As a horse lover, you can only appreciate this film. There are a few films that show that riding is this. I would like to know if Brian is in the film himself. I would also like to know if he likes horses. Brian was in many movies where he went. Where did he learn to ride? The only part that is hard for me is that the riding scene is always full of tilting, like when the horse can run forever with full steam. The camera works first and captures the horse in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on horseback. It would be very interesting to know how it came to all the very good horsemen on horseback.
