Stack should receive an academic award for this performance, period. It's a crime he did not do. Amazing how humanizes the rich worthless nature. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone has earned her academic merit for her performance. In fact, all the actors in this movie are excellent. Beginning is a taxi ride, then aboard aboard the plane, then it is still moving to an emotional ride that will take you all the time. You will have fun! <br /> <br /> It's just a spectacular soap opera. One-dimensional, 100% cute. Maybe you could call her the highest man, because acting so much will prevail over the material. Excellent acting, well controlled, but strictly in the soapy genre. I would not even say melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Without denying the great value of this film's entertainment, you can only imagine what this talented actor and director could achieve on more important themes.
