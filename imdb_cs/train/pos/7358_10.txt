One of the most provocative movies with excellent cinematography supported by Mc Clarens lisp and the stunning quote "Do you think love on the first page?". The trace of expressionism was evident in this figure, and the catapulting of the flawless integrity of the film. Gabby (AKA Joey), played by Eva Longoria, apparently loved the film and the role she played so much she could not even bother to mention her in her filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film would undoubtedly be the heroic rescue of the MC clure when it saved a young child with a speech disability. it was perfect! The use of sound effects by James Cahia is still unmatched today. The medical bust he shows in the film is painfully realistic. When I first watched this film, I was forced to do so with intense lack of respect for Gang Inthused brothers from Southside and CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This was by far one of the most encapsulated slits Cahill is committed to shooting. <br /> <br /> Personally, this movie has a sentimental value to me and I will download it in the near future. That's when I can find anywhere, LOL!
