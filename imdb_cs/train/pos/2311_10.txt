Reese Witherspooon's first film. He loved it. Story and acting were great. You are emotionally involved with characters. In my view you have to see. After watching this movie, you will see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful. <br /> <br /> Other members of the cast do a great job. <br /> <br /> The film is very well flowing. There is no boring moment throughout the picture. The man on the moon is right. <br /> <br /> As I said, I think this movie was great. I've seen it many times, and each of them was looking forward.
