This is an excellent movie, suitable for all but the youngest, although accessibility for young people was unclear (at least in the printed form I saw) by some unfortunate choice of English subtitles! For most of the film, it's almost impossible to guess what time period it's set - there's no modern technology, not even the ubiquitous Chinese wheel, just a clumsy, almost monochrome, everyday life, against which is the contrasting dazzling display of Sezuan opera and festive fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refers to their approaching war, it could still be over the past 150 years. But then we saw a motor car - late 1930s, early in the 1940s - and we realize that we are watching China on the verge of huge riots and that much of the world we see is about to disappear in the disaster of the Second World War and the Communist Revolution . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> small business for small children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I read too much about this movie; but I do not think so! I also think it is a scandal that films of this caliber are often not shown in the United Kingdom, while the remnants are reflected in quality material. But do not let me start. .
