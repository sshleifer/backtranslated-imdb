This movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained great backdrops and sets. 2) It turned out that besides the military environment is technological. 3) John Cusack's acting performance was amazing. He expressed himself very nervously. 4) It showed the vulnerability of everyone in the war. 5) She gave us an idea of ​​what might happen in many ways in the future. I was also impressed by the fact that acting is mostly involved. Hilary is acting, it was the most sensitive. The morale and values ​​of all people in the war torn situation are about to be. A liberal journalist and a conservative entrepreneur are able to do anything in every situation and are equally unpredictable. Great things. PSP
