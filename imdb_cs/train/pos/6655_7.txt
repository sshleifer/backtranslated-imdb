It's one of the better Indian movies I've seen recently, instead of dirty song and dancing or slum dogs. All actors showed the right emotions in the right intensity with the right timing. It is a characteristic feature of a good film that will make the audience come back and explore the subject, which is exactly what I tried at Harillo. I always enjoy the fine acting style of Akshay Khanny and interestingly, having a rather complicated relationship with my own father, Vinod Khanna, though not as dramatic as Gandhis, and wondering how the essay helped him. I was impressed in the direction and 2 inches up for Anila Kapoor to make such an elegant movie.
