As the biographical film "Lady with Red Hair" (a story about how the director / producer / dramatist David Belasco has transformed the famous divorced Ms Leslie Carter into the international scene), the Yankee Doodle Dandy is definitely not in the league with this Warner biopsy what is it?), but "Lady" is a nice film in itself - and shares many features in common with the classic Cagney. <br /> <br /> Just like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "Lady with Red Hair" jumps to the old show-business taste. (On the other hand, both films have delicious theaters, as well as inevitable scenes that are behind the scenes and theater management offices.) Also in the "Lady" as in Cohan biopic, and the beloved feature actors of this time, everyone is doing such a great job , to which we remember them. <br /> <br /> I need to add that again like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "Lady with red hair" will not let the truth get to the story of a good story? But, just like "Dandy", "Lady" can handle - wonderful! - Explain the essence of your personality greater than life. Everyone knows that Cagney is not dying all the time in her brilliant and loving portrayal of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" Cagne, but few audiences realize that Claude Rains has done a similar service to David Belasco in "Lady with Red Hair" - and he did with a coward almost equal to Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures this galvanic personality of the legendary showman in his worldwide glory. The rain gives an incredibly pleasant, greatly observed and remarkably realistic performance, like everyone whom Broadway once called the "Guide". Watch Claude Rains in action (looking at each shot as if he had a good time!) In "Lady with Red Hair" you can see David Belasco bending over the film as if he could not wait at the main tent again. <br /> <br />
