Published two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning film has all the rich technology and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, great wall-to-wall Gershwin music, excellent choreography, lighter-than-air scenario and Kelly's outstanding performances, Levant, Foch, Guennette and Caron. Hollywood is not doing it like that. It's definitely my favorite film of all time, which is the standard I judge all other movies. OFFER, ENJOY, ENJOY!
