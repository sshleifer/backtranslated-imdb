For the first time, I saw this film in the course of my games and playwrights in Tulane. I was amazed at how beautiful and crude this document was. It is a sincere view of the untried reality of loneliness. The family is fascinating, and I thought she really showed Little Edie on her core. ** As a side note, my professor even said that during the filming Little Edie became in love with one of the cameramen. ** Beauty, as I discovered, comes from the nature of family dysfunction. In the relationship between mother and daughter, it's obvious that they can not even work in the company, and you'll want Little Edie to rehabilitate society. Overall, the film captures aesthetic quality and presents a surprising beauty. Two inches up!
