I thought it was a wonderful movie. It touches every human thread. Love in the movie is very intense. I thought this was the best performance of Will. Great Directing. Editing allowed. The music was great. Good use of flashes. This is the kind of movie everyone should visit. I hope people will get something amazing from it. Overall excellent movie. I think Hollywood should make more movies. Even action movies can have a careful story. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. He had the purpose and determination that is rarely seen. I would suggest tracking it alone or with someone that really matters. For me, I discovered that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film. The outside world was suspended for a while. It was a nice feeling in this chaos that is happening in this world. And with this generation, it was great to see something (someone) who cared for other people more than himself.
