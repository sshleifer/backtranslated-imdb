Episode two of the first season is a wonderful vacation story of love, betrayal, ... and a murderous, crazy escape dressed as the Christmas Father. A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) has just murdered her dick on Christmas Eve for her life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins to struggle to survive as ugly, Santa Claus's suit on a psychopath (Larry Drake, perfectly over the top) threatens her life ... as well as her rare young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is cordially remembered by those familiar with the program. By the way, this particular reviewer looks everyday on a routine. The most remarkable thing is that there is a rising, exciting and narrative turnaround, and All through Houst is one of the best Tales From The Crypt stories.
