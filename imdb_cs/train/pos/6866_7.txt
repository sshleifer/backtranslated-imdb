************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason I've seen this movie and that's why I do not know much about humor. There was some part that was fun, like Barbie and Ken Spoof and merchants and presidential skittles. I think this is sometimes noisy (Dare, I say rough?) It was sometimes fun, but it could have been better. Probably, if they spend more time in humor and less time than strip women, the movie would be more fun. Some skits just make you want them to shake and shoot, other skitones make you laugh and weirdly think. Unfortunately this movie is dated. If you have crazy crush on Richard Belzer (So it's worth it), it's worth seeing it and seeing how chase is chasing.
