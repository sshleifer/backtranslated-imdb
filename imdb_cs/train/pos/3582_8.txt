Here's another 80s movie that most people just do not know. This slow, picturesque (loving footage from the Montana landscape is breathtaking and reminds me of Costner's recent "Open Range," which also starred Robert Duval), and the emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie, or sleep or an unprecedented Sunday afternoon. Those who are in the right mood will be treated with a gentle, intimate, intimate look at the grief of one family and how they will come together after the youngest son inadvertently shoots and kills his eldest son while hunting. Performance is all top-notch and quietly differentiated. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in the pictures as well as all supporting players and young actors. I really liked how director Kain (who unfortunately did not report any notes from that moment apart from the first "Young Weapons") gives us quiet small glimpses of every personal grief. We do not know just how a younger brother or a parent's death is, but also a confused middle-sister, uncle, crazy wife, and a teenager's girlfriend. What we are getting in principle is the answer of "ordinary people" in the countryside. There are also David Lynch's shades of "Straight Story" in some of the Stoic Mines of the Mid-Western Morality of People Described Here, as well as in the loving footage of the farmland they inhabit. It's one of the better and more realistic "slimmers" of the time and a nice little find for you, a quality movie hunter out there.
