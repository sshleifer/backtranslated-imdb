Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as a television hostess of horror films late in the night, and when her figure turned out to be unexpectedly popular, she suddenly found she was doing everything from beer advertising to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. It has reached the top of its popularity in the late 1980s and was the result of ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK. Elvira's horror television hostess dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England in the hope that the property will provide enough money to support theatrical performances; she is disappointed to find she has inherited the rest of the house, the poodle and the old book. It happens that the city is puritanic over all the descriptions and she provokes a righteous indignation wherever she goes. It also happens that her big uncle is secretly a bad warlock and a great intention to lay hands on the "old book". Throw a couple of teenagers, a muffin stud and a hateful woman with fake ones and go there. No one would report that it is a film masterpiece, and it stretches at times. But Cassandra Peterson from the beginning to the end shows an incredible atmosphere: exciting, sexy and mixing low humor with blazes of sharp comedy, dancing with film as circles of circular, creepy and often self-mocking jokes. From the FLASHDANCE disaster to the wizardry foolishness, it is never wild. It's a tremendous amount of entertainment, and the end of the movie can even create a lot of tension. Will Elvira win the best of his evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything, so let's say you have a lot of fun to find. DVD quality is fine and bonus materials are few, but if you're in the mood for something silly, you will certainly respond to the urge. And if you've never seen a silence-swirl, you're on favors. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
