Well, I have to say this is a really funny movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was quite cowering, and there were some special moments when the movie seemed to turn dark blue for no obvious reason, I was not disappointed. The story was really quite interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan has to trace the other five members and find out who uses their skills to evil and who uses them for the good. The catch was that during the training, the entire clan was masked, and everyone had since gone back to the company to disguise and changed their names. Fighting games are a joy to watch because every member of the poison clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. Combat scenes have players to jump all over the place, and fortunately the camera stays set and uses a sufficiently wide shot, so you can clearly see all the action. One drawback of the film is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half until the first battle. But stick with him and you will not be disappointed!
