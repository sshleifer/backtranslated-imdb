Martin Ritt's romantic work-class drama is unbelievable, they are coming, yet they are moments of pleasure mainly due to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both great). She is a widow who can not continue, is illiterate, and is the inventor of the wardrobe - you can guess the rest. The adaptation of Patrick Barker's novel "Union Street" (better title!) Is so abandoned that it moves indefinitely, and filming is a mess, but it is still pleasant; pink blue collar fantasy. There are no prejudices to serious problems (even illiteracy is just a tool for the love story) and no real fireworks, although the characteristics are deliberately a bit colorless and the leaders are tinted to an interesting degree. The finale is pure fluff - and cynically it will be hard to swallow - although these two characters deserve a happy end and the painting would not really be satisfying in any other way. *** z ****
