The manor castle is located in one of the jerry-built settlements on empty plots and parks, which at the time were called "Hoovervilles" named after our unfortunate 31st President, who was trapped in the Great Depression in his administration. The design of this film lies in the fact that the house of man is still his castle, even though it is just a cottage in Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a shack and the truth that this guy will not even work that good in good times. But in the part that was very typical for Tracy before he was occupied in San Francisco as a priest, the beginning of classical roles, he plays a hard pot of mug that he takes to Loretta Youn. <br /> <br /> One thing about Human Castle is that it shows the consequences of depression on both women and men. Women were more excited to wear them if men had difficulty finding a job, women twice as difficult. And they have been sexually harassed and some have resorted to prostitution just because of the square. Spence takes Loretta Young into the one who faces such problems and does not demand any demands on her castle. Pretty soon, even though they are in love, though Tracy is not such a way to settle down. The love of the scene had some other zing to them because Tracy and Young had a cruel affair when shooting men's Castle. Both were Catholic and married, and in those days it was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young were quite serious about Catholic faith. Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of paternal character for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who has gone through all the pitfalls Young can meet and try to clean it up and Arthur Hohl, a really nasty creeper who also has an eye on the Young. Hohl brings a plot of Human Castle to his climax through his intentions. <br /> <br /> A man's castle is a frantic look at the Great Depression, not the usual movie getaway for those who try to avoid this kind of reality in their entertainment.
