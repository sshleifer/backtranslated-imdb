Upper notch Columbo from start to finish. I especially like the interaction between Columbo and the killer Ruth Gordon. As an avid fan of Columbo, I can not remember another one in which the killer does not stop at the end. in other episodes. In this, when he tries to determine the correct sequence of boxes and the "message" that his nephew left, he finally answers. <br /> <br /> Music in this episode is also very good, just like in many others.
