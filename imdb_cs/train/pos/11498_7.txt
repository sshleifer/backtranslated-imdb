"Kolčak: Noční Stalker" is an extremely entertaining TV series, which is repeatedly attracted by a horrific, sarcastic, 40-year-old reporter into a deadly fight with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) forces. Based on the popular pair of television films with the Kolčak character, this series moderated in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but today maintains a strong cult. But the average viewer of today's day will be able to dig Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? <br /> <br /> This is a really hard question that answers fairly. Detractors of this series tend to claim to be formal and hopelessly dated. On the other hand, the fans say they are skilfully written, well-performing and sometimes really scary. And I? I have a leg in both camps. I have been looking at all 20 episodes in Kolkak on the DVD recently, although it seems to me that the series has a lot of mistakes. I ask myself the question that Kolchak is the "formula" fiction first. Now, I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas - for example, each episode of Columbo develops according to the same pattern, for example. Repetition is not in itself a bad thing; in fact, critics have long known that viewers often enjoy and actively seek repeated entertainment. The problem with Kolcak, however, is that his formula is simply rigid - it is too repetitive and even the most holy standard. In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates murder and discovers that it was committed by some form of monster. He tries to publish a story about the monster, but his Vincenzo editor blocks it, always on the grounds that Kolcak does not have enough evidence to support his claims that supernatural powers are working. And unfortunately, Kolchak is also blocked by the police. So, in the end, Kolchak carries out some independent research on the monster, finds out how to kill him ... and then kills him. Without ceremony or reward or writing a great story about it. Find out where this increasingly rigid formula may be annoying, are not you? Vincenzo is special - if Kolčak always suffers from monsters and Vincenzo never believes ... well, why does Vincenzo not threaten Kolchak or did he bind him? That's what every normal boss would do. The series, however, avoids this realism and prefers Vincenzo and Kolcak to retain comedic antagonists. The result is that many of their scenes together are deeply unbelievable - although they are quite fun too. The best episodes of Kolkaku have overcome the limitations of this formula, but usually because they contain some unexpected surgery. These selected episodes are so good that I think they are largely immune to the typical critics of the series. My favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror at Heights - an episode that is remarkable from being dirty, inventive and socially conscious. Kolchak's dialogue has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. Although close to the Kolčak formulation, the script (written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster) is remarkably literate and plunges deep into monsters. "Omen" films, this episode excels me because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - lures Kolcak with a good treaty of Satan (which reveals a lot about the reporter's stories). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Herring and really scary, almost unstoppable - a seeming monster. that I chose these three episodes for praise, I would say most stories are fun at least. For my money, there are only two complete turkeys in 20 episodes: Primal Scream, about drunken men who are uncontrollable in Chicago, and Sentry, which contains the latest make-up in the history of filming fun (and this rating comes from a lifetime fan Doctor Who and Godzilla! <br /> <br /> So in balance, it's a good series. A bit repetitive, perhaps a bit sweet, but it has elements of grandeur. Even during the weaker episodes, Darren McGavin's great performance as a corrosive, world-weary, infinitely funny Kolčák really shines. The series bears effortlessly, in such a way that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never did "Buffy". McGavin was one great acting actor and this series is worth watching for him.
