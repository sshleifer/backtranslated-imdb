When the US entered the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to launch propaganda films. LITTLE The American is probably the best of all, because star Mary Pickford. Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision is when Pickford sails, is sunk by the Germans (thinks Lusitania) because he carries ammunition, Pickford has a great scene on a lifeboat and screaming at the German commander. Later, of course, he encounters Holt and Hatton when he is kept as a prisoner of war in the castle. Director Cecil B. DeMille provides one really great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt passes through a village that has been bombed. It runs through a destroyed church, leaving only one wall. A very large cross is against the wall. As they stand and watch, the wall collapses, but the figure of Jesus remains hanging in the air. It's a very unreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very straightforward and unusual. <br /> <br /> Pickford is always happy to watch. She has always been a very natural actress who has avoided the historiology waving on her hands, many other actors of that day. It's also very nice. Holt is very good here as a leading man. Hatton is all right. Among the list of names of actors in "extraordinary" parts are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> A great movie but interesting to see American propaganda at work.
