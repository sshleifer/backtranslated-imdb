"Dressed to Kill" is definitely one of the best horror / thriller films ever to have happened. It's a tense, stylish and extremely exciting mixture of sex and violence. Playing quite well, Pino Donaggio's orchestral score is unforgettable and there's a lot of surprises ("Angie Dickinson"), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalyst (Michael Caine) and a high-cost girl (Nancy Allen). The killer in the film is the transgender Bobbi, who is also one of Caine's patients. The film is filled with breathtaking moments: the infamous murderous murder scene is extremely stylish and quite harsh.
