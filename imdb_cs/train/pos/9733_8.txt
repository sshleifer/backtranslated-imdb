"Lossing friends and alienating people" is fun if free, Toby Young's memory adaptation is the same name. It's also a great title to help fill out the line requirement in IMDb reports! The essence of the book is the same as a book with some accidents, but a romantic conspiracy is added and the end is definitely hollywooded. Simon Pegg, although he plays an essentially irritating person, is his usual sympathetic and entertaining self and largely carries the film. What's strange is that he was just a television series a few years ago, and now he wipes his shoulders with Hollywood names. There is a good support cast and it is fun and easy to watch - the kind of "Ugly Betty", but more fun.
