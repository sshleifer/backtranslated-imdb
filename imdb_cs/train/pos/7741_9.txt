The first of two adaptations by Jim Thompson, released in 1990 (the second one is more known by GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all the features of Thompson: dangerous women, a game of trust and characters that are not so weak, are, or are not so harmless . Jason Patric is outstanding as a former boxer disqualified from sports for life due to a ring incident (director James Foley uses the RAGING BULL-esquire sequence to mass out the back story) and too little Rachel Ward is also performing great performance. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the film: his sweet-talking fool Uncle Bud gently controls each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic relief in this movie, so watch it ready to suck in the emptiness.
