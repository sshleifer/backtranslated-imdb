Daniel Day Lewis in my left leg gives us one of the best performances ever an actor. He's great like Christy Brown, a polio man who learned to write and paint his left leg. He earned well Oscar and Brenda Fricker, who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is amazing because the younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great as a father. It is worth seeing for outstanding performance.
