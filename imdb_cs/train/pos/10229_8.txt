YETI deserves a rating of 8 stars because it is one of the biggest bad movies ever shot. I saw it at midnight projection in L.A. and people say and cheer on madness - this movie is one of those movie wrecks where you think you can not get a stranger and then it does! The millionaire who finances the Yeti defrosting project looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman as they poured into a poorly-matched suit - one that plays scientists is one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen - and yes, there's a mute kid (who looks a bit like a girl) and he is toll since he survived an air crash that killed both parents (perhaps - a therapy for a child). Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti (as she fades - which takes FOREVER) - and immediately falls in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti is making her "eyes in the bedroom" place - it's like a big Barry White trying to seduce a band. In fact, once Big Yeti picks up hottie and has it against her chest - she accidentally touches Yeti's nipple and yes, the movie has time to show his big gray nipple GET HARD !!!! Yikes of all YIKES! In addition, there is a collie dog because an Italian producer had to hear that an American audience like a dog and he was trying to get Lassie a little bit - , thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout, you are the best. " This movie is much more bizarre than something Ed Wood could ever dream of. If you are a fan of classic piano cats - look for this baby.
