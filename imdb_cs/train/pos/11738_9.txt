Unfortunately, for her, everything she gets is a haunted old house, a poodle and a magical cook. While in Fallwell, Elvira is trying to make money, breathe a bit of life into teenagers, earn a breeding heart (Daniel Greene), avoid baking on a basket, and store a cookbook from her crazy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who plans to use the book to end the world . <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman, and like Elvira, it's all he's morbid and cheerful naive, not to mention he has a wonderful couple of knocks. In this movie, her spells are useful. <br /> <br /> I loved the entire movie "Fish from the Water". You have Elvira, her black low cut dress, her big black hair and her huge "twins", and she's in a Christian city where most girls do not even wear. It also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more fun. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is just as great as Elvira's uncle and nemesis Vincent to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but he still does not care and steals scenes from Elvira. What really makes a movie is not a plot, but many jokes. Everything from joke fight to scary spoofing is here and makes me laugh much more than anything from the sequel to SCARY MOVIE. I've heard that there are about 56 jokes in this movie and all fans of Roger Corman B-horror films will love spoofing in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will love this movie.
