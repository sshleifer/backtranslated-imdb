Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a very successful film, but left a sour taste in his mouth. Rob Roy is a little less polished but a better film. It is a historical film that combines timeless motifs with true historical values, while Braveheart gives the rough and uncomfortable contemporary gloss of the ancient story. What makes this movie is cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in the role he imitated in his mind (in a bizarre form) in Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but he is neither the greatest fighter nor the most lovable lover. He is an admirable man, he orders the screen. Against him is selected a selection of the same human opponents, including the Cunningham of Tim Roth, unpleasant but brilliant, and John Hurt morally failing laird. Jessica Lange is also praised, as Rob's pragmatic woman: also strong and noble, but 300 years from a modern heroine that is just as it should be. This is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of your own beliefs and strong performances you prefer.
