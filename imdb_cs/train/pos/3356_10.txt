Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I together watched "C'eravamo tanto amati" on the summer night: we loved it but we did not like it because we loved a "special day." I believe that Ettore Scola is quite underestimated: we often forget him, perhaps because his last films were disappointing. And so, last night, my mom and I were sitting on the sofa so we could enjoy this masterpiece. Scenario, direction, cinematography, script, and production were sober and accurate, but what I liked most was chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. Both are excellent actors and play the leading role of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatical fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for huge families. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. They spend together a special day, the strange day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I do not want to come up with this: go look for this movie!
