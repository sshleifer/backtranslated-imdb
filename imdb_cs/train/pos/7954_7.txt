Great voices, lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this movie very good. The addition of "character" to the three main animals gives the story much more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older boy, Shadow and the young hell, Chance. Earlier versions of this film could not provide animals with a true personality or motif, which is perfectly done here. Sally Field is kissing in anything, but she really shines like a proud cat, Sassy. The great contrast between cat and dog looks at life and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies that make storyline and resolution outstanding. It is even an exciting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for the evening alone or with children. Hats fly to Disney.
