I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty-dollar noise violation after midnight - so, no need to say, I can easily get in touch with Polanski 'Ten Tenant.' <br /> <br /> But I also like the movie for other reasons. I'm not sure it's all working - the descent of the Polan character into paranoia and madness, which takes about half an hour, seems somewhat harsh and bizarre. Ebert, for one, was totally unconvinced and filmed with a cruel star rating. But I think individual scenes and moments work nicely, so even though I do not quite understand the whole movie - what about Egyptology? - I still have the overall positive impression. I like the enemy, for example, by Bernard Fresson. God, how many times I settled down that I do not have such stupid friends, no more than my friends at all! I like the cinema scene - it's the funniest "make" moment in the history of the movie, I would say. And boy, I like Isabelle Adjani - in this movie is a lime, it's almost incredible. And she gives great performance, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I disagree with occasional frustrating remarks about his performance here. His character is supposed to be low-paced and thoughtful, so his low-key performance suits. I found compassion for him - though he lost me a bit when he started dressing up without being clearly seen. Yes, the movie is obscure. And slowly. But it captures the alienating properties of dwelling in flats - something I've done too much - so I kicked it out. It's funny that everything you need is a common reference point and suddenly such a strange movie becomes deeply significant! It's definitely worth the pickup for a pocket swap on a DVD.
