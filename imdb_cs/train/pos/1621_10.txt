Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of animation art. The perfect skill and art that characterize this duo work is nowhere more evidence than in this cartoon scene. It is a pity that so many people see what is and was always intended to be, a delicious pastime, which in no way tried to despise black people. If anything, it is a tribute to the infectious humor and the musicality of the black race. This time I did not see this confectioner, because the "Anglican races" in England were considered too insulting to show off in a multi racial Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I'd like to re-examine this masterpiece. I think those who are normally looking for messages and intentions that were never intended in these cartoons, which are after all sixty years, should try to illuminate and remember that today the world is a very different place, but that does not mean that someone has the right to censure what is visible from the past.
