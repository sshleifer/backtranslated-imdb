Parker and Stone are thinking about their beautiful overflowing humor from their animated masterpiece on a feature-length live action movie with generally good results. Much of the movie is Trey and Matt runs amok with his new toy. The plot is simple: two average boys have invented new sports, a basketball with a driveway, and baseball scoring that becomes a national madness. On the way, they encounter many clichÃ©s of sports movies and send them along with any other popular culture that comes to their sights. It runs like a tense episode of South Park, with a usual machine-gun interview, toilet humor and homily from the heart. If this film is weak, it's a connection with the team that gave us "Aircraft" and "Naked Gun". This effect is clearly seen with the heavy use of the lame vision gag and the presence of a shiny, rather two-dimensional, Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given by Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn has a slightly better role in the company that has been his party since "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine are exaggerating as he can, but we have to admit that he is perfect for the role of the crazy team owner. /> <br /> For those who have not yet noticed, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable than rock stars than comics. This is reflected in the performance that is dedicated to the soundtrack in almost everything they create. As usual, they give a good choice here, including the mandatory footprint of their own ultra-non-PC DVDA. Special mention must be made of Dian Bachar, who deserves some appreciation for making it difficult to play Tang with Parker and Stone's furious Couple of Cartmans. Overall, this is a fun comedy that is held back by full potential by relying too heavily on the "Naked Gun / Airplane" formula. Parker and Stone could do something really brilliant (or totally terrible) if they got full control of the future movie. America either locks these boys or leads them.
