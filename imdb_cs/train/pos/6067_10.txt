Although I tend to agree with the other commentaries of the people who have seen this movie, I feel ashamed that I like it. Often such a huge mass of eighties is not outside the Wham! video, so it's definitely worth watching (GBP 0.79 per night at my local store!). Watch out for the crazy seams and zipper on the monster costume, the fact that the hero looks a lot like Keith Chegwin and such classic lines as: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "Finally we meet Kor ..." Kor: "Exciting, > <br /> <br /> Amazing! I also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with the pictures of a castle surrounded by furious sea and dangerous falcon - like a bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other things, such "interesting and engaging" suggestions of what is happening in real movie, nothing No, I'm not a jerk ... there really is not a furious sea or a wild bird, trying to catch you ... classic in my opinion. This movie gets 10 for pure value of fun !!
