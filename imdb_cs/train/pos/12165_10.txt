Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations when you end up in laughing laugh at exactly the wrong time; and just the moment you realize you should not laugh, you have already reached the peak of your voice. and when you look around at your haunted white faces with your open mouth and glazed eyes, you feel the sting of pain in your stomach and suddenly you go to your throat and ... well, you get a point. But for all his inconveniences and faults in the face, Frownland, it is really a remarkable work that, looking at the unsatisfactory mess of the main characters and all his pathetic troubles and misfortunes, would like to scratch your eyes out and he did not like it. <br /> <br /> It would be much easier for me to just leave Ronald Bronstein, but for some crazy reason, I felt unwavering resolve to stay on the pitch and experience all the grainy irritation the movie offers. If someone ignites you, you usually want to drop it: Stop! Decrease! A Roll! But with this movie you want to look, the flame slowly absorbs the whole body. You will suffer from pain - perhaps from distraction or some unknown masochistic curiosity that I can not even try to explain. Unfortunately, the mainstream cinema will never allow this movie to get into the theater near you. But if you have a chance to catch him, get ready: bring the dog sack.
