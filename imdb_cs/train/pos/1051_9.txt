This is a powerful document of domestic abuse in Cameroon. The "Sisters" are lawyers and judges who successfully prosecuted their husbands for abusive treatment of their wives in 2004 and won one divorce woman she desperately wanted through the Muslim council. It is relatively long - about two hours - but fascinating for both plaintiffs and defendants, as well as for lawyers who have successfully represented them in court rooms chaired by female judges. It leaves you behind because it left me with a lot of questions about exactly how this change happened. How and when did women come to occupy the position of the authorities in Cameroon? Was some of the cases that appeared in this movie significantly affected the treatment of women in general with their spouses? Was the award of a divorce by a Muslim court against the express wish of the husband a one-time event? I do not suggest that filmmakers could answer these questions. They made the film two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they did worthy of a wide audience.
