Otto Preminger's opener works almost like a flip-side LAURA ... while the film was shiny and features a high gloss of Clifton Webb, this film is a lot of seamer. Dana Andrews is less than a good cop who accidentally kills a man just to pink him to the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving with a quick clip, so logical outages are easily overlooked. Andrews is pretty good (much less wooden than it used to be in the past) and the beautiful Gene Tierney is amazingly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays an unfortunate victim. Where to be seen next to each other, and a great companion at Preminger's equally ominous WHIRLPOOL (also plays Tierney).
