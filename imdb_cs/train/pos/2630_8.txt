"The Lion King" is undoubtedly my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought I should give the next chance and me. Lion King 1 1/2 was quite good and had good laughter and fun with Timon and Pumbou. Just a problem, I feel that sometimes there are no explanations, because they can create holes of plot and just the feeling that you want your own explanation. Well, I would recommend this movie to the Lion King's fans or just a night with your family. It's a funny movie with the same laughs and love figures first. So, hopefully, I'll get the same with the third installment of the Lion King series. Sit down and just think of Hakuna Matata! That means no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
