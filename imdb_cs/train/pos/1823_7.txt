I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were four years old, but strange is that I never saw it. The next day I was babysitting and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go To Heaven so we both rented the movies and we've seen them today, and he really loved these movies. So many memories came back to watch this movie again, and I have to admit I was screaming a little. I am 22 years old and the end is still coming to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most animated films I've ever seen, and I'm really shocked by this 5.8 rating, I thought this movie would bring good memories to others. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is so charming and fun. Charlie is a gambling dog that another player, Carface, kills. But when Charlie wants to take revenge, he returns to the ground with clocks that can not stop ticking, or it's the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and spying on him, find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan who talks to the animals and finds out who will win the races. Charlie takes Ann-Marie's girl and makes false promises to get the money. But he finally learns that he should give Ann-Marie ahead of him when Carface returns to him with revenge. All the dogs go to heaven is a perfect family movie, it's not Disney, but it's a great family movie that you can watch. Not to mention it's so cute and touching. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid believed me that dogs have souls. How could they not? They are so nice and I think I'll cry again. But I would recommend this movie for everyone, it's a fun movie that will watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
