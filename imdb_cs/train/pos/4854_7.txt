Shake this in a dark and stormy night, and be prepared to be amused, irritated, and terrified. The dead old conspiracy about the phantom train, which is said to be going through the lone English landscape at night, may be unlikely, but it's a lot of fun. There are some amazing old clich√©s like "ACCIDENTS" that local people can remember, but they will not talk. But most of all, the film is a comedy vehicle for Arthur Askey to show off his distinctive brand of the Vaudeville-style humor among the spooky bits. Askey's furious humor these days is not very trendy, but if you let him wash it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askey movies.
