This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told by the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban town during the Castro Revolution. It is, of course, a real good work of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are just attempts to mismarket as an action movie. THE JULY TEXT IS MORE MORE. It has more in common with European cinematography than with RAMBO, and the revolution is just an inconvenience to everyday life and people's interests. This fact in itself makes the film more sincere than most of the works that are currently being dealt with in Cuban history. Excessive use of the voice narrator undermines the story, but the film does not require clips from Hollywood movies that say much more visually than the narrator could. Compare with CINEMA PARADISO and are just games like movie wax melancholy about movies, but there is a basic pain in losing a lifestyle that overcomes the lost love. The Revolution, like the movie Julie, never seems to end.
