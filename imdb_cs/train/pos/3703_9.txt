Okay, so it's an adult movie. But it is really very tastefully done. It is obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money to create a classic kind of film. I was pleasantly surprised how well it was. Even acting was pretty decent. The plot was much stronger than most of the adult movies I've seen. Working with the camera was above average. It's just a good movie!
