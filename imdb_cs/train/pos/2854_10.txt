Much has been said about this film and I would like to join those who praised him. It is a highly unique film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without doing it. In places where you just laugh out loud, in other places where you feel the characters whose mistakes and failures you are watching. Sabu's genius can be shown with respect to some film sequences. One is that all three men who chase each other have a dream of an erotic day about a young woman just passing through the street. This sequence is beautifully rendered and very well illustrates the characters of all three runners. It's erotic and fun at the same time. Another example of the Sabu genius is part of the film where the runners are tired. The first one, typically loser among the three boys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for somebody else is back and you see that they are dancing together and that they will shoot the next one as they dance with themselves, which is deeply moving. All runners will get to that point where they think they have something back that they have lost or are on their way again. And in one part of the movie they stop hunting, running in a row, just laughing. So it's all the beauty and absurdity of what we call the life that Sabu can show all over the movie. His characters fail (do they at the end?) But it does not free them from their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" that match Sabu's claim to be brilliant. Watch them! <br /> <br />
