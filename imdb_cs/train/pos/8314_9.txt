The film was in fact a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a famous girl group. In her efforts, the oldest nurse meets a drug dealer and a caretaker on the street called Satin, with whom her sister goes, because she thinks it is "a great time" that gives her everything she ever thought she wanted from life. Though he might be accused of killing her, she actually kills only her spirit and the will to live, becoming a drug addict, eventually dying from overdose. The story is not about street life or an Italian gangster trying to buy Stix, then threatening it, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life, as they are portrayed in song and style and character, times for young women, which they were trying to "discover" at the time.
