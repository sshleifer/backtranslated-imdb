Yes, a rooster horror thriller ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Good Goody. This is a fun and camping fun and part of the 1960s guignol cycle that penetrated into the 1970s. Released as a double-shot with comedy Burt Reynolds FUZZ, this crazy fear is so spectacular that it's very fun. Just like the CHANCE OF WESTERN, OTHER, and BABY JANE, I suggest that every prospective viewer remembers that it's almost a thought of being inclined to sit with someone you can with a shriek and an elbow. You really get drunk when you look at ... cheap champagne. Again, with many 30s movies ideas are also about deception; the fight for time for a better life that worsens and distorts the emotional madness involved in the murder. But this is just crazy. It also reminds me of a bunch of BLOODY MAMA De Niro - Winters shlock fest, which makes this movie look positively famous.
