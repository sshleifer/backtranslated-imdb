I've seen a lot of PPV in the past, but it's the most fun, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. DVD accessories are worth it because they give a different view of how wrestlers play after the show (for example, interview with chris benoit / interview on the edge), some look at the Monday Night War, the first match of Hogan, who won the name of the gold brand and some promotional talks . Besides, it's a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table Match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 It was quite a good intense match to start. Not too much holding and just pure rawness physicality. Spike can hold in table games and Guerro and Benoit put a good clean match on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble w / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 Dave really did not care about a single wrestler and did not intervene until Kidman made the shooting of the star. Normally people expect a lot of high flying in the mass-cruiser championship, but that has little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, nobody cared about it or even did not know (you can say that the lack of camera blinks). But the end was fast. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE Championship: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I never liked the rack as a wrestler, it lacks intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but he did not really have the chance to show off his tall flying act, though he still played some good counters and added that he needed a quick pace of struggle. That ended quickly, which was great for this match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny to look back at the PPV, how he once played, how he dressed and how he was watching (he was watching his interview, it's pretty wittily). It was a good intense price match that showed a good variety of seizures, booms, counters and some antennas. Jericho was a subgroup, but it certainly helped Price start his career. The prize will win. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD v Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good match. Both styles of wrestlers really matched on the screen and Brock cleans the power and raw energy. RVD skill full of movements and speeds. RVD looked great in this match (better than his later fights and prizes) and the game was fast. The end worked perfectly because it still kept Brock's intact bar, while RVD only gave his desserts in his home country. <br /> <br /> 6. No Disqualification Compliance: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacks some intensity as an RVD, but is still a good follow-up. Though it started a bit slow (which is always a big show) Booker T was impressive and made a bad move on the announcement table. The finisher was awesome, the end was a big break and a big break for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance Storm 5/10 It was an average match. Hogan looks like usual on a huge pop, but his variety of movements lacks such intensity and energy. The Christian again does not have the greatest athletic skills. It eventually ended up as the average match at best, but it was OK for the PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for unchallenged championships: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easy to match the year. This is by far the best match with triple threats I've ever seen. She had tight falls, lots of finishers, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who would come out of this. If you are going to buy this DVD, I'll buy it for this match. (end, watch for yourself!) <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a solid PPV with many other bonuses that keep track of you again and again. Though it's hard to find (I had to pay more than usual for this DVD), it's definitely worth your money.
