... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that I was BLOWN AWAY with this short film. I saw it randomly when I was in Boston at the film festival and since then I thanked God every day. Indeed, I really believe I'm part of a story like reading a Tarantino script before someone else did it or saw the first projection of Mean Streets. I'm not sure what festival will be short to go to another or what the creative team has for future products, but I hope I can be there for that. <br /> <br /> Really incredible piece of film.
