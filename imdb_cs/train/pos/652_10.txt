this movie is so complicated that some description may be given to it, yet it fits with it. you have an insecure, uncertain and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud), who is imprisoned between two (not, three) women. we obey his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncratic in endless monologues, we see that he is working on his magic about the three women he loves. this could be a prerequisite for a hen movie, full of cool, cool, uninteresting comments. but director Jean Eustache managed to keep her fresh, ironic and humorous. because it's such a long movie, one can not laugh when, after two hours of polite conversation, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly screamed on the phone as he remembered the charming line from the film. this kind of situation is purely cinematographic and can not be fully restored in a commentary. nor can anyone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue François Lebrun at the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and every minute.
