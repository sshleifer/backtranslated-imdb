Elegant Carol, beautiful husband Eddie (sympathetic David Houseman), Carol's furious, constantly ate the best Anna Anna (lovingly carved by the infectious comic fervent adorable Chris Jordan), and Anna, the love husband Pete (typically gentle Eric Edwards) is a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy frequent group sex with each other. Their usual routine is disrupted when Carol's lone, suppressed, yet urgent widow, mother Jennifer (a wonderful moving performance of beautiful Jennifer Welles) drops to visit. Soon, Jennifer relaxes and becomes a willing participant in the swinging and unrestricted sex-lifestyle swingers, with the exception of Carolka, who wants to conceal her. Writer / director Joe Sarno creates a sharp, respectful and receptive exploration of suburban anxiety and the limitation of the entire sexual revolution of the 1970s. Sarno transforms the traditional middle-class morals into their heads and other spice things with a daring and provocative mother / daughter incest subplot. In addition, Sarno invokes evenly bang-up casts: Welles and Brooke are both exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as the scaly New Age sex therapist Shandara and Erica Eaton as the Neighbor Neighbor of the Field. Better is that all women are very hot and tempting; Welles is particularly serious about the screen with her beautifully sensual figure and smoldering erotic presence. Sexual scenes are really annoying and fairly clear, but never unusual or boring. Bright, polished cinematography by Stephen Colwell and the jumbo, melodic acoustic score of Jack Justis are both solid and effective. Recommended viewing for fans of Sarno.
