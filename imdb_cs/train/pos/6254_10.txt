I just saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The work name was "Dog Days". Audience response was mixed. Some people considered graphic sex and realistic violence to be too much for them. The others seemed to appreciate how good this movie was. This film is not for the weak heart. It's like "luck" with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There are poisoning animals, smelling from the officer, orgy'esque 'swimming at the mall, penetration of the anal candle, and harassing mentally incompetent. If it sounds too long to deal with the fact that this movie is not for you. This film shows mankind in his most desperate and miserable. The banality of our existence is pulled in our face with the greatest joy. Seidl is not interested in redemption of humanity here. And why should he? This film represents excellent performances from all involved, is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be included in the film.
