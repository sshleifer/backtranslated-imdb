Living in (some) rails. Of course, they have been awarded art licenses, but some of what you've seen in this movie are continuing in some schools. I went to college in southern California, where races are almost alone. It's funny because they are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc. And I can honestly say it's there. But the point is when a class is dropped or when they are just waiting for a class, they (the students) seem to hang just around with people of their own race or ethnic origin. It is bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But as a school document to one of the schools I attended, he once wrote, "We should all try to get together with students of other ethnic groups and try to know them." Otherwise, you create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Rasism certainly existed in one of the schools I attended. Once someone put leaflets around the campus talking about the glory of the Aryan race and had symbols of some racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened as an incident in a movie where a young Caucasian man left and started shooting at a multicultural gathering. I can only hope and pray that nothing like this ever happened. <Br /> <br /> So "Higher Learning" is too dramatic? Exaggerative? Maybe. Is it "out of the brand?" It depends on where you went or to school. The cause of races, where ethnic groups just hang with their own DOES has happened. Minus the Hollywood Exaggeration, the racing thing got close to me.
