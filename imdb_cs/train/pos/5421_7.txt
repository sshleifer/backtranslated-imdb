"Now in the sunny climate of India, where I spent my time as a soldier in the service of the Queen of the Majesty ..." so is the famous poem by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis on which the film "Gunga Din" is based. If you are lucky enough to look at this legendary classic movie, you will enjoy movies in the way they use them for ultimate pleasure. Based on a script writer and poet, this is the story of a humble Indian native called Gung Din (Sam Jaffe), who during the British occupation of India was in the 18th century a "regimental beast". His greatest desire is to become a soldier. The Water Boy is part of a British Californian contingent at risk of death by the well-known Kali blood cult called "Thuggee." There are three specific soldiers in this company who are known for their bravery and roommate. First, he is handsome and dear, Cary Grant plays Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Another is Victor McLaglen as a courageous Sgt. MacChesney and finally is the spectacular Douglas Fairbanks Jr. like Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three, together with soldiers, are surrounded by a bunch of mountain rangers led by their fanatical leader called the "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the midst of the Chaos War is a brave boy who hopes to win a seat in the army by playing the chest he has found. A tough story for an old black and white film that needs a little fanfare for anyone who wants to have a classic. ****
