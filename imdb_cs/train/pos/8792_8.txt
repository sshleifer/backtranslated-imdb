Fun kung fu movie with actors, plotters and battle scenes by rendering over the average chop socky. All casts are perceived characters and skilled warriors. The guys of the ancient comedy of Alexandra Fu-Sheng are fun to watch and his austere companion has extraordinarily impressive abilities. For me, the film is just an ugly defect in the cast size - sometimes things are a bit confused like cuts and changes between different subplots, and some of the characters are not as full as they could. But the kung fu film should be judged primarily by the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple certainly delivers this number. The film culminates in a high bodycount battle that allows each character to show off their skills against a good opponent. Overall, Shaolin Temple is a pleasant low budget kung fu movie. It's not about the quality of a good Jet Li movie, but it's definitely worth searching for fans of the genre. My remarks: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Various Notes: In 1987 the Warner Home Video Edition I saw was (predictably) badly dubbed, and lacked full cast and crew credits.
