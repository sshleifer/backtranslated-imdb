Yes, it's flawed - especially if you're into Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, a purely funny or fantasy story or plot, and you do not really have to think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg's movies are for intelligent filmmakers and insignificance is a perfect example. Characterization is great, the story is great, but like all Nic Roega films - you're thinking about all aspects of a thing that never would have started before. His films always make you think and I personally like it in the movie. So do not expect you to leave this movie and feel happy everybody because you are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's great.
