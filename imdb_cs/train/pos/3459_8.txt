Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was the iconic villain of Columbo. The first "correct" episode of Columbo, which follows two separate pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from the classical state. Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half the murder secret of writing a partnership. His partner Jim is talented, while Ken has no talent other than gift gab and the ability to promote books. Once Jim decides that Ken no longer requires marketing skills, Ken will make a plot to kill Jim. Apart from the fact that this is not a new plot, it is actually realization in the history of murder originally intended for one of their books. He does not require Columbo for a long time to feel that Ken is a murderer, though unfortunately there has to be another murder (Ken romance and then kills key testimony) before Columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction. Nothing wrong with "Murder by the Book", but it's not quite top-notch. I would simply publish "Publish or Destroy": both episodes include Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but "Publish Or Perish" is a fraction more tense and unpredictable. But it is still a great episode.
