I've seen this movie back and still on the favorite of your favorite movies. It's surprisingly put together, and what really makes the movie are detailed tid bits (for example, the Cafe Bustelo coffee tape that is used again as a hair cup) that people do not see because you will not understand this music IF YOU ARE HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that are very culturally specific and strange. Do not put this movie unless you have any previous knowledge of what's on it. I can see perfectly what the writer / director went and perfectly hit the target! This film deserves better ratings.
