Eric Valette is probably a talented filmmaker and so are two guys who wrote a script. That's why Mal√©fique is a great movie that's done with just a little money but also a lot of imagination. Well, I'm a bit exaggerated, but still I'm honest. So if you like dark, horror movies, go and see this. It's really worth it.
