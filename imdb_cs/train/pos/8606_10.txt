There seems to be no medium value on this movie! Most of them take place in a dream and like most dreams is often stupid and illogical. It's also a wonderful production with some great songs and great performances, especially by our angel. <br /> <br /> Jeanette is dead, unconscious insults and various other faux passports at the reception of dreams are merry and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and pleasure. At one point she sings Carmen with a snippet, followed by the last trio of Faust (for some special reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's an incredible comedy - extremely fun if you get into the groove.
