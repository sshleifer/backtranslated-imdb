I did not expect much in the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is excellent in a very different role. He drove a slim armani suit for a ridiculous appearance and pays to show he's a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear will win and they will decide for one of the better pair of friends for a long time. Humor is dark, performances from Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are great, mixing with the element of the story about friendship and having a great movie. This is probably one of the best comedic comedies for a long time. It is a film that definitely proves that we can expect great things in the postgraduate era of Brosnan's career.
