Chase created a real phenomenon with Soprano. Endless performances, rock-solid songs and some great music make up what has become most likely the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All the cast are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini earn every centimeter of Emmy. Anyone who doubts it needs just a few episodes; especially from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely furious, totally terrifying, and you still think you love him - he's charmed. Many people I talked about Sopranos (who have not seen them yet) say "I'm just not a fan of Mafia movies / shows". It does not matter. Run - do not go - and get it. Those same people usually love "E.R." but I bet that they do not care about hospitals ... It's not about the context.
