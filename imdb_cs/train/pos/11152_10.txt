Watching Midnight Cowboy is like getting masterclass in acting / direction / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to look at it when he was originally released and saw it for the first time a few years ago, but that was absolutely a test of time and since then I have been watching several times. Everything about this movie is great, from eager performances by Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie, I will still have fun every time Voight flashes one of his innocent painful looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sick and sinister manner) to the stunning cinematography and well-tuned dream sequences. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that most of our current filmmakers are not willing to take the chance to have movies that are both visually and audially interesting like this movie. Medium cowboys should be required at all film schools. <br /> <br />
