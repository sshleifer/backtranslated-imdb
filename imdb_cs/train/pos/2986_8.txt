I am amazed to see that even the only actor who criticizes this old film. Usually we do not have good opera movies, and here is a really spectacular opera performance. Of course, visuals are not great. It's dated. But as an opera it can not be accused; and I'm an opera fan. I can not even detect one sync of my lips; if we did not know it was Tebaldi in the sound, nothing would convince me it was not Sophia Loren. It does everything with taste! Her dark makeup is fine; and she brought a wonderful life role! The rest of the cast is wonderful as well as the stunning ballet band. Most actors are excellent; Loren really amazing. Her Amneris competition is also amazing. Whoever did not care about this work in 1953 is disgustingly repulsive. Verdi would have enjoyed it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
