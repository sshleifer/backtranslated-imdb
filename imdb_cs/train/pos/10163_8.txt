It had a good story ... it had a nice pace and all the characters were being developed. I've seen a lot of movies in the last two weeks and it has to be the best I've seen in two weeks. <br /> <br /> The character of Jason Bigg was the best. <br /> <br /> Although it was small, it was skillfully created from the beginning. /> <br /> It can be a romantic comedy, and most of them do not like it, but writing, heading, performance, sound, design in the whole volume was really great. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite high of all the movies I've seen recently - and the rest was big budget or better promoted. Good work in written form.
