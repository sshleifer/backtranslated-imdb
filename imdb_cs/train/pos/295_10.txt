Bogdonovich (mostly) unheralded classic is a film unlike any other. A movie that has a fairy-tale feeling, but has a solid base in fact because of its use of authentic locations in Manhattan and "true" geography, perhaps the best placement of a movie I've ever seen in NYC. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovitch, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) can be great and the whole set is the band you really want to exist to spend time with them. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years, which does not seem to tear apart anything, is the highest point of Bogdanovic's fertile after a successful career, when his best work really became ("Saint Jack", "Last ..." sounds off ".
