This movie has some things that are quite amazing. First of all, it is based on a true story. This is in itself wonderful that at night in the autumn of Nebraska will hit several tornadoes at night. I wonder if the name of a real city was close to "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the movie). There is Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a town that begins Blains-something. It shows the lowest moving tornado recorded in sight, where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene in which the television is fuzzy is actually coming out. Before Doppler radar and meteorological radio, we learned that if you turned the TV on a particular channel (not on the cable) and set the brightness correctly, you could find out if a tornado had arrived. The problem was that you could hear them. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about the midwest tornadoes, it made me funny. I like more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - it's not the way you could do it, and F5 you joined the pipe in the house.
