I began to lose my belief in films of recent floods with a genre Hollywood genre. Stories fail and camera work is only copied from the latest movie of similar taste. But then I saw Zentrop (Europe) and my faith was restored. Not only is the metaphorical story charming, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you every step of the way and penetrates you to Europe in 1945. We all saw death on the screen in hundreds of ways, but the beauty of this movie is how every slow moving moment leads you, leading you to death. Unlike many movies, a knife is not displayed after one second, but it forces you to watch the devastating yet sensual beauty of the last men's moments. I think we can all go away from what this movie is trying to say, but it is definitely worthwhile to find time to find out what it really means. I would like to talk more deeply about the film for anyone who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
