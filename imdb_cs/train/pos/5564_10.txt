The best movie Cheech & Chong so far! Of all Cheechs and Chongs, it's certainly the best of all. I think I've seen them twelve times in total and I love them all. But that's definitely the best. Compared to the others, this affects many topics and gives you lots of good laughs. Part of the texts are now part of today's language after 25 years. I hope one day they can do more because they are still great comics. I heard he was writing a new script, so who knows ... I think these guys are the only ones who made good movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever watched one of them ...
