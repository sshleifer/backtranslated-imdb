My, Kasi Lemmings is definitely a decent woman. This movie is a lost gem, a dead satir "moccumentary" from the early nineties Hip Hop scene when MC Hammer just started to disappear into that good night. We are watching three members of the NWH as they embark on their picnic journey, wishing for wealth and glory. And like Nickolas Nickleby, at the end they finish their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and much less naive. This is one of the best movies nobody ever heard, but it's a movie that you love or hate, much like "Company Man" in this respect. I take this movie for the 1000 Islands above New York: it's a wonderful little secret that you want to have for yourself.
