Of course not, women are on average too sensitive and necessary, which is interestingly shown from mother to girl, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly or glamorously settled. Unlike many of you, I have seen LaMaman et La Putain twice. Like many good films, I noticed that my opinion improved on the second glance. All I know is what I've seen and I still have to dive into other exploits until I've got the DVD. I have yet to figure out exactly why I like this movie, but really I do not care why? Although I'm sure I can and make some amazing explanation. Okay, so maybe you do not agree, maybe it's boring sometimes, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of the beautiful Grusenka.
