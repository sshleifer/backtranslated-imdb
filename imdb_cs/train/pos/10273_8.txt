I am a great fan of movies where people get in touch, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of movies where people identify with the genre. In short, it's an extraordinary thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat by providing you with interesting multi-level characters and never really finding out what's going on and throwing lots of twists and surprises to completely upset what you've just seen . The film meets on many occasions with the audience and despite the fact that we know about it; it is still difficult to guess where it is going, and every change becomes a surprise. As I mentioned, I am a big fan of annoying movies, and the action of this personality follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a colleague. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help her patient, and en route to the art of reading people to pull up the horse. House of Games breathes a dirty atmosphere, and David Mamet is doing well when setting up a movie at the underground level of the city. The film is also effective with all those involved who bring life and credibility to their characters with the greatest skill. Joe Mantegna plays at the heart of the acting man's movie, and although his performance is a bit subordinate, he is always firm and believable as the villain of the work. Lindsay Crouse plays next to him as a psychiatrist who can seduce and reassure himself in his role. Perhaps he is not the greatest seeker, but at least he can act. The way the film carries out its plot is the main star of the show, but you will undoubtedly be surprised at how the film is constantly amazed and cheated by the viewer. Sometimes it's as if we were in a heavy hit and were condemned by the horses in the movie. Another thing that is great about this movie is a way to show the audience how to eliminate some drawbacks, which is useful if you are interested in twenty dollars, let's say. Overall, the House of Games is really exciting.
