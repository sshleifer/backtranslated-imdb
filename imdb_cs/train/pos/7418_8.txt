"Shower" is a story of loyalty, unmistakable progress in the modern world at the expense of a relatively traditional and human way of life. The man has to choose between his successful career in business, city life, his wife and his retarded young brother. Eternal doubts between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern China versus old. Public baths with their rallies, cricket battles versus shopping centers and a skyscraper. Lots of old men and women no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, motion, full of fun moments and hot sweet. Sensitive will cry and laugh the same way. Actors are enormous, especially those who play the role of a retarded boy; and Yang Zhang doing a good job, simple, simple, let the story just flow itself. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
