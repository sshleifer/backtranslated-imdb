"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows that he does not care about anything new, so he does what an intelligent person will do in his place: he forgets the logic and focuses on giving the audience a fun ride. He uses the familiar clich√©s associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. A nonlinear story is not just a trick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience (just like comedy to make people laugh), this movie succeeds in colors. I was looking at it in the theater with the audience and it was fun to see the audience over it. Probably not even in your living room.
