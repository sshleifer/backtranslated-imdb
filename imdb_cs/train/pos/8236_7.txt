Due to the "domestication collar" invention, mass zombies are under control and become productive members of society; however, they perform strenuous tasks. Businessmen visit those who live in the bordered small towns of the 1950s, while in the "Wild Zone" the unfortunate zombies roam. In the town of Willard, preschool K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with his parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (like Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, Robinsons are the only family on their street that does not own zombies; their new neighbors, Bottoms, have six. So, to keep it, Robinsons got the zombie Billy Connolly (like Fido). Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Collar" has been damaged by the old lady's walkway and she has her; then new and hungry zombies attack the city. Meanwhile, young Ray joined Connolly (the boy and his zombies are like "Timmy and Lassie" TV), and Robinson's family find it difficult to cooperate with Zomcom control authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" is not far enough in its own "wild zone"; but it is a colorful, stylish and entertaining satirical addition to the zombie film tradition. Ray and the actor play well, individually; with the bloody zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and the owner of Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) the most memorable pair. Director Andrew Currie and crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photo), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design), have earned the awards. <br /> <br /> ****** Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
