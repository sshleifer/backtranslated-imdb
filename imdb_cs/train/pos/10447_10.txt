There are many people in life who only meet once in our lives, but for some reason we remember those people for the rest of our lives. Once in friendship life, there are people with long distances, and there are always some natural reasons why we do not meet these people anymore. We do not always know their names because we never imagine and sometimes even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how ordinary humanity makes occasional friends and we want to keep it as such because unification could spoil love memories or we do not know it. We're afraid to check it out. The movie "Before Sunrise" caught me just when I watched him. I never meant to watch it, but because the discussion between the couple looked interesting, I looked at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect from him, not even a young couple. They had time to discuss each other until sunrise and anything else had disappeared before they had to separate. I believe that this movie had good reviews because the situation is something everyone has ever experienced on this planet at least once or twice. All of us are thinking about all the people we met only once in our lives.
