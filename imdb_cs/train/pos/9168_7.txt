it was a wonderful adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem I had with it was that I did not like Zelaha Clarke. I thought she was too old and caused Jane to be very shy. in the book Jane looked like a much stronger figure. I was really excited by telling her out. the part where the morning is after Rochester she asks to marry him and she runs to him and embraces him always laughing at me. I think they made the wrong choice. but Dalton was just as amazing as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. Another thing that made this version not entirely 100% was the quality of the movie. I know it was in the 1980s for television. if it was a feature film and a better quality, it would be perfect. my main complaint, however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
