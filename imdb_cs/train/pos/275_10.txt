This film starts with a family that all go in different directions, and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). Mother plays Mitzi Kapture (Jill Dunne) who suddenly enters her daughter and Zack, and then it seems that all the problems seem. Jill Dunne has a husband who often travels or lives away from home. There are also big problems that happen when a family chooses to go on a camping trip that their daughter Olivia does not like and just can not adapt to sleep outside and requires a tent to keep all the mistakes. In many ways, Olivia performs excellently as a teenager and Nick Mancuso, (Richard Grant) gives a great supportive role as the owner of the hotel. This movie will guess how it ends and you will look forward to a movie full of horror and horror. Enjoy
