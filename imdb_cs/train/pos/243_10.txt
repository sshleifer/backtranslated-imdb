Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is great, all technical (especially cinematography) are sharp and the screenplay is smart. Heath Ledger is amazing as Edward '' Ned '' Kelly. He is captured as a legendary alien and is also supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are in place <br /> <br /> The film is the edge of your seat to the end. One of my favorite films from late legend Heath Ledger, who was the top of every movie he played in. And he makes no mistake. Excellent movie all around.
