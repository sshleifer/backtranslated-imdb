Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give a solid performance in this beautiful but empty film. It is ironic that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really beautiful cinematography and sets, and yes, even Dietrich's infinite suitcase suitcase is also fabulous. Looks great; Boyer looks young and fancy. The story of a woman looking for meaning and a former life-seeking priest seems to be quite obsolete, but she has opposed such unbelievable sets and skies as it works, given the two stars, the amazing score by Max Steiner and good support for the cast. This movie takes about 76 minutes and seems to be badly edited, and some characters appear or disappear. Joseph Schildkraut is funny as an Arabian guide, C. Aubrey Smith is an old priest, Lucile Watson, Mother Superior, Tilly Losch Dancer, John Carradine Diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays .... Well, I'm not sure. It's coming from the desert and spoiling everything! As others have remarked, John Gilbert was scheduled to play with Dietrich. I can not help, but I think it would be wonderful. The role of Boris, who is kidnapping around the world, would be good for Gilbert. And after Queen Christina's success (with Garbo) his career may have come back. I can not think of any other film that Dietrich made in color. She looks great and wears some amazing clothes. My favorite is Valentino as Shiek-like outfit wearing at the pool. It is definitely worth seeing the fresh sets and colors and two great stars.
