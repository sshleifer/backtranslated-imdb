This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original film. I saw the series and it's a good movie, but here they put together "Live Legend, Part 1 and 2" and "Fire in Space". As with the first movie, but with other episodes. But still it's a pretty good movie. Only the end is strange (you do not see what happens to Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. Actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen it, look at it. Cast: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
