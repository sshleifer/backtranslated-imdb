Malefique has the viewer from the beginning to the end of his nervous atmosphere. Almost the entire film is placed in a prison cell that turns around four characters and whose transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are the most daring. Early prisoners will find the diary of a previous prisoner behind the bricks, which deals with his obsession with the occult and black magic of the themes leading to his escape from the cell. From here everything is about uncovering the secrets of the book and its spells to escape from prison. This leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light. I think the story is rather poor, and the last step is nice, but the ends are very loosely bound to me. Anyway, I was excited until the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique with minimal settings and occupancy. Kills are raw and frightening ... it does not exclude that you spit on your spine and occult themes are also doing very well and reminded me of hell in Hellraise. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with a greenish shade. Sometimes you wonder if the real or occult world is shown here by a stranger ... when a slowed-up boy loses his fingers and is relieved to sleep with Marcus's breasts, it seems normal, and how weird are the gates of freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer differently than most shocking genres. I just want the story to lead to a more consistent final. Several elements, such as a visitor with a camera, the other obsessed with obsessed books, and a doll of toys unclear toward the end, do not fit in the story. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for other movies by director Valette, though turning him off to see that he makes the Hollywood remake "One Missed Call" that was useless and useless in the Miike version.
