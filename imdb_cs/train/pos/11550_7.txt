If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will stay with a fantastic comedy. It seems to me to be a pretty good film, which is not a small result when I was considering the coma I got into the introductory scenes. To put it mildly, this movie has a terrible beginning that was neither distant nor even optimistic. Once things get stronger, you'll stay in a comedy that's still holding for over thirty decades. It's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who want to see their earlier work.
