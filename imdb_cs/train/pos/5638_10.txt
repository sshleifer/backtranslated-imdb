I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent model for teens and should be more appreciated. This movie is about watching your dreams and will never give up no matter what people could do or say to deter you and criticize you. Holly fills her dreams just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are times in every person's life when people think they are not what they are. While watching this movie, you'll want to understand that you are special in your own way and that you should watch your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow us. She never knows how much it means to me. Bravo Britney. You're the best!!!
