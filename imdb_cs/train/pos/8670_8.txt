WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA Kane vs. MVP in Inferno: So this is the fourth match that never happened in the WWE and it's Kane vs MVP (wonder why it was the first match on the card). I saw only the final parts where Kane sets the MVP butt on the fire when they're on the apron and then the MVP runs around the arena while screaming? possibly a refs burned a fire extinguisher while the MVP extends around the entry ramp. Funny and visually quite fun ending. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team: Originally William Regal and Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in a regular team match. However, GM Teddy Long comes to the ring and announces that it will be the Fatal 4-way tag team leaderboard. MNM and The Hardys are drawn and it's all chaos. One word that describes this opener? Wow. Man, I really can not remember how many sick points it was in this match and the words really can not fix it. There was one particularly remarkable place where Hardys built the ladder in the viewing position and Jeff jumped from the top rope while Matt held MNM for killing and then WHAM! Nitro fired away, while Mercury seemed relieved and bleeding like hell with a tear on his face. He had to be taken and Nitro continued the game himself. Another point was when Jeff powered London, while FLIPPING from the ladder. There were other, very flying, breathtaking spots that they remembered. London finally unblocks the belts to get this bastard. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman vs. The Miz: Two men are thrown into and around the ring until Boogeyman buys a displaced bomb for victory and then gets rid of worms over Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 for this three-minute incognito. <br /> <br /> The United States Championship: Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavo Guerrero in yet another typical Guerrero match. Some good points included a superplex from the upper rope of Chavo and an unusually long chain of German supernatants from Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes in a circle with Benoit nail belt, but Benoit scares her and decides whether to give her a sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to go roll-up, but Benoit hangs him again and Chavo is locked in a sharpening. Game Over. Nice battle battle, though slowly. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this, in a fairly slow-game. Did the match have some great high-flying spots? most notably, Helms' moves off the top rope? but the crowd was not found to be after seeing the ladder, and Yang needed to get into the air. Helms won the match after throwing Yang away with his face on his knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Undertaker vs Mr. Kennedy in Last Ride: After a series of matches between the two, this is the Last Ride, the second in his time and the second winner must accompany his opponent from the arena in the ice rink. Pretty good for what those two could offer. Kennedy managed a lot of Takera and even broke without a ring to throw out Taker from Armageddon, which was about 15 feet below; and thanks to God for Kennedy, otherwise it would be brutal. Kennedy almost won the victory until Taker came back in the sun (I liked the camera's view inside the funeral). Taker then missed the steel pipe to jump on Kennedy, and instead interrupted the window of the servant, but later Kennedy interrupted his chair and followed with the chokeslam and Tombstone on the rooftop. Kennedy was unconscious, and Taker drove him out of the arena to win. I really cared about the willingness of these boys to take / give real bad shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa comes to the ring, I'm going "what the hell?" just like many kids in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie competition" gets into my ear. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker: Talking About Charisma vs. technicalities. This game was, in fact, a fairly good major event, when the momentum moved rationally from one team to another and maintained good tension. Even Finlay got a good good shots on his opponents (this time I doubted his strength against the Champs) and he and Booker did not take place in an attempt to cheat? except for one place where Booker pressed a scepter into Cena's throat. Batista attacks Bomb at Booker, does not see F-U; The price was made by 5 Knuckle Shuffle and I think he also did the STFU. It was probably the best technical game at night and the participants really greatly improved what they could without a 7.5 / 10 ranking. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the WWE, we must agree that Armageddon was tied up by a number of observers, and the ladder event eventually swallowed the show; The last tour of the tournament resulted in a lot of nervous points and the main event was well suited for its category. All other matches also lived up to their billing, except Boogeyman versus The Miz, and unnecessary lingerie. Overall, Armageddon was a very nice pay-per-view, and despite some big obstacles in the chronology of PPV, Armageddon I wish this year's goodbye with respect. PPV rating: 8/10.
