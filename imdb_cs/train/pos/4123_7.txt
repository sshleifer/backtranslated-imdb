The freedom to have your own marine motor boats, excitement from underwater adventures, a sturdy man, adventurer and beautiful (and so well-equipped!) Bikinis assistants were all definite selling points for "SEA HUNT" (1958-61). <br /> <br /> But what was the reason for making a series of marine helicopters for rent *. Let's look carefully now. There must be some traces. <br /> <br /> If we look back a little, we see RKO Radio Pictures underwater! (1955). He plays Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive Scuba Diving adventurers working in the Caribbean Rescue, including Cuba in front of Fidel. The film was slightly successful and was memorable not necessarily for his story as to the appearance of directors in swimming suits. Gentle, shaped Women Folk in some really fabulous two-piece bath suits (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) They are always for boys plus; and the presence of robust, athletic men who have the best beef cakes is equally glad for Gals. And there is one element that is a true legacy of this old RKO feature. It's on the Soundtrack between musical queues and themes. It's the recording "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White," written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and starring Damaso Perez Prado and his orchestra. Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song (with Lyrics) will soon forget about it. His Carribbean Beat is so lively and his rich use in the Brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly provides instant impression and memory. A record of 45 RPM of this track has reached the Top 10 Most Popular Songs of the Week for many Saturday Evenings at "YOUR HAD PARADE". We can not remember how many weeks and how high it was. (Maybe somebody can add one item please!) So we went back to "SEA HUNT" and our own odyssey when we got to "Tube". The public accepted a cheater! but they should go on a TV series. ZIV TV Productions has earned the reputation of introducing a product type that has largely failed to connect to a multi-level network. But they had some great success with the TV syndicate. We can say that we offer a number of stations to perform on one TV station in every market area. (Like various newspaper syndicates, they sell "comic strips to various documents across the country and even the world." So we have Mike Nelson himself in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges "Mr. Bridges was about fifteen years old and so (in 1943), DOMA BRAVE (1949), and PISTOL (1943), and in a few songs of Boston Blackie (with Chester Morris), he turned to several very unforgettable performances of predominantly supportive and very diverse roles at THE STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943) At Eaton Falls (1951), Lloyd has brought a very convincing way of characterizing him, along with a gentle, convincingly athletic figure that has the appearance of a person who nourishes his physical abilities, as well as Diver's diver, whether performing duties on board a ship or moving under the sea took over the role quickly, but unlike many disinformations, there was no knowledge of SCUBA *** before the landing but Athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a fast learner, because so many undersea shots showed that there was no doubt that it was Lloyd with mask, bubble (air tank) and fin fin. Stories almost always involved the help of a client for salary, just like a private detective. So what if the client was a beautiful lady who looked good in her bathing suit, the better. Just like many other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV producers, "SEA HUNT" that appeared at the beginning of the theme and finally, along with original random songs and music. <br /> <br /> I once thought SEA HUNT was the pinnacle of syndicated TV series, success, like "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As for the venue of this underwater saga, here in Chicago it was shown late at night (after 10:30) at WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC Affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I remember who was the original sponsor on this particular market. And even on the scene that the star did! How well we can remember and imagine Lloyd as Mike Nelson, going to his Power Boat. And because we were invited to come back next week to watch "... the next adventure of SEA HUNT sponsored by LaCrosse, the brewery company G. Heileman, Wisconsin," the creators of the old Lager Beer! "Everything when Mike cooked us up and picked up the old bottle." (Damn you, Mike, drinking beer on your moving boat, let us tell the Coast Guard!) Then the ship leaves the quay, accompanied by the sea hunt and the Kredity roller. > <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figuratively than literal, Mike was for rent and things ran very much like Deterctive Story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** ZIV Syndicated achievements included "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT "(and its clone" MEN OF ANNAPOLIS ")," SEA HUNT "and" HIGHWAY PATROL ". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And of course SCUBA stands for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
