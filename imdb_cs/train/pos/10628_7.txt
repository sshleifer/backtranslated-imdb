through occasional tempered acting and "seen all before" story, it is quite a compelling film. He has tension, scenes with the demon are actually quite spooky, some of the visual effects are excellent and best of all, no senselessly misplaced humor to get lost from the movie, because there are too many horror movies now in them <br /> <br / > frankly, it's not the biggest movie, but it really draws you and at least tries to develop the character. I was glad to watch him
