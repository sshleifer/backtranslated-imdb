I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where he got a standing ovation! This film tells a story I had never been told before, about the rebellion of the German gentile women Rosenstrasse (street in Berlin) who married the Jews at the end of the Second World War. As such, it's a unique story, and that's the only Holocaust movie I've ever seen, showing that there are good Germans (the Anne Frank family was a Dutch family, for example) to the Nazis, and they actually had the opportunity to stand up against immorality and the brutality of their homeland during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their own lives. Actor acting is a great, intriguing and intriguing story in New York, an excellent direction from Von Trotty in every scene and production value including gorgeous cinematography. Of course the family in New York can speak German. Many immigrants in this country decide to speak in their native language with their family - a common occurrence. Such criticism is unfounded. To say more would spoil the experience. The film is long, but I never looked at my watch. I hope this film will have some distribution in North America, because this film is not only a masterpiece, but it can actually help to cure all the hostility people have towards the Germans to support Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I THOUGHT that you saw it! You'll be glad you did!
