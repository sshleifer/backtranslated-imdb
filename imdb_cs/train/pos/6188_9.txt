The murderous investigation continues behind the scenes, while Vanity, in his premiere night, plays the unconscious audience. A special combination of musical and murderous secrets is worth seeing for her cast, production numbers and the complete novelty of the film. Gertrude Michael has an actor role in the frightened actor's quest to stop marriage between show stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" number (which was also on the 70's album Bette Midler). So while the choir girls are mixing around behind the scenes, the break-up detective Victor McLaglen poison girls while trying to solve the murder of the unknown man behind the scenes. We'll quickly find out that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson that Jessie Ralph's ladies' cloakroom is Brisson's mother, and that Jack Oakie's stage manager fits in. There are lots of drawings between the musical numbers. The most famous song is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting story "Where Do They Come From?" And there's a strange Rhapsody that explodes into a Harlem special issue with Duke Ellington! Quite a cast. Some great actors, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is pretty good. Brisson is totally zero. Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays Doctor, and also see if you can meet Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the girls show.
