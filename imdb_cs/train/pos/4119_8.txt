Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first color film, is a dark surrealist view of the tragic lives of the people of Tokyo's slum, essentially a series of interconnected vignettes that portray several groups of people slipping out of a dangerous existence in the harsh and hostile post-war rock city. Swinging from comedy to tragedy and back, this film shows how people tackle the worst kind of life in their own way, mostly retreating and living in fantasy worlds of their own heads, emotionally pulling from people around or drowning in alcohol . Mixing kitchen sink realism with Kabuki-esque theatrics, Kurosawa toys professionally with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughing with the same shelter. Wonderful experience.
