I've been watching this movie many years ago and I've been looking for it since then, in my opinion, though very brutal, very educated about the future that I was looking forward to the film, and to this day it is very sorry for everyone disagree but the film should always be judged everywhere there, and in my opinion its great to let it go with all the cloning and test tubes of kids that are happening today that we are considering this film can be a dramatized event of what the state is but you go there. All the horrors of today are so well prepared and I laughed but it makes me think and scare me as a mother What if I were desperate to watch this movie I would remember But I love the film To make my own mind Do not look at the movie - Do you know the story and ask yourself how far would you go for a child?
