In this 1943 film Judy Garland is not considered a great time prepared by the man who loves her - Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supporting Oscar won a year ago in "Johnny Eager". Not only is Spring Byington too old to be a widowed mother of five, with four of them seeming to be her grandchildren? Singing and dancing are simply amazingly staged, but the way the blooming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted has left much to be desired. It was Gigi-like, where the young girl eventually avoided her charming legs.
