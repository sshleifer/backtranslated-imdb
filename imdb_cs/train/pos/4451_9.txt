The premise of the story is simple: The old man living alone in the woods is at random struggling with the murder of a small child and trying to convince the police that a murder has taken place. Although there is very little dialogue in the film, the visual story telling the eye of the camera made the film pretty nice. Adjusting the gray forest brings a feeling of loneliness that complements the calmness of the characters themselves. We can also feel helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of murder, which is analogous to the inability of a silent child to tell his own story. True horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. This film successfully deals with these elements only with visual imagery, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that use other bad horror films when the story is weak. <br /> <br /> Cleverly, the story develops slowly building tensions for several scary and surprising moments. The end is also unexpected and credible. Reminiscent of Japanese horror films such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or English horror films such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents", this film gives the audience an experience with a true atmosphere. I recommend to anyone who enjoys good bone cooling to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the movies I just mentioned above, you might want to try them too.
