I was just thirteen years old when I saw this series for the first time, and after thirty years of watching the DVD again on DVD. Photos of the introductory credits have never left me. This has influenced my view of the world and of the peoples in it. My parents have been with me for so long, they've seen a series with me, and we've always been discussing it. It gave me the love to study history and the highest marks I received in our public schools! <br /> <br /> The voice and delivery of Sir Laurence Olivier is timeless and perfect. I have the feeling that the people who have experienced it will feel that it is their version of the history of the Second World War. I can not imagine he is sometimes bored looking at it. Perhaps a similar Cold War might now be considered, although who could replace Sir Laurence, it is hard to imagine. Buy!
