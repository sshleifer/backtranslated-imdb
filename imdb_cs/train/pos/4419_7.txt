I saw this film and I heard that writer-director Juan Gerard will speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. All I knew was that it was the story of an eight-year-old film, an old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution of 1958, and how he influenced his home and family. His opening scene will bring to mind "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of references to classic films: Casual Wheel (Casablanca), "Chicken" (Rebel Without Cause), Bunuel's links, "Touch of Evil"; you will find others. The homeless (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore, which often uses a black man as a type of Greek choir. What this movie is like is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's wish to honor his family and the medium of the film he loved his whole life. This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people who are real to him, as well as the outlined events. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and a passionate film lover), but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live this dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed Gerard and agreed to produce and play in him. Keitel keeps the screen powerfully like a mysterious and mysterious grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. In truth, the first half of the movie suffers from rigid delivery lines and some breakthroughs, but stay with it. The last half is much better, as the events of the revolution combine for a warm-hearted and sincere summit. This is the first attempt by Juana Gerard, but it is sincere, as he is and his heart and desire really is, in this sincere first effort. I would definitely like to see it again, and I hope she will continue her film career. <br /> <br />
