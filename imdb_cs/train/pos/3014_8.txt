This fantastic whodunit is the early prototype of what has become a very popular film genre. I was happy to see that William Powell treated the detective story with charisma and spell, and without the stupid attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the series "Thin Man"). While the story is good in itself, I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz 'fantastically imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, it is a film with a rich structure, and Curtiz is an incredible credential of the media; from broken pictures to strange camera angles and imaginative memories, Curtiz demonstrates that he is one of the best Hollywood directors. We highly recommend that you are a fan of this type of movie.
