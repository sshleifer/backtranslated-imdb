I must say that it was not very exciting, but it talks about fashion and strange ways to solve the mystery. A little simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... that's fantastic! I really enjoyed that part of the movie ... Corky (Josh Flitter) is incredibly cheerful ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) looked really hopeless ... he was supposed to be more angry with her how he treated him ... <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is a tour and fashion in disguise. Anyway, I recommend this film just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teens of spy movies Emmy Roberts .. Spymate ... do you remember? In this filthy detective work, it gets good.
