In spite of other comments here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie; a film that reflects - for better or worse - the socio-political feelings of the country in the Glory of Reagan in the early 1980s. It's also a kickass action movie. Opening up with a liberal, female judge overturning a case of murder due to lack of tangible evidence and subsequent direct entry to the caf√© we encounter some unhappy haggis (a scene that will challenge you to the famous "Go ahead, do your day"), "Sudden Impact" is one continuous rollercoaster action movie. The first time you get into the breath is when the uncomfortable Inspector Callahan is sent to a nearby town to investigate the background of the murdered hood. From there, there is more to it, with Callahan going to deal with the sheriff with a mysterious past. Top-of-the-range shooting and time-consuming scripts will help make this movie one of the best 80s.
