The old Vaudeville team, Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns), were one of the most famous, but they said they hated each other. More than 20 years later, he agrees to gather for a television special ... but he finds STILL hating each other. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work. <br /> <br /> A big hit in his days and won George Burns Oscar for Best Actor. I (a bit) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon, so his non-stop single-liners. Some of them were fun, but the witty of Willy and Al's senility is NOT. I also never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor, and something around him shook me the wrong way. His character is also a spoon that makes him feel worse. Everything that was strange was fun. Burns is simply great to throw one-liners with ease and even Matthau was a good fit. Their word battles are the best sequences in the movie. Benjamin is also very good because Willy's nephew is trying to get the two of them together. It's worth seeing for Burns myself. This jump started his career a long way and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". So it's good. Just good - not great. Matthau's character really makes love more difficult. I give it 7.
