"Hot Millions" is a well-written and well-crafted story of embezzlement that steals (hot - too bad word for embezzlement, according to the lead character of Peter Ustinov) a "hot million" from a London branch by an American corporation by creating a shell company on the continent seemingly secure computer company to transfer funds to them. (Remember, the spoiler of the police is a comedy, not a secret.) Since 1968, this computer screening may seem naive to today's more computer-literate population; but as a person who worked with computers before the movie was released, I would say that even then it was like being written by a computer and illiterate, probably intentionally amplifying the girl's comic aspects of this British film. <br /> <br /> If you have a small taste for this type of entertainment, it may seem that the movie may be dragged into places. Fortunately, it has a carefully wrapped end; unfortunately, the final credits do not give any indication of the classical music used in them - a symphonic piece at the end and a duet of piano flute in the middle - only a song sung by Lulu, which I do not quite remember.
