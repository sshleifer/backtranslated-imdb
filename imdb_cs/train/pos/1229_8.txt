I've waited for ages before I saw it because all the reviews I read said it was terrible! I leased that I expect the worst, and while it's barely the best sand film out there, it's much worse! Sandler often talks with the camera, and the movie does not take seriously, but it's all part of fun! A great way to talk in the afternoon, and you could even laugh once! A good movie worth renting!
