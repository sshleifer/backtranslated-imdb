Intense actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward join together to make this modern noir a winner. Of the three I do not know who is the most interesting because they all offer good performances and interesting characters. Patric makes a narrative in this noir, plays a former boxer and a mental patient. Wow, that makes you an interesting guy! He looks stupid, but he is not. Ward is a blind, attractive, cynical, intelligent, and compassionate conspirator of a workable plan that is developing poorly. Bruce Dern is also in the mix, and Dern never fails to fascinate any movie. The film could be considered a kinder downer for the average viewer but I found it fascinating .... and I do not like depressed movies normally. What I found was a special crime movie. Look and see if you agree. This is a quite unknown movie that should not have this status because it's just a good story and well done.
