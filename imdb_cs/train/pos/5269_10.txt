I love bad movies. Not only because they are often as fun as "really" good movies (such as Pirates of the Caribbean and other Hollywood patos), but they are often much better than those movies. And that's why I love the Italian tear of cinema of the 1970s and 1980s. That's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & Company. Director Ruggero Deodato made some really good movies, such as House on the Edge of the Park, and his Atlantis Interceptors and live as a policeman, to die as a man are fun action movies. But it is really bad. Barbarians are such an idiotic movie. Peter and David Paul as barbarian brothers Kutchek and Gore are very entertaining due to the lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they scream and scream every time they do something important. In one scene, people try to hang barbarian brothers and escape in a very special way. Bad action, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, in fact everything in this movie is bad. I can not describe how much I laughed when I first watched it. Barbarians & Company is a classic camp, everyone should see once. If you thought Plan 9 From Outer Space was a fun camp, it would be a real killer.
