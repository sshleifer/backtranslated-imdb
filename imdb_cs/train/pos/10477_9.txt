Walking through the rope between comedy and drama is one of the harshest events in the cinema. How do you get laughs from other people's misfortunes and do not start feeling sick when it goes too long? Well, this surprising little jewel of the film will bring great laughter, beautiful scenery, and a pretty good buzz as well. I especially like the concept that alcohol is legal because white Europeans like it and marijuana illegal because "other races" use it ... undoubtedly true and raises the racial side of the marijuana laws that so openly populate populations around the world. Extraordinary commentary "DVD Extra" ... two of them actually ... were running through the film with both actors and writers. I still saw things I was not sure about in the first film, but then I realized how easy it was that she missed a lot of fine comedy first. What a horn! Do not miss! 9/10 stars
