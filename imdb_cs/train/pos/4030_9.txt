This movie was absolutely amazing. The time of premature division and culture were beautifully created. Urmila gave another great performance. What I really admire is that he does not bother about Pakistani craving that is uncontrollable in films like Gadar and LOC. With a section as a backdrop, the film does not go to political issues, nor does it focus on violence or what is right and wrong. The film always focuses on the tragic story of Urmila's life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai was greatly rendered. The film really shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, suffered from this division. The theme that there is only one religion is really predominant in this film.
