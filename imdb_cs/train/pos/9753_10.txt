... in our home. Just like everyone else who commented on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4 years at the time) and I (10) would watch this movie over and over again. We all loved star wars, but we've always come back to this for great songs and adventures. We all loved Camel and during his song we would sing with him at the top of our lungs. Some slow moments (the time spent at King Koo-Koo in his yard) and generally we were bored with a knight song ("The reason why I am {sound effect} because I love you"), but we loved the way to save Babbetu and the end, and they were all a little frightened by the image of King Koo-Koo, who sailed where the entire horizon was, and laughing maniacally at the end. I'm still delivering "Hooray for me! Babbette from Paris gays!" around my friends (I now have 33) who look at me as if I'm lost my mind; however, when I sing, I'm 10 years old and I remember the great year of Star Wars.
