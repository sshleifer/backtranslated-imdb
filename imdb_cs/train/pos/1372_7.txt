"Party Girl" is looking forward to the enormous spell of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes the movie seems to be a vehicle in which Miss Posey allows himself to play because he is normally in real life. The film, directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer, is a delight for Ms. Posey's fans. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer will take us on a wild trip to Lower Manhattan to show us this purposeless soul, whose life is dedicated to entertainment in various clubs that are constantly attending. It is a period that was even more naive than what this area and adjacent Meat Market neighborhoods have become. At least in films there are no demands, and people on Earth see the normal way of life if we can call it. Parker Posey makes a wonderful Mary. It's because of Parker Posey's that we like the film more than if Mary was the next actress. It's a whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.
