I just saw it last night, it was broadcast in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's "Passionate Eye" series. It was recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as many others. It's quite a remarkable movie. The filmmakers literally came across the story and there was a documentary about Chavez. Instead they found themselves in the middle of events when the coup unfolded. They had an unprecedented approach to events and people and, for the most part, let the story develop as it did. Of course, they have their own ideological view (which is obvious), but they keep in the background and instead try to focus attention on events, people and background, and the history that led to the coup. Like a movie, it's not a trickery in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, what it should be like. We will find out what "embedded" journalism should be. What we see is a remarkable description of a country trying to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Ch√°vez) who genuinely cares about his people ... the story of power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests merged to lead the revolution of the democratically elected leader ... and an unprecedented approach to the historical event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
