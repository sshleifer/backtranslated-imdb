Scoop *** of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director but I liked Match Point. It was a great dark romantic thriller that fortunately did not notice Woody Allen. It has a beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is the latest Woody Allen film and although it appears in this, it's ok. It also features Scarlett Johansson and two of them work perfectly together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young journalist who gets a sphere of life from the spirit of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the spoon when on a ship with a grim mower and a bunch of other souls that Reaper had taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). He tells Joe that Peter can be a serial killer on the streets of England. Joe, with the root of life, travels back to living, and gives this information to Sondra during a magical meeting. Sondra is on some magical show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.). She becomes a volunteer to go into a fading box, and when she's in a box, she gets a visit from Joe. She did not know what to do, she was using Sid Waterman to help her flush the case. This film feels like a nice and light feel compared to Match Point, and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great. Allen's humor is great for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is amazing as Peter Layman, the "suspect" serial killer. <br /> <br /> It's a fun little movie that sees you sometimes looking at someone to watch. The ensemble works well and the story flows and sometimes forgets that your observer Woody Allen will be alone. I call her a chance because you may like it.
