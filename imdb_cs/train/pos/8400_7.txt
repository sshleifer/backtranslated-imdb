I chose this movie in my local library. After meeting with the director at the film festival late last year, I was curious to have "checked" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. The film engulfs fresh looks on things known, love, infidelity, friendship, jealousy. It can be a little talkative sometimes, but never so completely drop the movie. I loved watching a love story with characters that CLEARLY belongs to each other and looking at them to make more conscious decisions rather than accidentally "falling" into something as important as love. The contrast between this film and the average low budget shoot-em up black film is quite different. Look at it. If you're lucky, your copy comes with a copy of a soundtrack like mine did. Good things!
