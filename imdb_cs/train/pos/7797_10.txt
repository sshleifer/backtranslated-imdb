"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful story about a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, who escaped her suppressing root to become herself. Although the title character plays an artistically gorgeous Ashley Judd - probably her first film role, though somebody proud - no emphasis is placed on becoming "someone" and another Madonna (whether it is Jesus' mother or a horrified singer). Instead, he emphasizes the following instincts and is rather introspective about them to make them an ideal adult self. NOTE: This is not an action movie !!! She uses an occasional voice story (Mrs. Judd) when she writes in her journal - and oh, I see that I just lost the male half of my readers. But be patient with this beautiful movie, where we learn that bliss can come - oh, I do not know, carrying water and chopping wood. Actor / director / writer Todd Field, who played Nick Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut", co-stars like Ruby Lee is a noble love of interest, one who helps her heal her idea of ​​relationships implanted from her youth. But even his character is not the answer to Ruby Lee: There is no external hero to her. The ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Writer / director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / directed "Ulee's Gold," has done an incredible job showing a young woman who has become himself - facing the old challenges of a good murder on the way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> I hear the first few chords of this song, I tear my eyes tears, Pavlovian and uninitiated - I do not know if it is music or an indelible connection with a silent, enchanting mission to strengthen the message. <br /> <This movie is highly recommended for every young person who is trying to find his way. For every woman at any age it's necessary! Disadvantage: Not on DVD except for Spanish. (But we learned that it's legal to make one copy of the VHS version that can be easily found online. My beloved husband found someone with a copy of VHS and got a DVD copy for me.) Even though this treasure movie occasionally appears in the air? on indie channel, usually? You can not rely on it when you need it most like a tonic that will relieve the pressures of the world. So buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a major re-release, and that would be if I were the Hollywood Queen. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
