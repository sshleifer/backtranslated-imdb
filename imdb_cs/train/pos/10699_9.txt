When I saw the Girl of Birthday, so I liked that I noticed every Nicole Kidman movie I could, just to let everyone down in comparison with him. I theorize that while the presence of a certain star usually guarantees a certain level of quality due to their artistic control, Nicole Kidman's influence affects IMHO's film enjoyment. For example, Dogville even gets rid of the viewer of any visual, rather than losing an existential view that struck home, or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of someone else's, or other cause of Kidman. <br /> <br /> Here is a natural woman and she does a really great job. I do not know how or who could keep it, but it probably worked. The way in which the film portrays its openness despite its resistance comes to the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And then what makes the desperate hope of man in vain reachable. <br /> <br /> Of course the fact that male lead transforms from a millet-duty official into a man's macho in the space of one movie sounds like a fantasy spread of a male ego, but its conversion is adequately believable. It's not as polite as it is in a movie designed to support a male ego. Instead, it accurately records the necessary growth resulting from the unique circumstances of the films. Also totally charming is the way in which criminals are portrayed as totally human except for their criminal mission. Her gang has the prey of a rough and fallen community that is foreign to American culture. And while they are his adversaries, they are never his enemy. In fact, he'll teach him the competition. <br /> <br /> I was really interested in Kidman's ability to look physically Russian. I wondered if her ancestry was Russian, but none of her photos I studied did not tell about it. Maybe it's just makeup, but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that she will soon knock her head to make another great movie. In spite of my free kicks with Mrs. kidman, this is an excellent movie in all directions and probably the role of life.
