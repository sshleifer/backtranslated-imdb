The War Drama, which takes place in Louisiana in 1971. A group of recruits follows through basic training and then Tigerland - accurate display of Vietnam on American soil before being transported. He focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... as they meet, they become friends, and they deal with leader Corwardon Collins Jr. and Border Psyche (Shea Wingham) br /> <br /> Surprisingly non-commercial film by director Joel Schumacher. He uses a handheld camera for most of the film and uses a digital video for combat scenes. It works very well - the film looks granular (as it should be) and uncomfortably realistic. Farrell successfully covers his Irish brogue and accepts a quite convincing south accent. His performance is simply great - he is an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not that good. It is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very faint. The rest of the cast is great. <br /> <br /> This movie was kicked off by its studio. He had no stars, a family story, and was considered "just another war movie." He plays only a week in Boston! It is good to capture video or DVD. Farrell and Davis also have a long nude scene.
