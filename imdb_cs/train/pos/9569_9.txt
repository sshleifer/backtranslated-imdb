As I understood, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the infamous cat. 3 films in Hong Kong have disappeared. At least so far, and that's an amazing movie. I knew it was a brutal crime scene that's happening, but it's the first cat. 3 I bought it recently, I was not sure what to expect. The Cambodian hit-man goes to Hong Kong to repel the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer. The judge seems to have taken measures for men because she had said goodbye to the judge, and threatened to take all her money. All this is known in the first ten minutes, so nothing is given. After hitting the cops, they find a very fast hit, but several police officers and civilians are killed trying to arrest him. He's avoiding the cops and is about to catch the guy before he escapes back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the spectator the chance to capture his breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed because you find it very difficult to watch and take off when they find it. On the way, someone who tries to hide in a dump will find a woman who is raped and abused by a man. She helps her and rescues her from the guy and persuades him to take her with him in his escape. I loved this film, it's like a roller coaster that is still moving and moving at high speed, because one incident leads to another, and the police are sometimes as bad or worse than a hobbyist. The game is exceptionally good and shooting and shooting in time are breathtaking. This movie is not allowed, nor with a very incredible end. The end is absolutely incredible and also the end of all actions and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes brutal, but this is no crime that would destroy you. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a larger edition, including the release of R1 certainly. Big film, we recommend.
