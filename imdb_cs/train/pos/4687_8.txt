Lizzie Borden's love crimes are an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (including full frontal female nakedness that will surely defeat the male species). She flirts with sadomasochism and a captive who falls in love with Captor's theory. This treatment of female libido is sometimes shallow and jerky but Borden traveled far beyond the feminist dogma of women gaining strength by their insatiable desire. <br /> <br /> One striking scene reveals a female fetish for a horse when an antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, seduces an older woman who wears her pants and asks her to show her horse riding. The tiller leaned between her legs and pressed her to her crotch, which markedly increased her excitement. Then suddenly he leaves his home and harshly sways to the closed door. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> According to all the news, Sean Young shows up as a strange person, and she is barely beautiful. Still, in this film as a district lawyer, her intense face and long body slim body, her hips highlighted, and periodically discontinuous movement alchemy into erotic fascination. Her performance is strong and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has an interesting world view and the fact that it is in contradiction with the modern ruthless zeitgeist I really appreciate.
