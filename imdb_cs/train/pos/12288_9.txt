The House of Ghosts is a breathtaking story of family intrigue, South American politics and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring the novel Isabel Allende with all the passion and tension. This is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and mellows very credibly, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara keeps her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a nice couple who is fighting for the adoption of a family in racist culture. Glenn Close, like Esteban's sister, gives very moving performance. The Portuguese country is a reasonable substitute for the non-Latin Latin country. Clara's and Esteban's ranch settings are effective, and periods when American cars make a nice contribution to the post-war atmosphere.
