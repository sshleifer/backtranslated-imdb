This is the first film by Tom Hanks, which I gained the privilege of seeing in the theater, even though it is my favorite. When I heard he was going to play a hit, I was a little overwhelmed when he thought "can Mr. Hanks pull this one out"? And he did it magnificently. The 1930s depression movie is a fidelity, a redemption, and a way you do not want your children to face. Tom Hanks is starring as Michael Sullivan. Being a family man and the secret life of a contract killer for an Academy Award nominee, Paul Newman. This film, Tom Hanks, is rather based on a reaction and a view rather than a dialogue that delivers retirement performance. One evening of one of his works Michael's son Michael Jr., who played the newly arrived Tyler Hoechlin, witnessed a hit. A partner of Michael Sr. in the field of crime, teammate Daniel Craig, this information can not have. So he will rebut the son and wife of Michael Sr., with the exception of Michael Jr. So two heads to Chicago will get Conner Rooney (son of Paul Newman Rooney). <br /> <br /> Drama and intense plot really gets stronger than her father, trying to set things right, even though her son is on the way. While on this lethal path someone hired an intervention for Michael Sr. The killer would be a photographer of the late Harlena Maguire, who would play the spotty Jude Law. The movie will feel old times. And thanks to the beautiful and scary nominee Oscar Thomas Newman, which you can not help, you will appreciate this film from Oscar-winner Sam Mendes. So sit down and enjoy wild rides.
