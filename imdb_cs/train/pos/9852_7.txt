No day will come without a new animated animated movie, so now we really have a chance to see more than some nice effects. After watching the ice age, I felt that it was not as much impact on me as some other films of this genre. But it's because I'm Big Guy now and I'm sure it's a very nice movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is fairly simple and the "actors" are entertaining cute, without any rough or complex humor. Even "evil" is a beautiful, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a little disappointment for me (I knew most of the main characters were doomed in a sad way) but a great thing for kids. In addition to some fights, nobody is dying (even when someone is dressed with a mammoth, several times), which has caused cartoons to feel. The computer animation section is nice, but nothing special except some really nice scenes from the feeling of cartoons when you feel like walking in a nice painting or comic book site. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < not to notice, because it does not feel like being in the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a nice movie, but it's more like a kid's clich√© ideal-world-and-fluff-animal-for-kids. If you hate cute animals that make fun things, watch at least once.
