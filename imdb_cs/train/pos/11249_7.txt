I've just watched all 6 episodes on DVD. Efficiency in the whole context is excellent - no doubt. It was not enough for me, I have to say. No real tension as such, a lot of first-class development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of whodunnit. If you like a good story slowly and carefully, then it's for you. Peter Egan as leader of Magnus Pym is excellent. The film portrayed the traitor's life. The man who was to be a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who had been psychologically destroyed by his unhappy childhood that fraud had become his way of life in all matters. As a child he adored his father, but his father was time and time again exposed as a cheater and a criminal. Pym betrayed not ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is fatally damaged by the influence of his father - he revealed his moral thread. He has no real love or loyalty in himself. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological things and a few light moments in the 6 hour series. Very good.
