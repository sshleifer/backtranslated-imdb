Natalie Emily Watson is absolutely the most popular and most romantic figure I've ever seen on the screen. She is the queen of this film absolutely doubtful. Or is it transformed into a king? The crazy weaving of chess games and the family struggle for control, strength and victory are amazing. Just like the chess masters in the film, the director plays many concurrent matches with our mind at once, but they all are either in major or minor patterns. Periods, costumes and paintings from the early 20th century, lakes in the lake area are beautifully captured. No square space is lost. <br /> <br /> So brilliant scenes are leaning, I can not tell them all. I recommend that you have enough time to watch this movie twice, perhaps a week apart, because you can not capture all the poetry within a 64-fold but multidimensional frame in one environment. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakov's book but try my analogy, what I read reminds me of another romantic triumphant film of poetry as a story, Barry Levinson The Natural. He completely eliminated the worsening of the end of the fatalist book, Bernard Malamud, in favor of romantic Impressionism, who was clearly American. The director did it better by seamlessly linking Russian and Italian morals and morals to the background of enlightenment. The true story is that games are zero; there is a winner and loser if both contestants draw. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by the constraints and living conventions if we let others break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, encouraged by Natalya Emily Watson, can overcome and allow us all to strengthen our gifts at the same time. Only the barriers built by our fears can lose us. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie (10/10).
