this movie is absolutely cheerful. basically revolves around a serial killer who has somehow changed into a snowman through a chemical accident in B-film. then goes to the city and begins to terrorize local residents. his local police chief and some other characters to try to stop him. it's on the budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this movie is that it knows its garbage. improvisation of polystyrene and polystyrene imitating the giant killer of the snowman are classic and that is clearly the intention - one of the few films that has its main selling point. along with comic stickyness, there are other great comic moments - listen right at the start of your voice that your father is scaring his children to death and the most amusing rape scenario he ever made to shoot. fantastic fun
