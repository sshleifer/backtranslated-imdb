What can be said about Tare Fitzgerald's convincing performance? She is utterly believable as the wounded Mrs. Graham, embodied by experience, sharp and strong will, yet impossible against Mr Markham's passionate observation. Through every filthy look and every temperament flare, Toby Stephens is the master of his character, every flicker of his distinction in his eyes and facial expression. It is the power of passion and hope that will restore Helen's wounded spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is the perfect performance of an unreformable criminal. Despite everything he has done, there is undisputed human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end; he is at least aware of his own shortcomings and how his destruction has come. Helen's attempt to save his soul - after he left and took the child when it was unheard of - is a triumph of hope, hope, and belief in the value of every human life and soul, whether it is wrong, even if a sinful person can be. Markham's persistence can then be regarded as her reward for her faith and insignificant moral character. Though the apparent idea of ​​morality so strongly presented to the tenant seems to be outdated by today's standards, the story is filled with the integrity, enthusiasm and conviction that still works. Tenant is far more plausible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is the adaptation that makes the novel of justice. I highly recommend that you view it!
