Maybe I got in front of myself, but even though the film itself was a technical masterpiece for his time, I watched it last night at TCM, the question is, why did they do it? life threatening lives, many of them died on the road, why would they experience such a life-threatening journey just to find food for their beast (!) once they have reached the "land of milk and honey" to stay there? Are you threatening your life and the life of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle? It's so dangerous that I only do it for this purpose, it shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people. Risk of death for a cow? Better than I am!
