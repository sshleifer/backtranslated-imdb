What I like, Balanchin's changes to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last part of Grossvatertanz (the traditional melody played at the end of the party) is repeated several times so that children are the last dance before their end scene. <br /> <br /> 2) The violin solo, written for but out of the Tchaikovsky score for Crazy Beauty, interpolates between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of the melodic relationship to music for the growing Christmas tree that will appear shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> 3) Solo for a cavalier with a sugar floating fairy is excluded. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the allegation that Balanchine has somehow denied that the Tchaikovsky gorgeous score is lost.
