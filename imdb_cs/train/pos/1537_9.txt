The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows. Here Mia visits her father for the birthday of her father, who sometimes has a tragedy, the question is what this year will be and will be surprised ... It is a very well composed film, a story that has the perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is seldom see. You will be happy, you will be wounded and basically everything between them. Finally, you can not help to fall in love with Mia (if you are a boy, I think he is the main actress). She is a very well-chosen actress, as well as many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
