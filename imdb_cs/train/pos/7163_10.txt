I really loved this movie ... I started reading the book and I loved her ... as everything was ready and everything had some purpose ... I think this movie was so good because Louis Sachar wrote the script. . And of course Andrew Davis has ordered it ... Shia Lebouf gives great performance to his first film ... the story is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it is very similar to the book that this film is not boring ... I absolutely loved him ... and I encourage someone to read the book ... the whole movie is very well compiled and carefully crafted ... two inches for me every way
