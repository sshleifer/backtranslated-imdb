Even at the beginning of his career, Capra was quite successful with his camera and his timing. It's a thin story - and sometimes quite predictable - but it's got very good performances from its cast and has rather complicated camera moves that include the viewer intimately. The first part looks like the story of Cinderella, though someone with the brain can see that the bottom part will look like it - the rich "prince" loses its fortune. However, due to its good cast and fast pace, it is easy to get clich√©. Then the film becomes more original because the husband has to find a way to feed himself. The end is very predictable but satisfying. I would also like to add the title songs: very funny and entertaining.
