One of the smartest films of serial killers in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative background shot and the history of one of the most popular serial killers. The directors create unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who recalls the Zodiac will be fascinated. Others will want to learn more about this mysterious criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not a fool, but a very methodical and self-promoter. The director plays the audience's expectations and pulls them out. The film is built as a mysterious murder or "cold case" in a thriller style. It's an intelligent detective / procedural horror film that rejects gore-chicks in search of cheaper excitement. Some people do not like any movie shot in the video. This approach is very old and provincial. It's attitude and view of movies that place technical issues above the value of entertainment or artistic value. These attitudes are on their way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget movie, no doubt, but obvious viewers are looking across the border to find a carefully crafted gem.
