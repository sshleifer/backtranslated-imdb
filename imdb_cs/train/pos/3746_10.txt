I love this movie / short story. Jason Steele is awesome! My favorite parts are a French song and an opening title when a soldier on a spatula shouts "SPOONS!" I always went wrong. I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and people who have other Jason Steele films. His style of animation is very original. Permanent display of several details. His humor is also cheerful, and it's certainly not something you'd hear before. Just like a Max deformed spatula that has a sound and light system in the head that transmits color light and joyful music whenever it talks about its miserable life. This is a great animation that you can watch at any time.
