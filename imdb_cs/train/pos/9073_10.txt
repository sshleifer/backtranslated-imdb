My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to see this movie and were totally delighted with the amazing entertainment of the film. He has a special attraction for boys and men who remember their childhood, but also women enjoy the film, and especially Hallie's refinement Kate Eisenberg "Boys are so weird." It is refreshing to see a movie that recklessly shows that boys and girls are really different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys really do such weird things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers stupidly! We liked the film so much that my son and eleven-year-old friend, me and my daughter, a 23-year-old friend, went to see the movie the next day. We had a second time of fun and everyone was talking about it. It is a pure and exhilarating pre-premiere cast reminiscent of TV Classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all think he will become a hitman who did not appear as "Freaks & Geeks" who did not survive his first season, but he released his DVD release. You see this especially if you have a boy and you find that it stimulates the conversation about entertainment and security! Girls will love it because it's an opportunity to say: "Boys are so weird!" Do not miss ...
