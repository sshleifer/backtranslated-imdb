Okay, that was a nice good episode. Much better than the credit he gets. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is wonderful. Best yet. I love the last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the guest occupation (without the helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What you do not like about this episode is that many things have been unexplainable. why change sex? what is the purpose? are they extraterrestrials? what kind of? why did they never appear in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I am giving this episode a high trio of stars. One of my favorites, but punching holes worries me. Still ... I will not let it ruin my fun.
