Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as originals. It crosses borders with flying colors. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw her theatrically at the age of nine, and the film was completely enchanted and enchanted. The film certainly calls for comparison with the 1963 counterpart. The earlier film is also a pleasant and fun movie, but it certainly feels like a natural documentary rather than a movie. This update is epic and cinematic. Nevertheless, I thoroughly recommend both films. The film is certainly a must for the animal lover. We have a wise old golden retriever, Shadow; a sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and a young, fun-loving American bulldog, a chance. Animals are greatly expressed by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. <br /> <br /> There is nothing dirty in the movie. There is a little scatteric humor, but nothing extreme. No heavy violence, except for a few tense scenes that include whipping waterfall, angry porcupines and a dark rail shaft. Merry, spooky, moving and above all real, I was surprised, the film won no prizes, not one. Still, I have to say that it's just as good as some of the Best Picture candidates nowadays.
