As a fan of Paris Je'Taime I went to visit New York, I love you with very high expectations. I like to leave with all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast and fun. The film starts with two chambers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) who try to get into the same space but argue in what direction. That was funny, and then the film goes to the best skeets I've ever seen. There were four amazing of all good. The four of them start talking. One represents Shia LaBeouf as a ringing at a hotel looking for love in an old lady. Another of them is Orlando Bloom as a musician who works with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another of them is Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly, as two people go to the ball, Thirbly's character is handicapped. The best of them is Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a defending old couple. I'm going to let you know that Nataile Portman is an impressive director-direct debut director and writer of skittles about the manager, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are great as a flirtatious man and a chap. New York, I love you, is certainly as good, if not better than Paris Je'Taime in 2006. Squits are well-behaved, and the film shows how indie films should really be. The film, however, has not so many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its perfection. If you want to laugh, check out some great dramatic effects, you will see a fantastic amount of great performances and just have fun, then definitely go to New York, I love you.
