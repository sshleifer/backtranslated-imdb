Savage Island's raw savage will scare you to the hell out of you! Believe me. <br /> <br /> When a boy from a devastated Savage family changes some tourists out of town, Pa Savage wants to avenge himself and stops in nothing until he arrives. <br /> <br /> This is a real horror movie with some really amazing horror moments. Also negative reviews clearly come from someone who lacks the right knowledge of the film. Directors have chosen lighting and working with the camera to reflect the dark, dark and moody mood of the story; in other words, gain some aesthetics. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film won the NEXT Award for the Horror Film Festival.
