As for the Muppet line, however, it is neither the best nor the second best. It has been sold to children but has some dark and emotionally disturbed adult moments that parents may not want to expose their children to. One of them is that Miss Piggy goes "post" in a jealous rage that lasts for the duration of this work. But the story is progressive and very entertaining. One scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss Piggy go beruerk in a department store is just cheerful! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of levitation and entertainment. <br /> <br /> I like it very much and I enjoy it today. <br /> <br /> It fits at 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br />
