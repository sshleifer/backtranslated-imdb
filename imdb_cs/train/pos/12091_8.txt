'Castle of Blood' (aka 'Castle of Terror') is the surprisingly haunting entry of Italian director Anthony Dawson. Excellent black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, excellent casting, relatively logical scripting, deliberate stimulation, and surprise (even if absolutely reasonable) that separate from each other. Only movies are sometimes hockey music and quite a sudden "love at first glance" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière), which has become another surprisingly funny movie. While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub and tells one of his ghost stories to Count Blackwood. When he recognizes a great writer, young reporter Alan asks for an interview with Poe. During the interview Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Dissatisfied, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers the chance to bet Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive this night in Blackwood Castle, the night after Halloween when he's dead. Alan can not afford to bet, so he bet his life for a £ 10 bet. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the exaggerated Black Sabbath (called the Satan Mask), Mario Bava is 'Castle of Blood' rather restrained, so a few moments of violence are even more terrible, particularly surprising by a director who is usually associated with those terrible Italian space films from the 1960s. It's a pity the only version of this movie that I'm badly worried about (and recorded) Mr. and the scan version. It is still worth seeing and shouting on a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt as Elizabeth. Watch this and enjoy a movie that compares well with Robert Wise's "The Haunting."
