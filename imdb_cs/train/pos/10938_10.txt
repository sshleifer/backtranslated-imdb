I have rarely encountered a movie that has become so full that I have to talk about it immediately. This film is definitely the most amusing entertainment and is very authentic. I've seen a dubbed version, but now I'm on my way to first selecting a DVD remaster with an original Chinese conversation. Still, the dabing did not get in the way, and sometimes he gave some really humorous humor: "Poison Clan jumps the world !!!" Story-spraying remains faithful to Chinese methods of intrigue, tension, and interpersonal relationships. You can expect twists and turns because it reveals the identity of 5 poisons and professional pace. Martial arts compete with choreography, it is in its own class and must be seen as believed. It's like watching real animals fighting each other but coming out of their own martial arts. Such a level of skill among actors is unmatched in modern cinematography. The combination provides a serious dose of ancient Chinese culture and I recommend it only on the basis of the real intention of the film to fight the story of art and master its implementation. ... Of course, if you just want to see people bang each other along with the rough forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
