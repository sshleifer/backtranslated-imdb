Still Crazy was compared to Spinal Tap, because both are comedy about washing the R & R groups. In fact, the similarity ends here, because Still Crazy is much better written and performed, while Spinal Tap font worsens from the slightly entertaining first 10 minutes to threats, making Beavis and Butthead appear in comparison to the sophisticated ones. Still Crazy is a formulation, but the transformation of characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some of the musical numbers for me has made it possible to cope with the a priori predictability of the film. People who expect to try a spinal tap on satire would be disappointed with the gentle nature of the film, but I would have taken the successful self-ironic cry of Still Crazy over a pompous but unsuccessful sail shot that is Spinal Tap.
