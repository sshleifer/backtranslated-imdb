Steve Carell plays like a person you really can relate to in Dana (in fact), a movie I thought he would not like, but he would like it in the end. Not that the movie is laughing loudly funny, it's just that it has a big heart. We all love Steve Carell, they do not expect this fan of the office, but you know what I liked. Carell plays as Dan Burns, a widowed father who really does not like her daughters. One weekend travels with him and his daughters to see their family. While she goes, she goes to the bookstore and falls to her wife. When he returns to his house, he finds out that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). Dan in real life, sometimes I found a little incredible. Are the Burns family really like people who work together and play social games together and do a lot of other family things? I would very much doubt that. I do not know any family that is such. Does that prevent me from putting my thumb up? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life: *** / ****
