STAR EVALUATION: ***** Unbelievable **** Very Good *** Well ** You could go for food instead * Avoid all spending <br /> <br /> Stuck-up Career Kate (Franka Potente) leads to the London Underground to catch the train to marry her with George Clooney. After a hectic working day, however, he recovers and wakes until he finds himself alone on a deserted platform. When she gets out of a situation that brings her from one terrible encounter to another, she learns about something much more vicious and evil that awaits her. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British Film Industry is actually becoming one of its own, especially in the horror thriller, with films like Creep and 28 days later (which has strong echoes in parts.) As for success in what he is about to do, Creep cleverly creates (especially at the beginning) a haunting feeling of isolation and strained fear. When it's a smart time to run, I (even inadvertently, I suspect) can honestly deal with some of the pioneering horror films of the 1970s that rely on shocks and fear without focusing too much on character development and such. <br /> <br /> From the weaknesses, some scenes are a bit predictable, but they really do not make it less scary or effective in any way. I'm not sure if the end would mean that it would look like a moral game and it's not perfect, but it's definitely very effective and serves a very good basic function. ***
