yeah, right. Sammo Hung has already played the lead role in 1983 "Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain". Now, 2001, he's doing it again with Zu Warriors. But this time it does it right. You rarely see it in wuxi, more often in classical eastern or criminal collapse. But this role is easy for him! An old Chinese legend about mountain zu is not often represented in films (as far as I know about films translated to the west). Nevertheless, the legend contains a number of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: Still, you have not seen a similar story in a modern movie! And that makes it so great! A wow: all the colors and an extremely deep story back to the heart will instantly let you into this movie. When I first watched it, I had to watch it immediately and I did it. All right, I did not understand it for the first time. But that's just better! You know, you did not want to understand everything because there are so many spices in it! Therefore, it is a pleasure for someone to look again and again. And yeah, growing deeper in your heart, the more you watch it. <br /> <br /> Summary: The Story of Love, the characters you're posing and really: a movie you will not forget! - Editors have noticed: Well, I think I must watch again now: D
