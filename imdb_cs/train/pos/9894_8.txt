"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous film about how a martyr at Marty's high school chooses some pranksters all the time. The prank goes wrong and eventually burns furiously. Five years later, his martyrs attend a rally - only ten of them, of course, and low, and Marty is murdering one after another. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the cast as a heroine (who will die the same!) The act is totally terrible , there is also absolutely no tension. Lots of grotesque death deaths to satisfy gore-jokes: the fellow's stomach explodes, another female victim literally gets a sour bath, a couple with a sex in the bed getting an electric shock, a guy crushed by a tractor, one girl drowned, and the doctor got into the eye with a hyperdermal needle. The killer wears a decent and somewhat haunted jester mask and the setting (beautiful old English castle) is really nice. However, the dream of the final is totally pathetic. Overall, it is true that "Slaughter High" is a piece of rubbish, but I liked it. Just for fans of really bad slasher movies.
