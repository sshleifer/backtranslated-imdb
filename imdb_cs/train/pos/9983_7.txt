This film is basically about relationships between people and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who begins the journey into her past at the dawn of her life and analyzes how she lived her life. This path is refuted due to the economic crisis of the sons and his intentions to put her in the nursing home. It's a very honest look at some of the questions we all put at some point in life, and there are lots of secondary ideas in this movie, such as family heritage, real love, marriage, or fate. Although this type of movie melodrama is nothing new, it may be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance of actors and characters are very plausible, but since time some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie on a quiet afternoon.
