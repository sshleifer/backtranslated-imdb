The second official episode of the series "Columbo" ("Murder by Book", shot later, has hit the broadcast waves). Robert Culp, who, in several future installments, coincides with trustworthy detective Petter Falck, is amazing as a briefly tempered chief of a sophisticated private detective agency that murders a client's wife when he refuses to flood his plans for blackmail. Two stars are well rated in this clever exercise, one of the best in series.
