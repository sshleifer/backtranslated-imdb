I'm going to go out on the limb and actually protect the "shades of gray" as a good episode of clips that got into the life and death of Commander William Thomas Riker, who fought the final fatal illness. > <br /> Scenes from the retrospective sequences were quite well done with the mood Riker was in such as when he experienced his romantic episodes such as "11001001," "Angel One," and "Up a Long Ladder." Tragic moments have been highlighted, such as Tasha's death in Skin of Evil, as well as elements of vibrant dangers in "Heart of Fame", "Conspiracy" and the above-mentioned "Skin of Evil." Riker also showed courage under the fire by telling some humorous jokes like: "My ancestor was a bitter rattle once ... after three days of intense pain the snake died." This episode highlighted Will Riker's psychological distress under extreme pressure. And yes, in my opinion, I am interested in proclaiming "gray shades" as a fixed episode, because at the time of my original broadcast, my face was sweaty and wondered if Riker would pull out or not live alive and alive to see another great, galactic, space adventure beyond the boundaries ... Of course, in the years to come, it seemed to me that I had created a special opinion on this episode ... but if the prize was to be the "best episode of clips in TV history" then I think that this episode should be evaluated in this respect.
