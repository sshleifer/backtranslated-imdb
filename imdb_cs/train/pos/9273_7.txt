In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has the shape of all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still live, they usually do what you expect, such as going for soccer matches to get a little bit upset by the national team because they are running to qualify for the World Cup. In addition to women, they must not go to the football stadium to watch the game. The often entertaining little movie follows a small group of women who have snapped into the football stadium and a small group of borers assigned to protection is holding a pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to delight in the team (nothing that is subversive) and the small human questions about each person's life, brings a fairly subtle commentary on human versus ideology. <br /> <br /> Amateur acting, good script and dialogue, a really nice movie. Bend It Like Beckham, a bit - a warm heart and joy in everyday interests and pleasure of people.
