De Grot is an amazing Dutch thriller based on a book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, "Het Gouden Ei", was created in 1988 by the great mysterious thriller of the Netherlands called "Spoorloos" ("The Vanishing"). This time, it's not as good as the thriller (though much better than the American remake called 'The Vanishing'), but there are times to come. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening moments are amazing. We see a man, later we learn that his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), who comes from an airplane in Thailand. When he takes his bags, it's pretty clear he's smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acting. There will be some tension that you would not normally have in such an opening scene. Later, we see how Egon in Thailand has made a deal with a woman, and they claim they never did that. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, the film is constantly reminiscent and flashes forward. We see how Egon, as a child (played here by Erik van der Horst), is friends with the guy Axel (as a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensem) became a criminal. Egon, meanwhile, goes to college to settle down with a woman. Around this time, he sometimes meets Axel, but really does not want to have anything to do with him. The film is a chronological way. This shows Egon and Axel as children, rather than as students, young adults and in their thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the film returned when they were kids and jumped forward again. Every time we see them as kids, it explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> happy. Just like the beginning, the end is amazing. The middle part of the movie is fun and it causes it to divert our attention to the first scenes, only to return at this point in the end. This is an editing that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic end is also happy in the way.
