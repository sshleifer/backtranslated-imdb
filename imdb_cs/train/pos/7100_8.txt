I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas, when he came out in 1986. I remember paying prizes for seeing the movie. After seeing the movie, I see why. The film was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this film was that he was trying to tell the story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap it around the Masters Saga. My biggest complaint is that this is the second wave of Robotech masters who are attacking Earth. They even used the same Master Saga scenes, but with different conversations. As a child I loved the movie. But unfortunately I did not see her as an adult person and I can not give a better overview. Looking back I was disappointed, but now I'd like to see the movie and rethink my attitude towards it. That being said, please someone release this movie for the whole world to judge it? I love Robotech and can not wait for Chronicles of Shadow.
