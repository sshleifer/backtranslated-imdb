Dr. Mordrid is one of those rare movies that are completely under radar, but it is totally useful. It really reminds me of old series from the 1930s and 1940s. That's why I would like to see more movies ... but judging from the rest of the full monthly output, it simply was not enough to satisfy a typical audience. Unfortunately, because of the unnecessary sacrificial scene, there is too much for the family audience - which is unfortunate, for without them it could be Harry Potter's charm that children would eat. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I was not sure if Mrs. Nipar was out of the list, she was very loyal. No really! Anyway - it's a shame they did not have the money to get a Dr. Strange, because I think it could be a total phenomenon of childhood.
