I, like many destroyed trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) They suffered seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", dreaming of a better show when it was over, and lamented the end of "Deep Space Nine" 1999. Prayers, he replied. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visuals, pop-song for intro. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything I did not like. register me for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", no one is missing! Stay on Trekkin! <br /> <br />
