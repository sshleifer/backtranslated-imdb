One of the funniest Johns, Eugene Levy is also great, I just want studios to find that this movie has to be on DVD, I have it on a videotape, but I feel that this film deserves a DVD (and extra great) Kung Fu Uuniversity Kung Fu U) skit is as fun as the whole movie and the scenes she has with her girlfriend and her family are great, this movie never seems to be on TV but loses most of it's joy when it's edited for the broadcast If you find a video, I recommend buying it (ebay is a good place to find a copy). We'll hold the VHS until it's one day on DVD. there are so many great movies out there that have not yet been released on DVD, and that's one of them.
