Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being approached by a lonely biker. She is mortally shaken by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the assailant pushes his way into Marjorie's home and exposes her to a degrading terror. Bloody and bloody, Marjorie can get his upper hand on his assailant, knock the daylight from the blockbuster and make him helpless with a sharp spray in his eyes and neck. Hog tied and poisoned, Joe tries to explain to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they come home. There is almost a sign of mercy, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should she continue to impose her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse, and rude language make Raw Fat Fawcett a real prize from Dit's roles that would make her career forever bleached. Kudos to director Robert M. Young.
