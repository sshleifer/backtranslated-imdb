<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that she owns Jake Speed. I've seen it at least ten times. This movie is one of the most funny movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family heard nothing. Together comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), who tells her exactly where her sister is and offered her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. She does not work for money because she just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) watches and writes his adventure into novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's funny, it's an action, it's great. I think it's a cult movie with a very small cult. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws out some single-line lines you'll never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as a girl and a sidekick, respectively. John Hurt, the guy who's stomped out in Alien, plays a devilish, perverse villian that just adds fun. In many ways, this film is similar to the movie Indiana Jones, in some ways similar to James Bond's films. Maybe it should be called Indiana Bond, but no matter what the title is, it's a very nice movie.
