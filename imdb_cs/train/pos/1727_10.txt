The wooden horse is a very clever film about a very clever and successful escape plan that British soldiers worked out during the Second World War. The sense of humor is excellent, especially the lines expressed by the acidic languages ​​of Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are amazing as two heroes. Direction is tense and fast. Highly recommended.
