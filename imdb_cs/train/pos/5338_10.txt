If I'm going to watch porn movies, I prefer to have some plot and dialogue about descent. Behind the door in the bedroom is one of the few I've met with these attributes. The new side girl cheats the human nature of the neighbor and the weakness of seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue, (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the choice of an actress who plays part of the blackmailing lead and plays a great role. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The film gets a total of 10 just because it is in it. Her partner in Monique Alexander is a little kitten. The two should cooperate more. But in this movie, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. It is bad. It looks like she has more talents to share. I like the girl who was (maybe) the DA's wife. I forget her name, but she's pretty good looking and she's not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to find out what some people are so excited about. Obviously, some parts bought it paid for. What's fine, but it's over? Excuse me, come on! I'm afraid her performance here would have dropped some ratings except Chelsea talent and beauty takes precedence over negative results. Overall, this movie is good.
