I've seen this movie and the game, and I have to say it was the most important story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I did not know how terrible life is, and it's probably still for the South African children and adults who were and are living at that time. I brought tears to my eyes and a lot of sadness to my heart that every human being should fight like that just to stay alive and to bring children out of this area and teach them to act and preprocess and relax their own story Simply amazing. It simply surpasses five stars, I will evaluate ten. I thank Mr. Mbongeni Nge for such a wonderful story. Though it was twelve years since that story was told, it is still one that lies heavily in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD out there, please notify me ASAP.Thank you. PS There was nothing wrong with children wanting to point out their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in the hope that someone will have a heart and offer help.
