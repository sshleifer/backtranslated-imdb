What a beautiful TV movie warming the heart. The story tells of a small five year old girl who lost her father and found it impossible to handle. Her mother is also very concerned ... just a miracle can alleviate their misfortune. Samantha Mathis is fabulous as a Momma girl because she was like a nanny in "Jack and Sarah," worth watching if you like Samantha Mathis and happy; year tearing jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is always a beautiful grandmother in this select and spectacular movie. Jodelle Ferland (a young five-year-old) is a charming and convincing young actress. The film is based on a real story that is so concerned. "Mermaid" is a homage to human favors, which is clearly illustrated, and is clearly still around us in this difficult world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us all hope by realizing that there are a lot of nice people in the world with a lot of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
