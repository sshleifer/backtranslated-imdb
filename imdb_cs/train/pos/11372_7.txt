"Citizen X" tells the story of Rostov's Butcher, a nickname for the shameful and perverse Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. The film focuses on a novice detective (Rea) who has been pursuing the killer hard against all possible problems in the face of uncooperative bureaucracy in self-serving and comfortable denial. The HBO product for TV, the movie offers massive casting, good performances, saves the audience a lot of sharp details, but plays like a doodrama without styling like a Hollywood fare. A perfect and straightforward dramatization of a serious and relatively little-known story more interesting than Jack Ripper. (B)
