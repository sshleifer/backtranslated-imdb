WARNING: SPOILER! This film, Zero Day, gives two students, Andrea and Calvin, who feel disliked and hate about something and everything that connects them. <br /> <br /> They are going to turn themselves-I thought the "mission" all led to a huge mission that was zero. The number of zero days is not determined until the end of the movie. The browser knows its serious and full of hatred, but is never quite sure until the end. Now we all know if the movie is based on the Columbine massacre, the end is quite obvious. And the end is not different from other attack films, they go and kill many of their colleagues at the end. I thought a lot of movies about this attack and this movie Far is my favorite and most respected. It gives the viewer and inside view of the life of these two teens who hate life, and sincerely gives the viewer something to understand and close to terrible events. <br /> <br /> The events have won, I never knew the seriousness of the shots until my English class was assigned an essay or story defining moment in our generation. Well I knew everyone was going to choose Twin Towers, but I wanted to be different because of course Two towers were tragic and very defining but I did not think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way. that I was only in 3rd grade and had no idea what it all meant. But the shots went away and worked. I remember conversations, views of the school sky and horror and horror in the eyes of thousands of people. This movie is a convincing, ground-breaking and horrible masterpiece, and I would welcome it to everyone.
