The prerequisite for this film is simple and so is the scenario: the older Muslim will get his teenage son to take him to a similarly old car from France to Haju in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to fulfill his holy Muslim commitment to die. The father is obviously devoutly religious, but the son is uncompressed; he accepts from his commitment to his father rather than to religion, he would rather be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in a lot of things the son does not understand, and the cunning between them is a device that keeps the drama, though it is often a bit unpleasant. However, like any good film on the go, special characters appear on the way; such as a woman on a return trip in Croatia, who simply goes to the back seat after calling for directions to Belgrade and shows that her hand pronounces a word that supposes it to be a place but can not be found on the map. In Bulgaria, another man asks for instructions confirming that he speaks French, but then gives an extensive comment in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in one country a tire's son is eating sandwiches and wants meat - they get a goat, but unfortunately (fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform a Muslim slaughter ritual. Eventually they get to the Mecca - Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but to a much larger extent. For the West, it is bizarre but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated but enchanting in its own way, like a National Geographic with a soul.
