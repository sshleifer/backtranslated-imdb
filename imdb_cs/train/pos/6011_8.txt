in my opinion, the middle part of the film, especially the love scene, is too long, but you can imagine this desert sensation all the time. but the best of this movie was unforgettable, there are great blast images, their color, slowness and pink floyd music are unique in the history movie! <br /> <br /> Destruction in its propper and popular form.
