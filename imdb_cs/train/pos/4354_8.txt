I saw this movie back at the Palm Springs International Festival in 2005 and I appreciated the 14 films I saw there. Theater 900+ was full and eventually got a standing ovation. This was Peter Falk's classic, if you were a fan of Falc, and you saw a lot of chemistry between Peter Falk and Paul Reis. The name of the film seemed to be long and too strange. I was surprised that it did not go to general release. It was much better than most of the junk emails that the main studios are planning on you. Perhaps he is too grown up by focusing on a child boomer and senior audience. Many people could concentrate on the situation in this film. This is likely to appeal to the revival of such years since people look back on this film and consider it a kind of gem. I would rate 8.0 to 8.5 on scale 10 and I would definitely recommend it.
