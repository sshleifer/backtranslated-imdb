Harem Suare is the best film I've ever seen in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Harem Suare is a sensually filmed and enormously portrayed film is a courageous film dealing with interracial romance, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors fill the film. Cut off from the outside world, women talk to each other by telling stories of intrigue, rivalry and jealousy in their ranks.
