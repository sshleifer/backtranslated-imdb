I only saw season 1, but it's great! A wide range of people have been stuck on the island. No one is the one who looks and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in their dresses ... It sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is that so great? It's probably not, but then a bucket full of X files, a batch of "what"? and a big hey and an island, which is everything you've always dreamed of in your freaky nightmares and you'll be lost. The story has so many twists and turns is incredible. A great set-up, a solid negotiation with the liberating acceptance that at the end of every person is a man (well, almost everyone ... I think ...) with good and bad side. But weird oh so weird ...
