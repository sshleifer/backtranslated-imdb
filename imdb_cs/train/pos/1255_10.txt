This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many people click here? I will tell you. In this movie you have a black criminal who overcomes a white professor. A black policeman who tells a white professor that he is bad for defending a black criminal and a black policeman turns out to be right. The white professor looks stupid. It's always a race. It's an excellent movie. Do not forget the racist. If you can see that there are black people in this movie who overcome white characters, you should have no problems with this movie. I recommended everyone to look at this movie.
