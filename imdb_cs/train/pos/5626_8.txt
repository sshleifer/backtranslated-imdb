Then one day, when Marjorie's roommate is at work, her assailant will come. His name is Joe. this human. But she can shake her eyes and insect repellent mouths, things that kill him if they do not get help soon. He binds him and makes Joe the subject of the same kind of physical and mental attacks he (1986) is director Robert M. Young.It is based on controversial off-Broadway play since 1982 William Mastrosimone.Farrah Fawcett, who unfortunately lost her battle with cancer Last year, he is amazing like Marjorie. James Russo, who also played the striker in the game, is convincing like Joe. Alfre Woodard and Dia at Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as Guard Guard. He has a Golden Globe nomination. It is not a movie that should entertain you.It asks the question is vengeance justified.This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.
