Finally, I bought and added a copy of "Show People" to my collection. I can not comment more than what the previous audience said and the characters, plot and overall quality of this film without repeating our own words. Looking at the portrait, the exceptional performance of so many M-G-M silent stars is worth seeing for itself. I really like the scene in which Marion Davies plays alone and meets her role playing the character of Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read your lips because there is no title card that would indicate what she says when she sees Marion Davies, but it's something that means "I do not think I like her!" Cover the corn, pop on the cassette and prepare for more than three quarters of a century in the film making history. Enjoy!
