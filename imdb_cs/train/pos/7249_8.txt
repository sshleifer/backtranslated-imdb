It is difficult to assign this movie a "fair" amount of stars, but due to its high production values, I settled on eighteenth and what was in 1968 an innovative approach to the war movie. Do not forget that I have not seen you since 1969. But it made a strong impression. Long-term dying must be one of the most animated antiwar films ever shot. It does so simply by showing, in an extremely realistic way, the work of a handful of soldiers in northwestern Europe in the years 1944-45. No movie before this one showed the infantry war with such a deep detail, all cold and discreet, to speak for themselves. There is no sermon, no sentimentality, no comical relief, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately there is no subtlety either. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters hit the flat and familiar clich√©. As a "fun", the film does not do this, although it was clearly not meant to "entertain". It was intended to put you over the head with the misery and horror of the Second World War and the modern wars in general. It was twenty years before Platoon and thirty before Saving Private Ryan, which are much more "observable" films. Here flat and generally unpleasant characters, a lack of real plot and really unpleasant images (including what can be the first to reverse on screen in theater history) make the film hard to sit, even if it's only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So the ten stars for production and realism, the four stars for the feeling it will have when it's over, is a bonus star that has its heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like Carl Foreman underestimated "The Victors," an equally dubious but much more interesting and thoughtful film, The Long Day's Dying looks like it's not on DVD. Why not? Both films were on the cable several times.
