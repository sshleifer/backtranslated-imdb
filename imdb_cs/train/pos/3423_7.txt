Do not expect a description of "truth". However, the accounts of these veterans from Iraqi and Afghan wars require thoughtful reflections. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the film is that it shows vividly the words and war wounds of these vets and their postwar struggles to reconstruct a certain degree of normality and functionality of their lives. <br /> <br /> My main criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and advocates anti-war activism, but nothing to fix the serious shortcomings of military and veteran affairs programs to help those you suffer and still suffer from the traumas of the war. They are NOT fatal mistakes in the movie. As a veteran myself, I know the terrible consequences of the war are real, and these young men and women express it very well. These vets live the physical and mental pain and suffering that most veterans experience and which ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
