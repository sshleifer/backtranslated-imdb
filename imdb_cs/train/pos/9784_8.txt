A sensitive film lacks a gloss and, to some extent, a narrative structure, but it is greatly shot and executed. However, the narrative structure is debatable. While it implies that in the final scenes it nicely attracts free ends and combines its ideas with what a modern viewer can describe as a "story", I am skeptical as to whether this feeling * needs a * story structure 'that is it is unexpectedly compared to SOMERSAULT in that its central protagonist (I'm not sure it is the right word!), She is a young and very young woman whose newly discovered sexuality is both confused and reinforced - when, of course, Cate Shortland's film is better suited to this aspect, but while there is a possibility for unscrupulous audiences to reject this film as a cliché, PEACHES is somewhat more ambitious than SOMERSAULT in some respects, maybe it's where it does not. the first film Monahan - INTERVIEW! I'm not entirely sure how the story added sex scenes between weaving and lungs. Who knows - maybe yes. They certainly brought down houses compromised and flawed nature Weavingova character - although I personally think that it was achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** FILM AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN **** ***** <br /> <br /> In a second monitor to see how it would like some refused telemovie dressed as a feature. But I'm not sure how these "categories" are different or whether we should make that distinction. In any case, I think the film has plenty of layers to distinguish itself from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal and its content is scarcely demanding, at least in the way they are SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLARS, ILLUSTRATED PEDIATRICIAN, LOOKOJI SINGLE AND HUMAN TOUCH. All the performances are good, but I came to the conclusion that the main reason I enjoyed the movie was to fit into the "Australian" genre without having to add anything ... and I understand it can be quite good reason for another person * NOT * like it! In fact, it was not until the moment when the room in her Vietnamese dress Lung enters the room, the film really starts to pack punch. But it leads us to another debate - * should we * expect the film to challenge us all the time? Sure I like to be challenged film (or book, or other people), but there is no room for what is simply a story? <br /> <br /> I did not delete its initial contribution on this movie because I am too well aware orwelliánských overtones of such an act. But I would reduce my initial rating from 8 to about 6.5. As for the AFI Best Film nominations, I have my votes for HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and LOOK AS JOURNEY - and I think LOOK Both ways should win.
