Dwight Frye steals a performance like a silly young man (who appears to be mentally handicapped) who is blamed for vampire murders, especially when he discovers his love for bats who like stroke and gives unsuspecting friends like "gift items"! Besides, there's a fun mysterious story about the above-mentioned murders. Underestimated.
