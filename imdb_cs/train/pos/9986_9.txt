As perhaps one of the few Canadians who have a book to read in high school, I thought I add my notes. See the movie without the knowledge of the story in advance in any case lost from the film. Characters have so many complexities, each with their own way. Better adaptation lies in the fact that everyone can express their own perceptions on the lives of the characters, rather than being peeled opinion. You can love them or do not like them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Amazing performances Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I would highly recommend it.
