2005 Report on the Toronto Film Festival It's official; "Takashi Miike" is destroyed. An annual quest for the new movie "Takashi Miike," "The Great Spook War" or "Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Tell me what you're gonna do, it's a fanatical ride. Colin Geddes, a ruthless programmer, said the film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "The Lord of the Rings" or "The Infinite Story" for Japan. After the screening, I can understand where it goes, but in the end it's "Takashi Miike". He directed the movie "Ichi the Killer" from the year '01 when he was screened for screenings on festival bags. And no, it was not just advertising. <br /> <br /> Summary of the description: A young boy with a troubled home life becomes "chosen" and falls into the middle of the Great Spirit War where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions on his way. <br /> <br /> This is not really for kids, not too "young". Surely you can see how to get scared without fighting with some of these ghosts (and friendly ones) on the display. That's something I've seen before in the cinema. Fantasy naturally, some very fun (but dark) material. You will not be bored, it can guarantee. Will it ever be hit by North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
