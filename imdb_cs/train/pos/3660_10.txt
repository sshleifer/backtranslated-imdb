This obscure de Sica delivers goods. And it is said, "The Sichuan will inherit the land." This story of the classes on the surface, but really allegory for all homeless people who have settled Europe after the Great War. They are homeless, but cheerful, in a society that is too poor and selfish to carefully care or admit carriages for Italian rugs. de Sica decides to say it as a fairy tale, the story of Cinderella. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I can not predict whether deus ex machina is a constructor of a writer or Vittoria. It begins with the words "Once ..." to show the timeliness of your story, because the story could be placed anywhere and everywhere. The caricature of the sketch of the aristocracy that scratched the bone, the prodigious nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to deliver their wishes and end up directly from the image of Spielberg, makes this crazy joy for all. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best. Leaving neo-realism, he always surrenders between this old and pure old film, creating a film that breaks the heart, and at the same time fulfills the desire for the hope that one has to continue in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
