I love this movie! 10 of 10 hands! That's damn good! I'm not a fan of movies, but I have to tell you that this is what my eyes opened for. Amazing color and fast energy. I was lucky to catch it during the Zoinks screening! The Boston Film Festival and the story surrounded me from the beginning. She had lots of themed subjects for adults and character, and when it was over, I wanted more. I hope they will continue. That would be fun. My only problem is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH! SUCKS! I saw a block of wood pull out better performance. I do not want what the director said when he threw it. But if you ignore it, you can not help but give this movie a dozen!
