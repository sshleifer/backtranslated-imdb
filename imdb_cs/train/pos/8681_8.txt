This cartoon is short of conspiracy, but it is a visually stunning work. There is a very, very small spoiler: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" which is incredibly mild-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring every year, but the match with winter is not yet ready to retreat. Gnomes and storms have their own songs. It's more like a plot, like it is. But this cartoon is not a conspiracy - it's about color and animation. Views are exceptional. In 1936, such bright color was still something new and there was incredible inspiration here. <br /> <br /> My favorite short moments surround the movement of liquefied colors with pipes. At more than one point, the row of pipes is aligned in a row, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors move through the tubes and the music track causes the line to appear to be a tubular organ. <br /> <br /> The battle between the growing greens and the winter storm, which refuses to quietly leave, is extremely well done. These types of shorts are things that are obvious to Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, but probably also helped their final exit from MGM, as this cartoon is likely to go over budget, and MGM finally decided that they could better control costs if the animation departments were controlled someone who knew a little bit more about price than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful cartoon and it's worth seeing. It is available on the 30s DVD Attack, especially if you like good animation.
