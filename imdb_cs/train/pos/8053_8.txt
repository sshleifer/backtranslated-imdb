These are great early comedy films by Sammy. This is not a parody of the dragon entry, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and mimics him very well for men of his size. Nominal story of how his struggle is still causing trouble with his loved ones - then they fight. Oh, fighting. Good, fast changing scenes with a big bump (a white boy who plays the boxer, seems to have really hurt one of Sammo's kicks). The most fun part of this movie was purely unintentional. There is Jim Kelly looking a guy (one of the three experts hired Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in a black dress with an afro-wig. Well, did they have no real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? I think I've also seen enough white fake "Chinese people" in old American movies. He is one of the fans of Sammy or Bruce Lee.
