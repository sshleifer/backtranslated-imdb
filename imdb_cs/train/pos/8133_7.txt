Well, I personally do not like rap but I still found Fear of Black Hat cheerful. I'm sure I did not get any jokes, but I knew some, and it was fun enough to laugh at me when I laughed. I'm a big fan of the spinal tap, so I naturally had to check it out. It was derived from The This Spinal Tap, sometimes apparently, but this film still stood on its own as an original, intelligent and fun satire. My personal favorite: "They did not have hats at the time of the slaves to protect them from the sun, so they were too tired at the end of the day to revolt, now we have our hats."
