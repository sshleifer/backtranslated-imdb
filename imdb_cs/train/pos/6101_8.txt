So I will not destroy it for you, I will be very brief. Attractive casts are some great acting and fun lines. A young graduate of Harvard High School (Brian White) finds out that he does not know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his internship because his girlfriend (Mya) left him for work as a television producer. His senior resident (Wood Harris), who helped greatly with his "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana). They help protect their career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of just wanting to make money (which seems to be true for many of my pre-boyfriends).
