A deeply humorous but honest comedy about a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited back to Tomawka camp week in Ontario, Canada, according to their former consul (Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder has used his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense. Also, the movie has a lot of fun moments, some of which are totally bizarre like my favorite, the use of camouflage. Newton Thomas Sigel ("Arranged Suspects", "Three Kings") provides the film with impressive shots of Canadian wilderness. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, director of the films "The Evil Dead" and "The Gift", appears here as Arkin's humble right-wing man. One more thing, this movie has calmed me that the camp does not have to be a place of bloody murder.
