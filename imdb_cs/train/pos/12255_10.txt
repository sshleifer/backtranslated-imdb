Because of Austen's films from the 1990s, it's my favorite, more than the "Persuasion," which transformed me into Austenian. Before I saw this "Emma," I saw two previous versions, but in one Emma everything seemed to be bad, rather like Lady Teazle, and in the other she seemed half as bad as a possible cheater, while here it seemed true , young and stupid and stubborn. Overall, I thought that the attitude and the atmosphere of the production brought the novel's spell extraordinarily well; it's really one of the sweetest and funniest things I've ever seen, more like a Christmas dream. The script is unusually well shaped, and the accessories of the adapter, as well as the light shaft that reveals Harriet to Emma in the church, are in harmony. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I'd expect, but I really liked it: he's bringing a distinct practical side of character, unlike Emma's affections, and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite fun. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse's character almost a Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emma is a protected woman is just as soft and as firm as she should be. As in the production of "Pride and Prejudice", care is taken to believe the possible combination of characters - in some cases, it is unique. For me, this production was still a joy.
