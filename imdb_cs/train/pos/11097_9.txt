Spoilers! From the moment I saw the film's local film criticism of this movie in a 10:00 news review, I wanted to see it. I do not remember who it was or which local reporter Omaha made a review, but the critic was very urgent that this film was too uncomfortable for the average church-walking Nebraskan. They showed a snippet of the scene where John Glover was about to kidnap Ann-Margret as she bathed in the pool. Glover's character encourages her to see how beautiful her body is, and so on, with many words that local stations need to adjust. I was addicted. One problem, however, was. I was only 13 years old at that time, and I had to wait a year before going out on the cable. Let's just say it's worth waiting for it! <br /> <br /> If my guilty pleasure ever happened, it's a movie. Calling this movie would be a huge understatement. The film focuses around a successful businessman who, after affair with a young woman, has frightened three small pieces. Roy Scheider, who is as efficient as ever, plays a poor guy who just wanted to strike a bit, and now finds himself at the mercy of three amazing villains. The character of John Glover is one of the most unforgettable carriages of all time. It is sometimes unclear, funny and always on the brink of crazy. Then there's Robert Trebor (nice name, by the way!) Leo, who is clearly overhead with this extortion. It's a buzzing, sweating, a coward who leads live naked models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, an embarrassing sociopath, who is all afraid of good reason. Who can forget about the excitation that gives Vanity a giant plush teddy bear? After dealing with the initial shock that he realizes what he has against him, Scheider turns the tables on to these creeps and takes control of it, the situation, that is until Glover does not follow his wife! The conflict takes place brutally, virtually the entire shot is shot, raped or thrown out. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I like such a movie. I should really conjure up, but not. Perhaps it is because these characters are all interesting and the story has plenty of possibilities that most movies will never try today. It is scary to think that the film industry for adults probably has more than a few characters, like Glover running in LA and looking for trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to smile. "Hey, you have a nice day!" <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of shots, cool cars, great dialogue (as well as the line in the opening statement) and decent acting. Lots of portraits of real porn stars. Look at Ron Jeremy, who plays Glover in a whirlpool with two chickens. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to say: How hot are women in this movie ??? Wow! Travolta married Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see that Vanity is naked at the time of becoming a born-again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her, except that it's an essential American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10 stars <br /> <br /> That's what the Hound says. <br /> <br /> Added 14.2.2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
