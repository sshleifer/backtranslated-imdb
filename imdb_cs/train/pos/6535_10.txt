It was a great movie! Although there were only about 15 people including myself, it was great! With my friend we laughed a lot. My mom even enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women, and there were about 20 years old and they seemed to enjoy it. I love the part where Corky and Ned are just like they like Nancy and things his cute lol. And when he gets on the road and Ned is there. Yeah, that was a great movie, even thinking that people underestimate it. Go ahead, I bet you will like it! I really liked it and so did my friend. <br /> <br /> People were so hard on this movie and they did not even see it. I'll bet he'll give them the chance to get the movie and actress next time. Everybody thinks, but if you have small children, it's still good. I'll probably marry my 7-year-old niece.
