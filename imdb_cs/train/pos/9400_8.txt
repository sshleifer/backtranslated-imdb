If a man in a white suit did it in America, can not you see that either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis is testing Sidney Stratton's Alec Guinness for the size? This is one of the best Aleks Guinness movies and certainly one of the best films ever made by Ealing Studios in the UK. It is so perfectly suited to the timeframe of the new government of work and the society it is trying to build. It is amazing how capital and work can be agreed upon in the crisis. Alec Guinness This humble little schnook man is obsessed with the idea of ​​being able to invent clothes that will never need cleaning that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter at the moment he touches the garment. <br /> <br /> He is a permanent boy and he succeeds. Of course, the consequences have not really been thought about the kind of impact clothing it will have on society. Eventually, they all chase him as if they were refugees, almost like Peter Lorre of M or Orson Welles at The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is a sign of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like this chase, as described in some of the serious films I mentioned, can be played with laughter. The dirty Guinness suit is not just white and repels stains, but it shines like a neon sign. In addition to Guinness's best performances, Cecil Parker comes from another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter, Ernest Thesiger, the largest garment manufacturer in the UK. Was he thinking about lending that Paramount suit from Ealing to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
