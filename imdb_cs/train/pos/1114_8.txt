At that time I remember being surprised and amused by this film. I told him the most important film I had seen in ten years, and I found out that I had come across people who say similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusually responsive behavioral notebook. And she confirmed the bitter adolescent personality we all had in a jealous, adult view of the world. Both together provide a surprising mix that may be too nervous for some viewers. (You wish you were not my brother, so I could!) Bernhards is looking for himself after returning to LA from New York, resulting in submerged attempts at different personalities (which are all badly suited), but enough of them include acting to appealed to the system of values ​​of "black imperative" that the real barometer of its resolve is whether it accepts black culture. (Nina Simone reminds me of her and she has an impressive, tightly built black lover in the movie). A pretty black girl attends shows and seems to commission Sandru's faux-blackness, but eventually rejects her. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics find it lucky to suffer for Christ, here Sandra shows his suffering in the hands of the black culture in which he longs for the place; as if she were honored with her rank and her rejection. It is the only value system in the world of films, outside of Bernhard's art. <br /> <br /> For nations whose main theme is racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of two themes dealt with in an atypical way.
