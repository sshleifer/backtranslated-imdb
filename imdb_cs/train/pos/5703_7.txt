I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this movie explores some of those deadly roads and 80s of movie noir topics I've enjoyed watching so I enjoyed it. Generally, however, it is the basic stupidity of the movie noir protagonist not cast well from female lead and her hero is almost neanderthal, and therefore kitch a warning.
