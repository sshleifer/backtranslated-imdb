It was a change of life, it really was! The Man on the Moon is an amazing experience he watched. The game was great, the story was great, and it was a great start for Reese Witherspoon's career. see how someone could not love this movie. Sure, it's not the best movie ever, though it was close, but it was very fun to watch and I even laughed at one of the jokes and lots of other little laughs. Of course, you have sometimes cried your heart, but this film was instructive and brightens your day, though you must have the story a bit depressing. I do not believe this movie has won at least one awards and I can not believe that they have seen such little people on this site. Take a look at this movie, if you do not, it will be touched.
