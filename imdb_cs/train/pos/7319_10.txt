Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes his troubles to his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. That's just the beginning of things that come from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays a doctor who has studied for years at Myers. He knows there is something else about him, something of a mysterious evil. This evil will not be occupied and can not be stopped. After escaping from Myers, he watches his younger sister. If she kills her, this misunderstood boy may be in trouble. But he seems to have trouble completing his sister when other people get in the way. He can export them while looking for another girl he needs. There were plenty of horror films that included teenagers who were hacking in pieces with a camouflaged or terrible killer. But this one started it all. If you think about it, most of the horror films we all remember are those that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chase around half naked girls. Well, if it was not for Halloween, those characters would not be scary our dreams when we were kids. Halloween director John Carpenter got a lot of horror films of the 1950s and combined everything he knew into a movie that scared the crowd by the end of the seventies. These films strengthened him as the director he watched and also began with the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl he pursued the camouflaged killer. The film may seem clich√© today, but that was not the case at that time. It was copied and pulled apart, but Halloween would always be a sharper deep teen horror movie. He still gives you the warmth to listen to Carpenter's exciting music, while we see that another marauder haunts the shady Michael Myers.
