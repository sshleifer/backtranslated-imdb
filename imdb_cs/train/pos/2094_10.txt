Surely, 65 years have passed since the last production of Thalberg. But IMDB members, come on, this movie is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 1930s! It's 10. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw in the Museum of Modern Art in New York around 1970 (I was a teenager). Pretty views with scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always interested, for me it was MGM filming in the best. What the audience felt when they saw the attack on the rabbits, the destruction of the man behind the house, the terrible poverty, and then the beauty of wealth. Last week, those who watched the academic prizes saw the "senior" Oscar winner Luis Rainer. How magnificent she saw an actress who has probably released one of the saddest and most impressed performances in history that has decided to return to celebration. Ok so you should not win a year earlier (Great Ziegfeld) but do not believe Luise. Calls were up to ten years old when they were released, and its dialogue was limited. But like Olan, its use of visual and vocal is unforgettable. On a large scale and touch, what more can a movie lover want!
