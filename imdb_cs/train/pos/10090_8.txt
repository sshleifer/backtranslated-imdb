I was ready for a touring tour but was pleased to find a quick script, underlying moral and excellent portraits from all actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, tension and beautiful cinematography - there's even a shot of the magnificent stone buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban . Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most famous and beautiful, before she recovered her hysterical anger, which remarked to her later work. All supporting players round it up and I'm interested in who trained all the elephants. Speaking of the Stone Buddha sequence, you really can prove it's Vivien Leigh in long shots. Its shape and the way it moves differs from Taylor. The only thing that appears in this sequence is the poorly executed process snapshots when the background moves too fast on horses for a walk. If you want a movie that is provocative is beautiful to watch and never get bored, spend a few hours with the Elephant Walk.
