It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film is about real life and the way medicines play an important role. Although this movie seems to be made from a low budget, I found it exciting to watch. Some may not like the story and say the script is lacking in direction. However, when one gets so deep into drugs as these characters, the direction is not life. I feel that this film is an accurate representation of what a person can do if he faces extreme temptations. Most occupation is new to this industry. But they all did it very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get into the character accordingly. I think this film could be a good tool that can be used to deal with a person or his close associate who is involved in drugs and seems to be spiraling out of control. This movie could only scare them enough to change their ways.
