WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) possessed by taking back his valuable hold, a repeating rifle from Winchester. Weapons are still changing hands and Stewart keeps on. Anthony Man's black-and-white 1950 effort is more a crime film than a traditional western, and cowboys often seem more like modern gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman with a dubious virtue heading for a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) who can marry. She ends up falling for Stewart, but not before she has passed a bit. Winters is the most complex figure in a movie full of unusual characters. Watch young Dan Durey as a sharp assassin and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Cheerful, miserable Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
