"The Man In The Moon" is a pretty good movie. It is very occasional and is very well done in all respects. I do not think the movie was terribly original, but what is happening today? The cast members all worked well with the relevant tasks. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a good job. Jason London also does a great job. And the only person I've recognized is Sam Waterston, who has done a fantastic job. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trant) a lot. Sometimes it seemed to be the kind of father you're afraid of, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you've been touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws on you, then you should look at this movie. I would suggest reading the conspiracy synopsis, and if it sounds like something you are interested in, then go for it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, -Chris
