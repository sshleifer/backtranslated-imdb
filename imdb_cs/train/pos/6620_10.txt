If the answer to this question is yes, you should enjoy this excellent movie. I just saw it two hours ago in Paris (where the film is taking place) and I still feel the enormous trauma I got in the back of my eyes ... What a visual shock! I've never seen such a beautiful black and white photo and so drastic change in how to make animated movies. I firmly believe it will exist before and after the "Renaissance", much like what we have seen with Pixar movies or the experience of Akira and GhostInTheShell. It is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films, and I hope that this French initiative (a small unfamiliar French studio with a few young people who have had a dream called "Renesance" ...) will receive the success and recognition they deserve. Vive to France!
