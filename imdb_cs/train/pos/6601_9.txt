This movie is absolutely stunning. New Blade Runner - The future noir is the most gravelled. The vision of Paris is excellent, both recognizable and visionary, with great views, splashing and futuristic virtual reality. The story line is quite simple, a little surprise, but that's not what I like most about the movie. It's a visual treatment. <br /> <br /> Done in 3D and rendered in black and white (without gray!) with only one short point of color, it is less sharp to the eye than it sounds. There are many "artistic" footage from the camera - details and strange views - but it just adds the temperament of the film. Overall, you will get the impression of a graphic novel in a shot format. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the film was roto-skosen, such was the level of animation and the high detail of the facial expressions. But unlike the "Darkly Scanner" - which suffers (or is even improved) by the inconsistent character of the definition (just follow the way some hair changes its shape!) - Renaissance is consistent and accurate throughout the text. When the character is in detail, additional details and texture can be seen, but when they are in the center of the picture or beyond, details are omitted but not at the expense of character definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only downside of the movie is that in one comment we say that it's a one-time project. Such a pity, as I would like to see more of this futuristic history of film and noir and especially in this top-of-the-art graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English oak is also great. <br /> <br /> Everyone in all great film and highly recommended.
