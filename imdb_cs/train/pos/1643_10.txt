This is a movie that everyone should see if you want to see great acting. Mr. Torn and Mrs Farrel are doing a great job. I think they should have it on TV again so they can enjoy a new audience. Wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> It gives you a real sense of what pioneers have to go through physically and emotionally. A great unheard of movie. <br /> <br /> It was when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I've always thought of her as a comic, but it's definitely not a comedy, and she's just great. There are very few dialogues, but it only looks more real. Mr. Torn as always is a great presence, and only his breathing has a great feeling. I have to see the movie.
