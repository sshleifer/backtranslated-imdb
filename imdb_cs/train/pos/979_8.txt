Quiet ranger Robert Sterling is on losing the war with his ruthless neighbors, that's until the famous outlaw Robert Preston emerges from the blue to match the pitch. Soon it will start to go too far, causing a feeling of unrest in Sterling, especially when his son begins to pray with a corrupt criminal. Sundowners is a carefully tame, harsh and surprisingly tough picture with Preston's outstanding performance. Here he meets the wrong version of Shane, until the real character of the rancher is revealed. Most movie guides and videotapes spoil the surprise! <br /> <br /> Rounding out the cast are Chill Wills, Jack Elam and John Drew Barrymore's debut, which became more famous for his offspring than his acting.
