24 is supposed to be the best spy / adventure television series ever broadcast. The whole idea of ​​telling the story in 24-hour real-time is brilliant. The style of filming and stimulation is what hurts us to watch. And Jack Bauer is one of the biggest protagonists in the TV series for a long time. I rated it together with Simpsons and The X Files, my three favorite TV series. This first episode begins with a plot to murder US Senator David Palmer, who is also president. Bauer is summoned to his office to find out who's behind it, and at the same time he introduces his daughter's path to the immature after she fled her bedroom. It begins with the adventure in the best political style, and the best thing about it is that it always happens in real time, making this TV series a true creation of originality at a time when almost every television program shows us the same things again and over and over again.
