In 1994, Eric Monte performed the classic T.V Good Times show. JJ has always been my favorite and I like to look at Reruns at T.V Land. Jimmie Walker was always a star, not Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a bit jealous of the popularity of Jimmy Walker, who won millions of fans to sit and watch Good Times. The show would be dead if JJ was not there to save her with her always Kool Aid attitude. KOOL AID beer was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it was over. Instead of 1974-1979 it should have lasted longer, as in the 1980s, when I was just growing up.
