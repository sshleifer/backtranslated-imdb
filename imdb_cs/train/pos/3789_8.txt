Bravo to the Czechs, it seems that their once powerful film industry is awakening from post-communist sleep. Loners is a comedy with all the elements you would expect in the modern production of "Hollywood" minuses of garbage that have been in the genre over the past few years. Excellent soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful Prague cityscape, rather little. The story consists of several stories that often overlap and overlap and are basically collages of fate, destiny, desires ... This is a group of urban youths up to the thirties through different situations, from everyday life and leisure activities to after a career and obsession. And it's stellar. The movie is really a point where the whole theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) was not about 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience this with modern Hollywood productions? Although the main actor is outstanding (especially the upcoming Macedonian star Labin Mitevska in the role of an immigrant who faces all the known difficulties), I must emphasize George Machacek for his excellent idea of ​​Jakub, a constantly stoned bohemian, whose brain is heavily influenced by things he blows when he landed in many fun situations. Conclusion: Missing this! You have a lot to offer.
