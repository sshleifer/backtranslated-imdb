Big surprise, probably because I expected it to suck. The shows were quite reluctant, although they all agreed that the concept was gold: the man finds out that his new girlfriend is superhero and finds out when he wants to break up with her that it's a little Psycho. I was still waiting for it to collapse, but it never really was. Sure, there are not so many of his amazing assumptions as possible, and he decides to be short when it would be better to expand the universe of the film. But I can not blame it. Uma Thurman is great as a bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And after several years of dislike, I found that Luke Wilson could be perfectly perfect when he was occupied as a schub. He received two of the best comedic performances in 2006 (the second in an almost unreleased idiocracy). When I first had sex with Thurman, I broke completely. It's one of the most entertaining sexual scenes ever. My only real complaint is that G-Girl is doing a little psycho as if it's almost unbelievable. Maybe with some backgrounds, I could get it better. But I can forgive his shortcomings because I had a really good time watching it. Underestimated, of course.
