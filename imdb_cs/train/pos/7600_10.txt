After I was completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there'd ever be another show that would come closer to being as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is magical! I love this show absolutely and I can not turn it off. The richness of the characters, the complexity of the land, the beautiful setting are amazing. I am totally and completely addicted. I do not know how the creators do, but every character will touch me very deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything to the core! I have no cable, so I rented a line at Netflix. When I put it, I watch all the episodes at once, and I'm sad when it's over. I can not wait for the next drive to come to my house. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen!
