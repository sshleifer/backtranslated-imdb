I look at everybody. <br /> <br /> It's not better than amazing (Strictly Ballroom_, _Shall we dance? _ (Japanese version), but it's totally respectful and pleasantly different in parts. <br /> <br /> I am a teacher of English and some of the ignorance of the language I find it somewhat disturbing, for example: "the name should shout not watch." How it moves "Since the film titles ignore grammar?" There is nothing inherently wrong about English grammar in the Caribbean It's just not the Canadian standard English grammar Comment on the dialogue seems to me that I have given the headlines because I'm a Canadian English standard that I had problems understanding all that was not all that hard and it gave a distinctly different taste as the next step movies I was so American. <br /> <br /> I loved that this movie was in Toronto and she really wished it was even clearer. She loved the heroine was so atypical I liked the stepped routines, I liked my mother, I felt that many of the questions in the film were dealt with much more gently than they were for dance films. In summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then it's decent. If you have problems with superiority about English grammar, you have grown up, talk, your narrow mind may have trouble with this movie.
