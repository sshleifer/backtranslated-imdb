While Urban Cowboy did not moan with the same testosterone you could find at a rooftop, he gave an accurate look at this day and age in Texas. I also think that really criticizing this film would have to live in time and in the relative place where it was created. It was good music, fun times and yes, a few "harsh and crash" at honny tonk roadhouses. The relationship between Bud and Sissy, like "two ships passing through the night", was well conceived. When Pam took the note Sissy wrote to Bud, the tragedy of many real life novels was heard. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the actor and the crew worked great. I thought the screenplay was well written and directed. Scott Glenn was to get Oscar for best actress.
