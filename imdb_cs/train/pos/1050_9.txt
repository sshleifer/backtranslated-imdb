This amazing document gives us a glimpse into the lives of brave women in the Cameroon judiciary - police, lawyers and judges. Despite the enormous difficulties - lack of resources, desperate people's poverty, multiple languages ​​and multiple legal precedents, depending on the country's region and the religious or ethnic origin of the defendants and defendants - these brave, strong women make a difference. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a truly inspirational film that restores a bit of faith in humanity. In spite of the atrocities we see in the movie, justice is served by these passionate and hardworking women. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie gets to the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
