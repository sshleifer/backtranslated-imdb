Paul Greengrass definitely rescued the best Bourne for the last! I have heard that many people complain about filming this film and some even compared the camera style with the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding? Well, it was not bad at all. I think it helps action scenes feel more realistic, which I would like to come up with through a highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I really did not notice it. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damon was really satisfied with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it's a really good thing. In fact, Jason Bourne will be making this payment. Damon also has great support in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the secret organization of the CIA. Though the movie is full of great car hunters and nonstop events, they have managed to keep a fair amount of character development in their all happening. This film stands far above the other two Bourne films and is definitely one of the best films of the 2007 summer season!
