Kudos to Cesar Montano to revive Cebuano! Panaghoy with Suba is very good - it has drama, action, romance and a scene that makes you laugh. While the story is not such an original (love triangle - or do four-fold love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as a lord), its presentation is cool, especially using the original language - Biski Filipino, Nipongo for Japanese and English for American. <br /> <br /> This movie will be one of the best Pinoy movies this year. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
