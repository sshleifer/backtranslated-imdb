Man, I loved this movie! It really takes me back when I was a kid. These were the days when teachers were still displaying drums on drums, and if you were good, the film would slowly turn over to watch how it is playing back. I still remember one of the opening lines ... "Tutazem was his name and he was orphaned, lived with his sister so in the village." This is a great movie for children and as a permanent balloon. At the end, the other Indian boys in the village join the feathers to Tutazem, and he himself becomes an eagle. It will be as he always wanted. He ascends to the heavens.
