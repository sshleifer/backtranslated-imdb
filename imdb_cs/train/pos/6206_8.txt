I am admired by Hal Hartley's films, especially Henry Fool in 1997. "Fay Grim" is the sequel to this film and has a similar style and sense of humor. But the task is completely different. Fay Grim (famously played by iconic Parker Posey) tries to trace his notebooks about a missing man and finds himself in the middle of plotting and espionage. Support for the cast (most people from the first film, like Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and the very welcome return of 90's indie-sweet Elina Lowensohn) is excellent and the film has a lot of surprises. The director claims he is part of the "Star Wars" trilogy that serves as the "Empire Strikes Back" series. If that's true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I hope I do not have to wait for another ten years.
