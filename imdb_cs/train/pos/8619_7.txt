First of all, I think I remember somehow that I saw this movie in my early childhood, I could not read the headlines, and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked it. If you are not able to at least partially suspend your skeptical attitude towards adults and accept your seven old seven, you can avoid this film. That means, when I watched the restored 137-minute version on DVD, I must say I liked it, though not as much as when I was seven (I remembered the end). <br /> <br /> There are aspects of the movie that are worth the critique, the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes both have really comic moments, my favorite is the contrast between the scenes that have taken place in the last 10 minutes and the curious choice of music support listen to the lyrics). <br /> <br /> For the action film, a lot of attention is paid to the personal stories of some soldiers and to the social dynamics of the team, as their time spent on this route has demanded. By the end of the movie I decided it was a good thing when I was seven though the "relationship" of the guff was a bad thing. The action movie is also plenty of pleasing bloody action, especially a few epic battle scenes between the front and the hordes of the Shogun era fighters. Movie makers have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and allow him to be funny. I thought this was a wonderful aspect of the movie when I was little, and I'm not ashamed to say I'm still doing it. I also like the fact that modern soldiers generally do not spend a film of walking on egg shells trying to avoid time changes, have heavy machine guns, minometers, rocket launchers, tank and helicopter and are hell bent by doing feudal Japan . Which is what I would like any IMDb user to do in the shoes. In short, the films that are worth seeing, are curious to see that there are no more films created with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hard hints about why the film like GI Samurai is so unique.
