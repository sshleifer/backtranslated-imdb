I am sure that the film about the amazing life story of Carl Brashear was shot. Coming as in civil rights, Brashear has become an inspiration for people of all minority groups who are unwilling to meet the expected status. Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads by example of the behavior he chose. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who has integrated baseball and made it stick to his character and behavior. Like Brashear, Gooding knows he does not want his life, which his father Carl Lumbly has, is really clear he has more life than he. After World War II, the Navy still has its limitations. A black man can only be a chef or a valet officer, his real combat parts have been denied him. This is not good enough for Gooding, who wants to become a diver on the deep-sea navy. After he got Gooding at Bayonne diving school in New Jersey, chief executive officer Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some remnants of prejudice, yet he is a hero and one who can be inspired if one can go through racial divisions. The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they know each other, they both become Men of Honor. Other good performances are Charlize Theron as the wife of De Niro and Hal Holbrook as head of the diving school, a guy the navy just wished to retire because of why you will see. Honor is an inspirational story about people who have the courage to save and the ability to change.
