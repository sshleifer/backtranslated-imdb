I found the film "Holes" by hearing from people that it was not typical for Disney that both children and adults got into the story. People, I'll tell you I'm not disappointed. "Holes" is based on the novel by Sachar and follows the adventures of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent to a strange youth camp in the desert. He gets involved with a man nicknamed Zero and together they set out on an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and fun story. I did not know what to expect when I watched it. It was interesting to see how the story combines as pieces of the puzzle. The boys who played juvenile delinquents were all very entertaining and Jon Voight was just cheerful as Mr. Sire. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
