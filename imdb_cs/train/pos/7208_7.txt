Count Sidney Bruhl (surprisingly beyond Michael Caine) would kill the hit game. Enter a young young wonder (solid Reeve) who has just written this game. To this Bruhl's too hysterical woman (greatly played by Cannon) and German psyche (very funny Irene Worth) and you have won a wonderful funny film tension. <br /> <br /> "Standards," Deathtrap "is a very capable, abbreviated comic ride based on the amazing game of Ira Levin, the artists of course have their day with material, especially with Caine, which delivers top-notch lines. The film loses a little steam in the middle and the end is much less satisfying than the funny one in the original game, but overall "Deathtrap" is solid, well-behaved and exciting fun.
