I disagree with the previous comment on this movie. I think it was cute and fun and it had a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap lad to be cool. You can be smart and nice and elegant at once. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was great for the target audience. All my wife, daughter (10) and I all thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. She also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original mysteries of Nancy Drew, which I'm sure will love a lot as I loved Hardy's boy. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading immediately. I can not think of a better result of this film than to attract interest in this classic series.
