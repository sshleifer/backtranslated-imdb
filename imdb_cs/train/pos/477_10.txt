Hello to everyone that I am a chess enthusiast from the age of 6. I thought I was quite shocked by chess, but hopefully not as the central character of this movie. is the real chess player Curt von Bardeleben, who committed suicide in 1924. He is known for the game he played against Steinitz, where he played the beautiful combination of Steinitz. Instead of resigning, simply leaving the tournament, he never returned. Unfortunately, the social incapacity of a central figure is the treatment of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess I suppose this is a big sacrifice and sometimes you end up in an unbalanced way in other areas of life. The main example is the chess legend of Bobby Fisher. Even though he was a genius, he was also very concerned about in many ways. The film features a world championship match between the Grand Master of Italy and Luzhin. The format is a knockout that has actually been the world's governing body, Fide, sometimes employing itself as a format itself - from 128 players to 2 in the final. But it was a group knockout - which also shows a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each other. Position before postponement is in itself a fascinating chess puzzle. In fact, I've made youtube a video about exploring the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best Wish of Tryfon
