Here's a decent, gruesome impact from the mid-1970s on the NYC Gate of Hell, which becomes old brown-haired. There seems to be a lot of layers of hell, but of course this unconscious model decides that she needs some space from her friend / fianc√©e, so she just chooses one that is hiding like a nice and affordable apartment. He meets some strange neighbors and even attends a birthday party for a cat. When she meets a real estate agent because they hear strange sounds at night, she finds she and the old priest are OFFERING to be the only tenants. Who! And who are all those strangers? Her boyfriend (the slimy lawyer who plays Chris Sarandon) began to move and found that things were not as it sounded and not a long shot. It has some decent creepy scenes, and the thought of the grumpy old people, who are her "sometimes" neighbors other than what appears to be, is quite interesting. A bit of a decent gore, and even a show of less ordinary people at the end, they do a decent watch, and while I've seen it on TV many times, the vague version of DVD is of course much better. It's not a bad little horror animation, maybe a good accompaniment to Burnt Offerings. 8 out of 10.
