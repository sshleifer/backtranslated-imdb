"Spin it!" The 90s opened with Disney's clever disciple, "TaleSpin", a television cartoon series that featured characters from the book "Jungle Book". Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly to the sea duck, as you have never seen before: from Cape Suzette, to Louie, the mountains, the jungle, water, volcanoes, adventure, treasure, fun in one action pack of cartoon adventures !!!!! <br /> This was my favorite and my family. This was running on Disney in the afternoon during the first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996 before I got the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: today there are DVD !!!!! Experience the fun and excitement of "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br />
