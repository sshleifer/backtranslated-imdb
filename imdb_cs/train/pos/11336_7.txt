Answer: Despite the fact that this movie was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, sillier and more irrational than any zombie who ever sent the country. Playing in this independent movie is quite good, despite a less than stunning script. It takes a pretty good actor to deliver a rewritten, clich√© line and make the sound vaguely believable. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, is performing extremely well. Fortunately, this film is better than dialogue. Try it, especially if you are not a monster fan. This is not a horror movie. Although all adult women are quite monstrous, and although all adult males behave as if their brains were consumed in some earlier zombie movie, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for adult adults. this time is much better than the sum of his parts.
