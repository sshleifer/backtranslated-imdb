It's usually not a show (except The OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!) But after some episode of Reunion I was not disgusting. <br /> <br /> I can not even say how I thought it was a time interval that was against Bush last night, because I really enjoyed an episode of 1987 that will be broadcast next Thursday. Again, this conflict was disadvantageous because it is a new show but needs to build and follow a second episode that affects a week, killing some dynamics. <br /> <br /> This means that TV does not always be an Emmy worthy to be enjoyable. I do not expect RÃ©union to take home some prizes, but I expect he will be able to take the whole season. Watch the first few episodes of the beloved show a few years later? Sometimes you're wondering how you ever played. Character building takes some time. One episode for each year is, in my view, amazing. The only other show I can remember is that I'm doing something like this is 24, with every episode being an hour ... and having a full year is more realistic than a full day experience! Please indicate this shot. Relax in artistic form ... it's just a TV!
