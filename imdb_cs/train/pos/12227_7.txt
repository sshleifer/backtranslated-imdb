I was looking for it after seeing the cheerful and linguistically demanding "Clueless" (1995), Alice Silverstone's most famous effort since the beginning of her film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should help improve most of the film projects. In fact, everyone in the movie does a good job. The only disappointment that I think the film has for me is the unpleasant "feeling" about some scenes, based on the need to run a rather uncompromising, adult theme as part of what begins as a school adventure. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good at this. It does well with the naive enthusiasm and the growing agitation that affects Mary Giordano as she manages to the truth behind serial murders. I think its MG characterization is a few miles away. The conclusion of the story is that he is continuing his career in law enforcement. It could be really interesting if Elder Silverstone once again visited Giordan in a time of crisis later in the life of an officer. Just an idea! True Crime shows his director in good light. Pat Verducci also has a written credit. I do not know about any other film work PV has done. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. Like most productions, it has this very unknown supportive cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is barely so. Over the past decade, he seems to have managed to secure an impressive number of scenes. I remember seeing him recently in "Carriers" (1998), which took place for a television show with a military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic American TV comedy "Who's the Chief" may also be interested in "Carriers," because the lead player is Judith Light, who remembers with a lot of affection due to the lengthy involvement in the show. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" might not work, but it's okay. I think it's a fun story that's worth seeing.
