Kudos to the writers of this film to create a very impressive drama. The development of the curious nature is taught by a well-trained and well-trained writing team. A member of the audience can not help, but he feels he has to make a terrible emotional decision that brains the brain against the libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the characters themselves, although her predictions are seldom verified. Credit is also due to creators who breathe life into the environment. Wood-shop changes as the film unfolds, with its own features, disorders, a series of highly charged relationships, and, of course, a fate inexorably linked to other principles. <br /> <br /> Make sure you catch it at your local artistic association.
