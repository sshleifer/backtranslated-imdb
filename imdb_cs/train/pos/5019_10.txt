Hello by Jessica, I'm Italian! Some time ago I saw this movie: "For the First Time" with Corin German German. It was the story of Michel and Mary Margaret. I need to know the title of the most important love scene in Michael's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy, this film has not been programmed for many years and I do not know how to find a song. Many thanks for helping me! I love this movie! It is very romantic! Soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
