Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that the film does not have to tell the story that it is enough to create an experience that will allow the viewer to take the raw materials and make them what they are. <br /> <br /> The thought of the most nonlinear film seems to be the older man living on the Franco-Swiss border, a man who is dedicated to his dogs who still have lover but whose heart condition is increasingly threatening his life . He has a son with a small family who rarely meets him, but when he finds he needs a heart transplant, he decides to go to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and renew a long lost relationship with a son who, years ago created by Tahiti women. What Denis does with this sketch of the story uses her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the magnitude of nature, human interaction with humans against animals, etc. A lot of time when the movie does not make sense is because we try to combine too hard all the leading points they are placed in beautiful pictures in front of us. Life is something like this: we look, see, observe, integrate, process and do what we want. <br /> <br /> When using this form of film making (like in the beautifully beautiful 'Beau Travail'), Claire Denis has developed signing techniques. Whether the viewer finds the final product reward or not has much to do with our individual ways of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers consider it too long a very discourse. Maybe it will look again, it will change. Grady Harp
