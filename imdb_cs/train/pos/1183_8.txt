The man adapts to life after 45 years of marriage. It must also address the problem of the Tulip's family dairy cow, which refuses to allow it to milk. Until then he will introduce his wife, who gave Tulip milk. The Tulip is based on the true story told by the Griffith family about the generation of her grandparents. The film is a nostalgic look back on the fading way of life, where people still feel a sense of responsibility for themselves, set in a lush green Victorian (Australian, not era) landscape. <br /> <br /> The writer and director Griffiths obviously has more ambitions in both areas, and this multiple 15-minute shortcut is a fine starting with her reel.
