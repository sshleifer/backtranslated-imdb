VIVAH is in my 2006 BEST FILM! DOBA !!. In his book is one of the top 100 films EVER Made in Bollywood. It's sad that this movie has not had so many reviews and is not so popular. <br /> <br /> VIVA is again a real success from the director who is doing it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj again pulled out the brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> These are the easiest and cutest movies I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP and later Dhoom 2, who even defeated Don in the matter, I finally see a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. I do not know why Bollywood moves away from the beautiful culture we have and we make Hollywood remake of stylish bullshit movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and is related to the Indian system of organized marriage that I would like to be part of. Our system, which teaches us to listen to the elders, to follow them and, of course, to listen to their thoughts is so great to see in this movie! Of course, there is no force in choosing a partner in life, and it should be a brief encounter between the couple and his decision how great he is in this film. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie ..... VIVAH is the story The Way Between Beautiful Time of Engagement and Marriage. The stage when the guy meets the girl! .... They both understand each other. She will try to guess whether they can love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and different ones that occur during marriage. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is great in the movie ....... Shahid is all right ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are amazing! The tracks are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ... Overall, you MUST see for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition, and I definitely do! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... Just have to say one word ....... BLISS!
