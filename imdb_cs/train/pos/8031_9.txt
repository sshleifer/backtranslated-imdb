This is one military runway that I like very much! Tom Berenger plays Military Assassin Thomas Beckett. This sea voyage is not meaningless in your face, and no questions have been asked about the person who did the job. There you have Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT form of D.C., working for the government and accepting orders only from them. Who needs bureaucrats? I do not! When these two are paired, the sparks should fly. And how. But Beckett teaches a young bureaucrat how it works. When a second sniper hits, it's a wit against wits, a mouse against a mouse, a shooter against shooters. And when the sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put the politics aside and save him. Whoever needs politics when you are like Beckett, he takes orders from no one but himself, plays according to rules, not books, and despite the politics, mutual respect is raised. The film was a direct hit. Bach. Reviews 4 out of 5 stars.
