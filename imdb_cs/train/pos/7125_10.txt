Goodnight Mr Tom is so beautifully shot and beautifully realized. The book is not entirely true, but must it be? Not at all. John Thaw is fascinating like Tom Oakley. His transformation from cruel to care was so well realized that he is more credible than Scrooge in the Christmas Seal. After Morse Inspector, it's the best Thaw time. He was seriously fulfilled by young Nick Robinson, who made a thoroughly convincing display of the evacuated traumatic abusive relationship with his mother. The script and the music made it worth buying, and you also see playing the organ. Amazing! The most developed scene was that Willie learned about Zak's death, and then told Tom about his late family who had died of scarlet fever. Buy it, it will be nice! 10/10 Bethany Cox
