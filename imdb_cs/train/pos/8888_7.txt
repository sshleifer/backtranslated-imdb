This movie started slowly, and then gained pace towards the center. However, the fact that the film ran over two nights interrupted this momentum at its peak. The second part was really interested, but then she retreated to a mere pathetic end. Do you play football in the yard? Indeed, can it be even more faint and hot? Now I hear plans for a similar film based on the 70s. I will not make much effort to get it if it's like "the 60s."
