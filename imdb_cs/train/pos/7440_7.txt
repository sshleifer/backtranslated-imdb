He just saw the movie, and it was terrible that the people who spoke during the movie sounded just like the actors. The film had its moments but also lagged behind and was rather bad. Everything should be a farce, but once you see the sad lives of the people in the movie, you think "People are all around us". All attempts to get audience compassion are interrupted because actors are doing one stupid thing after another. On the plus side there are some great (and fun) insults. I think I'll wait for the video - but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes his shirt during the movie! (not a nice look!)
