It's a nice movie, even if the assumption is stupid. It was some pleasure. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull roles in this type of movie (another example is Joe vs. Volcano). This is partly a star. Walter Matthau, of course, had this ability too, and he really got into the role of making fun, good-natured Einstein. I suppose you could say that they are both good at showing love figures, although they are loving in different ways (loving young women vs. love helmsman).
