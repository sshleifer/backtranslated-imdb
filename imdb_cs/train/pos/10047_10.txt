For all the poor people who did everything before complaining about dialogue, budget, this and that ... who wants to hear it? If you missed the point of this beautiful movie, it's your loss. The rest of us who love this movie deeply do not care what you think. I am a silent person who has seen thousands of films in his life and he is in his own book in his book. It was not a documentary or a complete factual description of what happened at night. It's the most amazing love story ever to try. I know it's cynical 90th and millennia all in tizzy, but come on. Someone on this board has complained that he has made too much money! How lame it is? In every civilized country on the planet, he produced money bundles and is the highest gross film on the planet. With this time, I will like to stand up with this majority. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I'm done.
