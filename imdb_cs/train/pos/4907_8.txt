A nicely crafted and imaginative production refreshing without clich√©s, this rather picky affair tells the story of a close friendship that develops between man and boy in less than ideal conditions: a man escaped a convicted man who kidnapped his youth as hostages. Experimentally directed by Alan Gibson with a gentle sense of balanced narrative motion, the film brings freshness in almost every scene like the criminologist Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), who believes his dismissal summons was particularly undeserved, creating an intricate but ultimately successful escape his spontaneous nature gets to the fore as he escapes to the children's seat near the lake. Often a bursting song or dance in a few steps, the frightening Steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and as the police closes to the inevitable conflict, the coupled couple is seen as very similar in his responses to the forms (Lindsay Wagner), who was commissioned to support a keen Police Lieutenant (James Coburn), who is in charge of the search for Steckert and his "prisoners". It's a stunning story worth telling, a fast-growing and romantic adventure that capitalizes on Harris' capital performance, a gentle turn from Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as a catchy boy with a matching mood score by Wilfred Josephs top-notch cinematography by Frank Watts with all the shots shot in the beautiful autumn province of Ontario.
