I spent years looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs) to show it to my children. The movie is fun and Spike and his band members show why they are the best musicians in the industry. They must be so good they play this dementia. I like it and I recommend it for movie lovers of all ages. The film is about the turn of a century fire house, with a crew of disorganized who are firefighters and band separations (when not fighting fires). There are usual running gags, plus Spike Jones' argument and his orchestra. Also comic relief was provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and direct man Hugh O'Brien.
