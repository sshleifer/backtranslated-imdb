I saw this movie in the sixth grade around Christmas time and I was really excited to see him and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was really excited because I really love George C. Scott! When me and my class are watching this movie, I was really into it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was absolutely wonderful! This is the best version of Charles Dickens's classic novel I've seen so far! George Scott's performance as Scrooge is something else, I thought it was a perfect choice, it was Scrooge, it's definite Scrooge! I saw two different versions of Christmas Carols, the other is with Patrick Stewart, but it's better! <br /> <br /> What is really great, it's acting, I thought actors were wonderful, they were all ghosts, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone could not find someone better than you guys are doing! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! It's definitely Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they would find anyone better! I do not think they would find someone better to replace someone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably a definitive film adaptation of classic by Charles Dickens and I really think you will agree, you will think this movie is wonderful! I will probably have to buy this movie on DVD because I thought it was absolutely wonderful! I highly recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of Christmas Carolina. <br /> <br />
