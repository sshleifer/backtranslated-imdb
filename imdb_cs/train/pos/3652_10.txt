I started watching this TV movie on Sunday afternoon, and I thought it was just another stupid post-disaster. I was wrong. Pandora's Clock is an intelligent political thriller that is far behind the quality of most TV films. It could easily make your debut on the big screen. The cast is excellent, including veterans Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga, in one of her best performances, has become a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Jane Leeves of Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is convincing all over the world. In fact, the last hour is so full of twists and strains that you can not leave your place for a moment. If you can see this movie, invest time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
