If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys, or if you have any interest in seeing the true, non-cartoon, America's "right American" side, then the Giant rider detonates deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is "unreal", an easy term if anyone exists, but it is very useful if you can derive it from some form of literal meaning - it's a 100% material document but with all the dramas of the opera , and the obvious sense of love, expert and knowledge brought in by the direction and narrative of Stacy Peralta, this film professionally leads you from swelling to a great wave, while keeping you in a complete fascination with everything that gives you the privilege of seeing. <br /> <This movie is a symphony, created just like Beethovens 9, which beautifully begins with its prelude in Hawaii, deeply attracted to human emotions in Santa Cruz and ends in excitement, triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamiltons feats, again in Hawaii . br /> <br /> Like classical music; like Beethoven's 9th, Ride of the Valkyries, or Barbers Adagio for strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Believe me.
