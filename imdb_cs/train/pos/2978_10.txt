BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's an off-the-wall movie starring South Park creators of Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two pet friends who create sport on their driveway that becomes a state of national feeling. Most gags are really cheerful, but the funniest part of the movie is when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opposition. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the wildest things. One defect in this movie is that the pace is too fast, and after looking around for half an hour, I asked, "What's this?" Another cheerful part of the film was how Joe and Doug constantly harassed Squeak, who is used to a little boy. BASEketball is a comedy classic with some very sensitive lines and is very fun to watch!
