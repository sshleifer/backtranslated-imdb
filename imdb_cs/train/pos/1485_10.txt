This movie contains personalities who play so deliciously on their tracks, I love the final when no one knows what to do with their lives but it is great when you see and realize that the priest is right to go for two so what do other people do? The film brings you to a new life, to experience, to dream with the other person and to achieve those dreams. It will also show you life itself, hard as it is. But it gives you the choice of what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. The movie he was doing to me worked well. I bought the film by the way;) Be careful.
