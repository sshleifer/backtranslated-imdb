I was delighted to watch the short film "The Cure" by the first director, Ryan Jafri. What really impressed me is working with camera and music. I think many young artists (just as I am one of them) would experience hard times with cinematography when they started producing Indians. We see that output is not exactly what we recorded or under our ambitions. But this film, the directorial debut from a young director, worked very well on the screen. Camera motion, color, lighting, composition all contribute to the story and emotion of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> But I still have to admit that I am not a fan of v / o (narration), especially when the film is a more mature narrative instead of shots and cuts. My personal feeling about some narrative is, my guess was that the narrator tried a bit too hard. So the energy moves the audience back from the emotions of the film. Overall, it's a pretty short movie, I saw the director's entry. Journey, Ryan! Greetings from China, we look forward to the next. <br /> <br />
