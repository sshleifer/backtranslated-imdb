A bizarre horror film full of famous faces, which has stolen Cristina Raines (later "Flamingo Road" TV) as a nice but rather unstable model with a rubbery smile that is paid for her suicide attempts by guarding the gate to hell! Raines modeling scenes are well captured, mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's friend, but when Raines moves into the terrible Brooklyn Heights brownstone (occupied by a blind top-level priest), things really start to cook. The neighbors, including the fantastically frantic Burgess Meredith and the stealthy couple Sylvie Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are devilish crowds, and Eli Wallach is very entertaining as a clever police detective. The film is almost crossing "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, "The Sentinel" is amusingly creepy, full of beats brought by director Michael Winner, who thinks of a thoughtful descending end with skill. *** 1/2 from ****
