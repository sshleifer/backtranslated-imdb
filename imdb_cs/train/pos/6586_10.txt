Jeremy Brett is just the very best Holmes who is approaching, and of course the best adaptation to the story of Conon-Doyle. The length of the adaptation includes some new landscapes that fit well into the surrounding drama and increase hatred for Milverton. Outstanding performances all around, especially from Robert Hardy, and Brett and Hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles, make it a great piece of drama.
