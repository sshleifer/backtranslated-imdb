Dudley Moore is fantastic in this widely unknown classics. This movie is a very humorous film that relies heavily on acting talent. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgood, Liga Minnelli and several others, this movie could be a disaster. He is not always well shot, and sometimes he has some very lean music that tries to force his mood ("psycho" -like music on wedding fight), but he can overcome it. The figure of Arthur is cheerful with drunken notes. But he develops well into a more mature, well-rounded figure when he learns to live his own free will. But the end is rather nasty. I will not let it go, but it could be better. It is many times to be seen.
