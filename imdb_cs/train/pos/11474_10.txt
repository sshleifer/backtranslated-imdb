This movie is for ages. First, I have to say that after seeing it once, it has become one of my favorite films. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) created a real piece of art. Where 99.9% of movies are purely fun nowadays, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us reality, gives us a teaching aid to let us know why this has happened. Ordinary media spin and rotate, but Ben Coccio looks right in front of school and can go where no other media has ever been in the minds and hearts of two young men who want to kill their classmates. While it is certainly graphic and frightening, how can it not be? The gloves fall out, the lie and the sugar coating of our media masters roll out aside and we are taken to a place where we find the truth about what has happened. Sometimes it's not just a free screw, as everyone likes, no, sometimes hate, and isolation is deeper, more human, it shows us that these guys are us and us. The company left them behind and the consequences are scary and real. Respect and love your neighbor. A lesson we should all know, thank you for taking this film, Mr. Coccio, with the great expectation that you will continue your film production.
