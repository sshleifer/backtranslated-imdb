This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie. It was my Friday night movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was the only one. I first saw this film with Aunt Brend and sister Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolt, and Sissy was my new best friend. I have read a lot of comments about why God left Sissy and how Sissy must "learn to act". But let's go back and look at this for a moment: SPOILER - My performance of the film now, not when I was eight, is that Bud & Sissy has a relationship to the worst because it makes him crazy when Gilley is riding a bull . They get into a huge fight. Bud is trying to jealise Sissy by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then thinks that two mistakes make a right and Wes asks her if she "needs some help". They all are on the dance floor like stupid buddies when Bud asks Pam, "When are you going to bring me home and rape me?" Pam replies, "When you're ever ready for Cowboy." Bud then returns home with Pam to his apartment in downtown Houston. Which dad bought for her with oil and "it all means". He's the one who cheats on Sissy. Sissy waits for Buda when he returns home tomorrow. Sissy is an ONE leaving Bud. Then it's up to Bud to make Sissy know he's a real "cowboy" and win it back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has their own! I love this movie. And believe it or not, I got a real cowboy! I also love him! :)
