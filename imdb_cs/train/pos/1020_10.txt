"Stargate SG-1" tracks SG-1 intergalactic surveys through a device called Stargate and all the surprises waiting on the other side of the wormhole. it's the first few moments when it first appeared, I did not know how well this series really would be, 10 years after I last saw an episode. My old impression was that the show was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than a science fiction series, it's one of the best, exciting, long-lasting, exciting sci-fi productions. And why? Because it runs on an amazing assumption. This series of values ​​far outweighs what the film is based on, and I think it is a very good example of the fact that television as a suitable medium is capable of providing something that does not work with time-limited film. The sense of familiarity created by the long running series, the tracking of characters and their circumstances that progress over time is amazing and only increases the ability to stop mistrust, and it is all the result of the great writing and the great dedication of the entire crew of the show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> several seasons, perhaps up to the 4th and 5th year, have focused much more on exploring planets and different situations, keeping episodes unfairly to each other unless it has always been a threatening threat to Goaul'd. <br /> <br /> - From the 5th to the 7th, there have been episodes of fighting Goauld and preventing attacks on Earth. After this annual survey of planets, it is almost an excuse to put sg-1 into the Goaul'd / replicator / ori conflict. <br /> <br /> - The 8th period is probably the most mixed. It has episode streams that include tiny earth issues in which the Stargate has hardly mentioned, but the last episodes contain some great moments of replicators. <br /> <br /> The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and not Jack O'Neil. Both are a good sequel, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a bit weak because they seem to be a bit more than SG-1 and Jaffa is losing battle after the Battle of Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically, after Season 7, the survey was pushed into the background, which was in many ways a shame because of the potential and secrets of each of the planets (episodes); on the other hand, it has done so many great episodes of ongoing conflicts that the change in the nature of the show has always worked and shows how great and courageous the writers are. Even hard I believe the series has a very good end that gives it a nice rest, the feeling I have is that it can go on; the people involved were all great experts and the series of narratives had something to offer. The last season, which has returned to the initial character of the series, was very feasible and would be very welcome, but in the end they are as they are. Finally, because I enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to see that it's over. A huge picture, which, however, is the work of hundreds of people over the course of ten years, is a view of beauty and true evidence of crematorial dedication, of those great actors and characters that we will always remember as a collective on SG-1.
