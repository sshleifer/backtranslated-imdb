The superb starry quality of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps from the screen in this humorous, humorous, mazan comedy with plenty of swords and fences. A charming story in his narrative that can not be resisted. Sweet romantic comedy with very young Gina Lollobrigidou as a love interest. The film will be remembered with great affection.
