Will you all be laying hell out of Todd Sheets!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you're coming to! This guy got 735 zombies and regular cast to work for FREE! Sure, acting is sometimes ridiculous. Yes, makeup is not the biggest thing you ever see. But it is not the worst, if you want to see it, go watch the Zombie Nation with its raccoon zombies. This is a clean, good old fashioned movie Guerilla Film! Todd is a perfect professional and omnipresent nice guy. There are holes on the plot, yes. The conspiracy seems to be far-reaching. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets came out of the shelter and made a remake that he was going. If anyone tried to make a movie, they know that finishing is a success in itself.
