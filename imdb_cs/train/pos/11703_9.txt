That's a great movie. Some people disagree with me, but if you know anything about the Bible, you know it is. I think everyone should see! I agree with the new updated version as pleasant, but the message is still OK. If you see this movie. It's not "scare the hell of you movie," it's true with the Bible. I think U.N. will play an important role in the world government. The last days coincide with the Bible. Look at what happened to the dog and cat chip, which has now come out to protect children from kidnapping. It's the rice grain size. I feel like he is the front runner of the beast brand, which is spoken in the Bible. Without a mark you can not sell or buy with this small chip in the future, it's not clear how much information you can put on it.
