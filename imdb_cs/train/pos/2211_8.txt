I do not see much television, except The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! 'S Soup. I think I have this show in good company. I love the sharper revision of the pop culture this show gives. Soup also helps me to stay on top of what people in the office talk about Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). Best of all, Soup shows clips from the most important shows, which are usually the most entertaining or the most controversial moments (most people are involved in watching the American Idol due to a strange show that is a bankruptcy), which is why most people say they are watching . And that means I do not have to suffer the other 98% of those mummatory talk talcs or "real estate" shows, for one nugget "funny" or "shock". The only reason Soup does not get in my opinion are sometimes sketches that are not so funny, and on even more occasional occasions the comment is not always par. But they can not all be home at home, and if so, Soup will not be on E !. Joel is a quick joke and Soup writing team (which includes McHale) to make for a great show. I'm kissing the laughter and crew remarks outside the camera. Even if they are incomprehensibly obvious by doing occasional laughable laughs, it's funny because it's forced. Apparently they are ironic. And that's part of what makes this fun.
