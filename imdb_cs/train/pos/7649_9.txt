Jim Belushi, a modern cocaine version of "It's A Wonderful Life". Michael Caine plays an angel that allows Belus to see what life would be like if he "did a great one." Jim is in his best work with a good story and support of cast; looks like a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. He is not an Oscar nominee but a good entertainer.
