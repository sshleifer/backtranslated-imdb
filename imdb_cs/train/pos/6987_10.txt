Save the "UFO" thing aside. That was the best document I've ever seen. The factual reports from Neil and Buzz ... have to be seen. Interviews and reports are revealing because most of the information was tagged as confidential in 1969 and was released only in 2006. No document to date has detail or accuracy so short 47 minutes ... FACTS throws you away and you will be left in jeopardy the risks that were first accepted in the month ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Have you ever seen a person who saved his own life? Bet not. Neil rescues his life when he is separated from death by only millions of seconds. Wonderful to watch. It's travesties, people did not know all the details of landing on the Moon and the courage these men had when they were facing a certain death, the missing computer ... 10 stars!
