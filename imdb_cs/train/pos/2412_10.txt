I feel that Monarch Cove was one of the best written and released series "Drama" that has long appeared on any network. This show had great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This could be developed into a great Primetime soap. People are looking forward to this type of talk, because we're "Reality TV" over-exaggerated. I long for the kind of writing and acting that points like Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Monarch Cove updated this concept pretty well and I expected it to get better. With these characters there is so much that they are expanding and all of them were very interesting and captivating. It would be a waste if we did not try and develop these characters after we drew and embraced us in our world. I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting, and sensual without going over or offending. He loved it.
