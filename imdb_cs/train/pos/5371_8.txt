I wrote the first movie almost five years ago. Then the ideas introduced in the film still seem to be fictitious if they ever even appeared at all. No longer. Now it seems that politics, society and the media at The Running Man are very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly missing in 1987 (in The Running Man), which are today's presence: <br /> <br /> As for the nature of Richard Dawson, Damon Killian considers this as "traditional morality". CHECK <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort from contestants. CHECK <br /> <br /> the cameras everywhere. CHECK <br /> <br /> Limited travel of citizens behind the rumors of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system supplemented by barcodes ("travel passes" in the film) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. CHECK <br /> <br /> Increased fusion, bordering incestuous government and media. CHECK <br /> <br /> Graphically generated by a computer that is so advanced that it manipulates real-world motion (eg, the "Digital Mat" image of Ben Richards on a pair). CONTROL <br /> <br /> Damage to conscientious opponents or critics of current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Marking the economy is further expanding the gap between rich and not so rich; an increasing number of marginal groups that respond to tightening the lines of the great government; civil riots to drink just below or on the surface of almost every major public event, regardless of its origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on Stephen King's novels. Just to be safe, I move to Switzerland.
