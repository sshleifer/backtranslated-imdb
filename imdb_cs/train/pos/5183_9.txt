<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw it at college in the early 1990's, and when I could not identify with the thirtieth movie in the movie, I felt that the story, the characters and the film were generally top-notch. People who have talked negatively about the Indian Summer can keep their crowded Armageddon films and leave movies with a big and healthy story to those who appreciate them.
