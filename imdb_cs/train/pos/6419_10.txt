This movie is a great military film. Maybe it's not an excellent Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that's not the case for this movie. Other reviewers have found that this movie is too slow for their taste, but? like a retired soldier? I appreciate the pace the film crew deliberately took to tell their story as accurately as two and a half hours were allocated. The story itself has been narrated and posted several times, but remains for a professional soldier? and the African American on it? to report on the story, as shown by the crew of the film, and how the US Navy represents. The story of Brashear's work to become a marine diver and his life as a marine diver outside his graduation is not the only story he is presented. There's also a story about how the Sunday Chefs commander did not make an unlawful order from his commanding officer that the 2nd Class officer Brashear did not come into the test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price for losing one stripe and changing the assignment. It also narrated the true story of Brashear found in the fifties of the fifties of the wrecked water bombs in the Atlantic Ocean, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was at the head of a disturbing line when Brashear did not get out of his way and married. It was a complicated story worth telling and I admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the whole story, and from the deleted scenes on the DVD I can say that the crew tried to tell the story as much as possible . As a professional soldier, I was proud to have seen such a great story that has been dealt with in such a complex way, and to see the tradition and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full way.
