Another strike, Norman Lear, describes the problems African Americans have had to go through in the turbulent sixties and seventies. With Esther Rolle and her husband, along with the three children living in a Chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black quarter, the show featured what the black people were going through with the landlord (Mr. Bookman's black agent), as well as the prices and everyday problems that just existed. The three children represented how people looked to face their problems differently - from comedy JJ to militant Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also sought success, this show was a perfect insight into African-American life.
