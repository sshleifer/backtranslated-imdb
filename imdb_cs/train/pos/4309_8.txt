Many comments that people have made me surprise (I apologize) for missing me. Kasdan wants to present life, an ordinary life. A conventionally structured story in which characters have opinions that change their lives and then disappear, music up and the film is over, absorbed into this much larger canvas. Several characters in this movie have such lighting and then move on. Sometimes they can keep their insights, sometimes they do not, so life is really like that. In other words, Kasdan is conducting a conventional dramatic structure in favor of exploring the continuing life? it is not a happy end, only the end; and everything before it's still in the process, always catching? and if you absolutely insist on the subject, exploring the role of miracles in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, to the beginning. Then add all the random incidents and interconnections that make up life or several interconnected lives and you have miracles at the bucket. Kasdan underscores this topic lightly than it takes, and signs it in various ways, most memorably in the instrument, right in the middle of the film, that Mac and his wife lay in bed, each dreaming of his own dreams, but also later in the film, how these dreams have the power to form a reality in the film. This is not a movie with a simple or obvious message. You have to let it play in front of you and then let it sit in your mind a few days, a month, a few years, and you will see what it was doing there. This is undoubtedly the best film of Kasdan, his oldest, most humane. The main meditation on life from one of our most talented writers and directors. The tragedy is, of course, that he was not allowed to work for many years, mostly because of the restrictions on studying around the "Dreamcatcher". Let's hope we have not heard from Larry Kasdan last. A great movie of a great artist. Keep in mind that art may not be fully rationalized to succeed.
