It's funny how your life can change for another ... To take part in "Waterdance" for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life can look frightening and you notice that are other people who find themselves in a similar situation can help you continue. <br /> <br /> The performance of Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (oh man !, Helen is the cleanest and most charming woman on earth ...) is amazing, Wesley Snipes also surprises you in one of your last serious roles. A simple and deep film that does not leave us indifferent to the message that is being transmitted: enjoy every moment of your life ... Really to the film like any lesson is not attended !!! (sorry, it's Brazilian expression ...).
