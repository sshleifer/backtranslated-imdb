This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all other characters have different actors from the English version. Both films were shot back because Garbo had such success in Germany. Garbo herself prefers her Anna Christie in this version before the English version. It's a good story and a necessity for Garbo fans.
