I am presenting this film to college students in rhetoric and media law, because his lessons are timeless: why to speak against injustice is important and can bring about the changes desired by the oppressed. Why freedom of the press and freedom of expression are fundamental to democracy. This is a necessary story about how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through Steven Bike's activism and Donald Woods journalism. It also gives an important lesson of free speech: "You can blow a candle, but you can not burn a fire. When the flame begins to catch, the wind bleeds it." (From Bike by Peter Gabriel, to Shaking Tree).
