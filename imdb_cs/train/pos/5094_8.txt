If you are a purist, do not collect time - otherwise, hold your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen it ten times, but this movie is just as good, just another. I will not describe the differences in detail because it would spoil the film. It's also a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a huge fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain and the supporting actress is great. I consider the quality of supported cast as one of Hallmark Production's trademarks and this film was no exception. The cinema is great and the score is perfect. If you are looking for fun, you will not be disappointed.
