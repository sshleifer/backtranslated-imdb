Moonwalker is a fantasy music movie with Michael Jackson with different segments. I will evaluate each segment separately. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with a music video. The music video is a concert by Michael Jackson, who sings the song "Man in the Mirror". The music video also features the montage of historical personalities such as Gandhi, JR King Martin Luther, John Lennon and others. The first segment was a good choice for opening a movie that I liked and also loved to assemble historical characters. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment 9/10. Segment 2 shows Michael Jackson's assemblage from five Jackson to his solo career. Montage I thought it was well made, I liked the animation they put in it and I loved their songs choices like "I want you back, Beat It, Thriller, you feel it and the way you feel me." The only thing I would like to make a bit better in one of the tracks is "We are a world." The reason why everything you see is rain drops, and in those drops there are Michael Jackson's paintings and chorus of celebrities, but it's a bit difficult to see the choir. In addition, this segment is still good. I give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is a bad song. You probably think Michael Jackson's Music is a bad video, yes yes and no. This segment is a music video, but it's a kid again. The segment was cute, but it was not as good as other segments. I give it 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music movie, which takes place after the poor version of the girl's "Speed ​​Demon". The short story is that Michael Jackson is being chased by his beloved fans and printed matter, and he masquerades as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them. The blinds in the pursuit sequence were great, but some of the Claymation characters looked a little fake when interacting with real people. Also at the end of the clip, the costume of Michael Jackson Jackson comes to life and dances with him. I enjoyed dancing, but it was like nothing. I give it 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy victory. Music video "Leave me alone". The music video is about media that is touching his nose in Michael Jackson's personal life, and Michael Jackson thinks he will not leave him alone, no matter how much he has managed to prove his innocence. The music video really speaks (but remember that it happened before child molestation, all about the superstitions about it in the eighties.) But I did not feel that this video should be in this movie because it's a movie for kids and I did not think the child would understand what she was singing about. I'm giving this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called Smooth Criminal. Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his power of a star who wants to be a criminal to protect children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from Evil Mobster named Mr. Big (Joe Pesci). The segment I was thinking really made a movie, especially when she danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a lot of criminals. I also thought that the special effects are good. The odd thing about the segment is why children are hanging with an adult man who never explained why. Also, character Joe Pesci talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean, why would you talk about drugs in childhood? Other wise it was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the final segment of the entire movie. The film ends with Michael Jackson singing the title version of Beatle's Song "Come Together," and then during the recording we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good reputation for "Come Together," and I think it's a good idea to put on a band of good singers with a talented musical like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie, I think it really brings a child's imagination. The movie is almost as imaginative as the Beatles "Yellow Submarine" animated movie if you like Michael Jackson and you are on a movie with a lot of creativity that's a movie. My overall rating of this film is 8/10
