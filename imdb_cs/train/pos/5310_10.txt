Pecker is another major film from John Waters, which happens on smaller than serial moms. Pecker's title character is keen to photograph everything he sees. It does not matter whether it's dirty or shocking when it's photographed. He soon uses the pictures he took and exposes them to display on his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle-class family. His father works at a drink bar, but he does not have enough money with a lesbian stripper across the street. His mother runs smiles and loves to dress poor people. His elder sister, Tina, works in a gay bar, where she specializes in business. His younger, little Chrissy has a habit of eating sugar, sugar, and nothing but sweet food. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays with her a ventriloquist. He also has 2 friends. His friends are Matt a chronic guard, and his girlfriend, Shelley, controls the mat as if she were a dictator. Soon he gets his paintings from New York City and shows them in the art gallery. Image is glorious, but pictures reveal the unusual lifestyle of their friends and the simple family life.
