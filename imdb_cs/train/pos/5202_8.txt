I just watched this version of "Samhain," and though I like it, it's nothing like the "rough cut" version I have. If you check the board, you'll see an apology from the director for this cutting version, 79 minutes. And he says he has nothing to do with this trim, decorated with a R rating, with a completely new twisted end. The Christian does not have to give up too much because the basic elements of the gore still stand, though they are very decorated. This is a damn shame because it has the potential to be one of the hardest and best gore films in years. Still porn stars and indies and some extreme gore can be at least partially seen. I'm just glad I have the "rough cut," because it's a gem for any gorehound library for me. Christian Viel certainly has the skill and vision to deliver the goods and hope his next project will be better made. The fools had almost classics in their hands and they all wound them up. "Samhain" can be one of the most controversial and badly controlled horror films at all, and too bad gorehounds have not seen what the director intended. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just so you know what you missed, it's my review based on SAMHAIN's "work print". <br /> <br /> The film runs in just over 90 minutes and has no chapters. There is absolutely no musical soundtrack and some scenes have no sound in the dialogue because I think they want to be a later loop. Most of the movie, however, has sound with sound, and when there is no effect or scene, it will appear as a message for the message when the movie is finished. It's exactly what they call "Rough Cut," but the only uncut version of "Samhain" you've ever seen. The reason, because gore is extremely graphic, much more than even NC-17. Yes, there are several porn stars, but they are just for killing and adding a little sugar and spices. The story is quite standard American vacationers in Ireland and eventually stay in the house in the middle of the forest. An area that is heavy for folklore, including the ancient Druids and the Samhain celebration, or as we call it Halloween. (Spooky) The film begins with a huge dose of gore because a couple of camping is infected with one of the local inbred mutants. This is a great gore scene when the fellow found his girl hanging from the cliff and crying for help. All she sees is her head, her arms and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when she pulls her she is completely cut into two. This is what I would call EXTREME GORE, with the inside, blood and cut limbs all over the place. We are here in Herschell Gordon Lewis, except that the effects look much more realistic. I'm just going to skip the story because it's your standard stopwatch and kills the conspiracy. Another gore scene is something that looks like a friend of first killing is taken to a cave like a placement (TCM-2 Case) and tied to a table. This geek then cuts off all his limbs (outside the camera, with a touch to put the scene), and then we see his hull on the barbecue hole, slowly turns over the fire, and the hull has a hard-on (if you can believe it). Yes, very bad taste, rough, terrible, you will find the right word and probably it is also good. <br /> <br /> Then, later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and all, cut her neck to her crotch, and all her guts are drawn in graphic joy and her blood drains into a pot. Yummy, real shot of huh? But the best gore scene is happening inside the house, and I have to admit it's one of the best gore scenes I've seen. This guy (no matter who) is caught behind the geek, and cut open in the back hole. The geek then puts his hands and tears all the guys' entrails, guts and what the hell is somewhere else right from his asshole. This continues FOREVER when the boy screams and more and more guts are pulled from the floor in the bathroom. It's so extreme, so I'm on top of that I laughed at everyone in hell. Of course, NEVER will you ever see this scene on the right DVD, IMO, along with most other really extreme gore scenes. <br /> <br /> So what do you think of it all. Well, first, though I doubt that this movie will ever be released in this totally unusual presentation, it will make Rough Cut a precious gem for gorehounds. Yes, it's a bit difficult at first, without a soundtrack, a few scenes we can still insert, and credits that have missing names all over the world. But that's what makes it so unique, and I would not trade it for nothing now. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme gore. This makes "Haute Tension" look like a Disney movie.
