"How to Lose Friends and Aliens" is not based on the Tiger Woods infidels. This is an average romantic comedy based on Toby Young's work experience as a celebrity journalist. Film star Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a crazy British journalist who works for a famous New York celebrity magazine. The young man is restless when he is about to catch all types of snakes to turn around everywhere, so the name of the movie. He is upset, courageous and sad. Yet for some very bizarre reason it is somewhat pleasant. Sidney gets involved with her fellow journalist, composed by Alison Olsen, starring Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is especially eager for sexpot actress Sophie Maes to play Fantastic Mistress Megan Fox. This foxtrot has insufficient ability to act, but high on "eye candy". Sidney gets into all sorts of jewels to get up to the journalist's rankings in the co. These are the top comedy moments of the film. But I think that director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose viewers and alienate authentic rom-com material by creating an unlikely romantic boundary between Sidney & Alison; even though the Weidstraughan team had made a fun story differently. Pegg made his character on the wire with his funny performance like Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges once again built bridges "The Dude" with his mysterious support as Clayton Harding, suave pres. The rest of the film acting was not good enough to be here. "How to lose friends and alienate people" should not be completely stolen, but you can lose some movie friends if you promote it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
