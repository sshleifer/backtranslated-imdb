After Jeremy Brett became acquainted with Sherlock Holmes, no actor would ever have such an extraordinary way of imagining that he could ever approach Brett's portrait "one of the most interesting personalities in literature." Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes and, in my opinion, can not be different. Grand actor Basil Rathbone is, I have to admit, to the other, but he is still the second. It could be argued that Mr Rathbone's scripts are subject to the absolutely top performances provided by Mr Brett and I would agree. However, when everything is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always and forever be the only actor to really "become" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject and we, the public, will look forward to Mr Brest's unique achievements. Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
