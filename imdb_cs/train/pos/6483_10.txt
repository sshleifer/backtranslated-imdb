This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, should be made clear, beginning until the end of the Second World War. The origins are not fully explored from the fall of Germany in the hands of the Versailles Treaty, which helped hurt Hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, it must be difficult, in a 26-part series, to get into it. In addition to the anticipated combat photos / events, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are said to give the audience an amazing view, especially if you are not necessarily a fan of World War II. Episodes that showed "testimony" and what was life on the home front of major allies / opponents, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States. It showed the extreme savages of the war on the front and of course the suffering of civilians, death camps, etc. They were very well managed and exposed. I would suggest it in every class of history for the young generation (from what could be said that I am one at 47!). Some things are quite strangely omitted, as the arrival of a new jet era begins with experimental Gloster's jet by Frank Whittle and the Gloster Meteor combat debut as well as the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially when the V-1 debut was seen and surprisingly less mention of V2. This is probably a little oversight without being a sensational secret and fantastic weapon that World War II brought from the unbearable old science. But the great series that has become his mark and has been repeated since then. <br /> <br /> Many own as a cassette file in historical terms, on a DVD for everyone separately, who will become a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be proud.
