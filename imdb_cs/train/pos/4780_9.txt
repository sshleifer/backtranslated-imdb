He always liked this film from the video cover. Eventually he got to buy it for a fiver in the sale and a guy what a movie. Simply stunning performance of all cases and is so beautiful. Even in distant times, so hardly you hear the dialogue as if you were really such a distance when you chose the bits of the story. It's really moving, often fun and very attentive. There is not much dialogue, but it is shot so that you feel so strong. And 9/10 from me. You must see.
