This is one of the most beautiful shorts "Our gangs". Spanky is in his most delightful and funniest, and babies who got into the babysitter are also cheerful. Tiny Spanky is forced to watch all her little siblings. An initial shot of all of them in baby buggies that has fun with the various things that hang a gang from fishing poles is a beautiful gag. <br /> <br /> Spanky's appearance carries his huge knife on a toy when asked, is invaluable, just like his answer - "Hi, where do you have the stuff - I do not care about any children!" That little boy who says "remarkable" throughout the movie, all the beautiful gaggos and Spania tells the kids "everything about Tarzan," they add to become one of the best "Our gangs" you've ever seen.
