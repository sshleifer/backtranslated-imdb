{Possible spoilers come ... you are warned in advance. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite musicals and movie musicals! (Another is the damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes shine (not to mention songs) shows are lost when moving from stage to screen. This is largely DEFINITELY this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, bright and colorful, characters are bigger than life and you can not help them but love them and Michael Kidd choreography is absolutely stunning. (So ​​they like to know they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All the actors "bounced the ball" (that is, they have unrivaled chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are utterly believable as the owner of the oldest floating cloak game in New York and the best-known player who bet on even the smallest things - like his fever up to 104 years - if they do not take penicillin. The sweet, fresh face of Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (although it is true that her singing trumpets are not as excellent as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - a doll with a golden heart and a way to heal all. And last but not least, Miss Vivian Blaine, whose role is Broadway, is Miss Adelaide, a singer and a Hot Box dancer, who would end her 14-year commitment to marry Nathan and get rid of her psychosomatic cold. <br /> <br /> First of all, to Stubby Kay and BS Wheeler, repeating their roles in Broadway like Nicky-Nice Johnson and Benny Southstreet. They were never two more stupid players than these guys. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brando is as good as usual, and although he does not have the voice of Robert Alde or Peter Gallagher, you will forget - as is the sense of determination to bring everything he can to his role as Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" gives me freezing every time I see him doing it. It's especially nice to hear him say "Daddy ... I have apple cider in my ear." Simmons is charming and pleasing in her role well fitting her appearance, voice and the way she carries. You are so fond of not only winning Sky (or eventually believing it) but helping people overcome their hazards, drinking and other sins and living with God. Her portrayal "If I was a bell" is wonderful, at least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is a man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parts that Sam Levene from Broadway could never have (a wonderful actor, but the guy was a deaf tone ... go for it). I really enjoyed adding the song "Adelaide" ... I wish some guy was singing like this ME. Frankie's cool, neat behavior goes beyond the boundaries of this film. But most importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide. And when we talk about Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is simply perfect in this role. The emphasis on exhaustion "Adelaide's Lament" is simply great. And it's also my favorite part of the whole movie. He really feels you for Adelaide ... especially when he shouts before and then again during "Sue Me". I still have not decided whether I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and Peck" ... maybe I like it anyway. Either way, she does fantastic with those as well as "take back Mink." (I'm sad to miss "hollanderize" from the movie ...) It's absolutely unusual, not to mention the joy and my favorite part of the whole movie. One of the best things about this movie is their lingo. It's a mix of top and street slangs. They never use "it is", "me" or "it is." It's always "it's", "me" and "it's." Overall, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals all the time, and it does not matter that you have time to watch every time it comes. My only complaint? No, "Take a look with a man today." Now it's a good song.
