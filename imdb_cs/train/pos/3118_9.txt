When I did not see the previous two in the Bourne movie trilogy, I was a little unwilling to watch The Bourne Ultimatum. However, it was a very exciting experience and I had no problem understanding what was happening due to the lack of seeing the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it reached this interval! I think I've never seen such a great movie, especially an action movie. Since I usually avoided events and thriller films, it was such a great news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most fascinating movies, capturing your attention from the first second until the last minute before the lap. Roll Matt Damon was just fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I have heard a lot about his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2 and now he has added this wonderful actor to his list. I look forward to seeing his other films in the future. <br /> <br /> Stunts were done in style - every one was great and I was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. Great.
