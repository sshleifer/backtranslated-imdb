BSG is one of my favorite TV series. I was lucky to have watched the series get to the final. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride! <br /> <br /> Once I noticed the pilot at Hulu, I knew exactly why I was in the title - Caprica! Although some things are not added when you compare the two series, they are still beautifully done. There was no mention of the Holobandes in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds, but maybe I did not have enough of a series to explain to them why. I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and will want to watch you more!
