On the surface is "Written on the Wind", which is a sharp, shiny soap about the sexual dysfunctions of family oil in Texas. But underneath it is a deep, social commentary on the life of the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk registers the results with another versatile. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that your best friend, Stack Rock Hudson, loves her. When Stack finds it sterile and Bacall ends up pregnant, the fireworks fly. And friendly Dorothy Malone has won an Oscar for her portrait of the biggest nymph in Texas that avoids Hudson. Good epic soap opera.
