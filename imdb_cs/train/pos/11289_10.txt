There is something wonderful that the film made in 1934 can be the head and shoulders of every Tarzan film that followed, including the bloated and boring 80's Greystoke. As soon as the audience reaches the first three scenes, which are undoubtedly boring, Tarzan and his Mate take off as a shot, offering non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and goes with the movie. Weismuller is also solid. Highly recommended.
