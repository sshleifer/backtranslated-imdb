Finally, there was released a good film Modest Blaise, who not only tells the story but actually tells a "real" story. I admit it's a bad movie if you're expecting an action thriller, but if you stop in your footsteps and eliminate all your expectations. Then you notice that this is a story that is very close to the original created by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to find out how Modesty has become the great person she is. It's not a movie that would attract new fans, but a movie that would tell a real story. Some things could be better, but when you can not forget the terrible movie of 66, then it's a wonderful movie. So you're a fan, then sit back and just enjoy the real story with the cover story just to tell Modesta about her story.
