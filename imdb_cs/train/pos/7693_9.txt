"GOOD TIMES", in my opinion, is a CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen each episode, I'm still enjoying it. It's hard to say which of my favorites. I also really love a theme song. If you ask me, even though I like everybody, it would be nice if everyone stayed on the show all the time. Everybody always gave good performance, the design was magnificent, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. Finally, although it can be seen on Land TV now, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it's left out of the air.
