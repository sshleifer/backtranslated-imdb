This installment greatly makes the CIA look like a very stupid organization. In fact, they may be. After all, the way the conspiracy works, it seems as if one had the power to sanction the killing of everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a very trusted job as Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of the whole movie being killed. He's still trying to remember who he is and how he got where he is. He gets help from a few people, and it looks like every minute of the movie someone's trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little rest in this movie and the action sequences seem very real. There are plenty of sequences of chase-driven chase, which in turn contributes to realism and makes it seem less Hollywood than many shots. These sequences add to the reality of the film in feeling. Dimming in some sequences is brilliantly done when you wonder if someone is dying or if Bourne can take off. This is the kind of action strain you're going to see when you want to have fun and I'm sure it will lead to another movie in the series.
