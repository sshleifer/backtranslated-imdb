My love for Chris Rock is changing with his films, I hate him for Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in that movie after that. I like him when he is alone and not keep back like Dogma. Well that's his best, he did not expect it to be so good. Chris Rock brings a wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedies I've seen a long time ago. He loved it.
