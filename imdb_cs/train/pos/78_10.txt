Although it has one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots," this film is my most favorite piece by Vincent Price. Gallico has this quality that is lacking in many horror filmmaking attitudes. When you look at it, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, injustice against him, and you make him cheerful when he goes to revenge, even if he scares you a little with his original fury. As the film continues, his character becomes tragic. He committed his murder, but now he has to kill to cover up. And again to cover it. And again ... your stomach drops with your soul as it goes down to your spiral - as if watching your beloved brother turn into a hood. Even when the story of revenge is old, fence devices are in themselves original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill more and more inventive ways. It is a shame that it is not available for home use.
