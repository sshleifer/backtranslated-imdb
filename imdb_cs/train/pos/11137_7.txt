Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when he was released in 1969, drawing X rating. According to today's standards, it would be difficult to find a rating of R. Jon Voight, who was better, competent in his role as Joe Buck, who is out of town who wants a lot of ladies in New York. He meets a gruesome street cheater named Ratso Rizzo, who is trying to connect with Buck for his own purposes. Both eventually create a bond that is both touching and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman just shines. Hoffman was often great, but never more than in this performance. He is the character that everything else around him fades in comparison. The loss of the John Wayne Academy Award is one of the most vague decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a hand with his hands, but this film has a dirty podbruska that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. It is worth seeing the performance of Hoffman himself.
