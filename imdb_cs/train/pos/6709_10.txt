What I like about this show is that it is the life of modern witches, and it's a blast to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. Magic magic is so diverse and displays the ideas of classical, medieval and modern witchcraft such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina Teenage Witch, this show is so fun and unique because it allows us to experience a bunch of modern witches, worth seven years! This show has so many great features, and it's a pleasure to see Sabrina live its daily life in a deadly and "other" sphere. I would recommend it to every family because the TV series is pure, fun and adventurous. Classical!
