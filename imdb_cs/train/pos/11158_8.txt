A shocking, well-prepared cooler is an underestimated story of brutal murders and evil powers. <br /> <br /> The doctor in town tries to find out who or what is committing a series of violent sexual assassinations. <br /> <Incubus is a tight secret, with some terrible murderous sequences that build on the distorted and terrible climatic twist. Murderous scenes are strong and cruel, so this is not a movie for squeamish! The direction of John Hough, along with the bizarre music scene, combines creating a dark atmosphere of fear that passes through the film. It also carries a Gothic atmosphere. They also feature nice shooting and some stylish camera work. <br /> <br /> The cast is also not bad. Grand John Cassavetes performs as a new physician in the city. Also, Kerrie Keane's performance as local reporter, Helen Hughes as a city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a tough psychic adolescent are also good. The whole film Incubus is a forgotten horror film that must be re-discovered and evaluated. <br /> <br />
