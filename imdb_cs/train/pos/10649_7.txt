What can I say? It's another Hollywood horror film with a very high budget ($ 80 million). It's not scary at all, it offers only a few excitements and one really scary sequence with the skeleton in the fireplace. special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as ever, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. Hill House architecture is amazing, all these sights, sculptures, furniture ... Delicious! However, I do not like the end because it was so lush. Check this out and make your own opinion on it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
