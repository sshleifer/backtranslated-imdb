It took me a while to watch this version, because unfortunately it seems I can not rent it in a video rental shop, but only in another version, but I fell in love with it. I've always been bordering on other Emmy. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, as they are not British, must naturally have an accent, and it does not work well for me. It seems to be happening. I'm sorry, but you do not think Toni and Gwenneth worked great. I could not warm up on any character, but this version is the warmer and more type of person I imagined Emma. It's definitely a version from which I'll be back from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley was not better, but he was convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I've never played with her in the movie version, but she's better portrayed in this version. Think about it (except Mr. Knightley), all the characters are playing better and much less over the top. Unfortunately, they both appeared around the same time, and the Paltrow version was more popular. Damn ... I also like a new scene at the end. Good work for Kate Beckingsale! If you are a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to look at it.
