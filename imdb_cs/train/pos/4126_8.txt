What night. Perry Mason then has a pistol, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour), and finally, at 10:30 am, "Sea Hunt" with his wonderful opening thematic music and Mike's ship floating on a new adventure. Great. Regardless of the story, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A male man and a boys man. This brought an interest in ships that lasted for years. Why they do not show up on the cable or is available on the video, no idea .. Damn.
