I have to see it last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival at Laemlee's on Beverly. This movie received the greatest applause of all the films in the evening. Since the two music videos were the first to open, I did not know what to expect from a time when they were very fast and attracted attention. I was not sure if I was ready for a moment. But because of my surprise, I really liked it. I thought the main demon star was really good. I was so impressed by my performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade. He has been really good since then! Either that, or he was given a miserable role or was a pushed director really tough for this short one. The girl did a good job. I think it's hard because it was her first performance and she was so young. Dad has done well. It was really nice cg work on short, both for this and short playing another "Mexican hat" which was also nice but I enjoyed it the most because it had the most depth and emotion and I actually cared for the characters. The second was a very simple story. The story was quite illustrative and dark! They dealt with real topics using more imagination, such as access to ADD people like me. We will not even talk about the last movie in the block I left. My only complaint is that I just want to see the demon figure and a little less start and that's why I gave it 9 out of 10. I also thought the final credits went a bit slow. Otherwise it was beautifully said, controlled and edited. The timing was very nice and a complete change from the rapid editing of MTV that has been done today. This director will also be an actor in the future. Now I'm going to think of him as a lost actor, not a Witchblade guy.
