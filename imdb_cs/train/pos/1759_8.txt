I'm not quite sure if this film is covered by the phrase "serious comedy", I'm not sure if it can be used. In the last few years, the cinema has been filled with comedy films that are too stupid and even smile. That's why I considered movies that do not fill these demands as "serious comedies." Does a 40 year old virgin fall in this guy? It's finally up to you, but in my opinion it's a very funny movie. You get a lot of laughter and also bring you a social commentary through some really great characters and situations. I'm pretty sure there's more than one 40-year-old virgin there, and even people, does not fit exactly to this specification, she can feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men. The story, as the title says, is about Andy, the shy, quiet guy who is collecting action figures, Survivor shows with his octogenous neighbors, and whose favorite band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Kal is Andy's associate on SmartTech. He believes Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is obviously a sexual pervert, but he still seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre. David is a passionate man who is still in love with his former girlfriend, who has escaped with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be affected by his constant cheating and getting to his ear. I'm sure most young people from 13 to 21 were watching this movie, but they really do not have the age limit to enjoy it. So if you have not seen them, you are a little laughing at social commentary before going to your video rental and relaxing from those deep and depressing independent movies. It also includes DVD bonuses that you will really see from top to bottom.
