Maybe I have to examine my head, but I thought this was a pretty good movie. CG is not too bad. I found it even worse. The appearance of the creatures (and creatures, I think, good and bad snake) was pretty cool. The action scenes involving snakes were really good, I thought. there are some outages in logic at times, and the story does not always make sense. But for the feature feature, there's a lot worse. And a lot of other creatures seemed to be picked up from other movies, so it's not entirely original. I think the essence of the story is original though. It's a bit similar to Godzilla (Great American Version) that I liked. like this movie so much, but I still say it was pretty good. I also like music.all in all, I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10
