This movie stars Emily Watson, Breaking the Waves of Glory. This movie about the obsession of one person takes place in the center where the chess tournament takes place. The chess master arrives and shortly after falling in love with the woman Emily Watson is in love (at first glance). It drops to this department of a man who is obsessed with chess. That's all to the dismay of her mother, who is much more interested in seeing her with another young master; the right lord. Her mother feels that it's just a fantasy for a young woman, because she tends to count on weird animals, and so on. The result is mostly a way through the human psyche. He tells the story of how his past is closely related to his presence. Emily Watson is amazing as well as an actor who plays the lead character. It's definitely slow, but it's worth watching. The end was even satisfactory. :)
