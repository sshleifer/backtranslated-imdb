Although I agree that it is a good, but not a great movie, for many reasons I have mentioned other posters, I still like it. One of the reasons is music: I draw attention to the very cool appearance of the Candoli - Conte and Pete brothers - on a well-grown scene in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day and convincingly captured the mind of Jimmy Stewart by playing a hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. Candolis really played well, though I suspect that the real music for this scene was dubbed later by two of them. I do not know much about George Duning, who is dedicated to music (besides, he seems to have worked with three Stoogs on more than one occasion), but casting the Candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a really nice touch.
