It was a wonderful movie. How these women tried to save their spouses. I thought the performances of the actors were great. I had to think about the film for a long time. I think every student should see this movie so he can think of war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the film because she told me and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I was as strong as a woman. I really liked it because something told me about relationships and that's what I like to see in the film. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, the pianist. If you compose these three films together, you have a great deal of attention to what happened during the war. We should remember something like war forever.
