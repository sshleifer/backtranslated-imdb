In fact, Goldie Hawn from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I turn. This is some Mr. Smith goes to Washington-type film, with some variations, but the same assumption. I shot the movie a few years ago, because I had a great deal of trouble on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is very unlikely that a cocktail waitress gets an important job in government just because it saved the life of a big shot. It made me laugh and made me go crazy. It made me laugh because some of the situations that were found were so ridiculous I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE AHEAD COUPLING). I foolishly thought that our government would create an average citizen in the way it was founded. And the speech she did at the end ... beautiful. It is a shame that many people do not have that sense in real life.
