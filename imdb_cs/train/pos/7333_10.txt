That's one great movie. probably the best movie I've ever seen. I watch it again and again. I have to give her ten stars because I said it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. This movie + Popcorn + Coke = The best mix you can imagine. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend this to you. At first I saw that I liked it, so I bought it and now I own it and I watch it about every day. my sons love it and think it's the best movie ever seen. This movie is about Guy In Fantasy World. I do not want to spoil the whole movie so you can read it after reading the text. Beautiful movie Beautiful characters, a beautiful story and just great stuff. must watch the movie. I hope you like my comment Cya <br /> <br /> Jim Make
