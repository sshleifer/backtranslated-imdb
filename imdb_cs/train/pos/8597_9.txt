I like this movie. I thought it was a great political thriller of something that had never happened before - a secret service agent who was bad and involved in a conspicuous plot. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison," he thinks it's a mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> It's just a morally flawed agent who has a relationship with the first lady! Because he does, he can not accept acceptable printing tests, and this makes him the number one suspect when it is revealed that there is a conspiracy to kill the president. "Garrison" is forced to go to lam but at the same time he is still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas does a great job in this role. I do not always care about the people she's playing, but she's a great actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is just as good (at least here) as a colleague of the SS boss who hunts Douglas until he is convinced he is telling the truth. When they do so, two of them work together in the final to find and stop a conspiracy if they can. Steps are also interesting by the way. I've never - and unfortunately - never see the first lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger. It's simply a smooth action move that boasts a start-to-finish experience. Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a number of them and the reason why you see so many critical remarks. But it is unfair here. It just is not smart enough for the geniuses here on this website. My advice: Chill, go for a ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, at the end I have a bit of Rambo-ish, but otherwise it will get a high mark for fun ..... about movies.
