Barbra Streisand's first television special was just fantastic! From her sketches as a girl to a collection of songs in a high fashion department store - everything was top-notch! It was easy to understand how these special awards won. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not only confused with guest appearances, the attention remained on Barbra throughout the production.
