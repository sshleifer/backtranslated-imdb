Yeah, it's a cat and it's moving slowly, but it's really good - and I think of a male man. You have to love Judy Davis, no matter what she is, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural and convincing performance. The scenery of the small coastal summer resort is beautiful and the main theme of the film is good. Unknown (at least unknown) actors and actresses give the reality of a movie that attracts and keeps you focused. Overall, I'm giving 8/10. Go for it.
