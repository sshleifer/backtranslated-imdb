I love the Satan Pit! David Tennant is such a great actor, and so is Billie Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorp in pieces ??? He's so cute, is not he? I hated those bits that had been obsessed with the devil, and they were told they were "going to hell," as Rose had said almost. Remember, he was quite funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, do not you?" Mr. Jefferson was so courageous, was not he? Dying to save others. I really felt for Toby (Will Thorp) when he was seconded for the second time because he was so scared. I was like, 'Oh, my God, if I were Rose, I'd be so scared for him.' And when she embraced him, I was like "grrrrrr, he is mine, but I thought it was really sweet, and a doctor ... well, I thought he'd say Idi" say Rose, I love her, "but he did not. Oh, okay.
