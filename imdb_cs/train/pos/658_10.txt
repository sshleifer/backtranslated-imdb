It's not easy to watch the movie - it's over three and a half hours and is composed exclusively of conversations. Still, it's such an incredibly persuasive and reckless observation of the human nature that, in my humble opinion, it is one of the best films of all time. The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want to raise something, look for the fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating Jacques Rivette, which was made at the same time). This shows the idealism of the late 1960s not to differ from the society he was trying to change. Includes the allegedly liberated menage-à-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). But Alexandre is shown to be chauvinistic and jealous like any other man. Women are exposed as volunteers and defining their femininity through a male perspective. The film is the extremely icy end of the highly revolutionary French new wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinematography as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave and starred (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coupe (1959) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors of the new wave but should be. There is no improvisation (unlike similar John Cassavetes films made in the US), and the dialogue comes from a conversation in real life. The film resonates with the personal experience of Eustache. For example, Francois Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981, and the real person, who also stood up with Marie. The anger and bitterness culminate in an annoying monologue that Veronika delivered directly to the audience and smashes the cool, objective nature of the rest of the film. This fascinating, personal and honest film statement remains one of the most famous films of human nature.
