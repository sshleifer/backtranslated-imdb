I saw this movie in theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then, and recently I got the VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old kids love this movie and ask him again and again. <br /> <br /> I was glad to see you again. Although I must admit that it is not so good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I do not have older children, so I do not know what they think about it. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter is still singing them over and over again. I hope it will help.
