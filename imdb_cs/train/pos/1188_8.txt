Originally, I was dubious about this film (just because of this topic) but richly cartoon figures, wonderful buffalo hunting scenes, and a dramatic conclusion that makes them worth watching. At first I had trouble distinguishing between two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed, they were increasingly different. I'm still damn the last scene.
