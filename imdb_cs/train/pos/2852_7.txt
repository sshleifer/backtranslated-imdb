This movie has a very simple but yet smart premise - an unemployed person trying to steal from a department store and a clerk of the store catching him in the act ... the thief runs straight to the merchant. All the time, an office clerk has difficulty with low-income chicory Yakuza (gangster). During the pursuit of the thief, the eye of Yakuzu, who was looking for a sales representative, will be drawn. The story then moves to a higher speed in the form of Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but it adds to the dog chasing the cat. The entire second act of D.A.N.G.A.N. The Runner (can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about persecution and persecution continues to the extent that by the end of the second hit the bum forgets why it is running away, and Yakuza don does not forget which of the two guys is chasing or remembering, why they run away from it. Like in the later SABU POSTMAN BLUES movie, most of the film is simply hunted and action, with a lot of physical comedy and dark humor injected to get the audience involved. What is inadequate is the end to which the persecution ends when those three men run out of steam and into one of the most chaotic Mexican booths you will see in a movie that looks almost as if Sabu has given Tony Scott a TRUE ROMANCE (Quentin Tarantino).
