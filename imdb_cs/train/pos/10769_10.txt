I love Monte Carlo and enjoyed this film thoroughly. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought his character (Julian Peters) was very appealing, fun and attractive. Sean Young was very good when the disapproved girl with the golden heart was disappointed. George Hamilton was a charming and perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a great day at noon. James Belushi is hysterical as a complete blockbuster. Cybill Shepard gave her a very sweet performance as a pretty vulnerable ignored housewife. Excellent cast occupation. Lots of talents, a clever script, lots of history and beautiful locations. I'm really nice to pick up for a terrible day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is nowhere near your horizon.
