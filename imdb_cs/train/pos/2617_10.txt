I have seen Lion King many times that all my friends have given togther. With a little sister ... you know how it is. Now I remember both the fence and the lines. As soon as King 2 Lion came out, I was fine and well, let me see ... the other was significantly weaker ... then I saw an ad for the king of the lion and 1/2 ... I was as good as we were going again. After watching 1 1/2 I was like a wow. All my expectations (for repeatability) were interrupted. A truly charming and original plot will keep you glued to your place all the time. I noticed that the cartoon was full of so many comic moments that ROFlmao would pay 100%. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend seeing the cartoon.
