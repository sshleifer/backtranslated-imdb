When I saw it as a child, she answered all my questions and scattered all the fears or misconceptions I had. It's easy to watch because it's animated, which makes it lighter. It has no moral bias or "preaching", so no one should object to it. It is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a soothing, "material" way. I hope to show my daughter.
