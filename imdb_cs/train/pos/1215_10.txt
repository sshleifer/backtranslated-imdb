This is my favorite of three bear care films. Again I liked all the songs. However, as most people stressed, the big problem was that this story is in contradiction with the original one. For those who saw the first film, they recall that the bears met their "cousins" whom they apparently never knew. Of course, it was not until the end when cousins ​​got their belly symbols after they showed how much they cared about. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow up with care bears and have belly symbols all the time. That is, it is not a bad film if you keep it separate from the first movie. I thought Darkheart's character was a lot worse than Nicholas first. At the same time, however, I felt it added some kind of balance to the sweetness of the caring bears. I also enjoyed taking care at the end, even though I knew other people had mixed feelings about the scene. And of course I loved songs. My favorite was growing and forever young. Caring for movies always has such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
