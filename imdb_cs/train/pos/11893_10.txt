The following two seasons of this original series were less than insignificant. The last season of catastrophic transformation has contributed to his three-year short life span. Perhaps if the plug was pulled out after the first season, it would have won culture. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season was really cheerful! Funny, clever with excellent writing promised it. The first excellent toast had the right ingredients - characters / actors, storyline, and so on. In addition, the paparazzi reporter's comedy was original to be introduced. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" on the prohu, night after night, day after day for exclusive. Many things make no sense to me. Like this show, and another fob my - Gross Pointe never "did". If the DVDs were released only the first season of naked truth and Grosse Pointe, please someone out there ?!
