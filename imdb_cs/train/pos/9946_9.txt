Dream Quest was a surprisingly good film. There were some obvious goofs, but that can be expected in a movie like the one that was made in such a short time. I did not feel any need to move forward quickly during the movie and found it fun. It happens sometimes stupid, but I generally recommend it. They probably exhausted all glitter in nearby shops and some costumes were pretty good.
