Everything is idyllic in the suburbs when a small family moves because the father has a new job in a computer company. But no paradise would be complete without his snake. Special things happen when a family joins a local club without a husband, as it certainly has a secret. The father is not a joiner, but there is pressure to join him, because everyone in the neighborhood and at work is a member. The good guitar part of Robert Urich is a bit warm, but Joanna Cassidy as a good housewife who turned badly. Dignified and well-prepared cooler with courageous Susan Lucci as club president. Take a look at the popular cult of Michael Berryman in a bit like a valet. The film captures the feeling of paranoia and the end result of special effects is worth waiting for. I've seen this movie several times.
