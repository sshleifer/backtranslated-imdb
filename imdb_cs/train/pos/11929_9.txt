One piece of trivia, which is often forgotten on this family film, is one of the business. At that time, this film in 1994 recorded a record for the greatest film premiere in the history of the film (and may continue to hold). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - undoubtedly in honor of the original film "Angels", which "persecuted" the Pittsburgh pirates. In this remake they "chase" the California Angels. Anyway, the premiere took place long before the Three Rivers Stadium, which was home to Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers at the time (Pirates are now located in PNC Park and Steelers in Heinz Field). The premiere took place on a five-storey screen in the stadium and held (and may even keep) a record for the biggest film premiere in history that turned out to be 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd attended the admiring of thousands of sports fans.
