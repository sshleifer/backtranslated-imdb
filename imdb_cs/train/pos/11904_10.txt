I gave him 10 because he seemed to like it and would like it if it was not. The reason why I worry you is to add a personal observation of the work of the castles. I've seen "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" several times and "House On Haunted Hill" many times, with a clever color sequence where everything except black and white is blood. Even I'm not old enough to see them when the castle was just his showman tricks, so I can appreciate them for my merits. While most of them reject it as secondary, schloks, hammams, etc., I think they are doing bad service to him. The end sequence of "Murderous" is really shocking and works today - and Premysl "The Tingler", while stupid, was very original. But "House On Haunted Hill" was TRIUMPH. After the Frank Lloyd Wright house was used as an exterior, a great Vincent Price and a solid cast, plus good score and production value - when I first saw him in the late evening premiere that he showed in the late 1960s, I did not see it before and did not see since. <br /> <br /> It was a bit when the heroine was alone in the basement (if you did not see the movie, we stopped reading) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. When NO telegrams what's coming, the camera slowly pulls back and makes AUDIENCE turn to ... I'm not saying more (my "spoiler" statement only applies to this movie). The reason is, I believe, this song was DELIBERATED - it's not accidental - and when it happened, ALL THE AUDIENCE REDUCED (including most men!) It took the audience about TEN MINUTES to calm down. Now it's an excellent filmmaking. He was a showy actor, but "House" and the other two films I mentioned are GOOD FILMS. The castle was probably not Hitchcock, but it was not Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> It's easy to concentrate on one's pieces and forget about their TALENT. So I hope it will confirm the document. I look forward to seeing it.
