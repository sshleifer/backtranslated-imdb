I did not expect such a film to be so influenced by being a family as if you were expecting it to live side by side. They are ordinary people of flesh and blood, not a typical Hollywood meal. They have a very common problem - debilitating illness. But the story catches the heart with a strong lesson. Casting, script, direction, and gaming flow along with the growth that draws the viewer deep into the story. Give this film full attention and its message really inspires.
