Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his friends are interested in a space mission that sees them flying through Saturn rings. His friends are immediately killed, but they seem to be really happy. Steve returns to Earth the ever-scarce mass of humanoid pulp; how he becomes a wild killer and melts at every step is followed by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). It's often so horribly fun - with absurd lines and situations around you - that it's hard for me to believe that laughter is unintentional. It seems to me that this is an unnecessary effort in the low budgets of the genre efforts of the 1950s and 1960s and, as such, it is an amazingly entertaining film. This sequence with a nurse is just cheerful. We are even processed into a split-screen sequence that does not really add anything, but it's still a gas that's going to look. Writer / director William Sachs deserves recognition that he came up with this brilliant idea; its ultra-slim character is really unforgettable. I think his step is a bit gone; some scenes (like the one with the older couple) are going on for a bit longer, but eventually adds solid, blues, B-film goods with panache. The climax is especially fun. <br /> <br /> Arlon Obersa's music is pleasantly shocked (although it's fun at some moments), and Willy Curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots sometimes. This brings me to the fantastic and persuasive effects of Rick Bakers makeup, which makes the film a very respectable centerpiece, to perfect finishing. <br /> <br /> The bar is under heavy makeup almost for the whole movie (Sachs also has a moment for the film to hit the ground) and does what he has to do well. DeBenning is rather a glamorous and stupid hero, and Ann Sweeney is not as hot as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are all right. It is worth seeing people such as Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Janus Blythe (from Toby Hoopers "Eaten Alive" and Wes Cravens "The Hills Have Eyes") and even director Jonathan Demme a small part. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie at midnight with plenty of gore, winter and laughter that is considered valuable to top science fiction / horror lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
