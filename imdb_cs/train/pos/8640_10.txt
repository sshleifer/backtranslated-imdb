This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to step out of the performance he has featured in this film. The Spirit was the pinnacle, just like Forbes and Lewis. The four main characters set out on the scenic road of historical murders, one of the best cars ever produced, the Lincoln Continental in 1960. Early Grace is simple with a taste for dry brushes and masks. He likes his wife not to smile or smoke and to wear PWT dresses. The Spirits and Forbes are two artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are parksmen from the countryside. While most of the tone in the movie is dark, there are plenty of fun scenes to take. Writing, directing and playing are excellent. If you like road movies, murders, humor and narration, check out this movie. Everyone will give you and you will want more when it comes to credits. One of my favorite times. "hey ... throw the dog to teach him to hunt!"
