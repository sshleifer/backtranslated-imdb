Some DVDs have me until I just can not go out and buy. It was one of those movies. Like everyone here, I remember seeing it as a child and loving it. I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut, so I was wondering what might be. I agree that the "Portabell Road" sequence is now long (just like a football game), but besides, I have not found any problems with the remaining scenes that have been returned to their worthy place. Perhaps Disney should have the original version (which is a restored version) on one side with a restored version on the other side, then people could choose what they wanted to view. Overall, it's still a fun movie that still captures some of the children's memories.
