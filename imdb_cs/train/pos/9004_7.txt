I had my doubts about another love story in which the disabled people find meaning and redemption through honest communication. This is not yet at the top of my list. But the performance by Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and an exemplary, almost overwhelming, and rescuing it from being just another tear-jerker. The cartesian depiction of the ALS victim is strong, perhaps even intermittent (sometimes its dialogue breaks into indistinguishable mumbles). But the overall effect is praiseworthy and rewarding. Branagh can be a perfect compliment to her performance. <br /> <br />
