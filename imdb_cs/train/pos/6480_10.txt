This was by far the best document about the war ever made. From the very beginning of the first episode, when Sir Laurence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glan, "The Day of Soldiers Come". On the last days of the war, when clouds of mushroom appeared over Japan, I never missed a second from this classic series and I remember it well even though it was projected back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy has been described in detail. This whole series should be mandatory for as many children as possible in the world to avoid the tragedy of World War II, and that bigot, hatred, greed, and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
