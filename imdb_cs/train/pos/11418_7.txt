I first saw this film during the International Film Studies course. I am a "non-traditional" student, and perhaps for reasons of long life or wisdom, appreciated the slow, reflective stimulation of the storytelling of the film. Emblazoned with warmth and dust of dry climate, the story is deeply psychological, full of multi-layered symbolism, and the articulating overturning of the subject is "other" in a country that you do not understand. the understanding that comes is full of unresolved memories and subjectivity of outsiders. Made almost 20 years ago, he is also the forerunner of many other international films that explore colonial themes in colonized spaces, helpless with the nuances of the cultures they have entered into. Much richer films - and heavily funded - work that has been produced since they reflect the same topics: Indochina, Nowhere in Africa there are not two, which in comparison may cause chocolat to look pale and boring. It has no adrenaline pump or extreme violence. Combat is mental, emotional and subtle. But what has been said is a great movie worth watching.
