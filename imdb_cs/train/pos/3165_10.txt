It was one of the most entertaining and biggest sitcoms that hit national television. Her unfortunate show is not amongst the great sitcoms that really belong to. The actors did a great job, and the season one to six was a show at the high point. Although Season Seven was not as great as the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was a real problem. Without Topher Grace or Ashton Kutcher, the show simply disintegrated. They did not say too much that the other actors were not great if one of the two main characters left, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also great) will have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help even because the fans showed that they were not well received. I believe that if the concert ended a year ago, surely it would surely go down in history as one of the greatest sitcoms. Season 8 was a little boring, but the final was great. I'm going to miss a show, I just hope I'll wake up one day to find out that the show is back like the 80th year with the same occupation because I just get out of it.
