The word "classic" is worthy today, but this film deserves appeal. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthaus (probably the best live comic book in the world), and the late laments of George Burns make a comic masterpiece. It's interesting to think about what the movie would be, as if it had not been avoided to kill Jack Benny playing part of George Burns as planned. Likewise, it is unlikely that the scene of the gathering in Matthau's flat will be preceded by a divisor. Surely one of my desert island movies. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
