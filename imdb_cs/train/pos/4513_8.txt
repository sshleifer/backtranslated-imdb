A child with ideals trying to change things around. A boy who is forced to become a human being for the sake of the system. A system that conceals the truth and violates the rights to existence. The boy, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands and tells the truth. A family that is falling apart and fighting against it. A movie from which you can not hide. You see things and hear things and you feel that until the day you die, you hope it never really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and boy with, sorry, balls, boy who will not accept things that do not let anything happen to him, a child with strength and a boy who acts like a professional , just as he never did anything else, this movie ends its end and anyone who wants to see how the abuse is in the 1960s.
