This movie was great. It describes in detail the struggle between the devoted detective against the determined ignorance of the damaged Communist regime in Russia in the 1980s. I give this film high marks of the fact that it is a boundless view of the birth and the development of a forensic investigation in a globally isolated (thanks to the Regime regime). This is a graphic movie. It represents an unbiased image of violence and its tragic remains. Nothing is a "covered candy" with exaggerated blood or blood that separates us from the cruel reality on the screen. This film is based on the Russian serial murder Andrei Chikatilo. I am so familiar with the real story that I have a very deep appreciation for how they have retained the real film. It's not a comedy, but for those who appreciate the dry and dark humor, this film is a must.
