Several summer camps were randomly sent to the universe by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship ran briefly. They had to send someone to the space station to get the gas tanks etc. <br /> <br /> First, this film is not possible in reality. But it gives you warm feelings of whatever you can if you set your heart. It is amazing to see those young actors who, after so many years, still look the same way. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000, it was shot in 1986) There are quite a few people in this film who still work in Hollywood. universe. It does not look incredible. It's about 2 hours long, running so fast you do not even notice it. You know it's not true, but until then you get to the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good family film. <br /> <br />
