Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: the film "Red Scare" without hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing but McGuffin, which ignites the conspiracy. Pickpocket Richard Widmark releases free woman Jean Peters from a wallet containing a microfilm strip; unknown to either of them, carries a secret vital to the Cold War. Peters, as it happened, was under the supervision of FBI agents who are as stealing as a theft like the one who runs it, with a cowardly comic Richard Kiley. When trying to get a precious film, both parties are helped by Thelma Ritter, a permanent old jane who is always on his ears and willing to sell what he hears. Fuller draws on the colorful palette of tempo and tonality in telling the story, which is a race against times of escalating brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, its summer solstice in Manhattan feels almost acrid. The love scenes between Peters and Widmer become an unstable mix of turbulence and tendency and are recorded in "Again," a song depicted by Ida Lupino in Road House, also played by Widmara. The tempo relieves Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene - one of the most noisy vignettes in all the noose and a kind of oasis of oasis in a movie emptied with sentimentality. This is the only work of writer / director Fuller in the strictest boundaries of the Noir cycle; his later exploration of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, Naked Kiss, Underworld USA) never resulted in synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street.
