When I first discovered Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to realize I saw the original and loved it. So I had even more reason to watch. Well, I was looking. It was really better than most of the sequel for TV movies. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you will find yourself) and I did not like most of the characters, including Brian. But the film needed sober and poisonous figures to keep Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) once again. In the end, I met Stanley and his happy ending. If you liked the original lake cabin, or if you love horror films without blood, I recommend you watch it.
