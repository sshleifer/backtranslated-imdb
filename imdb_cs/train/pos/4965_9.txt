Of all the football films I've watched, it's one of the two best. The second is fever. But the hero is the biggest world cup ever and is probably the biggest player ever to play in the World Cup, Diego Maradona. This story focuses mainly around him, but also revolves around the other giants of the game at that time. The musical score is evocative and the pictures are strong. The story of Michael Caine is appropriately uninterested and also dramatic. This story is not about individual World Cup games; it rather concerns the emotions of the players and the beauty of the action itself. Exciting games like France in Brazil (one of the best games of all time) were covered in the same spirit. The final Argentine in Germany was also in the same spirit. highly recommended. The classic world football. be watched again and again, esp, if you are a Maradona fan.
