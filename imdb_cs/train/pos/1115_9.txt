This is one of those unfortunate movies that have suffered even more sad, unhappy death in the box office. I saw this movie in a local art cinema, resurrected, shortly after it was tanked in the main cinemas. She definitely deserves to be treated for the second time (or even a third). Sandra B. takes it to the edge by doing a spoken word and taking some of the famous songs in this song (her version of Hank William's I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry could easily move you to tears). Maybe sometimes, viewers will be ready to take this movie a bit more seriously (but without some well placed laughs). The film moves at a fast pace (thanks to some nice editing) so some viewers do not find it still and boring. Perhaps the revival is just in the pipeline.
