There were times when this film seemed to be much more complicated than it should have been, but I think it's part of the spell. The detection capability of Detective Phil Vance appears to be greater than all oriental wizards from the time he agrees to a final assessment of how murders were committed. Dropping the dagger to the Chinese vase was kicker for me; I mean, could not someone just drop it? Vance (William Powell) soon had a film about Archer Coe's "psychological inability" to kill himself - I had to think about it for a while. I wondered if there was any scientific basis for this concept to be true without studying psychology itself. It seems logical, but it's always the case that does not meet the rules. You know, I got kicked out of a disturbed coroner (Etienne Girardot) that reminded me of Dr. McCoy said a few times, "I'm a doctor, not a magician," and "I'm a doctor, not a detective." I can imagine that DeForrest Kelley watches the film and says, "I'll have to use it sometimes." Once the identity of the killer is revealed, it does not seem like a big surprise, but until then it really does not know. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film did not answer the central question he had named the title, and the murder that I really cared about, who killed Ghillie Sir Thomas MacDonald?
