I do not know the stars or modern Chinese teen music - but I know it's a really fun movie when I see it. Kung Fu Dunk is a pure hollywood in its values ​​- it is played with laughter, for love, and is a great combination of Kung Fu and basketball. Everyone seems to have a lot of fun doing it - production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks shiny than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy of the abandoned orphan who grows up in kung fu school just to be kicked out and then discovered superstardom as a basketball game (and love and more etc.) is great - fun and extremely fun. Thanks to great events and good dialogue, it's simply enjoyable - for all ages - and our money was one of the best family films we've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunka a chance - we were really glad we did - a good sports comedy movie.
