this independent film was one of the best films in the high lawn festival I've ever seen. I loved that there were so many films that were great on the film, plus everything I got and the crew I had the chance to meet was totally phenomenal. I thought Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely loyal to his role for Disney actor, I was overwhelmed by his talent to go from comics with a cute teenage to such an adult role without any problems that the talent in the movie was amazing that the cinema was great, you want to see an independent film , it's really what you should see. I think Mr. Gruver would be so proud to have such a show at his festival, and his parents loved the film enough to get a favorite audience and saw it again. it was really a great movie, it was dark and fun and sad and really emotional, it was just wonderful. I am sincerely excited about this film and I really do not want to spoil it because nobody sees it and really amazes it. I think these filmmakers really have it, more work from them in the future.
