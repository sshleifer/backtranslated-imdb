The undisputed highlight of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. On the other hand, it is wildly comic and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone do better than O'Toole? I think yes. What a big face the man has! The story is strange and utterly disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially at the end), but it also touches and succeeds on many levels. But I felt that the film was basically about Peter O'Toole's light performance, and I'm sure I would not even have enjoyed half that if it was not.
