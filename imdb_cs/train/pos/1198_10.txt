Like most other reviewers, I first saw this movie (on TV, never on the big screen) when I was a teenager. My dad has always watched this film and recommended it to me, and I must say it's not just right, but this film has stayed with me forever in over two decades since I first saw him. I've seen it twice as much as three times (I put another watch a few days ago), and in the meantime it did not lose anything of its impact. It's a great movie that's worth seeing! Manr sees Peckinpah's RIDE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best Westerns to have a realistic look at life in the old west, but the hardly known LAST HUNT is definitely a better film and was even half a dozen years earlier. Actually, it was about 3 decades ago, or maybe it is still ... <br /> <br /> Though he thought hard and surely he saw the 100s of the West (I like this genre), I can not remember any western like this one. The two men were tied in part with hatred, partly because they probably had no other option, surrounded by beautiful Mrs. Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian who led the life of buffalo killers until fate reached one of them. <br /> <br /> Nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget about its end and the last images of this gem. When the camera moves and turns away from Mr. Taylor, the white buffalo skin (on the tree) appears and the echoes of the past, when all the hatred began, are again present. Mr. Taylor has his buffaloes but eventually got him buffalo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to top performances of all involved, intelligent scenarios and great dialogue, it should also be mentioned that LAST LOK is greatly photographed, seldom I saw the West that he shot well (aside from those directors Anthony Mann who are also greatly photographed) that all places are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the image very well. And director BROOKS is a really great story. Master craft! He did a lot of great movies and was successful in almost every imaginable genre, but even in such a prolific career as this, LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best, if not the best. <br /> <br /> It would definitely deserve a higher score, compared to a 7-something RIDE HIGH COUNTRY enjoying.
