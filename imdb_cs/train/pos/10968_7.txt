The gray gardens were breathtaking and crazy, and she just could not really look. It was so weird, funny and sad and bad and ?????? .. really no words can describe. Gray Gardens's move is out of bizarre. I found out that this movie is read by my uncle John Big Great Bathroom Reader at the Bathroom Reading Institute, and it was much borrowed and hit the top of my movie watching queue. This film is about the most beautiful most eccentric people ever shot. One should watch it for my favorite Edie outfit, which I'm sure contains curtains. When I'm older, I almost want to be just like Great Edie, who has a normal and social nature on her feet.
