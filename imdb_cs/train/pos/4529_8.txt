As is well known among the long hair of youngsters who are incredibly interested in the quiet rant Herr Graf, in the summer, the aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and extraordinary places to avoid the heat and also the hordes of rough people who have been relieved. Such bizarre journeys all over the world also take place in "The Three Ages", the charming and elegant work of a silent, old-handed work, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. <br /> <br /> The first segment focused on the age of stones due to the kinship this aristocrat felt in antiquity. prefers the second segment that takes place during the glory of Rome (this should include the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, that is, barbarians or the same Germans). Of course, the third segment takes place in modern times, but this aristocratic archbishop thinks that even 100 years ago he should qualify as modern. A leitmotiv that forces Mr. Keaton and his companions to travel and endure strange and merry happenings during three different age categories is a quest for love, a very complicated topic to understand for aristocrats who prefer to search for money and their own interest. Each time the "Three Ages" appears in the Schloss Theater, it is always a pleasure to watch a fun, humorous, silent film (even for a serious German musician), a gag full of gadgets, gaming, pratfalls and acrobatics, visual and amazing technical tricks, Quiet delicatessen, which is perfect for one to endure different and rough summer demands. And now, if you allow me, I have to take a vacation temporarily because this German earl must flirt with an old German heiress who does not look like her age.
