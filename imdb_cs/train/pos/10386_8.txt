what's wrong with your people, if you're not blown away by the action sequences of cars and jessica Simpson's hot body, then you're mainly bored in the head. Of course the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think it should be. It was fun and fun, I never watched the show when I was younger, I just saw one episode, and when I watched the movie, I felt it had the same atmosphere. The movie chairs were practically shaking, and the sequence of the vehicles was good because it did not sound like it and did not pull out like some scenes in two fast two-phases. and Jessica Simpson is just hot, I just wish she used it more in action sequences. Overall I had the hell to watch this and I would soon see it and buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
