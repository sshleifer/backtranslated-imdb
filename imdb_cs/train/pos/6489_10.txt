I watched this series when it first came out in the 70s and was 14 years old and I watched her in the house of my best friends because my dad did not want to look at it. Every week, a weekly ritual, and whatever it is, say that two fourteen-year-olds who look at a document with almost impressive silence must mean that it's something special. Wide shot of World War II events causes a difficult subject of the document. the creators divided it into what they considered the most important key events and devoted one episode to each. Some episodes have long been a "wolf pack" that covered nearly all six years of the Battle of the Atlantic. Stalingrad had one episode for himself. <br /> <br /> This document was not done today simply because most of the interviewees are dead. The list of significant players that appear gives a wonderful view of thinking at the time. Anthony eden foreign secretary, Carl donnitz, Ead u-boat, Albert speer, pet architect a certain and later arms minister for Hitler. In one of the later episodes we see the traudl junge, the Hitler secretary, who was with him in the bunker, and it was that he dictated his last will and will - he left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and escaped the Russian lines. These and many others play an important role in the realism of the events that are displayed. If I have any criticism of the series is that code-breakers are not covered by the park, but the revelation of their part in the war appeared after the series was made so I can not blame the creator program. <br /> <br /> The introductory titles and music is spectacular, and Narrator Olivier's narrative brings the natural gravity scenario. The best documentary series ever made? undoubtedly
