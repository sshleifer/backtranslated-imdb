Not just a successful John Cleese TV project ever did, "Strange Case" has the feeling of a first draft that was launched into production before any revisions could be made. There are a few stupid thoughts in the whole range and even a few clever ones, but the story as a whole unfortunately does not add too much. Arthur Lowe is a horn, although Dr. Watson, bionic bits and all. "Good God."
