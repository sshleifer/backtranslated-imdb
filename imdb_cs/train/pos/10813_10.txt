I turned and saw the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I read now. I admit that I caught my jaw when pork chops and water melons started to be put in, but people can not look at this film as a stereotypical or racist work. It is largely a black film black, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was completely segregated and stereotypes for the people involved were jokes of their time, old trends exaggerated humor. We see that modern black movies do the same, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho" and "hood" and the like. I think when you look back in the 80's you will find that today's films will look equally racist. What the audience should appreciate about this film is the Waters talent and pint-size Sammy Davis Jr., who knocks his current, Shirley Temple, and looks remarkably the same face as he's an adult. Everyone involved in this movie apparently had a lot of fun. Why do not you enjoy it for what it is, instead of what you think it should be?
