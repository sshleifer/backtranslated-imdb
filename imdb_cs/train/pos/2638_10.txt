One of the best films for all ages. You will never be able to look again at LION KING without having to think about the extra history that this movie delivers. For nearly 40 years I've been following this with my wife and two sons after work at night and I did not smile and enjoy the film for so long. <br /> <br /> Take time and watch with kids. It reminds you how Disney used to be when you were young.
