Really ... and an incredible film that, although not very popular ... extremely touching and almost life changing ... was at least for me. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my favorite list of movies .... it's number one now .... <br /> <br /> It's a very moving film that everyone should see .. The Man in the Moon ..... it's just unbelievable. It's now my favorite movie and I just saw it today and I would recommend it to everyone over 15 if you are a bit mature ...... If you really do not try to feel the emotions of a character, I will never get the real meaning and value of this movie ... But it's really incredible ... you just look at it because it changes the way some people look at life ... it's worth seeing 5/5
