Story: On the island of Texel, photographer Bob, who shoots the magazine, meets mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and longing for life intruders Bob, who had suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not as simple as it seems. Despite Kathleen, Bob gets into a dangerous net. Will Kathleen be able to gain his trust? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely even if it stays a bit on the surface and it would be nice if the figure of "psychology" would be resolved a little more. Why do these people do what they do? What motivates their choice? That's what gives the depth of the movie and something I mean. The story never reaches the emotional climax, even though the characters go so far as to justify it. So you do not know the characters at this deeper level. Actors do a good job and play in a very natural and "credible" way, but I think it would be better if Kathleen played a younger actress, because the naivety of this character does not work entirely for adult, up woman. The camera is nice and there are some great scenes of nature on the island. I give the film 7/10.
