"The Golden Child" was the first film by Eddie Murphy from his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And though it's not as good as "Cop", it's fun comic adventure. Murphy's star as a seeker for lost children, who is assigned the most unusual case. His task: to find a title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could be called "Beverly Hills Cop and Temple of Doom," because parts of this film play as Spielberg's adventure, a bit like a comedy by Indiana Jones. She has a comedy with laughter and adventure with special effects. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
