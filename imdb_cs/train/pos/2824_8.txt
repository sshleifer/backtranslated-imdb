Greta Garbo is an American film debut as an analogy of how our lives can be swept away from our fate and action, as in a torrent, which causes us to lose part of ourselves on the road. Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with the character of Ricardo Cortez Don Rafael, the landowner. Ricardo falls in love with her but is too easily influenced by his dominant mother. Leonora ends homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous singer and develops the reputation of being a free woman. In fact, part of her attitude is bitterness over Rafael's abandonment. She returned home to visit her family and eventually opposed Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that it is famous for La Brunna, and Garbo is part of her role as a diva who she really was, and she enjoys such great hopes in her later productions. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez reminds a lot of Valentino looks in this part and he was modified as a Valentino MGM clone, although he never thought he might actually be and was right. He is faithful in the mismatched part as a weak guy mom mom, and allows himself to age realistically, but comically at the end of the film. He can not win Leonor when he returns home, and later, when he watches her, his courage is undermined. The film is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences and sets that Spain is displaying at the time. you are looking for. There are also some fine secondary performances by old timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall, and Mack Swain. Although it is a story of lost love and missed chances, I do not think that Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together because she needed a more traditional woman and she was a very career and I do not think she was happy in a small village. The end is true to life and does not take any punches. Look at it as the American film debut Garbo and the forerunner of the next
