all the performances in the first season were really amazing. the first look you get from Max and Zach is via Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or when I call them minis. minis does the best acting work I've ever seen. main actors and actresses, such as Jessica Alba Michaela Weatherly, etc., to forget that you are looking at a fictitious t.v. show that this show seems to come alive. everything in all this is the best show I've ever watched
