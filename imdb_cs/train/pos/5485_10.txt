One of the most up-to-date and most interesting documents you will ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look at the political dynamics prevailing throughout the Western Hemisphere. While basically another chapter in the story of the "backed Latin American coup in the US", this film records in real-time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political savvy and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insights this movie offers are invaluable. Man gets clear examples of private media, as an impressive power for mass fraud and propaganda. We see how poor people in Caracas struggled with the brutal reality of "American politics." Man gets a clear sense of imminent destruction if people fail to deal with this obvious tyranny, which was a conspirator suddenly and illegally directed at them. We also see arrogance and fascism, supported by the CIA, private media, plutocrats, and generals who conspired to return Venezuela back to Washington. Although Chávez is cleverly led by President Hugo Chávez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him after Chavez is forcibly kidnapped by the renegade generals. Their response is the pinnacle of the film. If one strives for an excellent portrait of what the US government, Hugo Chavez and revolutionary Venezuela are about, this movie is it!
