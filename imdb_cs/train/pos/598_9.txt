heres the funny fact, I was a kid in the movie, one in the bed. :) I've been 19 years old. my parents took me for the exam for that part, at that time we lived in Texas. I think I only made $ 80 for her, but I have not been in it for too long. My parents said I would cry when I was happy and would like to cry. I was mixed. I have a special and sad fact ... and I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio, I work with walgreen. I graduated here in Texas, but I mostly lived in Maryland. This movie is a great movie, though a good concept. I've seen it several times in my 19 years.
