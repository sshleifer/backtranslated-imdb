<br /> <br /> The film was shot right after the war and was shot to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. It ended in receiving the honor of being the first Royal Premiere after WWII. <br /> <br /> A remarkable film blends together the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud's psychology, the fathers of the founders of America, and many others along the long stairs with special effects in their childhood) and heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds absurd, this clever screenplay leads and dances the spectator between the sky and the country with the skill of a mountain goat and represents a charming lightness that seldom corresponds in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Be prepared for your heart to warm up this sweet, innocent and enchanting love story. Roger Livesey behaves like a man who has a steal show !!!! <br /> <br /> The British cinema should cry because it remembers how well it was in the early postwar years. <br /> <br />
