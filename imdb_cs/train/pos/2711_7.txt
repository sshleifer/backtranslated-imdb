When I think Women in Prison, my opinion often comes to the dirty Italian / Spanish production of directors such as Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; and while these movies are often very inert, they are also very similar and once you've seen them; you could see them all. I must admit that these types of films are generally not my favorite; but in fact, on a few occasions, outside Italy and Spain, the idea of ​​women behind bars was very well done; and Roger Corman's New World Pictures are responsible for some of the best. Caged Heat is the directorial debut of Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme and is a well-made little movie with lots of fun! The film, of course, focuses on the story of a girl who is caught committing a crime and sent to a female prison where she is introduced to a number of violent prisoners. This prison is dominated by the things on the wheelchair that is linked to Chief McQueen; and she moves into the game the girls wear; which led them to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is much lighter than the one I'm used to women in jail; but this is more than offset by some great action scenes and dialing, and it ensures that Caged Heat is enjoyed all over the world. It has to be said that the story is not very original or ambitious and, in principle, follows a structure similar to many other women in the prison films that preceded it; but that's not such a big problem. The film is never bored and is adorned with exceptional scenes; including an attempted escape at field work and bank robbery. The film is assisted in a way from a man who would go to the helmet masterpiece of Silence of the Lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts; including the best of all legendary Barbara Steele in the role of chief prison supervisor. Overall, Caged Heat does not need to think much to the end; but it's a brilliantly fun little film for grinding, and someone with this type of movie will definitely want to watch.
