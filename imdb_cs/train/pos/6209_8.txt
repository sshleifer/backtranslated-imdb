When I first heard that Hal Hartley continued to work with Henry Foole, I was excited (it's been a personal favorite for several years) and then I was careful when I heard he had something to do with terrorism. When I just saw it, I was surprised to find that it worked while it was still a different kind of film than Henry Fool. Scripture and direction were both dead, and acting was excellent ... strange to go to Hartley to reassemble almost all of the cast until Henry's son, who was only four in the original. However, as I said, this film is completely different from the first one, but it works: I have aligned myself with the change in tone and subject matter of the fact that 10 years have passed and characters will find themselves in very different situations ever since the first film has ended. In that case, unexpected adventures appear ... and that's all I will give away ... not to mention that I will have to see again to really understand what is going on and who is the double cross, who. While it was certainly one of the better movies I've ever seen, it suffers like many sequels with its end because it seems that Hartley plans a third and the movie lets you hang. I'll definitely buy my tickets for Part 3 ("Henry Grim"?) In 2017.
