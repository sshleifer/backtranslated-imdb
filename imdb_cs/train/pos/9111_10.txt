"Capitães de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the revolution in Portugal in 1974. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. Fiction of the story is not a great interest, but the film does not spoil. The heroic acts of Captain Salgueiro Maia are not exaggerated, and the film is also a tribute to his deeds. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25th Revolution. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are great. Lisbon looks beautiful as ever. Do not miss! I enjoyed this movie very much.
