It's a very good Spanish film, but I'm afraid many of them will feel lost because many people around the world do not know what the Spanish Civil War was or when it was fought. As a history teacher, I had a great advantage, but I could easily see how the film could be thoughtful until you heard all the pieces. I doubt this will be a big problem in Spain where this film was made, but for some audiences they may be a little confused later in the movie. The film begins with 12-year-old Carol and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. Years have passed and you are gathering to come to Spain from New York. Despite the peculiarity of Carol, he says relatively good Spanish and much of the film is about how he adapts himself. As to why she and her mother are alone, I'm going to slip through it for those who do not understand that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the part of the Republicans (who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The film gets exceptional marks of its beautiful work with camera and music. A relatively slow and fast step is not bad if you are someone who can receive movies in this way. I have seen several other Spanish films about this war and compare them well - not better or worse - just a decent piece of live film about those left behind as well as a good coming of age. /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which party, the Republicans were mostly socialists and were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as volunteers from many countries (including the US). The nationalists were led by Franco and aided by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
