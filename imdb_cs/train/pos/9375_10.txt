Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This less well-known film is where Cage gives one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget, almost unknown film, but it's one of my favorite films of all time. I found out he was walking down the aisle of a video rental shop and wanted to see that Cage and Hopper (who are also great in the movie) appear together. Go get this and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
