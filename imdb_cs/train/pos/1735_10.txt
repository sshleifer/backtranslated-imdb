Miss DeCarlo's debut has everything the writers could come up with - from the Franco-Prussian War to the American Civil War, the Great American West, San Francisco in his bloom, ballet, opera, vaudeville, coach coach coach and Chinese junk. Just when you thought the story could not get any screws, it does. It's beautiful, she liked her tongue. DeCarl's character (here is Anna Marie - NOT Salome, that's the role she's dancing) is loosely based on the career of notorious Lola Montez, who was a lover of King Prussia, and revolutionized her crown jewels. She fled to the West. There is a city in Arizona called "Salome, where she danced", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez dances Salome role there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fall under her spell are not historically accurate, nor do I think it's a Chinese wise man with a Scottish accent - but it's one of my favorite classics of all time, and DeCarlo is amazingly beautiful all over the world.
