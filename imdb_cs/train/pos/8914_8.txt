I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The city where Jerry was in the market. I remember the whole family going out to watch shooting. I remember who showed me the "Blob" and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to point out that my mother was in the movie. Her hairstyle was the same as Aneta Corsaut, she was sick one evening and they saw Mom and asked her to sit in a car with Steve McQueen for some shots from behind. They paid her $ 25 and gave her the story she was supposed to tell until she died last August. My mother was not a teenager, and it was a few months since the birth of my little sister.
