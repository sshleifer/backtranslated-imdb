The first von von Trier movie I've ever seen has cut the waves. Surely a nice movie, but it definitely stands in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young German American who wants to experience Germany just after the Second World War. He takes the work that his uncle has arranged for him as a guard on a luxury train. Because of his work, he travels after almost completely destroyed Germany, meets with the killing of traitors and looks for the former Nazi parties. The company suffers from corruption. His uncle narrowed his consciousness by concentrating on the work he had as a train on the train. By chance, the main character is involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called "werewolves" who are pushing him to help them put bombs on trains. The atmosphere is stunning. The viewer is taken from the stage scene by a man who tries to place the viewer under hypnosis and counts to wake you up in the new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
