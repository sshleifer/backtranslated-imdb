This movie was amazing ... it made me laugh, it made it like a prank, and mainly it talks about the animals in it! this movie should be seen by all people! this is one of my favorite films and I love him so much that I have to comment !!! to rox! it's so heart to feel and a wonderful story that makes a great and hearty movie! My favorite character is a shadow. it's because I think it's most interesting and charming. I had a golden retriever like a shadow, I miss it so much! he was my best friend and I knew that when he died, he would be happier, but he missed me with all my heart! this movie is the best thing I love and everyone should! Love your pets no matter what they do, and always love them!
