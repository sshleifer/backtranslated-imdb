Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially with regard to what is supposed to be enjoyable today. <br /> <br /> As has been emphasized, it's hardly a real zombie movie, a sweet satire that employs the undead to show their fingers. While there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this film is presented (style 50s), I can not imagine that someone was really scared or off by Fido and his other men. > <br /> While the cast is generally good, I felt Moss and Nelson stepped out. Humor is not on his face, but rather muted; there's a lot of attention to detail, and I've been delighted by a few during the whole movie. This is certainly not a masterpiece in the cinema, but it does not strive for it - instead, Currie succeeds in delivering the heart-warming of the black comedy.
