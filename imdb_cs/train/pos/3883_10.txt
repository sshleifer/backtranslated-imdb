Until I saw this strange on HBO, I never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm glad to have it now! He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely, the comedian has dived so completely into his craft, then Eddie. I could not laugh at the whole performance. If you want to laugh, you have to see this special!
