Brothers with psycho-kinetic powers (yes, really) a duel, not only because of Debra Winger's affection, but really over the secrets from childhood, which left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are unreal touches (the fire brigade acts as a Greek choral choir), but also humor and romance. The soundtrack is greatly similar to how the American werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get, but with fire and I do not think I ever forgot Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), set up her own trailer rockin 'to' is the lady 'invaluable;) <br /> <br /> The best line is missing in the btw section ~' Once you have a clown, never come back! <br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered a DVD from the USA) and if the comments written by those people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3, they will not do it.
