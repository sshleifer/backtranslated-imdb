A great movie when I saw it. I have to say one of my favorite films of all time. I saw it eight times in the theater and got a DVD. As I was older and saw again, I realized the film was average. Compared to movies that are known as good comedies, that's nothing. I think Rock was cheerful in the movie, and the whole switching with racial affairs breaks down small obstacles that are great. Also, the idea of ​​how the film is about is a pleasant way of thinking. It's like most of the movie, but also a little twist, which is a very nice touch. Overall, I like the movie, so I give it to me ... <br /> <br /> Good 7/10 for me.
