FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films. His influence has been felt for more than ten years. Some elements that related to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at an audience in the mid-1950s, which has now disappeared, has quite a bit of note and the film sometimes slow stimulation does not help. But the story is a convincing central idea involving the old, defunct Krell civilization and "Monsters from Id" did not lose his appeal and continue to make this film relevant "must see" the film. What I'm most interested in is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The movie never really looked so good on home video and its elements are in dire need of restoration. I hope this will happen soon and we will get a special edition of this SF classic.
