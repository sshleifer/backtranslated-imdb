The soap opera of a small, cheerful woman (Kay Francis), who works at a local stand, performs as a front lady in the local theater but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor, who is a ham, a windbags and a skimmer, who arrives in town, he will visit him in his room with us, giving him tips on the star - pretending that his butler is his "manager" who deceived her to believe she has everything she needs, but "experience" to become a great star. Her husband discovers and strikes a guy, resulting in the unexpected death of the actor - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a prison sentence for a bastard. Another thing you know is that she joined a travel Burlesque show in the hope that she would one day get to Broadway and get enough money to get her husband's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in the trunk! has a pretty interesting plot, well, maybe a little exhausted but very melodramatic (with lots of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all * very * extended by the strong, emotional performance of Kay Francis - doing this movie. Also, a well-behaved actress, Minnie Gombell, is helping her act as an "upcoming forty-year-old" lady who works on burlesque and gets involved with Kay. It is worth seeing, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
