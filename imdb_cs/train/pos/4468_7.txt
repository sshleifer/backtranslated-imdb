Two sailors are on vacation - the female man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and they both fall in love with her. It's more, but you probably guessed it. The story (even for the 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and healthy - it gets pretty unpleasant. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and that's too much for such a stupid story. There are also boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. It's still worth grabbing. When Kelly dancing or Sinatra or Grayson singing, it will become magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you will not care. He is shot in the rich Technicolor with all the glitter that MGM had. Actor is all right - Kelly is fine (though she sees him as a lady's man pushing them) and Sinatra is just great (though she saw HIM as a shy guy too pushed it!). Grayson has nothing to do, but she is incredibly beautiful. Some shots literally took her breath! There is a lot of notice: Sinatra and Kelly is a great dance and vocal number; Sinatra sings anything; Grayson's two songs and the fairly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom also makes funny portraits. There's also a little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot just does not hold, but it's still worth capturing. It was a huge hit in its time.
