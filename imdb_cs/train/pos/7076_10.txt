Very strong movie. Bruce is good and Brad too. I think there are two cities missing from the list of reception from the list Bruce remembered. That means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job. Well, the Novikov property seems to me to be a work in this film. But I am convinced that I will return to the future theory of the diversity of the worlds. <br /> <br /> So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. In the theory of parallel worlds a man can meet himself. And I believe that there is no problem. I do not agree with Dr. Brown from Back ... But the story of 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. In spite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe he is really crazy and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost. A sequence of events that can lead her to believe he is from the future. Ball - good it can be some mistake, some forgery. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie - I have to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best.
