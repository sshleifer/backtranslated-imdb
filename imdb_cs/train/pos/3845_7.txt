Unusual, slow, entertaining erotic thrillers with many graphical and "roundabout" scenes that certainly disturb some audiences. However, it will be hard not to appreciate some of the imaginative sequences that this film contains, or to ignore Krabbe's first-rate performance. Verhoeven keeps an interesting ambivalence throughout the movie and plays with the meaning of the hero's vision. Unfortunately, everything has changed in the last 5 minutes, and the unhappy end is not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
