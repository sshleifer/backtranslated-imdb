I am a great fan of Stephen King's work and this film has made me an even bigger fan of the king. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They just moved to a new house and look happy. But behind their house there is a pet cemetery. The new Judy Neighborhood Judge (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the home cemetery. The burial ground is purely evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that if you bury a person (or any kind of animal) in a cemetery, he will return to life. The only problem is that when they return they are NOT ONE, they are evil. Soon after Jud explains everything about Pet Sematary, he starts going to hell. I will not explain it anymore because I do not want to give away some of the main parts of the film. The effects of Pet Sematary were pretty good, but they needed a little work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, especially because it was so original and breathtaking. This movie contains plenty of make-up effects that make the film more scary and dreadful. One of the most basic reasons why this film sent a freeze on her back was in fact make-up effects. There's one character in this movie that's really weird. The character is "Zelda". This special character appears in the movie about three times to be accurate. Zelda is sister Rachel Creed, who died years ago, but Rachel is still haunting her. The first time that Zelda appears in the movie is not generally scary because it does not speak or anything, but the second time it is the worst, and frankly, the second time I'm afraid of my life. There's nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary brings great horrors, some very good acting, first features and fascinating make-up. This is really one of the most popular horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.
