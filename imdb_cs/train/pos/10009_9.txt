When I first read Armstrong Maupins' story, I got into the hands of human drama that Gabriel did not see and those who care and love him. That said, we have now got a film version of a great story and we expect to see the past of Hollywood gloss ... Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner did indeed! Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and allows us to see his struggle with questions of trust both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we met the players on this track, we remind that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. A request to review a book written by a young man will turn into a life-changing event that will help Gabriel find the strength within himself to continue and progress. It's bad that most people avoid this movie. I'm just saying this because the average American probably thinks "Robin Williams in a serious role, it did not help!" PLEASE PASS THIS FILM CHANCE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all need to find and experience in ourselves to be better people. Just as his One Hour Photo film grew as an actor and created another high-quality work of art. Oh, and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale when Jess steals every scene he's in. 1940's front man looks and presence on screen. It's hacks the view that he could have his own movie right now !!
