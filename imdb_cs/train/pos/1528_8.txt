I'm a homework writer, and Diagnosis Murder is my companion for a break after lunch - good, pure fun, good humor and nostalgia for Dick van Dyke's show days. How innocent we were all (and how innocent is Diagnosis Murder). Especially I enjoyed episodes with other nostalgia figures like Joe Mannix. Thieves always catch, good guys go on. Of course, stars like and have a ball without taking too seriously. One beef: why were there so many women or even females? Amanda was too dizzy. It is hard to imagine that he is actually doing something as bad as an autopsy. I hope we have not seen Dick Van Dyke and our family on our screens. for lunch!
