In another of Bugs Bunny's hare, the shorts, the famous leporid * work in a briefcase at the department store when the owner of the Gildersleeve decides to hit him. Of course, this proved to be almost impossible because Bugs apparently knows he's better in the store than Gildersleeve (and knows when to dress). As always, he holds everything that comes with the utmost speed, so you have to wonder how wonderful this cartoon must look like when it first debuted! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a great example of how Looney Tunes looked like in the 1940s before the Termite Terrace burst. But do not make me sick, the cartoons were really good after the refined forms arrived. Anyway, that's great. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and hares.
