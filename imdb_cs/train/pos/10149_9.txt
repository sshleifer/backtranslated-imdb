Sweet funny story of two people who cross the road when preparing for a wedding. The ex-policeman and public school teacher fall in each other in this great setting in New York even though they have married other people. Perhaps a bit sad that "partners" are both A-type celebrities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Not heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for boys - they sell Natasha Henstridge's angle, and galsy - they sell sappy romance, they all win!
