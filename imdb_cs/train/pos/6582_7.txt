Okay, so there is a front view of the Checker Taxi, probably the late 1930s model. It has large triangular front lights. There is also the DeSoto cabin in this black and white, character movement, almost music love has gone through a bad story. It is a real pleasure to see the interiors and fashion of the rooms and hotel lifts from August 19th. Hair, women and women are beautiful. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, it could be great. There is an art loft that would be the envy of every Andy Warhol wannabe. If you watch this to expect the great story of Casablanca or Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. There is a nice little story behind the track model approach in this movie. My copies on DVD with another movie for $ 1 were very visible. The title sequence was cute but not with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. It was a RKO movie, but it did not have a nice Aircraft logo used by RKO. I liked Viktor Mature in One Million, BC, Sampson and Delilah and especially in a violent Saturday. Find out if you can find it. He was amazing in a comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After the Fox. Richard Carlson went on to lead Three Lives on TV in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> Vic Mature was offered part of Sampson's father in Sampson and Delilah remakes. He was supposed to ask him if he had any problems with his father because he was so famous as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is right, I play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
