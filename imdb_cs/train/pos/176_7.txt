SAFE COUPLINGS. This movie was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were in the top two. Okay, so a strange guy who (SPOILER TU) trades with a biker for his dress was funny. That boss was good too. But the film really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. The two should have a lot more time on the screen together. It's a great chemistry. Bathroom Scene - WOW! Romantic, sweet, fabulous. Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress that saves a stranger and ends up in a white house in the middle of the land due to the greed of politicians. To talk about Sarandon, it's a far cry. SPOILERS This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy and satisfies a bit - the political aspect much more than romantic. It touches political issues and hardly conceals romantic areas. <br /> <br />
