Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before I looked at it: <br /> <br /> It's officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. I'm not sure how accurate it is (I wanted to get angry), but it took me a while to hear it. <br /> <br /> * - The preview looked mostly damn cold. It seems to have been "too critical", according to some critics after the fact. * - Obviously so badly that Disney said: "Screw it out, relax again" Spy Kids ". <br /> <br /> So with all that was said, what is the movie? <br /> <br / > Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm a sucker for animated fantasy that includes mixing music and uncontrollable special effects as well, but "Atlantis" goes everywhere. It's a return to all the CGI eye-candy pictures in "Beauty and the Beast "and" Aladdin, "so much so that it's almost the best animator effect.The characters may not be as memorable (except for the doctors case) and the conspiracy is a bit boring but this is not the movie you're watching. (as in "only" about five hundred million or something, I know, animators who would kill to see fifteen dollars) of this film compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." was recorded as evidence of the death of traditional animation, and I do not think it's true. in the movie "South Park" and what does "Final Fantasy" really mean, story and art are all, not the method. I do not know what Disney's return movie is, but I do not think they're out of the picture.
