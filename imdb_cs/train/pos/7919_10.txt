There is no doubt that it's a camp joke, "Full Moon High" is the 50s of young Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) who accompanies his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure, Tony gets a bite and multiplies furs and fangs every time it's a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect in this film is that it can not stand if it has a witch curse and must fulfill its fate - even if it takes twenty years. But otherwise, the movie is just fun as soon as it gets. Ed McMahon's character is a supra-patriotic right-wing yahoo (thinks everyone should listen to Joe McCarthy), coach Kenneth Mars is tense dweeb and then it's more. One of the most eye-catching members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont on "Sanford and the Son" - as a bus driver, which is a great surprise. But perhaps the most fun scene is the change of the presidents; then he and Gerald Ford actually summed up! Anyway, it's a real experience. Since Alan Arkin, who plays a negligent psychiatrist, just won an Oscar last Sunday night and thanked his sons, I wonder if he remembers or did not play with two of them in this movie (except Adam has also his son Anthony Little role). Pretty funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. PS: Director Larry Cohen is probably best known for murderer child killer "It's Alive".
