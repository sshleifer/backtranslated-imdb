After reading the book, I spent $ 3 on this Wal-Mart DVD, and I thought what the hell ... I got a DVD and watched it last night. When I started watching, I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought it was cool ... He seemed to be running relatively slowly when he knew the story and how much it was. By the time I got to my own killing, I was sorry: "How much time is it?" Checked. "One minute? What the hell ?!" I felt incredibly cheated and thought that the film was only a third of the story. But then I was happy to note that the DVD selection of the scene included Part 1 and Part 2. I still had another hour and a half to go! Then I settled down very happily and enjoyed the other half of the film, even more than the first. I admit that I did not see an original film from 1967 (despite my sincere desire), but I have read a novel and felt it was a film with a relative descent, for a two-part television miniseries, that is. I think casting the role of Perry was totally bad and I was jumping on some minor discrepancies, but it's still very well done. The first half stretches a bit, while the other half is much more. I think the film should be adapted like Capote made his book: 1/3 of the murders, 1/3 after 1/3 after killing the killers. Instead, the film does more than 1/2 of the murders, 1/4 after 1/4 after the killers have killed. Again, it makes the other half more exciting, but less convincing during the first half of the move and beyond ... Now I look back and realize that I just made the same mistake in dragging things, so I'm damn damn. Come to watch the movie and create your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
