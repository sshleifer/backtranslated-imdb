This episode of Columbo is probably more famous for director Steven Spielberg as one of the first films. It is necessary to look at the role of Jack Cassidy as a killer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy appears in the later Columba. After all, Columbo fulfills his game as Jack Cassidy. He's a mysterious writer who is about to do a perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be an unpleasant owner / widow who would blackmail him for the money. Rather than losing more money, it will kill her. It's very fun to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's acquaintance with Columbo is curious after seeing this episode repeatedly over the years. What television today forgets the success of the years is that people will want to watch shows again and again if they like the characters. It's not about who does it, how and why, the Columbo's acquaintance, and its sympathy that is high in viewers like me.
