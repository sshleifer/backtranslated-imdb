The arrival of a world-famous conductor of a set of unexpected events and feelings in a small village. Some people are threatened by the way the choir chores and how people are gradually changing. This movie is hearty and leaves a cinema with a smile on his lips and tears in his eyes. It's about bringing the best of the people, and Kay Pollak wrote an excellent script based on the ideas he got for him. The actors are excellent, Michael Nyqvist knows that before, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance for me. It has the liveliest face that will not touch anyone. Per Moberg makes her role as Gabriel's husband almost too good to see. One would only wish if he was determined to play a nice guy one day, so we can see if he can handle that figure. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you have not seen it yet, do it today!
