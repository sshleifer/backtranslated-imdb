Vibrant and indestructible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unscrupulous luck to the life of lonely old sister and brother on Prince Edward Island. Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie. Outstanding production values, a literate script and first-class performances give the story exactly the impression it deserves. <br /> <br /> She takes her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress Anne Shirley is joy, headed by a fourteen-year-old orphan who has completely changed the lives of her new guardians. Fully assured of her main role, Miss Shirley is a joy, a funny viewer with Anne with unrestrained imagination, rapid temperament and not so secret grief. Playing a strict friend who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also fully controls her role; the viewer will be able to imagine that this woman with a sharp tongue is slowly rejecting Anna's affection and childish innocence. The Australian character of OP Heggie's actor gives one of his best performances as Westley is a shy, gentle brother who welcomes Anna to his heart from the moment he arrives to take her out of the station. Tom Brown is the most enjoyable schoolboy to catch Anna's attention. Sara Haden is suited as a carrier. Charley Grapewin uses most of his few moments as Doctor Avonlea.
