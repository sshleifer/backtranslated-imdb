Other TV films should be like this. I saw it back in 1993 when it was the first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both gorgeous, giving a very courageous and realistic performance. Weber was especially good, turning his extraordinarily spooky and compliant performance as a child cripple / murderer. This movie has really raised my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed the "Hoosiers", which was somewhat formalizing and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same sharp, simple realism that is so tempting. If you like movies from television that are unpredictable and are full of surprises, you will see if it is possible. The side story about Hunta and Fahey is also tempting without worsening the story.
