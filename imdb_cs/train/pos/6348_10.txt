Jim Carrey is as good as usual and although there are quite a few "Jim Carrey Moments," it's certainly not the "Jim Carrey" movie. It focuses mainly on children and I managed to look forward to such a film. He was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so those who expected to be weird over the top comedy were disappointed. The movie has beautiful moments and works well as a movie for children. I can not say I loved this movie but I'm not its target audience again!
