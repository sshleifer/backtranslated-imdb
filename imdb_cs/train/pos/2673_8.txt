The Path of Hope (1990) is a journey that many nomadic and poor Turks do to live in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as Westerners that they give up their lives and live in an attempt to reach out to the promised land. So many of them are cheated by greedy cheaters, who make money by offering huge charges for desperate people who are by no means victorious. One family suffers from cold, treacherous mountain ranges and predatory criminals only to find out that at the end of the tunnel there is not always a shining white light. This problem exists all over the world, not just in America. Some people usually forget it. A heart-shaped film breaker that lets you think, why at the end. <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
