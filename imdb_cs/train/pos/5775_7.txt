C'mon people, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It's a great, bloody horrible movie with a cheerful bad actress and two incredibly sad hillbills that give the conceiving factor. Boys on request with two boats are movie! LOL and you'll love the ship's scene where the English guy and his wife talk about all the stars and it's nocturnal and sunny. Bloody cheerful! You can say they did not care about the plot, but they just wanted to blow the film out of the movie as quickly as possible. In the bottom line, you will like it if you like a 70 year old lock.
