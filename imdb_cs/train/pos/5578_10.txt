A cheerful and unobtrusive look at the dating world is portrayed in this comedy off beat by the first writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds when four male protagonists meet each week in the local dining room to get to know the dating of the misfortune. We meet Brad: Pretty street swing on the street with a quick and sharp tongue; Zeek: cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: Sexually confused, nice guy with affinity for hand creams and masturbations; and Eric: a married guy who values ​​his weekly meeting with his friends in the hope of enlivening his boring and banal married existence. The experience and suffering of the only single lives in New York are funny expressed, mirrored in Sex in the City and HBO in the new comedy The Mind of Married Man, and bring gorgeous light. The story turns when the three singlettes meet Mia - Amanda Peet plays witty - and they all fall on it. Each of them is seduced by their unusual ability to adapt to the personalities they exhibit. When they realize that they all met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her as their friendship. Whipped is a realistic picture of the dating world that the critic did not recognize. It was missing in clear language. Protagonists are the cartoons of real people. Exaggerations are hysterical, they mix satire and humility, and they should not be taken as seriously as criticism suggests. In this movie, you will laugh from the beginning to the end.
