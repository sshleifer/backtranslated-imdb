"Moonstruck" is a love story. There is not one novel, at least three, but they all have the same family. Lorett's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). He does not love him, but he is a sweet and good man. When he went to visit his dying mother in Italy, Loretta met Johnny Brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny are not talking in five years, and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they fall instantly for themselves. How this story and love stories about Loretta's parents and uncles and aunts develops them is something you just have to see for yourself. Everyone seen is a delight to watch, with Cher as a bright star in the middle of everything. He won and really deserved the Oscar of that year. The hand is pretty good and Gothic and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are amazing. This movie is funny, charming and therefore very pleasant.
