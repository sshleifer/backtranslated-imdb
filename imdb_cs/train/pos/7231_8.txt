The usual cat and mouse are hiding until Jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink. He had a clear idea of ​​torturing Tom without knowing it. The cat is wise and tries to do things to "see" the jerry, even if it's not stupid. Of course, Jerry gets Butch aka Killer aka Spike the dog into the act (although it's late in a short time, and his post is minimal really) Brilliant animated short that reminded me of the white mouse that frightened Tom so badly. Most gag works and all violent because any good Tom and Jerry short should really be. This cheerful cartoon can be found on a DVD disc called "Tom & Jerry." <br /> <br /> My rating: B +
