I saw this movie when I was young, and I remembered that it was one of the first films that I really loved was not an action movie or a comedy. So in my later years I decided to watch again and see if it was just nostalgia or there was really something in the movie. To my surprise, the film kept to my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not too big, and it actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical instrument) and everything for me very useful. I was surprised because the last childhood films I've ever visited did not go through my minimal demands for decent film, yet this movie, which I first saw in the second year, screamed me today as if she were screaming at me. Maybe it's because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that I felt and that is why the filmmakers are making films (of course, money). Yes, there are deficiencies in continuity. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The film itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for bad things in life because nothing is perfect and this movie gets 10, not because it's perfect. It only gets 10 because she felt me.
