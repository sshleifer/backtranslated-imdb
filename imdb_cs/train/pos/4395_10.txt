One of my favorite movies, which was overlooked by too many movie visitors, the observation that made me think. Most of the young actors who became major stars were Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the actress was excellent and each of the actors mentioned memorial performances, especially Meyers, who portrayed the evil villain he had killed for killing. When the biographies and achievements of the director (although he won the Academy Award) and actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. I discovered the film on DVD by accident and became one of my most frequently watched films. However, seldom everyone is seen on the cable. I look forward to reading what others are suggesting are the reasons why this film is not well known.
