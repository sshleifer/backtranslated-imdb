Three flashes are the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and Princess) who will work with Ahmad; three are songs, each associated with the same characters. Three times Ahmad pronounces the absolute word "Time" in his statement on love for the princess and answers his three questions at his first of three meetings. So strong is the impression that the princess will resist the three attempts that Jaffar conquers on her - three consecutive remarks: deception, hypnosis and memory erasure. Jaffar, however, possesses what he describes as three inevitable instruments of domination over a woman: a whip, a force, and a sword. The third is the number of flying subjects: a mechanical horse, Genie and Genie and a magical carpet. Genie offers three Abu's wishes in the first of three meetings; three times Genie laughed in mountain gorges, and three are his considerations of human fragility before he leaves. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn (armed guards, giant spider and giant squid). Three are the tools of justice: the magic eye that shows Abu the future, the magical carpet that transports it just in time to save Ahmad and the princess and bow and arrow to do Jaffar. The number three is a spell, and there is a spell in this movie.
