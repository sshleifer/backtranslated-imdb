It is simply one of the best interpretations of Dicken's classic story. The script closely follows the story originally written by Dickens and captures the perfect balance between the film atmosphere and the gaming atmosphere. Spectators who like any format can find enough story rooted in their stylish selection style. George C. Scott brings a gorgeously realistic approach to the Scrooge character and is very convincing in the character-driven character development of ghost visits. I found that he had managed to get me to the extent that I sympathized with the old fool, which seldom happened in other versions. The excellent work done by supporting actors greatly contributes to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas Carol I've seen.
