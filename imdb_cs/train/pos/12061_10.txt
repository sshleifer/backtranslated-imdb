Every moment in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are created, and one is totally crazy with his utter brilliance. It's no less than a diamond! This is a movie that is overwhelmed by excitement, cool expectations and a dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And, of course, it probably contains one of the most exciting sequences in the horror history! Every time I see the movie, until the moment you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I'm scared of reason, but it will never happen; I've never done it right and I found myself terrified as the first time I saw it! Now it is necessary to say that to scare such a crazy fan of horror, it is nothing but pure perfection. Unlike Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud of the art of acting, they do not need any special effect to broadcast the atmosphere, they rely on the strength of the strong story and the craze (in this case) the design and the expectation. Every single element is perfect, from sets, acting, story to a dreadful atmosphere. Pauline Moran would certainly be able to make the devil whine, that's for sure! As a last point, if you do not like this piece of madness for some reason, then you do not know what the horror is, and you honestly do not deserve it. Thank you!
