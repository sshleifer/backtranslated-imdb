I never saw it when I was a kid so it was visible with fresh eyes. I have never heard of it and rented it to my 5-year-old daughter. And Christopher Walken's idea of ​​singing and dancing has raised me. Special fx are raw and singing, and the dance is average. But the story is great. My daughter was stunned. I loved watching Walken in this role and thinking about what the future will have for him. Very fun to see him dancing! And if the songs were not great, at least it was not Disney's sweet sweets. The Ogre scene was a little frightening for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we recently read "Puss in Boots" and I was interested in the improbability of the story. But despite being true to almost all aspects, Walken's acting made it plausible. Great fun. I was looking at it with my daughter.
