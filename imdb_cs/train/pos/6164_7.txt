Are we really doing "video nasties"? Below the mask of a 8MM digital broadband broadband remake, that's pretty good. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much of a story, and it sometimes happens as a travel book because our heroine scans the dirty stains of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. But I'm rather churlish for 'depraved' scenes, including everything from hot wax, harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning, headaches and some. These scenes are undamaged and it's a shame that Bruno and his budget could not stretch so that all the imaginations they introduced became more than mere cartoons.
