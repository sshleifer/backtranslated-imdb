I find it very interesting that Lee Radziwill, sister Jackie Kennedy and the cousin of these women, encourages Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of the film. They could be considered as "skeletons" in the family wardrobe. Other DVD features include several contemporary fashion designers who have attributed some of their ideas to these women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion would find the fascinating discussion of these designers. (ie, "Are nuts or something missing?"). This movie is hard to come by. Netflix does not have it. Facades do.
