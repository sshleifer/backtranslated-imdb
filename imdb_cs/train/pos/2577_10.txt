My father grew when he saw George Reeves as Superman, and when I was little, he had an episode on VHS and let me see them including this movie (handing them over to the family if that's the case) and I love him. > <br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with oil and mines, and dead men appear radioactive and focused on a city that is considered deadly and it is up to Superman to stop this chaos. > <br /> It's so beautiful and fun. Special effects and sound of old style - the crew drew such beauty with such little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little boy and now I'm 16, it just shows how timeless and classic these adventures are.
