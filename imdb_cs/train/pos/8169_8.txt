This is a cruel mess and is quite convincing. Corbin Bernson is in great command of this film with his amazing depiction of a blonde control freak eponymous GP. Linda Hoffman plays her cheating wife and she is very easy on her eye - unfortunately for her, a little "jingle" with a guy from the pool brings a terrible punishment in a way a good doctor knows best - a pity that nice smile! The last half-hour of the film is devoted to Bernson's personality, which is completely lost and the spotlight turns on young actress Virginy Keehn. Extremely talented performer, removes the reflector from the moment it pops out. Nice legs!
