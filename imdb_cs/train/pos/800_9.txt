I could not be more excited; Only eight years old in 1983, I saw the movie Star Wars! The best day of my life should happen. At that time, my only experience with star wars was just a few HBO Star Wars shots. I have not even seen the Empire returning yet. <br /> <br /> And boy, I did that day for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spacecraft. The Emporer. Light sword with green blade! Wow! Since that magical day I have had to watch this movie a hundred times. At this point, I can not get an accurate estimate. With these different views, I have noticed that this film - REAL Episode III - has its own mistakes. Of course, in the context of the Star Wars movie, those "mistakes" are more like "quirks". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magic day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had mine. And this was Star Wars.
