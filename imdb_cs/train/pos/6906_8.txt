I like this movie. It was funny, cute, silly and fun. They had a delicate cast, and some critics really bothered for reasons that I really do not understand. No, it was not "Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck," but it was a nice movie. Julia was an excellent playable psychotic "man for a man". The story is a little stupid to be sure, but this is not a high drama, people. It happened to me that I saw a film review, probably the only good one he had gotten, and then he appeared in the night to find a movie. I've never heard it smell until I've seen it, and I'm glad to see it. Finally, I bought the VHS cassette on the purchase contract and I look at it several times a year.
