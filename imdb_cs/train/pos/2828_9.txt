After watching him for half a year I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. I'm not disappointed because I'm one of those tough SMAP fans who need to see all their work and I finally saw the so-called hot film Goro. But I could not believe Goro was forced to make the film as such. In his worthy self, I'm sure he assumed that he made this film. However, they found the perfect person to look for embarrassment, poorly cool and half-depressed most of the time. Man, I still can not believe he did this movie ... I had to cover my eyes in many places he does not believe he really did such a movie ... hahahaha .... But I'm glad I watched it. Thank God he grew up ...
