Bug's Life is a very good animated game. This movie is for younger children, but it's a great movie for my age. The story is about ants named Flik. He brought his colony into confusion when he destroyed the food that was for the superior grasshoppers. He discovers and has to find more mistakes to remove this mess. This movie is classic because it's a good movie and it's Pixar. Animation is great especially at the end of the 90s. The story is good, but a little more detail would be enough. Voting is good as with most movies with animation. Music is nice. Nothing special, but he won a nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie seemed scary. This is a good film for all families. Rate this movie 10/10.
