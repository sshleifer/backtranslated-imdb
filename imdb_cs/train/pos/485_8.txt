"Luzhin's Defense" is a good film with gentle central performances, but too many of the novel and the lack of craft craft will come to life. During most of the movie, it was felt that the characters only helped move the narrative. Marlene Gorris might perhaps have examined the psyche of Luzhin rather than portray him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others. Adapting the literature to the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film is not deep enough in the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia is rushing to her mother, rather than a dramatic flash point in the movie. I felt that I had Luzhin's muff, and finally a tragic end, without the pleasure that his unusual and complex personality would be divided. But it was a moving and entertaining movie, but it was definitely not a great movie.
