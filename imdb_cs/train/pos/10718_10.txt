Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and it also inspires others. The performance was excellent and my wife and I went for Leo Thompson in the cabaret years later due to her performance in the film. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accident has slowed down and hurt the movie. 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident comes. I met one of Challenger's astronauts since my childhood in the Carnegie Mellon area, where my father went to school; I also recognize a close friend of the late pilot. I was last year's technical review for the National BSA for the badge badge Astrology Merit Badout, and it still seems to me that Spacecamp is a great movie that recommends scouts, Space Badges to the rank I teach. I ran like a late adult astronaut and followed the engineering education plan that we set up when Challenger exploded. I just settled with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible" what happened after the crash at Astrotech's stock meeting, so I'm much closer to an accident and any film similarities. I assured myself that I was a good student and four years later I ended up strangely on the advice of Rockwell engineer who told them that in 1986 they were not allowed to fly Challenger and who later built Endeavor.
