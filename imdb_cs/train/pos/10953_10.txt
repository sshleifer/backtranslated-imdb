I think this show is crazy fun! It's not for every taste, and I will not promote or disparage people who will not get it. I'm sure they are beautiful bright people working with different wavelengths. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah plays a self-defeated loser named "Sarah Silverman," who often finds himself in Homers' quarrels (that is, "Homerian" as in the "Homers Simpsons"). I remember Sarah Silverman from her short Saturday Night Live concert in the early 1990s. I immediately liked it and I went out of the way to look at everything she had done. This show is funny. That's why I always wear adult nappies before I look at them. Look at it!
