DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second attempt to produce Joseph Sarna - and although I would say it's much more fun than the painfully boring and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS, it's still a bit slow and un-explicit for my taste. <br /> <br /> This center is centered around a group of vampire girls living in the castle who want to resurrect their formerly murdered "leader." To do that, girls have to dance naked and kiss each other and sing strange things - and of course, to drink some blood. When the doctor and the brother's car break down and have to stop at the castle for accommodation - they provide the ideal blood for dandy vampires ... but it does not have to be as helpless as it seems ... <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ HEAD> a good example of the early 1970s. Lots of nudity - including some full-bodied, some dirty undertones - including incest and, of course, bleeding bleeding ... but these scenes are still fairly corrupted by today's standards. Some pretty women in this would benefit from some more explicit sex, but I think you can not have everything. It would also benefit from some heavier violence / gore, because it's a vampire movie, but I think DEVIL'S PLAYTHING's goal was to show skin, not blood. Still a little slow - and most of the acting is totally wooden - but that can be expected from something in this era and this budget. It's worth seeing fans - others may find it too boring for their hobbies. 7/10
