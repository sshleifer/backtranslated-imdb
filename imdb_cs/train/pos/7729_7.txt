JIST: Look at something else. The film was greatly awarded by Gene Siskel, but after watching it, I can not figure out why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has an interesting dialogue occasionally, some cool moments and a scary "noir". But it just is not fun. It also does not have a lot of senses, conspiracy, but above all the character of motivation. I do not know someone who behaves like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult film that could be taken into account - I suggest you do not accept this challenge.
