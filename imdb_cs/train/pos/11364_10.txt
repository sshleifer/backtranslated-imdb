Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly pious in this role where he has to portray a character whose morale is initially uncertain for viewers. As is often the case with Sutherland's characters, we have to ask, "Is it a villain [in this case a minor] or a hero?" This is a disturbing story about incompetence and terrible bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that has hindered the efforts of extremely competent people. Like Sutherland's nature, he deeply notices: "The degree of bureaucracy is its ability not to evoke special exceptions." The "committee meeting" (between the characters of Rey and Sutherland) after the perestroika is enforced and its revelation has a huge emotional impact. You feel the suffering of devoted people working in this system. A handful of theater scenes depicting family members of the victims increases emotional resonance about the influence of the story. This is seldom a feature of the film with this sinister topic, but it effectively reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved. This is a sad but very important film that has earned its showcases on Canadian television history.
