Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create classics, and for seven decades his West met like Real McCoy, fascinating, entertaining, magnificent; in any case obsolete. As a true fan of the DEADWOOD series, I'll tell you Gary Coopera's performance, because wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are much more on target. /> <br /> No giants anymore in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of the dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade, which for decades has seen a business life of decades: released, re-released, re-released. Filmmakers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandy beach. None of today's films will be searched in 7 months, let alone 70 years.
