I do not care if you want my comment or not, but I think those who write that the movie is not good ... you're so obsessed with movies in Hollywood that you do not see how good a movie I am not a Jay Chou fan but I have I love his game and not only his ... and maybe you think there's not much sense in the idea and maybe you think it's not that interesting, but I look deeply there is more than action in movies more than love and passion and tears more than the US in the world and it's good :) really good. And it cost a lot to do so please do not criticize the actors directors cause you do not know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you :)
