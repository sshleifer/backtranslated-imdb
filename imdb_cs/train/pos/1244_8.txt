I first saw this movie on TV, and I honestly loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most frightening villains anyone can imagine. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the gross good hero. I have never been a fan of Eddie Murphy but I found his irritated portrait here as a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through the Glass". Charlotte Lewis is to use the hackneyed phrase, but the only usable, clearly gorgeous. Some scenes are beautifully created: dreams, birds, silly combat scenes and climatic confrontations. Despite all this, Murphy is suddenly released to the modern myth by the modern man, the stunning and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his Oriental fantasy romp. Like this movie, we have James Hong, an incomparable actor, whose scenes, though short, also enhance Derek's quality. Since 1955 Hong has defined a fine supporting actor, a "class act" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is stupid; it is not perfect; but has so many redeemed features that it's a nice and fun fantasy that's worth watching. After four years I saw the "Golden Child" again; I really liked it! It's really great fun.
