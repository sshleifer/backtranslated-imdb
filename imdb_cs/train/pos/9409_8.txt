The chemist develops a substance that is never cleaned or incinerated, but is considered a threat to the survival of various industries. In this wonderful comedy of Ealing Studios, Guinness is amazing as a gentle but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with her sensual voice, plays a loving interest; Parker is her greedy father. Thesiger is entertaining as a patriarch of the textile industry. While telling the story, the film also raises some interesting questions about science, economics and politics. It is really driven by Mackendrick, who would continue to make "Ladykillers" and the noble "Sweet Smell of Success" later in the 1950s.
