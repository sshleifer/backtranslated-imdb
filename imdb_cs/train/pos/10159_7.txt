There are several films or films that I consider to be popular over the years. The Gospel Way was one of them. I looked at it like a young teenager, and I would like to see it again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / The last dinner was a huge meal <br /> <br /> 3 / he liked play with children <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and all the time. The film may not be theologically sound or high-quality acting, but at that time touched my heart. Besides, I'm a fan of Johnny Cash and it was a brave move. If it ever comes out on DVD, I buy it purely for sentimental reasons.
