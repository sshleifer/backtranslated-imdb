This is a great movie with an entertaining, clever story and the dynamics of cultural differences and a running theme of what is important in life, making it a very underestimated film. Do not let the cynics of the world discourage themselves from seeing it. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder that comedy is never appreciated because actors like Keaton make the humor of the serious bits look incredibly light. A great movie all around!
