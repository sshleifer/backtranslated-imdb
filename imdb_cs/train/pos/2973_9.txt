Here is one movie that is really fun at every moment it covers. How is it possible that this film stars the creators of South Park and directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I immediately realized that Coop and Doug are really Matt and Trey, but their talents in acting and writing proved to be quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they were really Matt and Trey later. Humor is sometimes rough, sometimes dirty, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid, but overall it is a film that is undoubtedly undervalued. In fact, it's crazy. Completely crazy.
