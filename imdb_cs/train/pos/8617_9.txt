"The GI Samurai" sees that Sonny Chiba and some other guys are being taken back to the civil war of the afflicted feudal Japan for no special reason and a massacre. It's somewhat over the cutting-edge sword essay vs. machine gun, which will eventually bring some interesting results. Spirits are basically running on the tracks you can expect from the title; ("what is a flying metal box?" etc.), "there is no better," and eventually a huge battle. The other one is proof that the film does not give up at all, seriously, the carnival takes over most of the other half, while the Samurai army fights with the Chilean platoon; the face of one would fully expect from the title, but still manage to overcome its ingenuity and extravagance. It is certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and it does not do long after. <br /> <br /> Chiba gives rough performance as hell, initially a good leader, but someone who finally finds himself challenging his own morale, because the situation is slowly acting on him. This is certainly one of his better vehicles from his amazing biography. The final act that these two worlds have influenced is that it is a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, for they seem to be asking, "Would not we be better?" , But it is maybe reading a bit a lot into it could generally be described as an extremely fun two hours (almost) non-stop action.
