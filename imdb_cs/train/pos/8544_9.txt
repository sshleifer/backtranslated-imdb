This film has never received the attention it deserved, though this is one of the best pieces of the set and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on the screen. Brightly shot on a small budget in real V.A. The hospital, the middle of the story is Joel, played very well by Eric Stoltz. Joel was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and arrived at a hospital with other men who had spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover played by Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of her later Academy Award winning work. Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the main focus, many other well-developed figures in the department. Wesley Snipes is doing a huge job like an angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as a bitter and racist Bloss. I think the two best scenes for Forsythe are when they become frustrated and angry at the dancers' square, and later, when they feel empathy for a young Korean man who was shot in a liquor store, stick to it. My favorite scene with Snipes is in a round table discussion about sexual options after an injury. Chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong and has two very intimate sexual scenes. Orgasm in the department is sexy and fun. There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take a specially equipped van into the lane. It's really a comedy of mistakes when they do their poor attempts to get a van to see "naked ladies." The story is even more stunning because director Neal Jimenez is paralyzed in real life. That's basically his story. This movie is real, not glossy or glamorous. Achieving the amount of talent in a movie with such a small budget is amazing. I recommend this film to everyone I see because it is one of those films that even improves the second look. It's a pity that such a great job is overlooked, but perhaps because of the video it gets the attention it deserves.
