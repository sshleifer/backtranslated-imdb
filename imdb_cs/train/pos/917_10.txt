I looked at it in July and even with the Christmas motif I found out that she was sensitive and sensitive. It's not real to anyone because it's full of fantasy and beautiful moments that sometimes make no sense. William Russ did a great job like Hank. I saw him only in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in that expression in his eyes, as Hank considered what was happening to him, he was amazing and gentle. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and beautiful in this role, as usual and very faithful. And Peter Falk as Max was gorgeous and always brought a smile when he appeared in many important scenes. There were many special scenes, including where Hank realizes who Max really was in his life. It's not for everyone ... especially for those who are not in the movies "feel good" and that's definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and have a sense, avoid this. But I think it's worth watching again, so I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have video recorders :)
