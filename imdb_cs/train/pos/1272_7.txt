A comfortable film, though I think it would have the potential to be even better if it had more depth. It's a secret in the middle of the movie, because it's known why Elly is such a hobby. Then, when we finally received an explanation returning to our childhood, there is still not much detail. Maybe they showed flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's still a good movie to watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
