Just as predictable as a Hallmark but without merit, Rookie makes a solid trip. Dennis Quaid, the most sensible actor who works today, is perfectly perfect when the science teacher turned to baseball player Jimmy Morris. The film is never immortal to children, as could be expected from film movie G. As a sports film, The Rookie is one of the best I've ever seen since Sunday's Sunday.
