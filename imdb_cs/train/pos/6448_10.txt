Kay Pollack (the man behind this film) is a really great man who tries to divide his life philosophy in different ways. He wrote a bunch of good and well written books on how to control his senses and keep his soul happy. The message in most of his books and in the film is that your thoughts actually cause your problems and that the reason for your anger is almost never caused by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but you never do it at all. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important about life, you must have an open mind and listen to all the "hidden messages" (or life instructions) that most parts of this movie contain if you listen and you are watching. Watch it with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and deplete as much as possible <br /> <br /> So while watching, keep in mind: <br /> <br / > "The mind is like a parachute, it does not work unless it is open!"
