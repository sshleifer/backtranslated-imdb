This film is one of the few quality films of the year 2000 and is definitely one of my best. The script is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the conversion to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photos are excellent as well as the performances of both Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely gives his best performance to date, proving that he is worth much more than we thought. Watson also performs great. The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro), who is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in non-linear time, with several memories of childhood Luzhin. Through these, the complexity of Luzhin is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say, but I recommend this movie to anyone.
