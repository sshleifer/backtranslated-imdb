It is one of the greatest sports films ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures in American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett particularly interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In this respect, James J. Corbett was truly upgraded. But to return to the film, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. In fact she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it is a period, the story resists the test of time; it did not become obsolete. Ward Bond's performance by John L. Sullivan must be one of the great images of true sports figures in film history and the boxing scene are realistic, well-presented and highly effective. This, along with the big script, makes this film a must.
