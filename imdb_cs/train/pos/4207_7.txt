Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) into the Candy pocket (Jean Peters) wallet, which contains an important microfiche that is designed for the Communist thing. She is followed by two federal agents who are waiting for them to fall as soon as the microfire contacts them. Skip, however, steals his wallet on the subway under everyone's nose, and he's going to be hitting both the cops, Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy, who want the microfiche back. The skip can only be tracked by Moe (Thelma Ritter), who sells information about crimes. It is clear to skip that what he stole is important and that both parties want a movie, but he will endure at a high price. This leads to Joey looking for him and the conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has the deadline to hand over the microfiche to the boss. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and has a good start that will instantly connect you. It's a bit unrealistic for Jean Peters to immediately fall in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary, otherwise, why would she later leave Joey? It's a good movie.
