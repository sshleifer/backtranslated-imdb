The French and the Belgians do what they do best. It is a strange, visually inventive, exciting and emotionally demanding narrative. Director Jaco van Dormael brings us to the world of Georges, suffering Down's syndrome, and his effort to make a meaningful relationship with someone, with just about anyone. This is not done patronizingly, but with a great sense of entertainment and honesty. Georges' relationship with the company's guru manager, Harry is brilliantly controlled - moving from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease. Eighth day gives a similar Hollywood fare as Barry Levinson's Oscar won Rain Man or Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump well and really in the shadows. Sometimes it raises the humor of Milos Forman's One Flew over a cubic nest with Dennis Potter's shades to throw in a good scale. As an emotionally blunt and desperately lonely yuppie, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns another excellent performance. But it is associated with brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It is a film with consistently powerful performances and so many memorable scenes - shoe shops scene, car show scene, George's dance to Genesis's "Jesus Meets Me", conference scene, fireworks. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing. Just rent it or take a retro screen at you and see what you missed. It is even better to buy this movie. Great genius .....
