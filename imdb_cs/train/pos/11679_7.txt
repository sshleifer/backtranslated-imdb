Beauty and the wonderful challenge are the main reasons why this film looks. "hula" is not perfectly matched with the best clara movies, but it's still nice. dancing, riding a horse and chasing the man he loves. this film is less than an hour long and was directed by the future oscar winner victor fleming. the movie moves fast and the clear bow has plenty of time on the screen. if you like clara, I recommend "hula".
