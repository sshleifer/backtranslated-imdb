It's not the best Bigfoot that has ever been, but according to the recent standards of nature, bad movies have appeared, which mostly show up on the science fiction channel, they are good things. It has some action, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but there are some practical F / X that I like. Overall, this film is worth watching if you are a B horror / sci-fi fan and you need to fix it. It's better than Sasquatch, not a sequel, so do not be fooled. The performance is better than you might expect in a movie like this one, and overhead is more than reasonable. Expect a little lul as the characters are "developed", but they know things are going up. If you are watching a DVD, you may want to skip one or two chapters.
