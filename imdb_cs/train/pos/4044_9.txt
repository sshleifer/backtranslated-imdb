I found this movie very well. The premise is quite imaginative and I was attracted to the viewer as the characters evolved. Stimulation is done very well for those who think they are sufficiently hidden from the viewer, and questions are still emerging that are later answered and create a well-thought-out and very satisfying film from both the brain and the action of opinion. Some people seem to be looking for a continual roller coaster ride with this movie - one of those going out of the gate. This would be more analogous to one of the coasters that will slowly pick you up - which creates an amazing sense of expectation - and ultimately, in my opinion, more concerned with the foundation originally laid. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
