I was expecting to see this film for a long time, and eventually I could meet at the festival in Istanbul. Maybe because I expected too much from this movie and that's why I was a little disappointed. I was not the best film from Korea, but it really is worth watching. The theme was nice and the movie is still watching you without being bored, even if it's long. But there are gaps in the movie and jump from one place to another. But Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in early cinematography, and I think this movie would not be so nice if it was not in the lead role.
