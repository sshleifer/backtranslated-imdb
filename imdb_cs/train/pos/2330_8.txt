This show is good. I like acting, funny pieces and cuteness. Actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, Everybody was great at the show. The show began with its witty, illogical basic idea of ​​bringing the dead people back to the first series, and frankly, as what people said, the first episodes of the second series were a bit down, but later they returned to look good as well. And now I really hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why does ABC just let it finish by the very end, when all the episodes are already done? I really want to know how this story will be. I think she should get a chance because there are still so many audiences who love her.
