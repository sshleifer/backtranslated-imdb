I read a book and saw the movie. Both excellent. Film is a diamond between coal during this era. Liebman and Selby control the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without defects. This movie should make them out of the stars. It was a pity in the studio that he did not provide everything he had behind the film. It could have been franchising. DVD release is a must and remake remake would revive this movie. Check it out in the TV Guide and if you see it, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Take another advantage - read the book (the same title). It blows you away. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we thought they were.
