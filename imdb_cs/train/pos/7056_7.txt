The sequel to the increasingly popular Cinderella story reminded me a little of what they did with one of Beauty & the Beast films. Basically, there are three short stories that are placed in the 1st. <br /> <br /> OK, the mice are adorable (I love Guse, it's so cute!) And Lucifer is amazing (as usual). I like some newer characters (Pom Pom was adorable and I liked Prudence.) The story was somewhat limited, but still very cute. So I vote 7/10.
