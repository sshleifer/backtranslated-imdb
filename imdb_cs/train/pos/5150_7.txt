Even though Ian Kershaw renounces this project due to inaccuracies about Hitler's lives and yes, it is dramatic but crucial. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years, during this documentary, which only deals with Hitler from childhood until he became Chancellor of Germany, including the Night of Long Knives. This television film (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a number of factors allow Hitler to come to power, for example the financial disaster of 1930. The series follows Hitler and something else, except Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. Overall, valuable and full of interesting actors, I still think it should be more firmly focused on stronger cinematography; Most actors are depicted in semi-coronary shots that (for me) lead to a theatrical attitude, not a movie. Tempo is sometimes sleepy and the film suffers and takes about 2.5 hours.
