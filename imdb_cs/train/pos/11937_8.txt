This was definitely the case of Angels in Outfield. It was yesterday evening on television, and I believe I have not seen this movie ever since I went to high school, and now I'm in my fourth year of college. Although the film has many flaws, it's so touchy that you can not help, but sit down, watch it and enjoy yourself. He is also cheerful. Danny Glover's wounding is just over the top that you can not help, but laugh at him loudly. She adds to the film, and I'm convinced the director wants it. You really feel the characters in the movie, even if the development is not the best. You must see. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
