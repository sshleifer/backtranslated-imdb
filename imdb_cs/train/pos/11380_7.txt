Although the word megalmanie is used extensively to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dances are too stiff, you have to admit that the guy knows how to put it on the show. In America In Paris, choreographed some excellent figures, some who stall plot, but it is still amazing to look at. (Look at Gene Kelly's "Getting Out of Bed Rutine" for starters) Gene Kelly plays as a GI who is outside Paris, has stayed there, soon is a wealthy female gigolo but really loves someone else! Hoary Story Secure But Music Numbers Save Show Here! I really loved the voice of George Georges Guitar in this. His "Stairs to Paradise" and his duet with Le Gene on 'S Wonderful' are amazing. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron, whom I can take or leave. Overall, it's a pretty good, but not a dynamite movie.
