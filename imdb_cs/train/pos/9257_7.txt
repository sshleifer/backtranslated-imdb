Are your typical women in the chain a maritime transport story of love? Maybe, you know, you know how this formula works now, a pretty woman is pictured, someone has to fall in love with her. I think this movie is governed by some typical story lines, but it does not say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, though short. Some things did not make sense, like getting into random fights, but it's fun to watch, the fighting was really done. This is definitely a comedy, but it has a very good feeling. Humor is well balanced, it will not hurt your stomach, but you will smile. <br /> <br /> There's a little shining action, so not for kids.
