Fast and fun satire on the original TV reality TV series. Drama director Robert Harling's screenplay is packed with one pad and ridiculous situations. The best of these is the culmination, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates to poor improvisation and brain transplantation. Keven Kline is murdering his lines because he does not have glasses, he is cheerful. "Her brain will be examined later in the next few houses." Brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are perfect. This is a treatment to see how it plays in cinemas as in this movie. It's a classic that somehow cracked. <br /> <br /> Alan Silvestri's score is another bonus. It fits into the soap opera with its spectacular and melodramatic air.
