Finally, an indie movie that actually brings some great fears! I see most of the horror films that came out ... Theater, Straight-to-DVD, Cable, etc ... and most of them are Hall ... Several are observable ... even less is really good ... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I showed a movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! I have no actor names, I suppose the budget for this movie is fairly low, but you would not know it ... the movie looks fantastic ... gaming works completely for the movie ... the story is good ... and the fears are great! While most of the filmmakers focus exclusively on fears, they often forget about the story and the evolution of personality, two things that help to communicate fears more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that character and story are important. It evolves to the extent that you take care of the characters, you know the characters, and therefore you are more afraid when they are in danger. Watching horror films, which cost from $ 80 million to $ 5,000, I find that "Dark Remains" is one of the gems there. Check this movie!
