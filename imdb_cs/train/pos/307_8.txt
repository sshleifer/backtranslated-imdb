"All Laughing" is one of those little movies I always recommend to friends looking for something extraordinary. It is firmly rooted in the tradition of the past but looks more concurrently. Even the atmosphere of the early 1980s is not too long. Bogdanovi wisely keeps the business so light on his feet that reality never leads to the ground. Of course, this kind of sweet little film relies entirely on the actors to go on, and "TAL" is blessed with dream empires who understand the demands of this kind of story. It's a movie that would not have been memorable for so long, if it was not for the little moments that provides an excellent cast: Colleen Camp shouted at John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak unleashed all his hair under his hat; and especially when Dorothy Stratten arrived at John Ritter and said, "How ... strange." It's such a fuzz that you do not want him to throw too much for fear of crushing him, but he'll leave it with a light heart and a smile on his face.
