Today's science fiction thrillers are more like Rambo in the outer space with a monstrous special effect (often absurd, like the sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space). Though the terse standards today, the special effects of the "Forbidden Planet" were quite remarkable for their time. Even today it still holds its validity. Still, the best part of the film is perhaps the reason why radio thrillers still have an appeal. Much of what was happening was left to the imagination of the audience. (How did krell beings look like?) By the time the most part of the story came to an end, the tensions and tensions that took place throughout the movie eventually appeared. The end was also very thoughtful and satisfying. In my opinion, it's still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi movies ever shot.
