This is probably one of Brian De Palma's most famous films, but it's not his best. Body Double, Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is heavily influenced by Hitchcock, and this movie is a take on psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who thinks she has an affair, and after her psychiatrist Michael Caine rejects her offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and she sleeps with him. After this moment, it's best that you do not know what's going on, but it's a murder, and Nancy Allen is calling her a girl who looks at the murderer. Dennis Franz is a detective on a case that really does not trust Allene, and she has to find a murderer herself. It's a pretty good movie, but it's not one of De Palma's best.
