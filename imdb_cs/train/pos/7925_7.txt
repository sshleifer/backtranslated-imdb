Stupid movie is really, really fun. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a little too obvious, it's a little bit in the second half, and the story is a disconcerting mess, but it's laughter. And it's worth seeing Ed McMahon as the right kook. This film is in the same class as Elvira, Lady of Darkness, another incredibly entertaining, underestimated movie.
