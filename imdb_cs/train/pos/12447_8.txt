There is plenty of material from the comics and novels of Modesta Blaise that would be great in the movie. Unfortunately, several attempts were made and there was no great potential for the character. So, no, it's not the modesty you know from the comic strip (now it's repeated in nice titles from Titan Books). This is a modesty about 5 or 6 years before the first belt and what you can do from her story is accurate. Miramax had film rights to the personality, with Quentin Tarantino acting as a lawyer and technical adviser. Early drafts of the Miramax project have tried to adapt one of the best novels, but have always managed to skip some key element. Tarantino was not happy with any of them, and offered him a name that would disappear from the project so they could continue. Because of the fidelity of the studio, they wanted to keep him in the process because they knew he "got" the character and his world. With movie rights approaching expiration, they decided to try a very different approach. The result was "My Name is Modesty," which is a small film with direct access to the film that represents the character. The film does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important to the adventures of Blaise in most of the stories published. What this film achieves shows the strength of the character itself. She never loses peace of mind and you never doubt she's even unarmed in a room full of gun gangsters. Most of the movie takes place at the casino, which will undoubtedly save money on production. No matter. The film is not so cheap. Instead, it gives a rather complex (and plausible) character story about the character and shows how far he thinks he is before us. If Miramax would adapt to one of the comic stories or novels, they would portray the character's background nicely and will not have to spend much time on their "origins." I realize that the words "Direct-to-Video" do not inspire confidence, but this movie is worth a look.
