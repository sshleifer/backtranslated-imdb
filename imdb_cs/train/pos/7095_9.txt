Terry Gilliam is a stunning feature film adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of surprise surprises, but still touches your heart thanks to excellent cast. Gilliam's inspiration for fantasmagoric work with script David and Janet Peoples to play with his head as well as poor James Cole (Willis with his most Steve McQueen - better than McQueen, even!), A passenger convicted of a future who literally does not know whether he is coming or going as a team of scientists still sends him back to bad times and tries to prevent an epidemic in 1995 that is fatal to humans but does not harm animals. Willis, the Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as well-meaning psychiatrists give some of the best performances of their career. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is scary. This is no-miss!
