The problem with the introduction of a real person is that performance can be good, but it still does not work if the audience does not believe the actor is showing a person. This is a major problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives amazing performance, but I hardly believed that Abraham Lincoln was so talked about as Fonda portrays him. theater in the courtroom with young Abraham Licoln in the foreground. Whether it's a true story or not, I do not know, but if that's not the case, why not call it Lincoln as a central character? However, it does not matter. In the film, Lincoln defends two young men accused of murder. In fact, the film is not too much and as a result it seems to be rather empty. I wanted more story and character development. The film is 100 minutes long, but he does not like it. There are several small scenes with Lincoln and a bloody relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem to be superficial. The game is good everywhere, but as I said, the performance of Fonda functions as a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just do not believe the real Lincoln was so spoken. It is true that he has a great voice when he needs it, for example, if he convinces a drunken lynx crowd to allow the accused to try, but Fonda portrays Lincoln too humiliously. Other performances are solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, mother of the accused. She's a pretty lady for whom we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, yet very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. John Ford seems to be epic, and it was probably when he was released. But even then there is not enough material to present them as such. <br /> <br /> It's a nice watch, but not a classic.
