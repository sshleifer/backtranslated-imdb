It's a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you let go of pretending that you know or are interested in communism and how real Russians or the British are, if you accept and you are not injured by conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is in her best, sexy, moving and entertaining. Ben Chaplin strives for Nic Nicole not to be touched completely, and the rest of the cast also does a good job. The finale moves and logic - the logic of the film, of course. It is worth watching if you accept the rules of the game.
