Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be with virtually no budget. All you need is an intelligent script, good actors and a lot of atmosphere. RRW supplies everything and more. Nothing Cage plays a former sailor injured in Lebanon, who is on his last 5 dollars after being dismissed for jobs on the oil field because of a bad knee. He returns to Red Rock and is wrong with bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not as his most terrible - yet bad) for a Texas-based man. He pays to kill him his wife and it looks like a burglary. Only when he gets there to check it out. He offers him twice to kill Wayne. Cage simply wants to get out of hell out of town with his free money and let sparring lovers be. But a number of failures and failures lead to yo-yoing coming in and out of Red Rock, back and forth. Eventually, he leads with Lyle of Dallas, the real Texas hit man who offers help without knowing he makes the plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW has never had a great deal of relaxation, so most of his viewers have spotted it on video or on television television shows. Viewing this way could look like a TV movie, but it's bigger. Quiet, slow-timed direction, moody screaming and screaming of the desert wind would all mean a great movie in theaters, but the best thing you can do these days is to watch DVDs on big HDTV. <br /> <br /> Only the weak point of the film I can think about is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring femme fatale with an ugly dyke-ish hairstyle. I certainly would not fall for her, but if you assume that Nic Cage is in militant lesbian, you still accept it.
