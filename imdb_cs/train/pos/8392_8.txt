This film features inventive cinematographic techniques where, instead of the camera-capturing landscape, there are tiny details of how someone appears as a woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrap it in a leaf. How can a husband have a hat, socks, shoes and underwear and both look so cool and comfortable. As provocative a woman is presented, it is another feature of the table that the director decides to announce that he is a free spirit sexually and seeks to obtain the pleasure he seeks without flirting directly or with some sensitivity to what one can feel. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. She is open where she has nothing back, she does not feel any strange shame of her behavior and wanted to share these facts because her primary focus always lies in the fact that her marriage is happening. Nobody can come between these two. Only chance for fate can intervene - his imprisonment during the war and what follows his last return. Very interesting film, which is completely absorbed.
