Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude toward sexuality. She has no problem ogling naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men it is when they lose it. She believes that when women actually have sex, that's when they lose some sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty." So he walks through Hollywood hills, hunting couples from afar, and finally shoots men of the dead with a powerful rifle of range. The apparent primary reason for the existence of this film is to engage in sexual activity over and over again. The "story" comes as another idea. This is tied to the fact that many happy heterosexual men are quite happy with how long enough nudity scenes (ladies look incredibly well without clothing) and sex are used to treat as a large dose of irritation. Of course, seeing a fair division across the scope of the clamping factor greatly illustrates the urge to voyeurism. (One of them is that Mike's eyes are a couple of minutes a minute before finally pulling the trigger.) It all underlines the terribly disturbing if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack. The hobby for the sinister basket is tied to your enjoyment at one or the other. It includes even one lesbian attempt that challenges Mike and makes him unreliable * how * to react. It develops very slowly but dresses with the most interesting ironic twist. It's a cruel and twisted rarity that if nothing else does not keep some viewers stuck to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
