during Eddie Murphy's stand the women of the audience scream at Eddie and the audience man responds. what is called is "Women - TO MR ROB (this is Saturday night character live), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. Unlike the previous post that said the women shouted, it's wrong, though the mail said they were there, they must have a hearing problem! despite what post-er says about it's not possible that you have a close listening on DVD as you actually hear on DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! Hope this will help someone curious explosion cheers gaz !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
