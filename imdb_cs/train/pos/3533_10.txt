It's sadly not available on DVD yet, but it's worth watching on TCM or VHS. The secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder and boldly takes on a number of dangerous characters in an attempt to get the truth. A movie with many twists and turns that I do not mention! The series of jazz drops, where our heroine is trying to find information about the murderer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, although it was a very low budget and during World War II it was black and white. Despite its low budget - Long Island looks a bit hilly - it's a film of original style and excellent vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks, who knew a lot about these issues and dared the worst women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall and Ann Sheridan. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who emigrated to Hollywood and brought with them an original fresh outlook. Unfortunately, Ella Raines has never regained so much, and eventually ended in poorly produced westerly.
