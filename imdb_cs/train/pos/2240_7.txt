My lasting love for Italian actress Luciana Paluzzi, who helped her jump to the beginning of her puberty with her performance in 1965, "Thunderball," led me to some rather unusual places. The case, this British curiosity of 1959, "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.", which portrays Lucian in one of her earlier roles. He plays this princess, though it is actually a show of Terry-Thomas and Peter Seller's talents, both of which are now on the rise. In this cute, often fun movie, we learn about the island of Gaillardia, the island of Madeira, which until 1916 was a British colony and then universally forgotten. Forty years later, however, it will become a center of global attention and international espionage where valuable cobalt deposits are discovered and their Majesty sends a devastating Carlton-Browne from the Foreign Ministry. Terry-Thomas underestimates this part as carefully as Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulosa from a tiny country. (This was the second film of the 1959 retailers, which concerned a tiny country that coincided with the world, the second is of course "Mouse that crashed.") Ian Bannen almost stole the actress as a genius gallery of Gaillardie and my girl Lucian is as attractive as it can be in its subsidiary role. The film is characterized by a very dry humor, even though there is sometimes a belly of laughter (for example, the reception at Gaillardian Airport and, in particular, the Gaillard Power Championship in May). And the prime minister's premier, with his broken English and seemingly constant stains, is another remarkable figure in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite the occasional or two untrustworthy, dirty British gibberish, I have found that this image is a triumphant humor and is well presented on this crisp DVD Anchor Bay.
