Nagra comes from a conservative Indian family that is not exactly girls who play competitive football. But our attractive young star can play serious football. Rhys-Meyers trains Nagra and encourages her to perform while Knightley supports a friend and friend. When your wedding is scheduled for the same day as the final football match, what is the girl doing? Like its unique path to BFGW, Nagra tries to push the envelope into traditional family ways. Here's Daddy (played well by Kher) who sees both sides of the problem. Anchors the whole point for hokey late sexual preferences of non-crisis, if they need fillers they could go elsewhere. Nice conclusion to the whole deal.
