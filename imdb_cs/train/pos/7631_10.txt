Kurt Russell's chameleon-like performance, coupled with John Carpenter's flawless filmmaking, makes this undoubtedly one of the best boob-tube bios ever broadcast. It also insists: the emotional foundation is strong enough to never age; Carpenter preserved for the future offspring the power and the perfect sense of life of the only King Rock and Roll. (I was a borderline Elvis fan of most of my life, but it was not until I saw this mind-blowing moving film that I watched BEYOND's picture at the man himself. It was quite a revelation.) ELVIS will remain one of the top ten films from all over the world .
