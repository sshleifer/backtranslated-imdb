He grew up on me. I like the music of R.D. Burman, and despite the rough elements of the story, I found out that I was moving a lot when I was watching the movie again. The brother's sister's line is powerful, I thought; there are also probably mandatory things like bar fight, story complicated crime, etc., which are just disturbing. (Although it is not unfortunate from a certain point of view.) Also, English translation is definitely someone for whom it was a bit thrilling and as such as I am, I am grateful for it. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> As many Bollywood films I've seen, it's melodramatic and opera, including a song first sung by a little boy to cheer up his abusive and unhappy sister, and then the same song sang 12 or so for a year later a man who traveled to Kathmandu and longed to reunite with this girl grew up and tortured (her mother and brother were told to be dead), suppressing her pain with drugs. /> The great thing about this 1971 film is that it is a hippie movement that has brought India from the Indian point of view to the hordes of seekers who see them as people who are persecuted in India by the spiritual hunger caused by the deficiencies of their own society, but still in India living only for immediate pleasure. Hippie singing-dancing-drugging scenes are really amazing and accurate in their tone (I'm old enough to remember) and I'm sure the masses of young white zoned-out kids are real hippie extras, as I recall hearing about kids on caravan to the east to get this kind of job in Bollywood. (It's not about the Hare Krishna movement, although the hippies singing Krishna / Rama singing, as well as a group of true Indian devotees unrelated to the hippies, in the opening scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> Virginia
