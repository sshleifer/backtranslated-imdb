When US author Edgar Allan Poe visits London, British journalist Alan Foster has been approached, who is becoming the target of a special tournament. Not believing that Poe claims all his strange stories were based on real experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend, Sir Thomas Blackwood, that he can not spend the night in a haunted castle in Blackwood. After installing it on a deserted castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone because he is approached by many beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics - who explains that they are all lost souls who are famous for shedding stories of their death anniversary of their deaths! When I first watched this wonderful piece of classic horror, I was fascinating all the time. I found the movie really scary and sad at the same time. Babs Steele is undoubtedly beautiful. A musical score makes the atmosphere twice as terrorist. The starless scene threw me a loop because I did not expect it. It looks like Synapse has done a great job of improving the picture, because this movie looks damn well for its age, and it's Uncut International version that boots. This is the film that is responsible for setting up the Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection.
