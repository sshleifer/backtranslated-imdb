I first saw a song from this DVD at the hifi show in November 2006 in London (I did not get into the cream yet!). It was through the high-end Arcam system, it sounded great with dts. I had to get this DVD and tell you this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever watched. The performance of Cream at their age was just blowing the mind, and the sound quality is the best I've heard on a music DVD. It does not matter what type of music you like will definitely grow on you.It is the pure shine of their performance that will keep you watching it over and over again. Even new musicians are not cutting mustard these days as these old rockers do.
