The horror film is filmed and things are not doing well. It's a camouflaged killer. The director tells the murderer of the occupation and the crew. He crazy and kills two people. Killed and the movie is never finished. Twelve years later, a group of film students decided to try and finish it - but it is a curse. People who try to finish it will kill themselves. Students ignore it. Guess what's going on? <br /> <br /> The plot is an old hat, but it's not bad ... for what it is (low budget movie slasher). It's great with a young and quite talented young man. No one is great, but no one is terrible. It also avoids forced (and useless) female naked scenes. It's moving fast, the gore is pretty and bloody and the script will not hurt your intelligence. Also Molly Ringwald is that she has time to play her frightened faded actresses. <br /> <br /> No big shaking, but no bad. I give it 7.
