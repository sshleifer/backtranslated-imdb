This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. He takes me to the mountain of emotions. I cry and cry and disgust and happiness and in love! It's all in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> Actors are all brilliant! I have to mention the main actor, of course, Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job! I also admire the actor who plays Tora, who plays this mentally handicapped young man so convincingly! A little reminded me of Leonardo di Caprios in Gilbert Grape! And then there is the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's sang. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to everyone to see and enjoy!
