If you want to watch a movie and feel good when you look at it, then Tigerland is the film for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The perfect scenes of this movie look so real; it's almost like a documentary about something that happened in real life but with drama. Boy, I'll tell you ... REALLY the drama they actually really "fought" in one of the scenes (getting a DVD to listen to his comments is not obvious). I see this movie as a bunch of desperate young men who try to watch out of an unfortunate fate when I look at Private Ryan Saving. I have recognition of what is "unfortunate fate" and she knows exactly how the men feel in the movie. I see this movie as a cross between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they're in real life? Some men are crazy, some men cry, some men in their fists, some drugs, some accidentally sleeping with hooks who ruthlessly try to erase the meaning of love from their lives, some try to drink pain, some jump from buildings or bridges, feel guilty others feel so agonized that it is so bad that they collapse - physically. This film has all the desperate emotions plagued by one ball. But do not make me badly your ruthless film, its realistic, very humorous film, the delicious and fun Bozz (Collin's Emblem), that's all lit up, and it's about 5 female actresses in the movie; I'll let you find out what's there! Use the War / Action Sequence dialog to display the perfect scenes along with the right music; this movie has everything I said: from the top down. I do not know why Tigerland is badly credited. The best thing about the film is that the envelope is written in the big, courageous "Best Movie of the Year" font, and it will not go away. Keep precious gems coming in Hollywood, 10/10.
