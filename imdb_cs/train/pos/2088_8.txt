From the top shelf of the great classical books, this master story is written by Pearl Buck. The book as a movie is called "Good Earth". It is related to the story of Wang Lung (Paula Muni), who is one of the Chinese farmers, who starts his day trip to the "Big House," where he took O-lan slave (Luise Rainer) and made it his wife. Almost from the beginning, he begins to adjust his favors by saving a small seed of peach and planting it at his new home. Over the next few years, O-Lan is trusted by constantly sharing her husband's work, difficulties and changing wealth. Over the last few years, they've been raising family and watching ordinary weather in the home, both holidays and famine. In fact, it is at the lowest point of their lives that everyone discovers the value of society, fidelity and love. With changing times, their growing family is helped and endangered by friends and relatives, such as their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a villain and a charlatan, but is sympathetically tolerated. Wang has his "old father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise him and remind him of the fragile and unstable nature. Two notable actors who act impressively in this film are Keye Luke, who plays Wang's older son and Phillip Ahn, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is greatly adapted from the novel. We highly recommend it to all viewers. ****
