Frustrated Deputy District Deputy George Maxwell (a good performance by George E. Carey, who also created this film) can not withstand his hateful, cold wife Edith (perfectly frightened Anne Bellamy). Even worse, Poor George is still saddled with a newborn sun and a lascional lesbian teenage daughter (dishy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has adultery with beautiful, attractive and free swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (gloriously played with sexy aplomb wonderful blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications occur when George finds himself blackmailed by bitter Julia Freeman (a pretty poisonous rescue by Kathy Williams), who wants George to applaud his boyfriend of the psychotic biker Laurence Mackey (frightening Robert Tessier, jail.) Director Tom Laughlin (the same boy who portrayed Billy Jack and James McLarty, screenwriter full of a gorgeous gray story with a winning and very entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, slizling soft-core sex and brutal violence, and overwhelmingly covering the wild, unrestrained sensitivity of the 1960s youth culture and linking the conspiracy with tight 75 minute progress, making sure that the movie is no longer welcome, and finally appears when Candy invites his silly friends through the Maxwells house to enjoy an improvised basement that has completed jam smoking, rock music and, of course, naked dancing youngsters. O. R agland hit the gnarly spot Stanton Fox's sharp black and white cinematography brings an extra delicate edge to deliriously dirty work. Best of all, this is a great show for Pixie Patricia Wymmer's whimsical and fresh face that positively illuminates the screen with its sweet, blond personality and breathtaking beauty. Total tracheal treatment.
