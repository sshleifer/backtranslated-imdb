Detective (Dana Andrews), with the rumor of violence, accidentally kills a murder suspect (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover up. The director of Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story worsens when the wife of a dead man (Gene Tierney) falls to Andrews. He tried to dig well into the big hole and out, but at the end of the tunnel there was too much light on the noir. Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, the crime chief, that Andrews is obsessed with the cuts and tensions between them giving the film his energy and drive, especially the scene at the Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand Baths, and a nighttime meeting outside the Bellevue Hospital which sets what should be the end of the film. High Stamp for the Atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc. ... and a general display of the underworld, though a loving angle and a simplistic good dirty cop do not help its cause.
