This is one of the few films that I regard as a film rendition for improving original books. The story is clear, accessible, entertaining and interesting, and musical numbers are undoubtedly exceptional. I admired the cyclical rendition of the "old home guards" and the glamorous "Portobello Road," a great combination of early animations and real actors that, even though they are dating, do not damage the charm of the work. The background of the Second World War worked well and was not omitted when the film started, which is often the case in the "evacuee" stories. The film, which is often too underestimated, has no end to experience for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are extremely well done and the whole text is neatly tied and well designed. Make a smile on your face!
