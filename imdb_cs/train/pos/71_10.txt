I could not believe the remarks about the movie. When I read horrible views of the film, I wondered if you actually saw the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was unbelievable! I think the actresses and the director made a fantastic job in the film. I did not have the pleasure of seeing an actress before, and I could not be more discouraged by the incredible work that I had to tell my most sincere film I have seen long ago. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is that everyone has a problem with choosing Deanna in a suicide attempt, from the comments you've made as if it were the actress choice and her silly choice. I do not understand it, it's a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else, so how can the actress be a bug I can not see. I think it was a truly believable movie that I would see again and recommend. Opinions are what is and is too bad that so many people are so close. I hope some of the actors soon think that they all played great roles. Busy Philipps will be one of the highest paid actresses and I hope she can laugh in the face of everyone who criticized her! Go ahead, girl!
