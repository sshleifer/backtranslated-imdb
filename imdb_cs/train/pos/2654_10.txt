Everyone should see this movie completely! It's a scary terrifying act, but it's not a shameless "jumping-on-it-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-to-off-like-scary" thing. It's really great. Check out this amazing movie! The director is Stanley Kubrick, the best director he ever lived. Each of his films is a masterpiece, including this one. Shining is about this family who goes to the hotel in Colorado Rockies as winter manager and gets into the snow. Well, the house is scary. The baby is psychic. Husband is slightly hit by malicious hotels and ... well ... HILARITA WORKS !!!! Not really. It becomes such a gripped thriller where the viewer's stuff flies from different directions and is horrifyingly done. Not just the classic scene "Here's Johnny". It's unforgettable, but it can not talk about whole movies. It's one of those things that words do not explain adequately, and you just have to see it. So go to Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
