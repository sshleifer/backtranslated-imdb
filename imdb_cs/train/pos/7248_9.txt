When I first saw the Exterminators of the Year 3000, I had no expectations for this film. Even though it was not as bad as I thought. It's a kind of Italian version of the Roadwarrior, with a cast almost famous in Italy, including Venantina Venantini. The story is about Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of the zombie carnivores. You can also see other links to Italian horror: Luca Venantini plays Tommy's role and you can see that the child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (the city of dead deaths AKA Gates of Hell) like John Robbins and Cannibal apocalypse as the role of Brother Marie. Pretty funny movie with boring parts.
