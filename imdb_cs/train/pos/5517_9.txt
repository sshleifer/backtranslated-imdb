Che: The first part was a fascinating experiment that not only narrated a very interesting story, but also tried to do something else with a "biopic" genre. Che: Part Two is an excellent culmination of this experiment. <br /> This movie offers all the same attributes from the first, from extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to the brilliant direction of Steven Soderberg, without forgetting its intention to overcome conventional biopic rules. That's what I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... he's always trying to do something different and unusual, and he's usually doing so. <br /> <br /> The last message from this movie is perfect and includes everything we have been told about Che Guevara's life. The only failure I've found on Che: Part two is that a few parts feel a little irrelevant. Overall, I give Che: Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation, the first is a brave and fascinating expert who invites the viewer and lets us think.
