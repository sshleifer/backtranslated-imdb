This is the time when Gunga Din is released on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I've been watching this beautiful movie, but I've never tired of it. Leaders worked so well. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> It just does not manage to overcome their exploits in India. Your first glance at Sergeants Three is when you see they are involved in fighting other soldiers over a so-called treasure map. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line they entered into the mostly deserted city - or they thought. They deal with the necessary repairs and soon find some "inhabitants" in hiding. Soon after they got into the assault from a group of fools and barely get back to the base. <br /> <br /> Later, they are sent to another mission that gives Sgt Cutter the opportunity to go for gold with Din. They find a temple of gold and are trapped by evil followers of Kali. Din is sent to get help, and Cutter is captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din and are too caught up. Faced with murder, they helplessly watch their regiment come to their rescue. The criminals are looking and they are about to surprise them when the injured Din flys to the golden dome and throws out his whistle, which then warns the British against the assault. That's why Din is shot. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack the bad guys and soon they beat them. Eventually, Din is honored when he is honored in the British Army with an honorable handkerchief.
