Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor and deserves respect when he tries it, but he is not in a class with big shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and he also suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irish, always great, steals the show. Olivier realized he had the potential in his production, and Iag is guessing with someone he knew he might be behind the scenes. I almost did not realize the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's worst character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice views of Venice are also nice.
