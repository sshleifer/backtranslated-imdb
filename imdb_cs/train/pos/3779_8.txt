I have the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get the second one when I saw it in the store. This was (I think) as tuned as the first but much more strange story. It was funny how they had their own hell and how they had to play death. It was funny that they played him in silly little games like a leash. The only thing I could change is station and death in the band, but it was great.
