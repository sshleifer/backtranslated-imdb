I'm a huge fan of M Lillard, so I finally watched this movie. I honestly doubt that if he was not in the movie, I would like to enjoy it so much, or even watch him, but as soon as I watched, I realized the story was decent. The bad end I have to say, but I saw it coming. It's a low-budget movie and some actors were not really good, but I've rated it all 7/10. Feeling over what Lillard actually did was what really kept me interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
