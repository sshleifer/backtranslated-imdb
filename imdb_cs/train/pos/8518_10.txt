During the annual sale of the sidewalk I came across this film at the local video store. During the scanning of the thousands of videos that hope to find some movies with the movie I came across this movie. I read the back of the film, and I knew it was God's hand at work to buy this movie. You see, I have a sister group of three children who are developing (and will soon be adopted) and live with their family. Immediately, my foster care children made a connection with the three children in the movie. The film helped them better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, the oldest of the sibling groups (7 years old / female) decided to open a little to her past and the trauma she had experienced. She struggles with the whole affair of trust. It's also the first time I've seen her cry. After watching the movie, I asked her what it means to take the baby. She said, "It means to be happy." It must be seen for families who raise children and are considering adopting. Surely he opened the communication lines with us.
