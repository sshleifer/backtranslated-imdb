If I had ever been asked to remember a song from the film of recent years then it would have to be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning, as Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd sing it. Rafi, lyrics Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the photographic film when the sailplane leaves the black background and shining stars. The second would have to be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was the last film by Meena Kumari before she died, and her screen saw her part. In each of the pieces that are drawn, she looks young, but she does not. But one actor who did not change in appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who fell in love with her and especially her legs, when he accidentally entered the train cabin and when he saw them, he left a note describing how beautiful they were. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that should be seen on the big screen just for film photography and songs. Star movie Meena kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and directed by Kamal Amrohi. Grandson Amrohi's grandson has now begun to revive his father's studio by making a comedy film.
