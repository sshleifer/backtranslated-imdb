I realize that many people hate this movie, but I have to admit it's one of my favorites. I like it better than its predecessor and likes it better than a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think people never tell the story any credit, just like back to the future, time Traveling is hard to write and in this movie they contain Time Travel and Spiritual Journey. I also feel that Keanu and Alex were the best performers in this movie, they looked colder, cooler, and cooler. <br /> <br /> The file design of this movie is awsome as well, The sets are quite detailed and huge at times and it can be hard to believe that these files were made for a movie about two teen buds who can barely look ... but it's not the genius of the franchise, so these two idiots are bigger than the life characters who are responsible for the whole utopian future of the country. <br /> <br /> The costume design was awsome as well. Bill and Ted in fact look great in Bogus Journey where, like in the Excellent Adventure, they look more like the FAGS !!! Even the music in this movie is awsome, the score in particular. I can say so much about this movie because I love it. But it's one of the movies I've grown up and I enjoyed more everyday so I can understand why people hate or just think it's a Bogus compared to Excellent Adventures (which I also love by the way). <br /> <br /> TRIP WITH YOUR FUN!
