For those of you who are unfamiliar with Jimmy Stewart, it's one of his "smaller" films later in his career. And while it's not a great movie compared to many other pictures, it's not bad and it's a decent passage of time - but not too much. Kim Novak is a witch in New York, and for some inexplicable reason, he decides to charm the poor Jimmy to fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and secluded Mrs. Nováková will begin to fall in love with Stewart - and it seems that it's definitely not in the witches book, no! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its sensitivity to witches. They are neither the sacrifice of the child nor the ubiquitous variety. Most of their magic is quite limited and unnecessary (such as Jack Lemmon using his ability to turn off street lamps). And very strange, it seems that all the witches are bohemians sitting in their loins where you can find people who wear berets and listen to miserable jazz. Considering what I think about jazz, it really has to be a smell for the witches in the world of this movie! The film is quite romantic and slightly comic, but it's not something I want to look at. Acting is pretty good, but the script does not offer enough prizes to make it an extraordinary movie - in fact, I almost did record 6 - it was really close.
