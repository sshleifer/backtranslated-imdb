I loved this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, because it offers a refreshing affair about dealing with HIV in the family, with much less hysteria than I usually saw in movies. The brothers are very close, yet they are not judges. Their desire to protect their youngest brother is noble, but in the end it is not needed. I understand that Leo's choice of how to deal with his treatment may not be the most popular with people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I can not believe it's a French television program. It had great manufacturing value. I gave this movie ten, and I think that even when you see it.
