"When I sit, I will never give up," says the mother to her son when she tells her to rest (she is just widowed). It means that rest is what a woman has of her times and her situation: rest in peace, neglect. But she is not in the mood for "rest", not yet. She also has a daughter who reprimands her for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly comes the apparition: sex and passion in the shape of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than she (Daniel Craig, brand new James Bond) when she " nobody will ever touch ". It's a story that thinks about a lot of things, especially about what a woman has to do with her life when her husband dies. We do not seem to have advanced in these aspects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would it be if it was different? Old woman, young boy ... oh, you're not ready, huh? <br /> <br /> The film has intimate tones along the length, except for 2 or 3 sequences in which the tones interrupt and some explicit dialogues appear. Those vulgar touches and the way your son and daughter find out your mother's love affair (quite absurd - see what I mean when you watch it) are the only disagreements in the Mother. <br /> <br /> * My speed: 7/10
