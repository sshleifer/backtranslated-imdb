Others reviewed this movie noir well. I just wanted to add to "Whew!" commenting on one reviewer that related to Elisha Cook's apparently coke-driven drumming episode. This was fine, I have to say. Cook earned some replies for his frantic performance. A little trivia I think: The Chef appeared as a waiter in Barbara Stanwyck's 1941 Ball of Fire. He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara sang, and legendary drummer Gene Krupa drummed, most energetically. Is it too much that suggests that Cook's drumming drumming in the later Phantom Lady was very inspired by the work of Krupa, which Cook was testifying about thirty years ago? <br /> <br /> If you look at Krupu in the "Fireball", I think you will see some clearly similar body movements. One, of course, hopes that HE was not affected by any drugs at the time!
