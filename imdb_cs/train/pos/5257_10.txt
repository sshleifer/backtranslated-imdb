I have to say that this film gave me a dual personality. They told me again and again to stop and start talking like a normal person. But it's very hard ... not Wang. Did you find it nasty and disrespectful? Well, get into the mood a lot more. This movie is just dirty! It's not a movie to show to your parents, but you should show it to a teenager or some immature person in the workplace. Anyway, back to voice manners. Luckily, this site has some Ladies Man (somebody in the studio realizes it's an apostrophe (?) Between e and s?), So you can always have a little bit to say to your bosses or cops. I have a letter in my wallet.
