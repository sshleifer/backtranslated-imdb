If you have any awards for the character and dialogue and any sense of America's cultural history, you'll find a lot of very absorbent material in this movie. Probably it was originally a game, and that's why the dialogue is difficult, but I can not emphasize enough how these icons, which we have only a shallow understanding, are made into really complex and beautiful characters. <br /> <br /> The film is better than any university course that tells you how to create a nature-driven character. <br /> <br />
