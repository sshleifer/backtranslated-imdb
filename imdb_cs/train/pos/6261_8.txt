Fantastic document from 1924. This geography of today's Iraq in the early 20th century was strong. Watch this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not make notes before making his Ten Commandment. Photograph by Merian C. Cooper, later created by Cinerama, an idea that probably hatched during the filming of remarkable landscapes in this film. Werner Herzog fans find this movie treasured, with the heartbreaking debates about the struggle that accompanies the surrounding countries, never having the human ability to stand so obvious. The fact that it happened when it was, shows not only the will of the subjects, but the filmmakers themselves.
