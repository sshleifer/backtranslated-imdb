I was glad to see Jim Carrey in the movie where the goal was not over the top. His character is like us all. We wish more - the better things that will happen to us and we expect God to deliver. Morgan Freeman became a great God. With a sense of humor and a real sense for the love of each of us who is still ready for a holiday when the occasion is presented. I thought character Jennifer Aniston was a bit too vulnerable and understanding of Carry's essentially self-centered TV anchorman I want to be, but that's the way he was written. I think the previews destroyed some potentially very funny scenes, because everyone who saw them knew what had happened before it happened. /> <br /> I read a lot of reviews and some people seem to be looking a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and is not intended to solve the problems of the world, although there are several reports that we could all take to the heart. Funny movie.
