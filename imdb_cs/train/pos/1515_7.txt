In the 1970s, Amicus placed half a dozen of these horror anthologies, one of their best efforts from Robert Bloch's leading horror writer. There are four stories, all worth it, but two - "Sweets For The Sweet" and "Method For Murder" - distinguish themselves as a highly effective way to fear. In "Sweets," Christopher Lee plays an impatient widow whose beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) becomes unhappy with his neglect and brutal intolerance, and she carries a voodoo doll expressing her reluctance for her methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of filthy evil and adds one of the greatest children's performances in Martin Stephen's horror film in "The Innocents". This installment is focused on with great finesse and the final outrage that appears outside the screen is the moment of the purest horror. The "Murder Method" is about the dreadful writer (Denholm Elliott), who is threatened by one of his own creations, the haunting Dominik. This episode is remarkable for its simplicity and horror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell plays well with our expectations. Short snapshots of Dominique reflected in a pond or seen as a flying fantasy on a meadow are really scary. The original poster art, depicting a skeleton figure trapped on a tray holding Peter's Cushing's head, was a rich temptation for fearful players.
