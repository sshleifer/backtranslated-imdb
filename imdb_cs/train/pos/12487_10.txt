Dark Remains is home and simple. The film is full of scary visuals and fears that make the horror veteran the most tasteful of the seat. Scene scene is especially good for these guys. Even if they did not work on a huge budget, everything looks good and the actors are going through. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive endings, which may be negative for some, but I think you're thinking about it. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are in place as a grieving couple trying to revive their lives there, but some characters like the sheriff did not convince me. They are not so important. I give Dark Remains the perfect ten-hour mark that is ten times more frightening than a recent studio story / Japanese remake.
