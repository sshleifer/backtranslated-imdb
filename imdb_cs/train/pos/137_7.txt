After some negative reviews I heard about this movie, I had doubts that I did, but I had 3.99 pounds in my wallet and thought I was playing a budget like a movie, saw it and he did it before, and I'm glad I enjoyed it. Director of Star Movies such as Chain Reaction, Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox) I had to play with it, though it was litter but it was not at all, suddenly I found some humor, especially Alfred Molina star Spider-Man 2 Character Doc Ock. He was the most enjoyable part of the film. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw the name of Matthew, and that made me get it! and its part is not big at all, it's very short at the very end of the movie, it's not the big part that leads me to why people hate the movie. I suggest that you do it. Some parts are bad that require polishing, playing and a little more action. But it's observable.
