For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite Star Trek episode, although "City on the Edge of Forever" was surprised in recent years. I prefer it to be a more curious Star Trek with this fascinating story on the Trek story. I still think it's quite a sophisticated way Gene Roddenberry has incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is to a large extent an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and we) to look at the pilot, the idea that Spock is in court is clever. If you want, you can plot holes. For example, given the Talosian capabilities of mastering Captain Pike's mind and state, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to his planet? And there are other mistaken questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best not to think about the details and just enjoy ST's only two parters.
