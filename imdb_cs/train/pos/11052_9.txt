When I was six, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones," and even if I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to persuade my parents to watch me once a week "The Champions" and "The Avengers ". I think it was the Golden Age of the English Series ... (I already have the entire "Prisoner" cycle!) But also a few years later she became "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" or Harry Potter "In the girl, of course, before I want the" Campions "to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting for" Dr. Who "(packing the whole series in the set, maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not spend more, 8), "People of Tomorrow" and several other "low budgets", but great stories are still available in my areas. speak and understand English, but not all of my relatives, including my parents, who introduced me in these great stories ... I hope sometimes someone felt the attraction of these series and then sold them as I had originally seen them. Inquired or subtitled , but in the same format I saw them. Remember Zone 1 or 4 is OK with my TV!
