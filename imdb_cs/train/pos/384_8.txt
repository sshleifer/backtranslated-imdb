The film version of Alice Walker's extremely emotional and influential novel from 1983 (written predominantly as letters from the central character of Celie to God) was a huge success for the Oscar and right. In the role of the abused and Celia, Whoopi Goldberg gave her the best screen for miles. Not just behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sophia, a fiery woman lonely with fate. Other players cast characters that Walker so clearly presented on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's lifelong wife; Margaret Avery as Shug, the power of change for the good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, woman of preacher; and largely omitted by Carl Anderson (otherwise best known as Judas in the movie Jesus Christ Superstor in 1973) as preacher Samuel. <br /> <br /> Beautifully and sensitively written, The Color Purple manages its source while opening the story to include a feature-length drama by the audience.
