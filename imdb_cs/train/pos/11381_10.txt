The best part of the American in Paris is a long ballet sequence at the end, when Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several major painters. Kelly was previously established as a Parisian artist in Paris, so the sequence is the logical end of a musical bursting with life and energy, Gershwin's melodies and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was in the best spot - it's a little different than Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of the whole ballet-filled film gives him a real wow. No wonder the sequel ended "It's Fun" after all the other MGM music experiences have passed!
