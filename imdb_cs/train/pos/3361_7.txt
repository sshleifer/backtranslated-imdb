I had the intention to recall the tenth anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's extinction with the many unimaginable films I had on VHS; but due to my continued cheerful Christmas marathon I had to deal with this! As it happened, he is one of his best performances - and he was fairly nominated for the Oscar (he is also honored with the film himself). This was also one of 14 collaborations with the other most acclaimed star that came out of Italy, Sophie Loren; both, by the way, are playing against the type here - she is like a rude housewife and he is gay! <br /> <br /> By the way, the name of the movie has a double meaning: the figures are linked to the historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself was shown in long archival footage) but more specifically refers to a "short encounter" of stars in which they share moments of friendship, revelation, and short passion - although everyone knows that the return to their normal existence is inevitable, leading to the sudden heat-blown end of the film. This is practically two-handed (with all the other characters - with the exception of the porter's porter in which the story takes place in full - which includes Lorena's cruel and fervent patriotic husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, appears only in the initial and final sequences); it's still a sober setting that does not deter Scol's director (for the record, it's his seventh film I watched and owned three others on VHS) and cameraman Pasqualina De Santis, so the result - the key - is not foolish: the camera is able to browse through different parts of a large building and observe the behavior in a confidential or discreet manner as the situation requires, but always insidious. The story, of course, depends entirely on the introduction of the two stars to be convincing and they both supply (their chemistry on the screen is quite incomparable); it is interesting that while Loren left home prices, he is a Mastroianni movable, yet unsentimental outsider (a movie, somewhat strangely, it seems to be equal to his sexual deviation with anti-fascism!), which has generally been an international audience!
