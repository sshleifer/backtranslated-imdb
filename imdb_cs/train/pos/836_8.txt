This is unlikely to be considered the best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and a plot of holes. But we're talking about a movie where friends and white-bread businessmen are friends, so a few whims should not be too surprising. Brosnan is excellent in this role, away is James Bond (the role he has left). If he can keep that quality, I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also great as Brosnan's direct man. I have read several negative comments about Hope Davis, but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep inside. There are plenty of good laughs about how Brosnan was running and a few scenes where I almost laughed. My father (the consultant) almost lost it when Julian called himself a "facilitator". Like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another hit-man comedy, humor can be very dark. If you're ready to enjoy yourself.
