This hearty comedy confronts several bizarre characters. In particular, of course, two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac, whose wife lost him because he could no longer withstand his cleaning and attacks on cooking. So they try to kill, but each attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an unsatisfactory sports reporter living in a divorce from his former wife in a bachelor's flat. He will offer his disgusting friend Felix a new apartment in his apartment. And soon the trouble begins because two such opposing characters can not live together for long. Felix turns Oscar's intact apartment into a clean exhibition flat. It cleans and cooks all the time. After a short while, Oscar feels persecution of mania ... He was dramatically filmed and he acted brilliantly. Especially the Jack Lemmon game is awesome. He is a perfect clown. It makes us laugh but tragi-comical. Look at the amazing scene when both men invite their two neighbors to dinner because Oscar has to touch something softer than a sphere. While preparing drinks, Felix sits with two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he starts talking about the weather. A minute later, the subject changes and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he begins to cry and when Oscar returns with drinks, there are three crying people in the living room. The film is full of fun and touching scenes. Intelligent, fun comedy with a big heart. 10 out of 10!
