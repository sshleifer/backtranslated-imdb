Gandhi, Great: Glory in the world is associated with people like Alexanader the Great, Ashoka the Great for their size was disappointed by being celebrated as more than humans. Gandhi is called great because it is not really great, but human, because I always believe that human love is developed in us. Gandhi was a man with humanity and a man who sought to make mankind ready to sacrifice in the battle for humanity, but not his enemies. Allow me to move into the film overview. <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father: <br /> <br /> My father is not a film about Gandhi, but about his son Harilal Gandhi. a son whose father was one of the greatest people who walked this country, the director succeeded in telling the story. The film successfully tells the story of an infant son of a father who leads the nation to size. The film is called criticism of Gadhi's failure as his son's father, I would rather say that it is the victim Gandhi made as the father of a son to administer justice as a nation's father. the essence of this film prevails not only in India, the land of Gandhi, but through the hearts of all the people of this world. Gandhi is the right person. Jaihind.
