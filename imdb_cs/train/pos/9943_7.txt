The film never says it's something magnificent like many movies. The film is promoted as a fun and entertaining time. And that was exactly what it was. It's the Korean version of the Bring Bring it. <br /> <br /> From what you get, you can feel the rest of the movie and how it ends, but the joy is not in surprising steps or the way the movie is the copy of the other. Instead, the joy is enjoying the way the two remaining "turtles" came to be men on their own. That's why the movie is fun and fun. The camera works, especially the dolly moved very well. The scenario, which was weak, was too pleasant in the fact that the characters were not two-dimensional, but they were full of life and desire. This movie will not win any Oscars or any DVD sales, but a fun watch and fun experience.
