The masterful treatment of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" by James Caine as the first film by Luchin Visconti fired mainly around Ferrara in a soulless war torn down by Italy. The original negative was considered ruined, but Visconti saved the press and fortunately we see this early novorealistic work today. The harshly handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who recently revealed her breasts in La Price delle Beffe "(1941)) are a star as meaningful and unfortunate lovers who are about to kill their husband (1939), but probably better than the American version (1946) ).) featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead role.
