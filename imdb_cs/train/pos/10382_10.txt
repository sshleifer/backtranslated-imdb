Like all other reviewers, this movie is constant in mind after 30 years. I remember I went to the library and tried everything I could in this story. I even wrote more information to PBS. In spite of all, I learned that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of 1900. Fastward until 2002, after years of searching ebay for a weekly and that was, a copy of the VHS movie. One other participant offered, but I was determined to win this movie. Lose a candidate wrote me a request for a copy I gave her. Despite the fact that I owned a copy, I was still looking for a place to sell a DVD copy of the movie. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
