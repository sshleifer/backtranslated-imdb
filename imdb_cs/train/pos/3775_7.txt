My Take: Goofy, but an imaginative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter return as two punk rock idiots in this sequel to the adventure comedy BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted are given much more work than traveling over time. They could also travel Heaven and hell! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for the "Battle of the Band" contest, which may be more famous than ever. Meanwhile, for many years in futuristic civilization, the time-wizard from the first film (always observer George Carlin) runs a university that praises Bill's and Ted's names. There, the evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October), is about to get rid of two idiot rock stars once and for all. So he sends two identical android replicas (according to Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do dirty work. There and then Bill and Ted will experience death and have to find a way through hell. to the inhabitants that contain the worst memories of a duo, and then through heaven in an attempt to return to the earth to save their girlfriends ... and their show. During this arid cruise, board games are played with none other than Death (William Sadler of DIE HARD 2), reminiscent of a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film class of THE SEVENTH SEAL, help in helping some intelligent extraterrestrial beings and more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> . But with the fact that it is not a small lack of fantasy and a lively turn in both performance and direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative and yes, fake. Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
