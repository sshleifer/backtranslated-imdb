~ ~ I was able to see this movie yesterday morning on the early reconnaissance pass ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~ "children's" films. That was refreshing for me. I have not read this particular book, so I do not know whether it is true or not. But he certainly took the roughness factor to a high level. It's a story about "new" boys in town, and there is a group of boys who have created a club of this kind and love kids. Do you know well? We have not always experienced it. She has a little brother she can not stand for, and her parents are embarrassed. I liked most how each character was completely different from the other character that they all excelled. The creator (why do they always make a thick red head? My daughter has red hair and she is not bully! Lol), it's a great beat that finds her shouting her own big brother. It was twisting and turning and you will fall in love with everyone and you will find yourself in the direction of all the characters! Even parents, great connections between father and son. All around pleasant, sweet, funny, coarse, etc. ...... Take your children !!! You will enjoy it just as they do!
