Most of the 1970s and 1980s of the Kong Kong martial arts barely function as films; Usually there are several well-planned combat sequences, but the plot is scratched enough to fill the gaps between these nodes - like porn movies, really. But this does a good thing. The most obvious is the direction and choreography that restricts each fighter to "style" - it's really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedy theater, but it works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the language of the camera that uses some impressive techniques (even today), changing the real-time screening speed to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views that point the direction of the story towards the past, or to the future. <br /> <br /> The least clear but strongest and unexpected is the construction. The winner of this contest is determined by who develops the story. The master (writer) sets the game where the lead figure does not know who is looking, which is the same situation in which viewers find themselves. One after another they find out who is, at the same rate we find out who is who. Everything follows the tragedy / noir arc. Conclusion tends to irony, and la "The Sting". She is much smarter than what we usually get from this genre. The idea of ​​"five poisons" is a template of "deadly viper murderers" Tarantino from "Kill Bill".
