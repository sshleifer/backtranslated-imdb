Time for this movie was not kind. Once the controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, this film now looks like a regular version of your typical spookfest. Terrible touches aside (especially that crazy, above the top finale), this is basically a shiny horror film for those people who do not care for this genre. He has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others) but something tells me that the producers wanted so expensive cast to convince viewers that it is not your average lowbrow movie (70th-century disaster producers have a similar idea). I liked to see familiar faces, but the story is very stupid, and no matter how high class the movie pretends to work, it works at the level of your average film abuse in the 1970s (but that's not a bad thing). Still, it's a nice movie, especially for those audiences who enjoy starvation. As usual, Albert Whitlock's dull work is excellent. Overall, quite fun.
