Reverend Cuba Gooding Jr. stars, like the real life of Navy Diver Carl Brashear, who resisted the male Navy to become the first African American naval diver. Sometimes at his side and sometimes his opponent was one man Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Billy Sunday's master (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in many ways pushed, worsened and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His display here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington in a hurricane. Through every scene we see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the struggle in him as he sets out to make his father proud. I also loved the director and created a lot of tension in some key diving scenes. Brashear's encounter with the submarine during the rescue mission is heart-stopping and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only error I see should lie in the supporting cast. Cuba and DeNiro are very complex and exciting. Which one makes you a little sad when you have to bend your heads with such two-dimensional support figures. The evil Lieutenant Cmdr. Hanks, Sunday's wife (Charlize Theron), eccentric diving school colonel (Hal Holbrook), and Cuban love interest are characters I found to have little depth. What made these characters more meaningful and effective was a little more time to develop. Why was the Colonel always in the tower? How did the Sunday woman be so bitter and always drunk? Another curious question must be this. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean, if this movie records this man's life, will his wedding not be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Reverend men are, however, a perfect example of triumph and faith that surrounds the human spirit. This movie encourages you and feels for this human struggle. Which I believe was the reason why this powerful story was narrated. My hat will be Carl Brashear. I really admire my strength. <br /> <br />
