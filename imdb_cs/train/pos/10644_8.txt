The second in the Why We Fight Series focuses on Hitler's grasping of Sudetlanlandu and beyond when he joins Neville Chamberlain and takes on his conquest of Europe. <br /> <br /> Clearly understood as a propaganda in its time, this series has become an information documentary as a test of time, just as most of the "allied bias" has turned out to be a historical reality. The FÃ¼hrer rises himself on his petard with delicious statements to his people and the world when he says one thing and does another when his army moves eastward. The Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulate, but the Poles have faced a heroic struggle against tremendous chances. <br /> <br /> The difference between Hitler's Military Force and Chamberlain by the Munich Treaty as a white flag, which still labeled "Peace in our Time", has long-lasting propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more strongly, as the darkness of the World War is taking on Europe leaving an American spectator with two possibilities, freedom or slavery. In 1943, this simple truth was not omitted, and the Nazi strike was effectively manifested.
