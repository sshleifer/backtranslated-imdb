It's a great movie that I do not think is getting enough credit like Saturday Night Fever or Maze in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl, but is too much a pig to admit his feelings. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his masculinity. Even though it was made in 1980, it is still on time. Great country soundtrack soundtrack is amazing. 10/10
