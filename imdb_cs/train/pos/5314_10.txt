The first time I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival this year and I was a teenager myself, I found the film to be quite appealing. these children are out of the ordinary and very unexpected that they are in the film of this character, but with the right dialogue and unsolicited film, the film has made a complete success. I like this movie more than others, but I highly recommend releasing and watching this movie. it's a mixture of funny comments and funny reality. capturing the essence of high school, the record in high school came to my list of favorites and hoped to have a chance to be released to theaters. I really thank all the kids who did the hard work of filming this movie, helped to cry my eyes in laughter.
