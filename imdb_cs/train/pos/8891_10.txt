I agree with other notes that there was not a huge amount of history in the film, but it was not a documentary! It was fun and I think it was a lot of care. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes seemed to have no place. At one point, it would be worthy, but I caught on to the story and the connections between the families later and found it to be quite good. Despite the fact that it was not re-admission in the 1960s, it brought very large and important milestones into the light of decades. It seemed very fun to me and it is worth watching.
