I just saw the Hot Millions on TCM and I completely forgot about this jewel. Ustinov creates a clever and frightening conspiracy that cleverly moves him from two to a genial ... Well you will see. Maggie Smith is perfect as a crazy secretary / neighbor who has a difficult time at work but has a warm and vibrant personality that blends in this picture. It creates a gentle view of a warm, humorous and real person who, in the long run ... well ... Molden and Newhart as Chief Executives have taken the challenge of what could be a banal role and bring them to their comics. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just pleased to see and I know, at least in Romer's case, Ustinov is expanding his helping hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is about to be shot in the growing age of the computer and it's a problem for the average man or man, but in reality such characters are so involved and so much fun to watch that the computer site is almost lost ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Keep your usual expectations of modern comedy and see the great performances and friendly, forgiving and deeply entangled land on this picture.
