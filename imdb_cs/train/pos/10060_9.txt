Wang Bianlian is an old street artist, known as the "King of Mask" for his masterful art changes in Sichuan. Liang is a famous Sichuan artist and respects Wang as an artist and a man. Liang fears that rare art should not die with Wang, so Wang's mind is the heir to heir. The film is about prejudices, masculine domination, state of art, values, and especially warmth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loop. Everything matters. It's a long story that was filmed so well that the length of the movie is only 91 minutes. Complete satisfaction. Five minutes is an art film, another five minutes is a sad movie, another five minutes is his thriller. It just changes his mood as if the protagonist had changed his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. The story and the script are flawless. The actors are great. Both protagonists are artists who can tell the way they played. Very impressive. He was not even nominated for an Oscar. This year's English patient received the best Oscar film and won the "Kolja" foreign film category. 'Kolya' was okay and probably 'an English patient', the smaller said, the better. Watch 9/10.
