Originally I saw this very dark comedy around 2000 in cable television. What a surprise and joy! In this movie everyone is secretly armed! Dreyfuss plays a "mental" don (remembers a New York Don who should be schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are in their most beautiful and DO NOT LOVE! This proves that beauty and toughness are common! Then there is a big "bullshit" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey), where they play verbally "bullshit" in the world. This film is both gentle and bald. For all filming it can be a very quiet film. And you have the opportunity to visit several actors in final or almost final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of words and is playing without blowing everything in the eye, it's the movie for you. Roger Ebert consists of this film. It's simply wrong. This is a great, fine movie! Maybe not for Ebert. I think it's 10 because it's good, how it's done, and how sad a script can be, while it's not a straightforward comedy kind of movie. I like it so well that I bought it on DVD, because it just can not be shown on cable television. Now it's all mine!
