Tachigui: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera - Tachiguishi Retsuden, --------------------------- ----------- <br /> <br /> The return journey in 1995, Mamoru Oshii unleashed his glamorous Ghost In The Shell animation that helped consolidate the international anime takeover - and also dropped into Andy and Larry Wachowski's concept for The Matrix. The sequel to Innocence (2004) was an inaugural Japanese animated film that competes for the Palmen d'Or in Cannes and letting the heads spin with their style and innovative effects as with their often unclear conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Always the trendsetter, Oshii has now introduced us to Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of Fast-Food Grifters? which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, or the Japanese anime. <br /> <br /> Greet Oshii's work as a "superfit": it's not even animation, not even live action. Instead, he was flying somewhere near 30,000 pictures that were digitally processed and reconstructed in a deceptive plain paper that resembled Balinese puppetry. The movement itself is a stylish, stop-motion style that reflects sequences from the experimental Tetsuo Shinya Tsukamoto: Iron Man (1988). "I could not think of any method other than this," Oshii said in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri, "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." The casting is equally mysterious, Kenji Kawai, who also wrote a superlative soundtrack, appearing as a hungry fan of hamburger, while renowned producer Toshio Suzuki Studio Ghibli spends his bizarre mode, including Katsuya Teradas, who drank Oshi's blood: The Last Vampire and Shinji Higuchi - a special effect that worked on movies Koichi Yamadera is a narrative sounding like a dry documentary NHK, which is underlined comically, as well as the extensive Yamadera career that expresses stoic anime characters such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop, and the plot itself is a bizarre reconstruction of Japan after the end of World War II. context of various fast-food off-shoots - from the shoulders of the shops to gyudon stand-up bars; Ameri reads dogs in McDonalds' convenience stores - inspired by burger-chain restaurants. "Food is the primary root of desire," Oshii explained. <br /> <br /> The mix is ​​a new breed of consumers: fast-food breeders, people who do not want to pay for their tucker and constantly fine-tuning their complicated scams to score free munchies. <br /> <br /> Oshii said his later motif is the honor of "art" eating food on the streets? something that is still considered a bit taboo in this country, and it is a bit likely to explain the use of the title "tachigui". Director of live action movies (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation, Oshii often blurred the definition between the two media. The celluloid result is stored somewhere in the gray area between the two formats. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, the visual experiment is as exciting as it can be irritating. Just do not ask what it should mean; Oshi's films, which are equivalent parts of the brain and innovations, are often not very clear stories. Where does Oshii succeed through a liberal dose of black humor? here is the Kentucky Fried Rat, the death of hula-hoop, the fastest Samurai chef in the world? and in the film is the very nature of surrealism. This is a person who discourages the influence of creators such as Godard and Truffaut and perhaps also owes Andrey Tarkovsky as David Lynch. So it should not be surprising that at one point the B-52 bomber is doing a proletarian ship in a similar look at Yoshinoya. The 54-year-old writer-director seemed to regard it as natural. "Japan that I described in the film may not necessarily be true to reality," he suggested. Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> Andres Bergen
