I'll be honest with Yall, I was a junior high school when this comedy first broadcast ABC I did not think I'd like it at all. But with John Ritter in it I felt it had little potential, plus their was something else I liked. The actor was a great, not very horrible, second comedy, John Ritter always brings his A game in terms of comedy. It was a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My father, who never sees a sitcom, just watches movies, sports and law and order, actually sat down with his three brothers and two sisters, mother and me and watched the show I think, because John Ritter was it. I honestly think this show would still run if John Ritter God was resting his soul, I wish he did not die.
