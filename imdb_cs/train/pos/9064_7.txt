I sat with my children when we watched this movie. We've all found it to be a very funny movie. When Billy goes to a new school, his fifth-class dad will start with him, leading to worms. <br /> <br /> The bet is done and Billy has just enough time to eat 10 worms or otherwise. From that moment on, the fool and his friends are trying to come up with unpleasant ways of cooking, frying or caring for worms to try to get Billy wrong to lose the bet. Billy remains strong, and his way to become more and more enjoyed by everyone, even the friends of bullies. <br /> <br /> I do not want to tell you whether to win a bet or not ... you just need to watch to find out, but I will think that if you like good family movies, you will like it. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for the boys, I have all the daughters and they liked it a lot.
