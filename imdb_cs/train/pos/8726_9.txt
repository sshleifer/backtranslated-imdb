Now it's a family movie! In recent years, there have been several family or children movies that are really worth it, but this is one of them. My whole family came out of the movie, afraid, entertained, dazed, and happy. We still quote small anecdotes. Children loved it and we are (hubbie and I are 36 and 32, respectively)! In addition to beautiful and striking animations, characters (small as they may be, and fictional as they are) are very well developed. There is not one of them with which you would not have empathy. Celebrities bringing these little beings to life are well-measured voice talents combined with the skills and art of some of the best Disney animators. It's a movie worthy of Walt Disney, alone. I think Mr. Disney will warmly approve this new film ... Flick, Dot and their little hero colleagues can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is one family leaving the theater that they want to see again .. and buy their own on a video or DVD. I'm glad to see it again ... and pick up what I missed for the first time. (I have never seen my children so quickly and vividly identify and embrace the characters before ... my daughter still talks about a small "Dot".) This movie is funny, hearty, smart and great fun for the whole family!
