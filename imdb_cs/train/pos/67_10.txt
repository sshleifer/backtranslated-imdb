The industry dropped the ball. The pendant does not make a movie of justice, and when it opened, it was full of screens. If people were able to see this, the work of the mouth would have made it very successful. The 2 main actors give a great emotional performance that really attracts you to the story and to the characters. I checked this on the recommendation of Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in my book. An example of a great movie that was not completely released, except on several screens. Which did not allow them to see. Some movies are coming to the video quickly because they are not so good. This is good Oscar and it's a tragedy on many levels that most of them will never even hear. Maybe it's getting it from your mouth on DVD or cable. If you did not see this movie, you should. Outstanding performances of two major actresses make this film. It could be just another philosophy of adolescent film in special schools, but instead, they are well versed in other good movies. The girl interrupted comes to mind. If you like it, you will like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without getting melodramatic. Even though Alicia is upset and Deanna is crying for most of the film, she's done the real way that she does not look like a stereotype or melodramatic character. The film will move you in many scenes, and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real powers as your school. Eric is even better than in operation. I hope both of these actors get more roles that use their talents and let them shine. Check out this movie, and if you like, you will encourage your friends to stay away from all the bulls that appear every year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 records. What word do we live in? AGHhh. So, to see the world right, he recommended it.
