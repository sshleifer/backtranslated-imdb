Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I can see that's happening ... the rich people have done more crazy things than this. And it was funny. I watch a comedy that is about to be entertained, to break away from the pressures of the world and not take anything seriously. This film is fully suited to this purpose. I judge the film on the basis of his own merits and I do not intend to compare surviving Christmas with Blazing Saddles. I was looking at totally dysfunctional people who grew up in careful, sympathetic individuals who could easily live in the street from my home. It stays on my list "favorite ..... to watch holiday". If you just want to have fun for 90 minutes, watch this.
