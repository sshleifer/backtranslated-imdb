Good effort for the Australian show. which is probably not surprising to see, it seems to be a bit revived in Aussie's high-quality dramaturgy. will I dare to compare this show with the brilliance of love on my way? No. but it reminds us of our early secret life. the cast is great, gibney is working on her charm in the first two episodes that I've seen, the British cast is also strong especially characters and lizzie characters. but abe forsythe can be a saving light (not that it needs to save) if it is the next season. I was not a fan of his performance at the remarkably amazing time of marking the mini-series a few years back, but it was great as a haven in ever greener. its also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. will allow the show to keep improving with each episode.
