At first it looked like a dull comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it, it was really fun. In fact, former comedian Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner and Oscar-nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns Oscars and Gold Gloves) were a great comedy duo and brought together to revive their hospital sketch for a TV show. Willy's nephew Ben Clark (Richard Benjamin's Golden Globe Victory) is convinced they can meet again without feeling each other how bad he is. They can not get all the time, they are both forgotten, especially during an interview, but they do it in the end. Also played by Lee Meredith as sketch sister (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Miss Doris Green, Al's daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's sister, and Muppets of Spade F. Murray Abraham as a mechanic. I think the best part of the movie is Burns when he says Matthau called him "son of a bacard". He was nominated for Oscars for Best Art Direction - a set of decorations and best writing, a script adapted from another material, was nominated for BAFTA for Best Screenplay and won the Golden Globe, the Best Motion Picture / Comedy, and was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!
