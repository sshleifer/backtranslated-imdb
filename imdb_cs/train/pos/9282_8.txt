In Iran, women are not admitted to football games. Officially this is because you have to save yourself from the vulgar language and the behavior of the male audience. But of course it is sexism. Women are inferior forms of human beings. Some brave girls oppose this and try to get to the stadium using various tricks. They are caught by soldiers and held in a cage until the police arrive and pick them up. Despite the mad situation, it's a movie with great humor. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. You will touch yourself at the same time as you laugh. Good work by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
