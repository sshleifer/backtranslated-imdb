The OFON men represent Cuba Gooding Jr., which is probably his best performance so far. Cast Carl Brashear, a man of high courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer from the South who wants to become a Navy diver - but he has problems because of his race. The diving school boss, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist, but he rather respects Brashear. The film is about how Brashear should agree with almost uninterrupted chances, not once, but twice. Performances are what makes this movie special. Good is great and DeNiro, the best actor in the history of the film, delivers excellent performance - his best dramatic work over the years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger wife. The film is a little too strong about patriotism (though not where it was near the level that was in The Patriot), and some of the characters are just one dimensionally bad one (Hal Papou≈°ek is so bad), but the film is now in rare films. It is uplifting and uncynical. Wonderful movie.
