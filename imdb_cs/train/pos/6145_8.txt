Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but it's really a beautiful movie. Angela Lansbury is splendidly tiny as Engletine Price and David Tomlinson has great fun like Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was great too. Children, however, simply missed the same spark, although Paul is very fun and cute. The songs were not as bad as some say, "The Beautiful Brine of the Sea" is the best, in fact all the songs are excellent. The special effects were amazing, they had a lot of magic and the story is pretty original. The most significant events were Mary Poppins, animated sequences. The submarine succession was beautiful, but my favorite was a football match that was absolutely merry. The only other criticism was that I did not end at all when I saw it for the first time. Overall, it's a beautiful movie that almost never ends. 8/10 Bethany Cox
