I was not quite sure if it would be just another of those idiotic night soap operas that seem to be invincible, but it turned out to be quite a good show (it's not just a talented casting). Four friends with diverse backgrounds gather and share the weekly lives of their love. An hour long program follows each of them individually through their often deployed tasks to find love and does it without being boring or harrowing. "Trudi" by Sharon Small is home (allegedly widowed after September 11), who is a little bit of annoyed and poisoned with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their efforts). It's great to see Small Back on Tv because it was great in "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The cat can act. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most injured but still very sympathetic to women because she is struggling with her kind but self-understanding husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly "Spooks") in his desire to have a baby with her, its needs. The last two actors are Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with someone and with all, sex is not specific, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) is a gruesome doctor who is affair with the patient And his son sent his career, and he loved life that was out of control. That being said, I am now wrapped up and I hope the BBC will continue shooting this series because it's good, it's different and it's a great actor.
