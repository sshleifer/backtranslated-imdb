I loved this film for life. It's such a smart story with many classic cues. for example, the ship that disappeared ten years ago was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology, it was the man who killed Chimer, a legendary animal composed of two or more other creatures. At FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly a chimera and his monster. <br /> <br /> I love movies where writers clearly add to their audience with a small amount of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbuster that spends $ 150 million on special effects, but around the scenario is about $ 1.50. /> Healthy
