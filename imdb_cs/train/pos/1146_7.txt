This film is about fictional soap opera. It's very fast and fun. To say something else would destroy the movie. There are several parcels and sub-sections in the film. This film has a set of top hottest stars today. Everybody gives the front performances. This film has been my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of today's soap operas / or the main time of soap operas !!! If you watch the soap go see this movie is cheerful!
