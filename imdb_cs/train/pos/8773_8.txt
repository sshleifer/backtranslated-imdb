Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett, known as the man who defeated John L. Sullivan. Flynn's good friend, Raoul Walsh, director Flynn with a good friend Alex Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Sr., William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious, egoistic young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the Exclusive Olympic Club of San Francisco in the late 1800s. Though benevolent, the fact that he is a "crazy Irish" and a social climber, he opposes the members of the Olympic club; most of them can not wait to see him lose the match and bet against him. In spite of that, it rises to glory, even as an actor. He finally gets the chance he waited for, a match against World Champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan calls for a $ 10,000 advance to make sure Corbett looks like he will fight for $ 25,000. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) desperate to raise money. However, the aid comes in the form of a very unlikely person. It's a very funny movie and Jim Corbett is a great part for Flynn, who himself was a professional fighter at one time. He has the necessary charm, good looks and athletic approach to the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest in insisting he hates him. In real life, it does not seem to exist; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. The focus of the film is on Corbett and his career rather than boxing history. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovations and is considered to be a person who has developed a scientific artistic form. In the film, Corbett is a flotilla of his feet and avoids being hit by his opponents; it is believed that he was wearing John L. Sullivan in this way. A good movie to catch Flynn at the height of his too short time as a superstar.
