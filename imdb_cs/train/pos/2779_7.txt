"Bend It Like Beckham" does not have to mean many Americans who do not know about soccer (soccer), but it is "Hit It Like Bonds" or "Dunk It Like Jordan" for English sports fans. Every young football player dreams of bending a soccer ball around a single player, and like a star player David Beckham, like a young Indian girl named Jess (Parminder Nagra), he does in Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play football games that are forbidden by her traditional mothers. However, as one day plays, a passing Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try the way for all football girls. After satisfying coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the team does something that her mother does not approve of. The film is not about the disobedience of parents, but about a girl who does what she wants to do, even when it is against culture, not only to her parents. Humor appears throughout the movie, especially when Jules's mother thinks she's a lesbian. The film resorts to a little clich√© because the big football game is the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it's not cheese, but fun and light. Soccer action looks good, sports fans enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of football will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, but rather about a girl who is trying to find herself while enjoying her parents, something that has proved to be quite difficult.
