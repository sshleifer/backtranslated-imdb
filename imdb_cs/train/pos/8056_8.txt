This painting in 1935 left with all sorts of Ocars for best director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and Max Seiner music. Victor McLaglen ("Gypo Nolan"), "Call the Marines," for 42 years, stood out as an Irish rebel who belonged to a harsh and tough crowd fighting for the cause and at the same time with poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informant of his best friend to go on a trip with his gall to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), the Guadalcanal Diary, 43, had a great supportive role as the leader of the Irish rebellion and tried to capture the group's informant. Gypo Nolan becomes spooky with his friend's eyes and begins to feel like Judas. The big film for 1935 and the wonderful acting of McLaglen, but rather depressing in all aspects of the film.
