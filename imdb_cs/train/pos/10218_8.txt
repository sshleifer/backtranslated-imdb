We must remember that the 1950s were virtually empty slate when it comes to movies. Hollywood was in the transition from patriotic war films, noir, two reels, etc. To news movies. We had Blackboard Jungle, Na nábřeží and so on. Some people may think it was an improvement. I do not. Who was the mogul who said: If you want to send a message, please call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less fun than some remote therapy. <br /> <br /> This is a pip. These are about three sisters who try to eradicate control over the property of their dead father. One of them, perhaps the only one to be redeemed, uses the help of a pilot company to help keep the rest of the family in the bay. He is initially in for money, but eventually he falls to her. Meanwhile, the rest of family plans to sabotage romance. The results are predictable. In this movie you get a little bit of everything. Sexual tension between nurses. A little gentle masochism. Inherited madness - if there is such a thing. We never meet our parents, but they have to be really bad. Cast is virtually unknown. One or two actors sound very vague. The game is so bad that it's hard to believe. It was released under a roof artist at Bel-Air Productions. He was filmed in Los Angeles mostly at night and probably without permission. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they had run out of money and the producer decided to wrap it in the middle of the scene. I can not explain it - not myself - but I put this pile of rubbish 8/10. I am familiar with the term "It's so bad that it's good," but I do not think I got into this phenomenon earlier. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but it definitely falls. You may want to try it if you like movies that look like they were made in someone's basement.
