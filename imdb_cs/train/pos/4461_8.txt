I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen several Gene Kelly and this is one of his best. I would actually like to place it over his more famous American in Paris. Sometimes the story seems to be lost in Gene Kelly movies with wonderful dances and songs, but not in this movie. Definitely worth the rent.
