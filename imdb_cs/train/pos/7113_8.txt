Being out of the suburb of Philadelphia and very impressed by local history, this film provides an excellent yearly view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes from the city center, train station that no longer exists, 30th Street - which still exists, as well as scenes from the northeast of the city. Good shots of old terraced houses as they appeared. Sometimes the movie is "chatting" - which causes the viewer to lose interest ... but the overall story is solid and very moving. Everyone who liked this movie should also try to see the movie "Bright Victory", also with local footage from Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a college campus. None of these films are in any format and I can not imagine why. I have them both on the VHS from the domestic record as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend all other fans of the history of my surroundings!
