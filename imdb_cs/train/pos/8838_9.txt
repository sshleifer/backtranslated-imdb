Finally, a movie where the audience is constantly arguing for the end of what will happen. Well, we all know that the life of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will spirally down towards destruction, because where else to go down but we do not know how and when to the end of the movie. Hoffman is as good as usual, and even Hawke was decent as a younger brother who basically does what he was told because he really can not think about himself. Hawke could be a bit of his element, but he played pretty well. Add to this combination Andy's wife, perfectly married to Marisa Tomei, cheating Hanka; Andy's misappropriation of corporate funds to pay for drug and sexual addiction; and the father who finally finds out exactly what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie thinks about you.
