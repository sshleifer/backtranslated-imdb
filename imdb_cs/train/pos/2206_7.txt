Do not believe all the negative reviews that this movie will receive. Yes, it's cheap. Yes, gore is ridiculous. And yes, acting is sub-par. However, this is a textbook example of early Slasher movement, and if it is your "thing" (its mine!), Then you will like it. There are plenty of good aspects of this film that more than offset the drawbacks. First, the score of the unknown Kry≈°tof Young is very scary and he emphasizes perfectly violence. The end is a welcome break from the predictable optimistic endings of most of the films. And last but not least, it's the setting that made the film for me. The creators of this film could do a much better job of "dressing" the set to make it more credible as a college camp. However, if you ignore this error, the setting is great. The four colleagues are alone in a huge, deserted, convicted building, just waiting to be ripped off ... reacting to the possibility. When you look, let your imagination do some work and you can enjoy this movie just like me.
