I would not want to put something here, I would say that this technically excellent, flawlessly erect and uplifting little flick will reward the spectator for an excellent hour and a half of fun: it will entertain, surprise, possibly be embarrassed and almost certainly attract the cause from time to time , because it is approaching the inevitable, but not obvious, end, without becoming any clich√© or predictable. Most recommended. Previous user comment gives 8 out of 10 for movie and 10 out of 10 for excellent performances by Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I totally agree ...
