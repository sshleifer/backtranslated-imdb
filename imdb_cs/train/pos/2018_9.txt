I loved it so much that I bought a DVD and a novel at the same time. Chemistry among actors (including the little Arthur) is amazing and exciting. It could have used a little more screen time for the fabulous Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham has been amazing "on it" since the very beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The one who amazed me with surprise and astonishment and astonishment was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I love him in Forsyte Sage and everything else I've seen. But he's going to slip like Arthur here. In my wildest dreams I could not imagine playing a psyche like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I love it. And I love him.
