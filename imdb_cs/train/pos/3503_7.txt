If you remember the summer when you had your first kiss, the first boy / girlfriend or the first puppy you love ... this movie is for you! OK, this movie would and never would have won Oscar BUT as a Dominican I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that you could go right over your head if you are not part of the culture ... the children are raised by the grandmother who is mother and father, the youngest son is frantic and bathe with Cafe Bustelo tin (sooo Dominican!), Judy is harassed by the surrounding men, goes to the church and illuminates the prayer candle ... the brilliance of the film was in those little details. Perhaps it was not the extraction of all the films fantastic film extravaganza, but it was not meant to be NOR, it should be an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture. More of the bitter sweet, fake chef kept this film in real life without taking too seriously. Just as in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" it was simply the story of a young boy. I recommend it (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) = O)
