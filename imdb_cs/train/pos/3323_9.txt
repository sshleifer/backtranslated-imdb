I have this movie about a month ago and now I'm a fan of Drew Barrymore's fan. I love the happy ending and this film gives a brilliant mood with the truths of the Red Sox. This is a math teacher who takes promising children to math trips to a society where Lindsey (Drew) has shown some information. It then leads in Ben (Teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it's not all easy when he admits to being a massive Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First it's fine, but then his baseball gets into Lindsey's way of life. In the end, everything is all right, and it's insisting that Drew runs around the pitch! I got it for two guys in the Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you love such films, I suggest you see some other work from Drew, such as Charlie's Angels and the first 50 dates, or even her new film with Hughes Grant in musical and textual form.
