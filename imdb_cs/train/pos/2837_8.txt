The desperate and unhappy young babe Zandalee feels trapped in a steady and helpless marriage with a failed poet and dear and deceptive businessman Thierry Martin (a solid and credible portrait of Judge Reinhold). Zandalee has a cruel adulteress with a fearless and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (he played deliciously on the slim handle of Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be saved? Or is everything going to break down and going to the seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on a horrible soap opera-like story, something so strong when they were trying to tell the story of a serious and gratifying story about how amok is running and what its potentially dangerous consequences are. The conspiracy goes gorgeously from the tracks in a mixed histrionic third third. Dialogue is just as funny and stupid (sample: "I want you damn naked and I live alive"). Even better, this film certainly brings a lot of delicious female nudes (the beautiful statue of Anderson seems to smoke hot in buff) and the exciting semi-pornographic soft core sexual scenes (Johnny and Zandalee do dirty action in church confession booths as a clear highlight). Tart'n'tangy setting New Orleans adds another spice to the already exhausted control. With his long, sneaky black hair, greasy mustache, dirty mouths, and rough ways, Johnny Cage is the absolute hunger as the only unpleasant "romantic" leader who pours himself into celluloid. Cast: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold are doing decent work with their parts, with the soft support of Joe Pantolian as Zandalee's merry gay gay friend Gerri, Vivece Lindfors as Marty's sentient mother Tatty Aaron Neville friendly bartender Jack and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely uninjured thief. Walt Lloyd's sharp and vibrant cinema gives the picture an attractive glossy look. A delicious, harmonious score A prayer for the rain will also hit the place. A delightfully arched and noisy revolt.
