I ran into the bar and expected it to be a hot beer on a lively day in Texas, but it was pleasantly surprised. After the "Saturday Night Fools", I did not have the desire to see re-make in some farm in South Texas .... and I did not. John Revolta was good as a jealous red, Scott Glenn was well thrown like thuggie ex-con, and Debra Winger was, as always, joy. * Love that woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and it comes from a man who can not stand the sound of country music]. Fun movie all the way.
