After reading the other lukewarm reviews and comments, I felt like I had to come for this film. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films tend to have little in common and expect this to be one of his favorite is probably out of the mark. What this film is is a thoughtful and fearless view of religious belief. The only other film she likes - in terms of his religious message - would have to be Tolkin's "Rapture." I am surprised that someone can say that the story is confused or supernatural. It's a simple movie about Catholic faith, miracles, and redemption - even if you never guessed it until the end. It's also the only film I can think about, whose resolution literally turns into a pun. <br /> <br /> As a (fortunately) fallen Catholic myself, I know what the film is about, and I find something of love in the final innocence of the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the type of theology on which the film is based then it will go directly above you. <br /> <br /> As a movie - unlike the story - 'Cold Heaven' it's not breakthrough. While Rapture is heavy with image and movie imagery, `Cold Heaven 'reduces its own cinematographic qualities. There are no striking shots, no sharp effects, no attempts to customize the content of the form. It's shot but subdued. Likewise, there is no dialogue or action to get into the high drama class. It's a simple story that just unfolds. It may seem strange; but at the end the mystery is revealed. It looks ambiguous; but with a single line disappears in the stomach of Catholic dogmas. <br /> <br /> In this regard, "Cold Heaven" has exactly the same thing in the heart that controls the movie as "The Sting," or "The Sixth Sense" or "Ultimate Descent", or Polanski's "A Pure Formality" . All these are movies with a trick on the sleeves. They can disappoint you along the way, but they have a point - obvious, really - but the fun is at least partly that it was accepted. Still, although it looks like something more than a furry dog ​​storyline, it's worth watching the way it drives - and it's badly driving - you. Try it - especially if you are, or have ever been, a Catholic.
