I was waiting for such an original picture as it has been long ago. Brokedown Palace has that aspect of "hard to believe", but with a genius overhead project and a screenplay, the palace is a great success. <br /> <br /> In fact, I never really liked to watch Claire Danes in one of her films, but I'll tell you what really changed my mind. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes for a holiday to Thailand where they meet a young man who convinces them to go to Hong Kong. However, he neglected to inform them that they would carry an obscene amount of narcotics for him. Well, they eventually got caught and ended up in a Thai prison. I know, I know how you can not know you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you get through that little miscue, you will find a very well written and featured story. I have recently discovered that I get into the storylines of the movies I'm watching, and develop my personal sense of the characters I'm following. This movie is no different. By the end of the movie I found myself taking care of her more than any of the other characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always Pullman delivers with excellent performance and beautifully combines the film. <br /> <br /> There are several twists and turns that will have tears in the end of the movie. It's one of the movies you've probably gone through when you're looking for the movie that's going to be home. I do not think you'll have to remember again in the video store next time.
