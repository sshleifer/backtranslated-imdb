It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is at my top 10. I'm a black comedian lover. Led by Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London), the supporting cast is almost dead. Counting the minor flaws in the movie: Ellen Barkin's make-up gave her the face of her flushed look; there were a few gimme cameos Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor, who served no purpose, and Michael J. Pollard time on the screen was too short. Overall, casting was simply unbelievable without a good screenplay. If you've seen the movie of Larry's Bishop (writer, director), the Underworld (a dark crime film), you'll be looking forward. His next trip (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantin.
