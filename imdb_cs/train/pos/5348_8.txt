Another excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic movie has great action and is one of Arnie's best movies. Arnold is framed in this film as a bad guy and plays the Death game. This movie is an excellent and great science fiction / action movie. I always enjoyed this film and it must be one of the greatest adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
