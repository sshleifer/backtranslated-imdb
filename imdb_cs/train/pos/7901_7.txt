The worst film of all time? Wow what now. You can not be serious. Maybe it's all about what the movie awaits you. I live in Oregon, so I was able to look forward to the beautiful scenes of the well-known, yet surprisingly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas in central Oregon (as well as the sweet portraits of our Ken Kesey and Ken Babbse who look down on Sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie) . These alone were enough to give me the film better than the "average" score. Or ... Maybe it's all about what expectations you have. After reading the AGES book and thinking of yourself "goodness, no one could ever shoot a movie from this interesting, strange, strange book ... especially 20 years later when mores (MORAYS - accent online mark) has changed "- I was really quite pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was wonderfully busy, and I do not care what you all say, I was also pleasantly surprised by the performance of Rainy Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not lesbian, bi, or trans, but I met many people who are similar to the people they were supposed to pose - and these "real" people acted like these actors. A little bit, a little bit - always a bit "on". Gus Van Sant is a strange native Oregon, but garsh he did a good job of adjusting this crazy book, IMHO.
