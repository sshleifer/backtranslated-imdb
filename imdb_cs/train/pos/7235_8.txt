"Girl stupidity" is a kind of semi-communicative, semi-communicative view of film business from the mid-1990s. We will take a look at life in early film studios, where we meet, assemble scenes, treat filmmakers, even lunch with a commissioner. We are also familiar with the little-known film facts - for example, you know that "often" movie actors "do not know the story they are working in?" <br /> <br /> This movie is basically movie star Kenneth Driscoll the discovery and romancing of a young starlet whom he discovers when filming on the spot in the country. I believe the 30-minute version I've watched has been truncated, on the same cassette with Cecil B. De Mille "The Cheat." It's a very credible movie - an easy watch with lots of extras. As a bonus, some of the best-illustrated subtitles I've ever seen accompany a silent movie.
