This is a great movie about the characters in the adult swimming class, about their problems, about relationships and interactions between themselves. He should have a wider distribution because it is much better than similar films from major studies. <br /> <br /> The instructor for swimming is almost Olympic, it reduces the teaching of elementary lessons for adults and often the goal of horndogging from their students. He tries more or less to resolve them with different results. <br /> <br /> Student characters are the mainstream of the USAA; teachers, police officers, college students and retirees who for some reason have not learned to swim. The film covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests while walking through the class. Several subplots provide fun food, including a teacher who goes through divorce, some high school students are making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet boys. It's a good movie, or just one that you'll watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with a reality.
