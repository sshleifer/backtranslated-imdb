Allen and Julie moved to the mountain cabin after their daughter was murdered. No one knows who killed the girl, but they moved to the mountains. So a couple moves into this cabin and is persecuted by the people who were killed there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it. This movie has a lot of crawling for him and has lots of parts that have made me jump. Some parts are predictable, but once in a while there's a part I did not expect. It was a pretty good movie that was not the most desirable movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good. I also liked the end because it left the viewer to decide how it would end. It's also a little sad movie, but a well-done horror film.
