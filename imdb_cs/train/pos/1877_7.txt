Arthur Bach is definitely unhappy in his life as a millionaire and is attracted to the people who are under him "in a social position - he pays behind the open scene as a footman and then he is extremely attracted to the slave." <br /> <br /> He drinks quite a lot and sometimes he's also driving a drink, which of course is not fun. <br /> <br /> The film is great, but there's also a reality behind the comedy. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on the screen and creates a figure for ages. Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but their Gielgud as "Hobson" is the most memorable.
