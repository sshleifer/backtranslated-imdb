John Travolta, the world's biggest honkeytonk and a mechanical bull ... what more can you ask for! Yeah, you probably will not have many surprises or profound meanings in this. Still, I always felt comfortable when I watched this romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet Gilley and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you should expect from a hardcore redneck couple. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dances, a mechanical bull and, of course, the required battles. She has a good soundtrack from 1980 that appeared as "I'm Looking for Love in All the Bad Places", "The Devil Goes To Georgia" and "Hello Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Put your cowboy boots and boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (out of 4)
