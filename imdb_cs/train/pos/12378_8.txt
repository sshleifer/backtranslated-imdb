In the hands of an experienced director this film would be considered a horrible work. Despite the fact that Michael "Death Wish" Winner is just a directional direction, the movie is interesting, original and more than a little frightening. The script conceals more than one gruesome clich√© on the back (a few can not shake) including Chris Sarandon as the hero boyfriend who actually listens to her, because he insists that scary things are decreasing. Burgess Meredith is gorgeous as an extremely crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner is a young Beverly D'Angelo who is her inimitable lesbian mistress. John Carradine does a nice job sitting on a chair. And beware of a short story from an unknown Chris Walken! This movie is spooky and creative. Shortening the plot is beautiful if predictable. The culmination, which I do not give any details, is disturbing and impressive. Again, a better director could do more, but it is quite satisfactory - at least for those who have the sensitivity of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> If you like modern overproduction of fantasy about torture, it's not like that. There is almost no gore. Direction is Spartan. The effects are scarce, although there is some wonderful makeup in the neighborhood - most of them are not a make-up ... but maybe I have already said too much. <br /> <br /> Higher than its quality can justify, but I like it just like any "8" movie I've seen.
