The girl in misery is pleased with the great songs by Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a great support cast led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. He is usually a stupid conspiracy for Astaire as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen's secretary. They are preparing a story about love, because women become victims to the left and right. He runs to Fontaine, who is kept in his castle by a native aunt and obedient father. A silly plot. <br /> <br /> Great songs include Foggy Day, Things look up, Nice work if you can, and now I can not be saddened. Fontaine does not sing but makes a short (and decent) number with Astaer. Surprisingly good in several dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including a resourceful and entertaining fairy tale in an amusement park. Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson as Albert), Ray Noble and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the leading madrigal singer. Jan Duggan is in the middle of a T-shirt that sings when he sings Nice work if you can get him. Her facial expressions are merry. It was also a scenario in W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, starring Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of abuse on this film due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, which, as noted elsewhere, would be terribly wrong. Visiting TCM notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. So. Two more future disasters. Fontaine is all right as Alyce, and dynamism allows a musical number to belong to Astaire, with a great comic shock from Burns and Allen. Funny movie, great songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!
