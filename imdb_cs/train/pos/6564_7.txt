Jake Speed ​​(1986) was an entertaining parody of Indiana Jones and other adventure films that were popular in the 1980s. Wayne Crawford plays as Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights with the malevolent wherever he goes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) they coach the earth and are looking for some action (and some decent stories). Duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins), whose sister was kidnapped by a bad white trader (John Hurt). Can he find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her rescue her siblings? Sappy and a cheese film that does not pretend to be something that is not. I have to give this recommendation. That is, if you like movies that will be fun and for those who do not take everything in nominal value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
