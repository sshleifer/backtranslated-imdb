YOU MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED on the press and was cheerful. We speak without interruption. It makes something about Mary look like a meandering drama. Amanda Peet shouts stellar quality with her winning combination of beauty, brain and serious acting skills. Peter Cohen, director, made a top film that portrays the raw material inside male egos in the city's dating of the world. For the whole comedy, Whipped is successful with his intelligence. Who is the director for the first time so rare, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barbera capture the depth and very strong performances as if they were men with a smooth lady. You must see that these guys go to work and they are going to Peet's site. Watch the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth a 3-minute download.
