As a long-lasting Barbra fan, any post that is such is impressed. This is the classic movie. It has mistakes (highlighted in other posts), but gives a look at the time (late 70's), which will never be there anymore, and it is fascinating to watch the on-screen deployment. <br /> <br /> Streisand struggled hard to make this film his own. I think she was never happy. But it brings to its fans a new Barbra (at that time) with LIVE singing, a young fresh look and a very impressive acting. The story is harsh but exciting and keeps you interested all the time. The vast "end" of one shot is hard for most fans who are not barbarian but speaks with those who admire her talent. <br /> <br />
