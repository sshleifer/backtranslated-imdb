Forget it is a "B" movie. Forget it is in many ways obsolete. Instead, make Id Lupine's writer-director much deserved recognition for solving a theme that was at that time (1950) taboo in Hollywood. In my opinion, this was the first film to deal with rape and the emotional and mental influences that this crime has on its victims. Although most acting actors are at best pedestrian, Mala Powers, who was eighteen or nineteen at the time, gives excellent performance to the whole traumatized young woman Ann who is trying to escape her "shame." Based on her work in this film, I'm surprised she did not have a more successful acting career. And Tod Andrews has a few good moments when the minister came to help. <br /> <br /> Ms Lupino, apparently working on a limited budget, was still able to create some unforgettable scenes, such as persecution of the street and the aisle leading to the rape, and the police assembly that follows. And she created a hot-eyed end that let me wonder if Ann might really have a normal life.
