I believe Soprano is an amazing show because of all the supporting characters in it. I've bought every video for now, and I'm waiting for the rest of it to be released. In all 42 episodes, Episode # 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance is the best. This episode deals with my favorite figure of all time in Soprano. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed by having kidnapped a bad car and accidentally killing the truck driver. Brendan was amazing because he was actually one of the few characters that actually stood against Tony and his gang. Eventually, he finished when he was fascinated by his eyes as he bathed, and this is my favorite scene in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is the first for me. And my favorite figure was sometimes Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to murder Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they caught him and tortured him. My favorite friend is Sean Gismonte, who was killed just after filming Christopher. Finally, the most popular character is Chucky Signor, one of Uncle Junior's followers. He was killed on a ship by Tony. All the amazing characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about sopranos. All men are always killed. Do you know what would be great to change the soprano? They should have the whole episode showing all dead supporting characters in hell and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvia and Paulie because they have to take revenge. Brendan Filone strikes back !!!!!!!!! 1
