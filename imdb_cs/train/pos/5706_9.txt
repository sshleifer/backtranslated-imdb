If this movie took place only a few years later, I could stab two or two points because the sound quality was rather bad. Sometimes the film appeared as a silent film during internal scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). Since it was 1931 and the French film, it is absolutely well-founded. Especially because it happened in later French films - until then, sound problems should be solved completely (for example in L'Atalante in 1934). Ok, besides some minor sound problems, this is a little cute movie about the missing lottery and a long list of people trying to get it. And when searching, there are lots of honest little songs that you can not help but love. Pretty charming movie everyone.
