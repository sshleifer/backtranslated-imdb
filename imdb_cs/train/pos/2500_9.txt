... probably the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). except one big damn fan service for fan girls (well, that was useless ~), it was a story that fired me away. hurricane for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people do not agree with me, but it was none of the three big actors (boys playing Shoho, son and Kei) who did the best performance (for me, anyway). it was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 from the Battle of Royale! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like Hyde, I worship his voice but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little 'off' but I loved the scene where the body of the dead man danced the other men boy. and Gackt was not that bad at all, I preferred how his character had made it difficult at first. I can not say much about my background on lee-Hom Wang, I will not pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the star occupied cast. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best cooperation I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it does not happen). while the complete song takes about nine minutes, you will not notice the lengths, because you would enjoy hearing Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> This film is a prerequisite not only for fans (a huge fan) but also for those who have science fiction, Asian-style futuristic films.
