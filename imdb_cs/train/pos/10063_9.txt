Shooting is nice and the environment is very realistic. I liked to courageously correct the concept of many difficult moral and social morays from the Chinese mainland in the 1930s and other basic human questions - I felt I could get a real sense of times, recreated even in the beautiful shots of traditional Chinese theaters and purist images of life on the street. It seemed worthwhile to experience. The predominant role played by Buddhism is probably the most true - both in its stupidity and in the philosophical aspect, which is perhaps the most effective thing I've seen in Chinese film. Casting is great. Pictures are unforgettable. The effect is pretty solid. Thematically crazy, yet rich enough to compliment the wagon's expression.
