I went to see this movie with a group of friends one night. I did not hear much. So I did not expect anything. But when I saw it, I liked it very much. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. I have to say, however, that Giovanni Ribis' acting performance needs a little performance. But such a small deficiency could be suppressed. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds is a retired thief who has to pick up 60 rare and exotic cars one night to save his brother's life. Film is by no means predictable. So the end should be a surprise. Do you think this is just another, fast car movie? Well, you're partly fine. There is much more. Everyone should watch this movie.
