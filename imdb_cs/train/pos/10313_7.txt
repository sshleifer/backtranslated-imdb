China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This production of Golden Harveta was supported by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost his impression because he is not such a great director. The only reason to watch this film is to see the fighting skills of Mrs. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Menge, it could be a classic action, instead of a raw movie movement. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns home to help her father. She has problems with the local crowd and needs her help. So he returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they just get rid of Master Big and his bad buddies? If you are a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock, this movie is for you. I only enjoyed combat scenes, everything else was garbage. Why did Raymond Chow not slip a few shekels and hired a top executive director? We recommend.
