If you want to laugh seriously, look at this movie and the things Bruce causes to his fellow rapporteurs. Deleted scenes are invaluable. I do not know why they did not include them in the original movie. It can not be because of the time because the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs drugs!
