I could not believe that at the time I wrote this review, I had a low IMDb score of 5.6 on Johnny dangerously and I thought I had to do something to promote as much as possible this unforgettable comedy. Seriously, to get such a low rating, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention the very shallow open mind. If you do not like humorous moves, do not watch them! The combination of absurd humor, a very good narrative, and a superb tempo, given by multiple gags, came into my DVD collection. And that's not even a mention of the visual fractions that are here and there, and of course the use of "wedge eyes" and "cliches" based on our favorite films of organized crime. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to a lot of people and I was introduced to it without any specific expectations (except when I was watching a comedy) - in my state of mind you should, in my opinion, watch any movie - liked. It goes well, it is not long to watch and there is absolutely no slowdown in the evolution of the story, which I think is really simple. Sure it's not perfect, some gags are somewhat short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other views that are yours. That's why I rated 9 out of 10. This movie is, in my opinion, the forerunner of "Top Secrets" and "Space Balls" in the field of absurd but well-thought-out comedies. Which are now more absurd when they renounce their thoughts and genius. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people think they are well understood, if at all. As a last word, I would like to say: watch for yourself, do not follow the average Joe words, and if you do not like it, then you will actually know it was not good for your taste, which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion.
