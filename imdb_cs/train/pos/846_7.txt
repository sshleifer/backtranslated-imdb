Two years ago I watched "The Matador" at the cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Of course, I was totally under the impression of the great role of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday I filmed this movie again on TV, so I looked a little deeper. Now I can safely say that this film is not so strange, but you have to love it just for one man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan picks up his class in my opinion with the amazing performance of Julian Noble, a tired hit that has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Gregg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man who has a bad luck: his son died in an accident, his work is not so good and he is not sure he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). <br /> <br /> I always liked such movies; a crime film with a great deal of humor. Most of the humor comes from Brosnan when he tells jokes about dwarves with great d ... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "On Sunday morning, after a naval left town, I look like a thug in Bangkok." Brosnan says it with his spell while drinking margarita as usual. I also like Greg's typical American face Kinnear in the role of loser, which is very lively because there are plenty of people like Danny Wright. So I recommend that you take Brosnan's best role sometime. It will make you smile and admire at the same time. Big Brosnan in a small movie.
