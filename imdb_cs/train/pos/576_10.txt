this movie was simply brilliant, casting, scene scene, story, direction, all really matched the part they played, and you could just imagine that there, Robert Redford is a wonderful actor and now the same director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish island as I did, so I loved the fact that this movie was a real connection, funny notes throughout the movie were great, it was just great, I shot the film once it was released for retail and I recommend everyone to watch, and fly-fishing was amazing, really wept at the end it was so sad, and you know what they say when crying on the film it had to be good, and it definitely was also congratulations to the two little boys who played Norman and Paul's part , they were just great, kids are often omitted from the laudable list, because the stars that all adults play are such a big profile for the whole movie, but these kids are amazing and They should be praised for what they did, do not you think? the whole story was so beautiful, because it was true and in the end it was the life of someone who was shared with us all.
