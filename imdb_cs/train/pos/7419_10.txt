Based on the preview that I saw, I went to the "Shower" that was expecting a little comedy; what I found was a deeply touching drama of family life that was said in the most popular photographic images I've ever had privileged. In addition, I later rewarded the appreciation of the sudden outburst of scenes from the past (in the dry country of North China and in high Tibet): is not that how memory works? One more time I'm here, I'm next in the landscape of the past, like this ... <br /> <br /> It's not just the strong recommendation of this movie, I put it among the two or three best movies I've seen in 60 years . By the way, a few more years ago, in the United States, another Asian "comedy" like "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese). As with the "Shower," the preview did not give even the smallest depth of the film, which turned out to be a fine psychological study (although it is full of entertainment moments). Is there any fear from distributors that movies seem to be too "important" or "deep" to appeal to viewers in the US?
