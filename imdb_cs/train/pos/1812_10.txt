This is one of the biggest movies ever, perhaps even the biggest movie ever. I forgot about the film for about 12 years. Until I saw that ADGTH had added television, it brought me a lot of memories of me when I was a little boy. And when I watched her a few nights ago, I became a film addicted. I usually do not like animated family movies, but this is strange that it's a perfect family movie. The end of the film always touches my heart and I'm very sad, but that's what makes this movie amazingly better than all the rubbish that's coming out today for children's movies. I mean, the film is G, and it's about 2 dogs involved in gambling, there's a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell in the movie. Which I believe makes the film from good to great. I think movies today do not bring reality to children and they do it in this film. RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
