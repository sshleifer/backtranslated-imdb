I have never seen this movie until I bought a cassette last year. I was fascinated and entertained. It has all the elements of what I like in a Sci-Fi story, in a book or on a screen. There is a social commentary, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There's something weird and fun about when you look at the "farther future" of the 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> I think it must be seen, not just for sci-fi.
