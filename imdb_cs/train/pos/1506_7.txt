Before movies like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Suspiria" and "Halloween" changed their horror look forever, the genre was a more gothic and much less violent era. Movies such as the Hammer Horror series and Rosemary's Baby were so scared and enthusiastic for the audience in the 1960s and 1970s. I can not tell you how many times I rented this movie in my childhood, but I did it because there was something about it. I did not want to confine myself to films from the 70s and 80s of the 20th century, and zombies and films like this production from the famous but sadly gone Amicus were a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: A spectacular musical score. Strong performances of star cast. Brilliant cinematography. Lots of good old-fashioned excitement and winters, especially in the first and last vignettes. A few scary moments and pictures. It moves slowly but rises. The house is a scary, oppressive home. Great production design and decorations that give the film a real old Gothic horror feeling. It depends more on moods and bloodless bursts than on gore and unwarranted nudity, because it's excitement. Disadvantages: Some problems with the pace in the first half. In addition to "The Cloak," the rest of the stories are remembered as if they were before. Cooks abundantly. The second story of "Waxworks" has subtle acting and it's a moment, but it is the weakest of four in terms of fears and tensions. A low budget is actually actually showing up. <br /> <br /> Ultimate Thoughts: After the first view of this movie for many years, I have seen why I often rented it. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a good example of when horror films were made in style and class. Watch this with the lights turned off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
