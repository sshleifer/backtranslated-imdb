What a wonderful movie ... <br /> <br /> This film that accompanies the fresh, emotional and dreamy music of Oscar-winning Rachel PORTMAN remains a pure pleasure worth watching more than once a year. <br /> <Unbelievable casting ... <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's role. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! It was fascinating to watch, the man find himself on the edge of his seat, just in every word and hysterically with her laughing. One of the most amazing characters I've ever met. From one of the introductory scenes, when I thank Mr. Woodhouse for sending "that beautiful slim pork ... PORK, MOTH !!!" she screams into her unfortunate and clearly hearing-impaired mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emmy Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law), who looks deserted and lost. The comical ways Emma would avoid Miss Bates's grid will be building herself for one really scary picnic scene when Emma offends Miss Bates, who takes her to her heart. Then we see that poor Miss Bates stutters and tears on the brink and just the crushed person can not help, but she feels that her heart is destroyed for her. It's a classical scene to be overturned and played over and over again ... The end is here with "Sense & Sensibility" and provides one of the greatest lessons on how to make a best friend ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie enjoys you the same way I do. <br /> <br />
