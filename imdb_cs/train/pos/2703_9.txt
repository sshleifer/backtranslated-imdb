I'm not a huge fan of camp kitsch and "so bad is a good" type of tracking. I really like this movie as a fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. The whole thing has the rings of John Waters, and he is undoubtedly excited, but with some outstanding actors and considering the direction that best uses structure and constant moves. Billy Zane moves with an incredible expression (see the autobiography scene for textbook lessons on how to use motion) and is bordered by some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie, but if you have the chance to watch it, save time because it's likely that you end the movie with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the humor of some big stars. We highly recommend.
