I first saw it when it was more than a decade ago. I saw it today and it still had a big impact on me. She fought against them about the girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who is raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who has a girl's pain. Caitlin is in a popular high school, but when she reveals that she is being raped, the handle turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). This film chronicles Caitlin's struggle against the whole city, including a high school, which basically allows athletes to identify the social environment and allow them to get away with whatever they want. Thiessen and Green are the best artists, and there is a real chemistry between these two groups. in the whole movie. All the actors in this movie, inspired by current events, did a great job. Fight Alone really captures the essence of what's at high school (at least in 1995) and has self-confidence and reputation. Recommended. 10/10
