For me, something very attractive and nostalgic is about science-fiction with a low budget. As a child in the 1950s, it was all. In 1957, I saw "The First Man in Space" at the cinema with my father. It was Marshall Thompson and some other poor people who got the title role. It is also a space mission that has become a bad one where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. I really scared the good and the lot. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives in me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost re-make just in full glory ... it's where the scenes were well lit. Just have to love for what is ... ... over an hour of darkly illuminated scenes, disgusting sounds and that scary music. Bravo!
