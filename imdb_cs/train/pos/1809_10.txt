All Dogs Go to Heaven is the smartest animated film that dogs have in 1989. Previous Don Bluth Film Country of Time (1988) has become a success. Dogs are as cute as small mice. Aw, I just want to embrace them when they're cute. Where I was? Yes Yes. His animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly expressed and the songs are cute and touching. It opened on November 17, 1989 the same day as the Little Mermaid produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. The part where Charlie killed Carface was so unforgivable. Carface is so important because he wanted to kill Charlie. Hanba on him! Love survived the song Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to the sky is the best animated movie ever.
