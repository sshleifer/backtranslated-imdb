Some spoilers If you are a fan of great horror, then you will know that Halloween has paved the way for many slasher films. Frequently imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a real horror of classics and is certainly one of the most awesome films ever made, if not the most shameful. In fact, I've seen this movie after seeing the rest of the series (do not ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 films before I saw this, so it worked. But I have to say that all this will turn away everyone else. It's really scary, and when you see Michael leap from the bushes or walk in the dark, he'll send the cold to the back. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael hits the guy and tilts his head to the side. It's one of the oldest films in the movie. <br /> <br /> Later slashers, like Friday's 13th movies, were fun and less intense than this movie. I like series F13 better than the Halloween series, but this movie is better than all F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a creepy villain because it's realistic, you could imagine that a man like himself will be killing people. I admit that this film gave me the nightmares after I looked at it for a couple of nights. What's great about this movie is that it does not rely on gore or humor to entertain audiences. It's just a pure terror. It's bad later series movies that have rocked since this time because it's just as good as an example of the magnificent movie slasher as they come.
