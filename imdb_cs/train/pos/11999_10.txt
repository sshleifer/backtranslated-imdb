I have seen this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about an actress who played a blacksmith's wife - I'm not sure of her character. I went with her to BYU and lost her - her girl's name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. Not listed in credits. This production was excellent, ripping on all accounts, excellent dealings for everyone. I do not think I even want to put it in the general category of "acting", rather like "displaying the feelings of the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens on this final dispensation" ..... something like that. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website or something like that, let me know !!! She was great in her role, by the way ... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
