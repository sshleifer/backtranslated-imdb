Legend of Zu is perhaps the most exciting movie I've seen in recent years. It exceeds all expectations and is really an artwork. With unrivaled visual sceneries and a story of divine proportions, Legend of Zu continues to smoke his audience with his Majesty. This movie is amazingly created using high-tech cgi, which allows fantasy fans of the genre to see their vision come alive. The game is perfect for this type of movie; if you were immortal with supernatural powers, I thought you would hold more for yourself. <br /> <br /> Unlike many comments, the conspiracy is actually fairly easy to observe while maintaining a rapid pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone who can not follow different characters simply does not have to pay attention or are accustomed to such levels of sophistication as titanic. The task is to match and peers with thematically motivated themes to let you breathe in the air. Legend of Zu is so great that so many people are postponed by their nobility. Let yourself be flooded with your fantastic vision and you will love this movie.
