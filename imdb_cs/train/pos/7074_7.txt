Terry Gilliam went back to the future (already done in "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus that destroys the human race. The script is totally crazy, with some easy tricks, but it's pretty funny and Gilliam proves he has fantasy (futuristic scenes are great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (what happened to her?) They are just fine, but Brad Pitt is so annoying that when he plays the part that is in his hand he is so compelled and not credible. It should only play successful young men. <br /> <br /> * My course: 7/10
