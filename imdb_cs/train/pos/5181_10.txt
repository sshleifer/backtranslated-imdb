I really enjoyed this film, but the four things really did come out: perfect comedic timing and Sam Raimi's performance as a skillful camp (?) Man, amazing characterization of the camp owner and best cinematography by Alan Arkin. The beautiful golden tones of the outer scenes attract me into the film as the sunset on the shore of the lake attracts me into my own summer memories. Dialogue and moods are very natural and believable. Some reviewers criticize the lack of a deeper scenario. For me it's just the lack that makes this movie work. The characters and their problems seem to be real, and because of that I care about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all parts together form a whole that feels good.
