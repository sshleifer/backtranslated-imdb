I am amazed by Jim Carrey. I keep on putting the film in my head. Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying, her sweet innocence) trying to get Grinch in the spirit of Christmas, the childhood of Grincha (very fun!) And, moreover, the weak ending with Christmas, All about the gifts. I have to say that I felt stupid when I went out of the theater with a lot of kids and toddlers who laughed and so on, but this film was a good full adaptation of Dr.Seuss's short film and IS for all ages.
