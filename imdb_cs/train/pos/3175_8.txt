It's great to attract this movie. I was honest with laughter. It does not matter that it's a low budget because it works for me. To be honest, my wife does not like it anymore, but she prefers another type of movie. Still, she admitted she was very creative and well assembled and probably all on her shoes. Those characters that are life are strange and embarrassing, they give me something to relate to in my own world. Just go ahead and be who you are. Dreams are what you are doing. Watching this film second and third time, I realized that there were hidden moments that first passed through me. What I can say, I like my fun with a certain complexity. Anyway, she liked it. I hope we will see more.
