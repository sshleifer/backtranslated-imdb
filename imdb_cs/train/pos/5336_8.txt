I like this movie very much, because in Australia, Chinese movies like these never show up in the main time. I have to say that this is one of the best serious movies ever to outline the difference between the people of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. This really shows that there is discomfort between these two, but it can only be improved when HK learns Mandarin. It also showed me how there is an Indian rock scene in the Indian rock scene and that Chinese people know how to wipe the guitar and get the house funking! Who said China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with a clean and sharp voice, honest acting and magical puree. I recommend this film to those who do not know much about Asian claims to clear themselves from typical Western stereotypes and people who simply love a Chinese-Asian cinema like me. Look at it!
