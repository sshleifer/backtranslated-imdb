For beginners I did not even know about this show because it's about a year because of the internet. I have never seen them on TV before in my country and many people do not usually know about this show. It's a pity because this is simply the most original and clever animation I've been witnessing for years. <br /> <br /> I do not distribute 10 points a lot, but it's one show that really deserves all 10 points. Although at first glance it may look like a typical cartoon, but keep in mind that this is not a children's show. When the whole story unfolds, you know it's a really deep story with the spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on spiritual animals, the old Indian believes it has been preserved for many years. This gives the show an original twist, which is often not found in animated shows. <br /> <br /> Overall design is also very different. Sometimes it reminds Spawn of a bit of harsh design, and sometimes it takes more cardboard approach. I believe David Feiss, who also created and directed a cow and a chicken, animated the segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in a comic book). If you are looking for a show with a crooked mind, show that it takes on different subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then you should not miss it. As soon as you start watching, you're probably going to watch it until the end. One of the minor facts may be that the show takes less material from the comic, but it is not too unpleasant. The only question, however, is where is the DVD?
