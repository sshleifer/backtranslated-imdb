I saw this movie when it was new. Later I hired her in Japan after three years, I fear I would collapse when I saw it in the harsh light of my widespread international experience. The film surprisingly surprised me how accurately it portrays the cultural clash between Japan and Pennsylvania (from where I came from). Not all things are in place, but the tone is perfect. I'm still in Japan many years later, and I'm still looking forward to this film for its equal treatment of both sides in the story. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors have spoken in original Japanese, dialogue is reduced in the Japanese version to conceal clear delivery problems in the second language. I noticed that one reviewer used it in the Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan by watching this movie than reading some of the "serious" books on the issue (most of which were written in the 1980s and funded by propaganda Japanese companies). </ span> <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by dragging average ratings from one-star reviewers who also thought it unlikely that the Japanese wanted to build cars in the US. (Of course, the Japanese run many factories to keep them close to customers and avoid commercial friction.) This is a very warm and entertaining movie that I would rate higher if it were not for some 80th clich√©, such as dancing around a cheese electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been more fun.
