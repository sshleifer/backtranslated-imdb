<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect films ever made. It's a return to glitter, a romantic comedian of the 1940s but with modern touch. Scenario breaks with joke, spell, humor and tenderness, cinematography is breathtaking (NYC has never looked so beautiful) and of course it's a cast! Dudley Moore changed his career as Loveable, drunk by Arthur Bach. It's also sad and real. One of the best lines of the film is its deep "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us are drinking because we are not poets." Big Sir John Gielgud has earned a well-deserved Oscar for his great performance as Hobson, Arthur's Chamberlain and Steward. Although he considered it "take money and play a role," he brings to the mark all the talent, experience and bravury of an expert tragidian and a sly comic. Support for casting is also outside this world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's stupid grandmother Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic mafia. <br /> <br /> The score is also a remarkably memorable and perfectly complimented film. bad fateful sequel.
