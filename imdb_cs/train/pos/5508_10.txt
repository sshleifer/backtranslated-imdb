The year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who was a Cuban citizen for the last five years, disappeared from the face of the Earth and left Fidel Castro's courage to announce that he was probably dead when he actually left Cuba to move to Bolivia to she lived the assumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara took the idea of ​​overthrowing the corrupt, bourgeois government there. Steven Soderberg returns again, where "Che: Part One" leaves (this time better). Movement is more of a goal, work on playing is sometimes so fine (including the turning of the sick Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Just say it's probably best if you see the two movies to get a true story about Guevara and the man he was (I rarely had the opportunity to see the two films in one show) on a long track!). As in the case of "Che-Part 1: Argentina," this film does not have MPAA ratings, but it contains enough salty language and violence that easily grabs it as "R".
