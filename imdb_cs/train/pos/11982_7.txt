This is how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in a rerun in 2001. <br /> <br /> I really liked it but it was too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I AM NOT MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS! <br /> <br /> The story of old TV shows. They even even stole from The Partirdge Family. In one episode, "The Partridge Family" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> The actors play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn's most remarkable, especially when played in one episode. <br /> <br /> Michelle figure DOES NOT HAVE a joke, but then she had this little kid to "take revenge" on her sisters for a joke after them. <br /> <br /> Story lines that came & went into one episode. Joey got a TV show with Frankie & Annette, she never heard of it. Danny suddenly played the guitar. 1 episode is coaching football, 1 episode he is training softball / baseball. 1 game & you are out of Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey are still working very fast, without experience. Only on TV show. <br /> <br /> I liked D.J. & Stephanie characters. Jodie Sweet's wish she could learn from Candace Cameron Bure, and she had a pure adult life without drugs.
