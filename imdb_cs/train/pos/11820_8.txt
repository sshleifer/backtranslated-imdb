Heh, if I tell you to compare the Dark Knight with an 18-year-old comic adapted to a movie rated 5.9, will it crazy me? It's just to catch your attention. Every day I meet people who complain that there are no good movies that seem to know only the latest band. It is never bad to search and explore old films, especially those that have good artistic value. Dick Tracy is one of those who can not be slightly obsolete when it comes to technology. Negative reviews mainly complained about DT's "Confused" story. But it seems to me that the story is quite clear and I have no problem. I did not see a comic, but I'm not a huge American comedic fan, but I appreciate high-end movies and performances. Most people's expectations were too high for a story to tell. But if you see a movie that will take Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what are you waiting for? I have some scratches on my head and can not it be that we really see the same movie? The title role, though not as competent as it sounds, was still capable of pulling and enchanting viewers. Madonna was significantly less in her seductive role than "breathless", but she added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was witty and miraculous for himself. He seems so brave he can go sarcastically about his formerly successful roles. We can see the hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler, and Robert De Niro, who makes our stomachs laugh. Thanks to makeup. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for me. The real feeling really got me.
