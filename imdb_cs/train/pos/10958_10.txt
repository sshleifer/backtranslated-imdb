This show is so incredibly cheerful that I could not stop watching the marathon at the comedy center today (despite having seen all the episodes earlier). I have always considered Silverman as a huge talent, and it is ultimately a vehicle that enjoys a wide audience for these talents. I look at this show and I laughed a very big percentage of the time ... I can not say that many television shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (especially) entertaining! This is a show I will never see and it's the one I'm going to buy on the DVD as soon as it comes out. You owe it to yourself to watch this show ... I'm predicting the long run of this series ... And just to be clear, the people who are offended by this show just did not get ... maybe they lack the intelligence to understand it. .. they should stop doing fools of themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in connection with Silverman, or who claims to be just "shocked" ... is so out of the mark ... It's exactly the opposite; it is enough for Google to quickly see that it is a huge advocate of civic rights, etc. If you do not know that you are ironically accepting all these outrageous views, you do not get it. And if you do not do it, do the rest of us with kindness and keep silence so we can all enjoy the fun ...
