All the reviews here about how much PCs lack the plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene does not make sense, etc., Everybody misses the main point. Let's be honest. This is a film that originated in the late 1960s and early 70s in Los Angeles. It's the movie to be watched while your H-I-GH is out of your mind for some psychedelic substance. Find some kind of navel and smoke upwards, or you get a slight flush of acid. Seriously, these straightforward and sober reviews of ZP are missing. You can not get anything out of this movie in an equal mind. As long as you watched this movie on a big screen (which I'm lucky to have done three times in the 1990s, when ZP was quite rare), you miss out, you have no idea what this movie is all about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you insist on not being intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the end when the crap pours up the soundtrack Pink Floyd is a wonderful re-work on 'cautious with this ax, Eugene,' 'come number 51, your time is up.
