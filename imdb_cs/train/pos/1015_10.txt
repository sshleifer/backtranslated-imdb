I was waiting for each new episode, each of them repeating with expectation! The new sci-fi design created by the Stargate SG-1 is a miracle I hope never end. Combining the past with the future is a new look that is fascinating for me. Season 9 should be exciting in itself. I want Richard Dean Anderson to appear more often in the new season because I love his dry joke as well as his lively bouts in his position as Jack O'Neill. Other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it the winner, season after season. You will cancel this program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. You also need a bigger role for Asgard - they're just too cold.
