I expected something else: more passion, drama ... Another unsuccessful attempt at originality. I am sorry that the film falls into the old clich√© of "cheese". 15 year old young people can appreciate it though. is not very convincing and the lines are common, without any joke. But the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can not say that this movie is a total flop, because people are watching it, but they did not meet the expectations of the public and sank into mediocrity. So to the end, production will keep you in front of the television for almost an hour and a half, which is a significant thing. So I think it's worth seeing if you do not get angry
