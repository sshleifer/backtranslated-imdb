I saw this movie in advance and I found it great. New York I Love You is a true romance that examines the clever, fun and sometimes shocking situation around the most powerful emotions of the human race. <br /> <br /> Casting is a huge, true ocean 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. Everyone gives out performances in one or the other. <br /> <br /> I'm not talking about who is the director of linking stories in clever and interesting ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapurova, Natalie Portman, I think - WOW! This film is not a straightforward romantic or romantic comedy, although it is both romantic and fun. It also has serious stories and remarks. But in my opinion it's good. Go for yourself and answer my reviews, I want to hear what others will say.
