I recently started to watch this show and I must say that it really made me laugh. You must appreciate its unrealistic aspects with everyone else. Some others said that this show should have a realistic reaction to the dead, among other things. If you are going to accept that Ned can return the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show. After every episode I watched, I could not smile. I really think it's great that there is a show that can have a very strange subject and it's really great to watch. I totally love the narrative, I think it adds a little miracle to the show. You can not always compare old writer's shows with new ones, you have to take everything as your own entity. Surely give him a chance and enjoy the absurd parts as they are.
