Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing West after the Second World War. Director Anthony Mann has got a lot of appreciation for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does a great job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the film with their portrait of two bad people involved in high stakes poker game with valuable Winchester 73 to go to the winner. This is a good script with several stories running at the same time. Look at the first look of Rock Hudson as a young bull. Thank God, and in a few years we'd let the Indians play in Western films. The film is black and white and was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. I would not find Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but received from my recommendation above average. <br /> <br />
