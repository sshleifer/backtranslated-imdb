"Antwone Fisher" tells of a young black Navy that has become a human being and product of child abuse and neglect (Luke), whose hostility toward others brings a stint with a basic contraction (Washington) leading to introspection, self-esteem and return to its roots. Pat, disinfected and sentimental, "Antwone Fisher" is a solid feel-good movie about reconciling past regrets and closures. Good old Hollywood family fun evaluates entertainment with just a hint of corn. (B)
