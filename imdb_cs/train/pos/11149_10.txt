Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his little life in Texas and be big in the Big City. Women ask about it and men are mainly "tutti-fruttis". Wide eyes, coming to New York, not ready for a series of humiliating misfortunes he experiences, worse than the other. In the midst of this chaos, Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless man living in a seemingly convicted building, is meeting and spinning. as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of blueprints designed to grow not only in Joe Buck but also in the past and showed us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences of his past: his unsuccessful relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt) who was raped as a gang, mother abandonment, and apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had the habit of throwing men for money. The air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the beginning of mourning, while Nilsson plays in the initial credits his fraudulent "Everybody's Talking"; we feel that even if we want Joe to get his mark in the city, he's very likely he will not end up working for a penny in a dead job - he showed himself in a master shot from his outer point to look later in the movie when he watches, how one works as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself. We know from his eyes that he does not want to end this way. A dark tale of broken hopes, John Schlesinger creates terrifying images of lost souls and a center at the end of the 1960s, the prevailing friendship between the two men, trying to achieve some sense of life in the midst of the unforgiving comfort of a dignified life. There are implicit notions that they can be lovers - Ratso tries to get Joe's embrace on the party scene and their final hug at the end certainly points to it - but that's basically a movie friend he can survive literally to death and bring some form the hope of Joe, who at the end of Florida looks much altered, older, wiser.
