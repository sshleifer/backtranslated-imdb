I expect to see a "cute little film" from mainland China, I was poorly prepared. Family dynamics, community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored so professionally in the film. Each character is solid and I was totally drawn into the story. The organization is much more complex than the American audience will be used to. However, there is no need to follow the procedure, even when reading the headlines. Jiang Wu, like a retarded brother, is a constantly shining light. Leave your cynicism in the closet. It will be there when you sign out.
