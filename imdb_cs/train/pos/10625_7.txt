The small cuts and stylized compositions show a good use of the budget of this film at $ 350,000.However, Hate "will hit the same places that do so many other local films, and that's in the story and character of the department, basically, things are just as much happening, Eric Seaver is not developing at all, basically he's always crazy, it's just that People are starting to notice, and the film is just wandering around its merry-go-round with very little progress, but it's too sudden. <br /> <br /> However it's a horror movie, when do we care about the plot? We just want to see people die and "Hate" surely adds. When the body began to look, the people in the theater began to say, "Kill her, kill it all!"
