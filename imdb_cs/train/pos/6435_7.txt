I think most people who posted comments on this movie do not understand how to watch the movie and / or have a little sense of elegance. First, if you want to judge a movie, you have to understand to what extent everything in the movie works. Modern sensitivity requires great drama. No, I do not mean a great set of characters and drawings, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are very tragic or very comic. This is a fine film. His beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It is a beautifully shot movie that combines the most sensuality, politics, human weakness, venality ... you name it. The world in which it is set is strange and would not be understood today ... a world where, if you have it, you have to look at it NOW and LUCK, even if you think you have it. Many people today do not understand that the Victorian society was not really Victorian, because people understand this term today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps set the record straight.
