"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I own the movie on DVD! The film deals with a widow in New York (Cher), who falls in love with a crazy brother (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery, her boyfriend (Danny Aiello). I'm glad Cher won Oscar for this film. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also great. Direction Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for anyone who can see and laugh. You must see! <br /> <br />
