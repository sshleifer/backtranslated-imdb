This guy is not amazing. You really feel as though you were living with him all the time during these tragic events and eventually crying with your family. He was so passionate about his own thing, not just for himself, but to ensure that the others who survive him would not have to go through this incredible pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "bad" day, and I always get to see the great and brighter side of life, just like Jonny, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret does not know about Jonny earlier when I visited England twice during my life and I could say I met him. It is nice to know that Jonny is sitting in the cloud, without pain! Relax, Dear Jonny. You deserve it!
