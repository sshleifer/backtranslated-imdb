I was willing to cope a lot with films from late spring / summer events, but in general it was due to the fact that most of them had reasonable earnings (such as great special effects, interesting plot, comic book, Steve Buscemi, etc.). But this movie did not have any of this. Everything we got was a little excitement a few minutes from the breakup of Eva Longoria (the question Maxim is cheaper than the film ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, tension, reverse story, character development, continuity, etc. I would get into the specifics, but honestly I've already - perhaps willingly - forgot most of the film. <br /> <br /> All the time I was in the theater I kicked in because I did not expect to watch 24 DVD seasons only in the afternoon. Save money on this, people. If you really do not like the fact that you really like splitting Eva Longori.
