It's hard to get an impartial judgment on such a movie that has had such an influence on me at such a young age. This is undoubtedly the worst kind of exploitative film. I was quite unhappy to see this movie for the first time in my youth that I will never forget it. I thought it was the worst movie ever shot. Then I saw it again at the beginning of this year and was again horrified. I'm not a richesman, not one who says what others should have and what they should not see, but I've made a big barrier to the way, as bad as the rape in this movie. I like lowbrow cinema, but it's just ugly. Find some Russian Myer instead.
