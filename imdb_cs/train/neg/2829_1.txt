The worst and most of the people who really have to know better (the cast has six Oscars among them). It is located in "Contemporary" Africa (it was produced in 1979) and concerns slave trade. It's a cautious writing and acting (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden have a low career in this) and lacks excitement without being interested in moral focus. It is also meaningful. You do not have to believe for a minute that some of the characters will behave in the way they do under the circumstances. Richard Fleischer drives, but you think it was over the phone. It's as bad as it gets.
