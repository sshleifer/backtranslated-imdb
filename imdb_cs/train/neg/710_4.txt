I read Rice's novel with interest and became quite enchanted with his characters and a heartbreaking story based on historical truths. However, I was simply APPLE on this disastrous adaptation. Casting was based only on physical appearance and not as acting talent (except for Peter Gallagher, who was neither blonde nor able to get out of a wet paper bag). The often restless and inconsistent attempts to influence the French accent were fun, but not fun. I found myself crawling through this confused and melodramatic bagpipe and I was surprised to have done it to the end. Be advised to fans of the novel - Stay away from this.
