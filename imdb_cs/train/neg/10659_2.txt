Filmmaking: Excellent, beautiful camera angles (I do not remember seeing the movie late, with good close ups until this one). She could avoid gruesome scenes using a soft camera. NY is in the picture well. I liked it upside down, especially (another touch). <br /> <br /> Music: Not impressive. Songs do not stay in the mind even after watching the movie. Maybe, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must slowly break away from the hard-core action sequences. His age and belly actually appear. You should also avoid close romantic succession. It was very uncomfortable to see an adult / old star who still tries to play as 20+ heroes of the scene. Love can be expressed at any age; as we are older, you can still express your love from a distance (without touching too many women, such as love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika just appears for the denominator in the movie. You do not know why she accepted it. Well, that's not my problem, I think. Others have little presence. Routing: I expected Gautham to excel (or measure) her second film "Kakka Kakka". He dissapointed me. It took a long time to release the film due to various problems. In several scenes she slides. Even the furious things got slipped from a famous director. Overall: Just a good movie. Too many graphics. Definitely not for children (and adults who expect some sort of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
