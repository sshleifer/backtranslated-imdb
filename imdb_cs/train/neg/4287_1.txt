Timecop I gave the perfect 10, I gave it 1 It's a very boring story and has little to do with the original timecop. A lot of things from Timecop have been destroyed, and instead they have put new stupid things. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason it is time that is the most dangerous time: confused: And the action scenes are nothing happy, most of them are not ... just the first one is great. .. and there are not many action scenes at all and all are pretty short <br /> <br /> At one point in the story, the main character travels about 5 times in a few minutes ... do not expect to do it twice ... <br /> <br /> Briefly: Do not waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
