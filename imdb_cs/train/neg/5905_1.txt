you do not see this. it was one of the deepest movies I've ever seen. its hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are such movies. what a sad look at Mormon life. I can tell you if you've seen this movie, it's not like that in the single department. if it was not, I do not think I would have gone through it. it's too bad that most of Mormon's movies are created by a group of geeks who have nothing better. that acting was so bad that I barely went through my wife. I think you could say he has all the signs of B. or are there C movies? anyway ... I thought this movie was getting in and was full of cheese. I wish some Mormons started producing some quality movies.
