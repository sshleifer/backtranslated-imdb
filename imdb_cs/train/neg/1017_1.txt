Oh dear God. It was horrible. It's bad, then it was. This movie makes no sense at all. It runs across the map and it is not clear what it says at all. The music seemed to be like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city is taking off. Since I live in Vancouver, I watch this movie and it is unbearable to recognize all these places. Why did not they do that as a real city? The only writing that was decent was "Tilman," in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor to play his role realistically and not over the top and camping. It was really a shame to see John Heard playing such a big evil guy with a lot of time on the screen, and the movie is a washout. Very bad. Hopefully, someone will see this important and at least give credit to John Heard, where the credit is due, and hires him again as the leader of the bad guy, which is where he should be. in list A.
