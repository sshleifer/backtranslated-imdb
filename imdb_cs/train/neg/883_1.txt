Problems with this movie are many, but I try to mention even the most obvious and most annoying. Above all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan's life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and television, was something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. Stories were thin or non-existent, and practically every scene, camera shots, a series of dialogues, and expressions of emotions were absolute and totally false. Finally, I reached a point after the hour when I thought I had avoided (something that was not unusual in recent years). I'm guessing that the film was driven by an outcast author who left some third-degree film studio, but I believe that director Mira Nairov√° (this time before Amelia, talented) was involved in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the director's talent in America dropped massively into cesspools.
