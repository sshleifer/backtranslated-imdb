I own almost every Seagal movie (yes, even those that are low budget), and I must say that this may be the worst not only for his films, but for all the movies that have ever been shot. The only culmination of this film and the only reason why I gave him 2 stars instead of 1 is that A. Seagal and B. Seagal have some sweet action sequences, specifically in the shop, and also, from the whole army with the knife. Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people and do not even bother with the story line because the story not only broke but also the acting, the fact that the F-18 and F-14 somehow changed to the F-16s and also the fact that Stealth was as fast as the F-16. Also Stealth has never had to fill fuel ??? And since when Afghanistan is considered an enemy territory from the point of view of air forces. Last time I checked, Afghanistan has no air force, we (US) check the sky. This top secret mission was also played through the speakers to all the crew in the room, yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it's a secret. Also, how did Seagal get to the top from the bottom of the truck? Tell us why they were imprisoned. Since when the Air Force Commanders are Great Commanders (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are they drunk in Arab countries because Muslims do not drink alcohol? Also, where do Arabs obey orders from women like # 2? The culmination of the film was certainly Seagal's killing people in the store and another 50 people who killed the knife, as well as the very short and completely random lesbian scene that came out of nothing.
