I do not like remaking or stealing the modern jargon of "narration," but this film really exhausted me. The original Prom night, even though she was not a masterpiece in my modest estimate, was still aware of what it is ... horror. There are some simple things you need to remember when creating a horror movie. The pledge is essential to maintain the interest of the audience. I apologize to the people, but the white articulated film was not! Fear was cheap and terrible. (A good example of fear that became a cliché over the transition, the cat jumped out of the cloakroom, followed soon after, but now the unexpected look of the villain of the film). This film could not successfully take it, as I would expect it to fulfill any of the other horror conventions film. It must be a hero or hero. This movie does not have one. The person I identified most with was a detective head. His quiet behavior, but a balanced approach to the escape of the murderer, was what other films of this film should have. Access to common sense to events that occur. (If you run from the axis that controls the psycho, turn and sprinkle in the opposite direction. Do not try to look back in three seconds, avoid moving the killer just to avoid all the branch and the inanimate object on your path. your boyfriend will disappear, you will not be looking for it yourself. And if you think it's a bad game, tell someone, do not worry. These clichés are tired and well overcome. In the horror genre in general and especially in this film.
