I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And besides them, Charles Butterworth (a very nice actor) was also in this movie ... so why did not it hurt me too much! Well, despite good occupation, it's one of the poorest written and most cliche "Pictures" I've ever seen. Because of the talent and money spent on this film, it's shocking, as it was in the script. I knew the movie would be boring when it came to me from time to time in the film that I was predicting exactly what was going to happen - and I was always right! And that's not because I'm a "film savant," but it was because he had almost no imagination or effort. In fact, it looked almost as if the film was just a long chain of clichés that were connected to each other! I also found that it was a little irritating that Fred had badly kept Carole in the movie badly, and eventually got to him. Uggh! In the movie Lassie ("Will they bring people to save Timmy, or will the rope hang from the break?"). Despite a very tired and cliché scenario, several positive film information. It was pretty cool if Fred looked broken at the end of the film-it was quite trustworthy, and he looked as if he had not eaten, did not wash or sleep in the evenings. Also Charles "Butterworth" is "prattle" provided several slightly humorous moments. But it was simply not enough for this film to look different than "film B". It's a shame ... it could be much better.
