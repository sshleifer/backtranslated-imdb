The first half was fine, but the last half was really disappointed. It is sad that the producers even admitted that they did not have the clue for the end and actually turned out. What's really sad is that I have to write ten lines of minimal comment to post this post. I really did not want to include spoilers to qualify from my notes because the show is not really such an effort. When the Battlestar galatica first appeared, I was really excited about the prospect of a better remake, not to mention that the first season of the border was cosmic pornography. Eventually they cleaned him up a bit, and in fact had a lot of fair trials, so I started looking again. But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel, the same with a baltar and six was quite stupid.
