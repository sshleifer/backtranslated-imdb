The word "first" in the title has a more sinister meaning for viewers of this film than for its victims of crime. At least he does not have to hold onto and watch how this endless film has reached its own end. The first should concern: 1. the draft script; The first one is used in each performance in the final film; 1. post-production adjustment; etcetera and others. The film is not too rough, it's just that everything about the film looks worse than the third, from the Gothic to the wooden performance. And if you suffer with this paved film, after a two-hour mark you want to escape from your misery. Within 160 minutes it is obvious that it should be adjusted for less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> There are few details about lame scenarios and acting. Even in the equally awful lake Lake Placid, at least the performance Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda built from an extremely weak script, were so boring that you could laugh in the movie. In the first to death, sadness will end up just for the lost time in waiting for what happens after the initial stage of preparing suicide for female lead. Editing is so bad that one is never introduced to one of the main characters that I think (never been completely told) is DA It just appears in one scene in the middle of the conversation. Obviously, the scene where it was introduced to the viewer was omitted on the floor of the editor. And no one realized that the character that came from nothing was unusual film music. <br /> <br /> In a word, do not waste your time with this. My wife and I wish we did not. But at least we've created our own diversion by commenting on different places in the movie, like Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile in Cleveland ..." !!!!
