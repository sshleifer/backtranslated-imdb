After watching a highly censored version of this movie on TV, I was curious to see the untrained version. I was surprised that it was far more plausible and more effective than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think that other reviewers have mentioned this, and what exactly is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character? Has he already raped other victims? Is it a completely psychotic or "average" sociopath? How did he expect him to disappear with the assault on a younger sister? Is this character at all credible, or is it just a matter of more needed background? It seems to be almost unpleasantly believable in nature and is too crazy to be able to maintain the learning work that connects him with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of the audience in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terribly convincing. The film engages in an agitated position between mere exploitation and somewhat serious treatment of the subject without having fully settled in both regimes. It was not the worst movie ever shot, but it's not that good either.
