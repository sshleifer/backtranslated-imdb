I could not watch, find out or understand the story for my life. The plot is still incomprehensible. I'm going to guess and say the problem of a pre-production story / fence has never been solved. Producers would never be able to separate many details that a novel or a novel has time and space to create from the second thought that was meant to film a serial killer and killer persecution by the police. Eventually it ended with too many things that happened in the forbidden feature film. That was really bad because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things and excellent cinematography. In fact, a well filmed movie that you can enjoy and relax for a few hours.
