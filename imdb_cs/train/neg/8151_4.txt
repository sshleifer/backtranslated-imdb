Stylish Leslie Sands' "Deadlock" becomes a bad choice for Bette Davis and Gary Merril, just after a joint success in "All About Eve." After her husband's death, she visits the most beautiful girlfriend of her closest husband, who turns her husband's husband as soon as others stop at the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors from her top flight, is sadly unable to pick up this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously postponed and restrained until the unfortunate final (where fortunately he pulls out all the stops). Production and support of castings strictly secondary; only for Bette Davis kompletists. * 1/2 from ****
