From reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, it seems that this movie is largely disintegrating, but I did not think it was bad. I've seen much worse, in fact. "The House where the Evil Lives" is the story of spirits about husband and his wife, Ted and Laure Fletcher and their daughter, Amy, who moved to an old house in Japan. Few know that the Japanese ninja brutally murdered her wife and her lover and then killed a Samurai sword 100 years ago. When strange things appear in the house, the spirits of the previous inhabitants will begin to have bodies living and plan to restore the bloody murder that took place 100 years back. I saw the movie and decided to give him a chance, it looked like a decent ghost story from the cover. It was routine and it was nasty, but nowadays I've seen it worse. The columns of spirits have been a bit overlooked, seeing the translucent blue shapes appear randomly across the family and picking up their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland. I can be wrong, but after watching it, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of this movie broke it a bit. An old Japanese home where brutal murder happened, scary activity, curses put into the house, etc. But maybe I'm wrong. To sum it up, it's a pretty monster. Do not go out of the way to see it, but if you like this thing and it happens to come on TV, you can take a shot. 4/10.
