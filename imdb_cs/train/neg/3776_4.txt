Believe me, I want to like "Spirit". The idiot comments people made at the time of release about how little old-fashioned, hand-drawn animation is seen, as if the last ten animated cartoon pencils had been released twenty years ago, and even more stupid comments about how old computers were old-fashioned, my blood ... but then the insult, the insignificant banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of the "Spirit," I have even more blood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Way to El Dorado" that Dreamworks are talented artists) and the sophisticated use of CGI is in any case misconceived. (Why are they bothered?) Not one thing worth LOOKING on. In the animated chair it's fatal. <br /> <br /> But it worsens ... Horses can not talk but they are much more anthropomorphic and unconvincing than the deer in the "Bambi" that can. And it seems they can finally talk to the horses. The spirit itself brings a prologue (which sounded to the whole world as a 21st century actor who was chosen from a shopping mall in California), and from then on, his soundtrack, which never happened, tells us something we did not know yet; expresses a feeling of what the artwork, even if it is bad, has not been able to express twice as much. This prologue by the way: (a) contains information that the Spirit we later discovered knew how to know; (b) Expresses ideas that the Spirit would not have the power to express, even if he could speak; (c) contains new age waste as: "This story may not be true, but it's what I remember"; ad) will provide countless children (the production is skewed, I suppose in six-year-olds) impression that the horses come from North America, which is true because the common ancestor of domestic horses, zebras, etc. In North America was origin - but all kinds of horses on the continent vanished long before the first humans arrived and the mantles of the herd of the Spirit (which allegedly belonged here as buffalo grass) came from horses introduced by Europeans <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> So the prolog has rather upset me. <br /> <br /> As often as he talks about the spirit, Bryan Adams sings as usual as if he had a bad throat infection - and it's not sings or even HOW he sings, that's what he sings: Maudlin's narrative ballads, which, if possible, contribute rather than the spiritual narrative of the Spirit, and which sound like they all have exactly the same melody (though I paid great attention and was able to recognize that they probably did not). If Bryan Adams and the one who pretended to smoke for a minute or two, the film could have a real look: average and inferior, rather than jaw.
