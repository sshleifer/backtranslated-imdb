9, a movie I've enjoyed for months ... was a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the lack of a story and a special character development. All the amazing action sequences in the world do not create a single indecent character. <br /> <br /> Weird, almost worthy of occult sequences were not just in place, they were furious. The story is about robots and scientists ... why suddenly they turn into necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magical spiritual lines instead of responding to what could be great scary story devices? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Such a movie is frustrating due to its lack of depth .... I would watch this film drawn in a crayon if the story was good. But the creators relied on Wizarding CGI and the name Tim Burtons to draw the crowd. Which ... is what attracted me, but I could not get respect. It could have been amazing ... with a few more transcripts and a little more respect from its creators.
