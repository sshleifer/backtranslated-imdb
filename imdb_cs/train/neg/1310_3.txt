The story is straightforward when one old man who lives on a highway in the woods one day testifies that a man has murdered a child in a forest. Soft For Digging tracks the attempts of an old man to try to convince the police that what he saw was not a fancy of his imagination. But there is a problem, every time an old guy goes to the police where the murder happens, no corpse can be found. Soft For Digging has a small dialogue that reflects most movie scenes, an old man who lives alone in the house. During the movie I found out that I was twice afraid, especially when the murdered child suddenly appears in front of the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit did not concern me; I found the pace of the movie a bit slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. The development of the story and its conclusions, however, after watching the film lasted too long. I feel more of a relationship, a spooky encounter with a child and an old man. Self in the forest at night, if you are not sure of your own mind, can lead to terrible situations, children are always spooky like spirits, see Dark Water.
