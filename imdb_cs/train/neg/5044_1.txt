I look forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. Besides, I'm also Shanghainese, so there was more than just interest in the subject. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. The film step was unbearably slow and monotonous. The director stayed too long for certain scenes. There was no passion or chemistry among lovers. There was hardly any dialogue. Dialogue was urgently needed to offset the lack of negotiation. At the end of the movie you did not feel any sympathy with the characters. This film missed everything. The script was weak, the acting was bad and editing did not exist. The director tried to imitate some of the noir film styles but unfortunately failed. A good movie is a movie in which you capture your attention, keep it and successfully conclude without you the feeling that time has passed. This movie had the feeling he would never end up. Do not waste money on this movie.
