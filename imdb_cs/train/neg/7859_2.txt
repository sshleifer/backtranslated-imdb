My God. This movie was terrible. I can not complain much. I went to see it just to be exhausted. That was enough. It is funny that the most disgusting part of the film was at a very, very early start, when a woman is very vividly induced to cause a terribly mutated child. I also think it funny that the most notable actor in the movie was a Hispanic soldier who was a next actor next Friday. Everyone in the film has done terrible acting work. It was the worst acting I ever paid. <br /> <br /> I also expected it would be much worse than the first one. It was not. I expected it to be more threatening, because it's a sequel, and the sequel to horror films is usually far less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more threatening because gore and violence usually sell horror films these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but in fact it was not as terrible as the first one, which was yet another disappointment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mutants in the first were so disturbing, but the creators tried hard enough to be scary, the whole concept of showing a son of a female soldier clip on the camera phone says: "I love you mommy" FOUR TIMES. It was silly that we showed it for the first time because they were just trying to make the wounded mother feel worse than the other soldiers, and it was even more silly to try to feel it, that's three reasons for no reason. This movie was a joke.
