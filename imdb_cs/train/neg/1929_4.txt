Some praised - Atlantin: "The Lost Empire" as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least because you do not think of adults. This script suggests the beginning as a live-action movie that has hit someone as a type of stupidity that you can no longer sell to adults. The "Workers Staff" of many older adventure films did before, (think Dirty Dozen), but - Atlantis - is one of the worst films in this motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that every member looks like is at best the smallest. MD / Medical man, tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we had not seen them before, we saw laughter and combinations earlier. The story of how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (Father Guido Sarducci), went from the florist to the demolition completely unconvincing. Only the main character, Milo Thatch, the young obsessed with Atlantis, Michael J. Fox, has some depth for him. Milo looks for Atlantis and continues his grandfather, who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on his knee as his grandfather places his mane on his head. And while those characters were thin at best, the best part about the Atlantic was voice talent. Commander Rourke loses nothing James Garner has said. Although Rourke is a fairly supplying military type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into characters simply by delivering it. Garner's vocal performance is the pinnacle. I'm sorry that Leonard Nimoy's dying king is no more than mandatory. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also remarkable for one or two well-done, funny lines - but I have always loved Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also good. Animation background, that is. Animation of the character will do nothing unless it means flatter characters appear even more flat. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, it is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say they are bruised. I'm not so sure. Any service site can be done with a new appropriate procedure. Shakespeare often started from a well-known story and plot and was known only for painting new paint. So treatment is the thing. And -Atlantis - obviously lacks it. <br /> <br /> I can not get into all logical spaces without spoiler. The conspiracy was bad. The bridges of the plot are pressed like a yarn and the end is meaningless. To add to that, the script and the animation are peppered with annoying negligence. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the very beginning, when Milo reveals that the runic or Celtic symbols have been incorrectly rewritten and the 'CÃ´te d'Ivoire' should read 'Coast of Iceland' , we're starting to have problems. Scenario writers would need to know that the British accepted Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignored the older Latin term Hibernia. But more than they need to know about the Vikings conspiracy to call it a greener island in Iceland and on the Greenland island of South Bohemia. Because it is a problem of a badly transliterated "letter", writers are condemned to require a runic version of English and a postmircle date in the script. Because it's been a long time since Atlantis was supposed to get into the underwater cave. And without visible traces and less technology than Milo, he made the inscription much less credible. The Shepherd's Journal could not have been written before Atlanta's sinking, or he would have known nothing about a cave or crystal lying "in the Royal Eye". It had to be written after the sinking, but without the technology Milo had on the expedition, how the hell did Leviathan do. So how could it be more about it? And why would it be written in Atlanta? Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require writing in Atlanta. So it must be some automatic writing. Because nobody in Atlantis can read, the spirits of crystal clear messages must be on the surface. That would make more sense. But it could also be explained in the film: Milo could see that the shepherd discovered that this power had told him all his life - he had appeared in dreams, etc. It had to be explored in the film. <br /> <br /> Atlantis would simply not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to discuss in Europe before the Romans understood that the hard "c" or their day became French "ch" (pronounced as "sh", no less!) <br /> <br /> Contemporary The Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm - when they apparently could * read, but now they are unable to read what they used or operate similar devices. <br /> <br /> Voice illiteracy points to a major flaw in the movie. It seems that this culture has not happened. It seems hanging up in the air until Milo can save it. Although life does not seem to be a lasting struggle for survival, nobody wants to compose poetry or write novels, and maybe it's a combination of Atlantean school systems that have come to an end and a lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kid can be justified for not knowing how to read or use machinery if she was so young when Cataclysm of stupidity - But ANY OF IT ** HARDLY ** Qualifies her dad for Deification !! Kashakim's stupidity almost pulled his people out of existence. He killed a heap in a disaster, blocked progress (he was not much killed here, but oversaw a massive slump in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill them unless they were first cooked in the lava because the giant robots were not there to protect them . The width of blue electricity should shatter Kashakim's image when Kida tried to connect her father's image to the circle of THE GREAT Rabbits of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Although Milo was the only one who could read the Atlantic, Rourke and others knew so much that they were looking through the gibberish book and found a page on the crystal - which he knew was crystal and not some stylized astrological or "phase solar" diagram. If Milo's grandfather told Rourke about it, he still does not explain how Rourke suffered Milo's reading as part of the book. She ripped the page that had been in Rourke's ears, even though Milo found no sign of a broken page in the book-apparently it was just for the audience to reflect that "something was wrong." If the word "Crystal" did not stop Milo in the head for someone to try to steal, Milo would have no doubt. It's just a rough preface. <br /> <br /> The "double cross" of the crew was not a change of character. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey, and Cookie had started with Rourke from the beginning. However, "heart change" is decreasing. It was a change and it had to be better motivated. It's hard to figure out with characters that have nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Damn a little that the lava flows through the dome instead of filling the rest of the area we see from the sequence. It's fluid; it will not pass over the protective dome until it fills all the lower regions. The end ends and it has no sense but to calm political correctness. Because his power is restored, Atlantis is no longer the weak power that needs to be killed. Giant robotic guards and the sky that shoot with the blue light indicate that they are not afraid of us than they could. Technology is better than ours, and certainly at the beginning of the 20th century. Eventually Milo must teach Atlantians to read why? The whole idea is to leave their small silence, punish the culture themselves, not send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the twisted world of plot and setting from the turn of the century should suggest that this is a tribute to pulp. The faults I find with the film agree with this idea. But I'm on the loose, why should I pay to see thin figures and make holes simply because many decades of novels also had it. And stories from pulp are part of the "bullshit that can no longer be sold by adults". We've become a little more sophisticated and our fiber has to grow. Raiders of the Lost Ark have lost no sense of pulp and have avoided so many mistakes. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 - The movie is nice, but as I think about the plot, it's getting smaller.
