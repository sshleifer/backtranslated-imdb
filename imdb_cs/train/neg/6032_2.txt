I am a Christian who generally believes in theology taught in left Behind. I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need to have a well-written script. Left Behind was horrified. One thing is radically deviating from the book. Sometimes it is done to condense a 400-page novel to a two-hour film, but in this film I've seen changes that made no sense at all. Another thing is the zero character development. When the characters in the story rescue (I will not say who), the book is obvious that it is a long process of soul search. In the movie, it's fast and artificial. The book is written fairly, where people such as Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but consistently, in film scenarios, fast treatment without any significant. In another scene where one character is angry that he will stay again (again, I will not say who), it seems artificial. I realize that as a Christian it is unedifying for me to say that I did not like this movie, but I can not in good conscience recommend a movie that I think was terribly ready. Perhaps it would be better to make the first book for 2-3 movies. Either way, Christians need to realize that in order to be credited seriously, we must begin by creating a quality film. I realize that a lot of effort probably went to Left Behind, but that's how I see it.
