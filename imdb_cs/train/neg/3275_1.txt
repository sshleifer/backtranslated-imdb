DO NOT HAPPY THIS FILM, IF YOU ARE LOVE CLASSICS, AS TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER AND BEN JONES! THIS FILM WILL REMOVE ENTERTAINMENT! First, this movie begins with Bo and Luke running a monthly for Jesse. Bo and Luke would never do it in a real series! This movie shows unimaginable characters that do things that never happened in the series. In the show, Uncle Jesse was honest and legal. In this film he is a criminal who makes a monthly and smokes weeds with the governor of Georgia. Moreover, if it was an extension that joined the Hukar reunions! and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: WHY JESSE CAN YOU LOVE MONASTERY BEFORE HOLLYWOOD MOVIE BEFORE HOSZARD'S OWNER? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALWAYS BEFORE THE REUNION FILM IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? Does it suggest that these characteristics have returned to life when they were dead for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good film, they would have brought James Besta, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000, creating a family film with live original characters, a show of what it was and is still being compared to this disgusting, disgusting movie! If you want to see good movies Dukes, either buy an original series or go to walmart.com and buy a DVD set 2 that includes Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! Both stars play their original cast and are family friendly! Do not waste time on a movie that does not stand behind the CD on which it is written!
