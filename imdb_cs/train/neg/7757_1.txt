I have advice for people who also filmed this movie if you shoot such a movie, make sure you have f / x to back up. Also, do not get a bunch of actors out of the list to play it. Another thing, like everyone else, we saw Jurassic Park, so make sure you copy it with care. The whole film was soaked, f / x sucked, it was soaked, the story was non-original. We are talking about the second actress, Carradine, who peaked in 1984 when he did "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a big comedy). It's not out of the list, it can act. He was just saying not to this bag. He had to do what Mark Hamill did after the "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as "Nerd" and it was supposed to be it. I understand he has to pay bills, but that hardly justifies. Have I already called this movie? OK. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a bit hostile, I'm sorry. I just lost 2 hours of my life, I could spend some productive work, like watching the painted bark, and I feel cheating. Close the message. Thank you for your time.
