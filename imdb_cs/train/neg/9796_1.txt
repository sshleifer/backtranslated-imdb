Well, I really can not think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, the Power Rangers GOT have to be at the end of this list. You can think of something stupid than five or six adolescents (who do not even act like normal teens) dancing around in identical suits WITH MISCELLANEOUS COLORS so, Fans, you've ever come across a real man who gets against the mental wall and gets up almost instantly and goes on in a fight without injuries? Power Rangers are for five-year-old boys and believe me that this show did not even suit me when I was five. I think you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teenagers really act like teens, and Tommy Oliver really behaves like a teacher or not, a teacher. It's teen-humor, although the fight is lame, I do not have to hate Dino Thunder. Many people say the Power Rangers are bullshit, but I would not. It would be an insult to a crime. So face-to-face, five-year-old boys, Power Rangers are garbage.
