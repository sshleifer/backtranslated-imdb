This is obviously a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "mysterious island". Audio editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on the set and hear voices that are recorded simultaneously in the recording cabin! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and who reads this comment, they will be amazed by the capital W. This film is full of defects. You hear the director's voice, giving instructions and giving instructions to the actress. "Ok, now stand up." As for the other characters. There is the guy who speaks his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. A stranger speaks in a deep voice. When you are yawning or threatening to fight, you will hear the voice of the actor. As for special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work that she was screaming aloud! Creation is good, but animation is explosive. Really annoying. Several animations by Karel Zeman in The Way to Time (1955). Special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Below, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET is a home movie and was in the shoes budget? He must watch the aspirations of filmmakers.
