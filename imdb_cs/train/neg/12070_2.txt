It happened to me that I bought one of the Legacy of Horror 50 collections and believe I'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie. Sometimes you will find a friendly and yet camping, such as Devil Messenger or Devil Bats, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's big movies (some are not horror and are there just because Hitchcock has directed some horrors and tensions) but at other times they seem to be giving movies, such as the Island Monster, because they can not accept the fact that it is easy to forget and it should be. <br /> <br /> So we're going to open up some idea of ​​Westing. The rich but cruel and abusive father who plays Carradine (the only permanent feature of this) died and left her inheritance to her children and servants who still hate it. Carradine is performing well enough, as always, but leaves voice and flashback sequences that leave us to sit between average / terrible performances. The rest of the cast either exaggerated or did not do the scenes. Since it was an independent film of the 1970s, lighting and effects are quite limited. It's hard to create a lot of tension when the viewer does not see what's going on in some scenes. Some actors like servants Igor and Elga will at least make the effort and I am ashamed to admit that I finally giggled at the end, mainly because of the stupidity, but still with little luck that they were pulling out some version of the twist Otherwise quite obvious who- done-but it is not enough to increase the quality of the movie. You do not like to like these characters because they are self-confident and cruel or psychotic, but they go to a whole new level and make many illegal. The death scenes are pretty bad and the tension is not really there. This proves that you would probably enjoy the film package "Chilling", which featured films such as House on Haunted Hill, Little Nothing Horror Store with Jack Nicholson, and Night of the Living Dead above him. This is best avoided.
