What can you say about a grainy, badly filmed 16mm deer film, where the best and most attractive artist is a German shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this constipation at all costs. In any case, it would be hard to find because the animal remains taboo and an illegal topic in the US. I strongly recommend IMDb to revisit its weighting formula for ratings because 8.8 ratings for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! I am by no means insignificant and spent many hours enjoying classical pornographic films of the 1970s and 1980s; but it is inferior product even by looser standards (then illegal) loop.
