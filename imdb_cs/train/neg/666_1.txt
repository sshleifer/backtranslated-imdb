I saw this trailer and thought that my god was the real film to want to see this movie, and at the same time I thought my girlfriend turned to me and said, "we have to go see this movie." .. Still, I said I saw it for about 5 minutes to go and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy cheap fear, but it was not even one of them. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen The director has no influence without looking at the same shots being used again and again he did not create the tension that the cast probably was simply said to scream the crying run to fall. I would like to see the script as the first 40 minutes was mostly annoying girl giggling and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. The conspiracy is just ... Well, there was no conspiracy, it was basically a fact that we would terrorize a group in high school at night with a serial killer ball, that's great! hmmm The actor was what you expect in an Australian soap opera hopeless, the main character of Blondie god dam who upset me. her longest line must be a half-sentence, and every time she was on the camera she just drew more rough expressions on her face. <br /> <br /> Listen to me if you have any taste in movies, this, and if you are like me and you have no choice, I wish you good luck, maybe smuggling in your ipod or magazine. I can not believe this movie has gotten!
