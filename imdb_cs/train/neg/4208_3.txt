It's a really good film, which is hidden just below the layer of layers on the layers of cheese, which is "Pagemaster". I found it when I watched this morning again when I neglected it for years. years. I remember I hated her with passion when she came out, but this time I found out that the special effects are pretty good. The conspiracy is simply an "endless story" with creativity-endectomy, but it's okay a little flick for anyone who just wants some really amazing eye-candy. The animation is amazing and I especially liked animators letting their characters look and acting a bit more surrealistic than the norm. I give it to the trick of three, because I would give him two (just for parodic value) if I ever decided to watch this movie and expected it to completely blow my story.
