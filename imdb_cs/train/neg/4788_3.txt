In Phantasm's third entry, Mike and Reggie continue to persecute a tall man assisted by a 9-year-old star, black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's deceased brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is rather a disappointment because gore and black comedies are far less inspired and exciting than Phantasm II. I felt that stress was simply put on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a standing comedian. Humor in the previous movie was much more dry and oppressed, which suits the story like this better. Also, the setting is not such a terrible and constant presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious? There are still a lot of gore, but not half as satisfying this time. By the way, beware of the heavily cut version because it shows the most beautiful killing off the screen. The entire Phantasm series is a lifetime work by Don Coscarelli, who has written and directed 4 episodes, the fifth in production. The first is a semi-cultural classic, the other is a horror feast of gore and violence, and the rest can easily be omitted. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros in Phantasm II portrayed his character much better.
