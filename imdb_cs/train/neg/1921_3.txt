For some special reason, the film world is modeled. Someone is making a movie about a murderous shark, then suddenly the world's film oceans are full of giant Kalichs, killer chops and marine monsters from each of them. Man is buried by a former lover of hell, then every film character is chased by a hell policeman or a roommate of hell or a healer of hell. Then, when a large Hollywood company produces a large FX budget loaded with tornadoes, then other filmmakers jump on the bandwagon, the fact that they do not have the budget to pull them out is not to stop them. THE OFFER OF TWISTERS is a case. What has occurred to me about this TV film is the fact that she is trying to hide a budget deficit by stopping advertising breaks. Whenever a tornado pops, Kamara blocks the horrified expression of the actors, shouting like, "Oh, my gawd goes this way," and "Run for your life," then the screen loses black, saving the producer, the budget of special effects . Unfortunately, the NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget has been raised to include better players. Castings are by no means bad, but they are insurmountable and lack the ability to wear the film that is characteristic. Where is Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? And the last word on this is the TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOTT was released a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER was like a few years old like a 1996 summer tease and NOTT feels it will show me, which leads me to believe that it was created and released to merge with the hype around TWISTER
