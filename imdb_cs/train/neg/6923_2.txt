An absolutely terrible Mexican movie is probably based on a story about Edgar Allan Poe about a journalist who wants to go to the shelters hiding in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc. When our hero Gaston is due to the great show of dr. To Maillard, the head of the asylum group, we see all sorts of things that should be horrible, such as men who hang in the dungeon for a long time, and comedy, like our hero, who jokes soldiers like climbing the ladder hanging alongside the building. Then there is one look that could be both: a human being dressed like chicken, yes, it is the real chicken that nests around the earth to feed chickens. The scene was supposed to be the comedy of the movie, but at least for me it was the low point of the film and really the most upsetting when they thought adult men and women thought it might be even fun. Oh! That's really the real horror Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And it brings me to this remarkable fact about the movie, which is mostly films that undergo a few changes to the title, usually have some serious problem. Yes, it is obvious, but some have problems with distribution, and others who do not care have numerous changes in their names so that anyone can not know to buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely a garbage. It has very little. The only artist who's worth to look at is Claudio Brook as the head of asylum. It's a huge board of ham when he laughs maniacally, orders of werewolves, hands with a sword in his hand, and praises a chicken. I'm so tired when I heard him speak of "calming systems" as a means to treat mentally ill. What a bunch of ludicrosity (Hey, such a movie with such a script deserves such a word). It does not take long before you find out what's going on in the asylum, and it will not be more interesting. Cinematic chicken scraping!
