The way back when I was renting videos for free, I chose this. OOPS The things I wanted to mention beyond the summary already mentioned were these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with the fact that the film had a special and ill fascination for food was gross and unsuccessful. 2: The background of the movie is some soundtrack that seems to be all the time and the way I felt after a few days when I saw this waste, I think there is something subliminal on the track. It was either traumatically bad or both. Many times throughout the film you can say that the writer and director do not have much experience or talent. And you do not even ask for acting.
