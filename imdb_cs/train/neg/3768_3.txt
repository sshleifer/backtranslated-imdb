That is right. Film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and the family. (Fred knew better when he worked the series "Titantic" and "Dogma".) So the plot. There are some scientists, some forest rangers, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. Everyone is really bad at work, including a hot dog (I think she's supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she's wearing bikinis). One of the forest guards recalls that scientists are "professional people," which is good because it would be terrible if they were professional rodents or jellybeans or Ewoks. He walks through the woods in search of some strange human bones, and no one ever mentions that the bones could be the ones that come from the infamous Bigfoot. They just walk around and one of the speakers is unhappy with the hottie. We all hope she dies in real time (along with her sister, who is supposed to be cute naive, but she is really just annoying). Then, they're going to find Sasqu ... I mean, Ape-like Animal Burial Ground. Of course, it does not mention that it could be just the Bigfoot bones they are struggling with ... I think scientists and forest guards just do not think about these things. Then Sasquatch and his tribe are angry and kill all the people we do not like, chase the other losers away and bury his great aunt Muriel and Josh cousin (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) again. <br /> <br /> Insipid, a boring dialogue (Several times I was offended), a sloppy plot, unrecognizable characters, bad CGI (a man in monkey suits would look better), and acting that was not very good added to filming a movie , which they will not watch again. <br /> <br /> Try this; this is good for some unintentional laughs.
