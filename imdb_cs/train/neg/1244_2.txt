That's a little first for me, for the first time I've ever been disappointed with Tim Burton. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, costumes and strange performance), but it could have been done by any director of the Hollywood director. Motion was very strange, the last third was just spent waiting for the end of the film, myself and filming. Tim Roth was great, probably the only pleasure in the movie. Return Tim.
