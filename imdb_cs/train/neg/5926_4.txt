Another weak third season: "Is there any beauty?" has at least one key element of the fence, which is very different, and as Spock says fascinating. The main character is a stranger who must be carried in a black box, because his appearance is so terrible that he is driving people crazy. It's bad that an episode can not meet this incredible assumption. I think that I think it was a mistake if someone "showed" aliens, because his actual appearance is by no means recommended as such a daunting building; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display that is used in different situations in different episodes, usually when a boat is under magnetic storm or something like that. In any case, Mr Collose's attitude may at least be tolerated by Mr Spock, and only when Spock is wearing a special shade. (I thought the name of the alien was "Carlos," which I thought was humorous, but I'm going to turn.) Spock must come together with Kollos at one point to let the stranger go back to safety. This is achieved, but when Spock / Kollos returns to the end of mind-meld, empty, Spock forgets his gaze. Uh oh. He crazy, but he finally recovers with the help of Assistant Collose, a blind woman with psychic powers. It could be a really bizarre, excellent episode, but it is misguided and will hit another badly performed show of the last season of the series.
