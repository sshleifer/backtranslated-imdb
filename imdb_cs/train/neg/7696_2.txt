Yeah, stupidity! I just watched and still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too addictive "addons" to the story, too stupid characters (I suppose they want comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. It's a pity to spoil one of the divine tales from "Arab Night". Childish, naive (both badly) and with lots of magic errors, I do not think it could keep the baby five years longer than ten minutes. The princess is beautiful, but she should be without language, because the actress does not know how she should have a role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Pity that "good boy" is not better. Only the light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who, unfortunately, is far below his level, but at least keeps his actor / fighter at the top. I'm sorry I saw him in such a thing, but I'm glad I had to do all the charade, so thank you to David. Only, for him, I give the two stars of this fiasco ... I would give him more, but that would mean the final score for the whole movie. The rest is so bad that I might want to classify it, but there is no quality lover, and here I think it would be too much.
