Steven Seagal .... how could you be part of such a terrible movie? I rented the movie because your movies were usually clean. I lost much respect for being in a horrible movie like this one. Very, very bad taste! I'm embarrassed to rent the movie. Steven, if you continue in movies like this, I believe your career is over. My husband and I have enjoyed watching many of your movies, because you can always "get the bad guy" with some manual maneuvers and make it clean ... and the tongue is pretty clean in your movies ... but this is something else. I'll think twice before I borrow your next movie.
