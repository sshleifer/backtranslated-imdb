I think there are some that Nicole Eggert remembers from her little girl on such TV shows as T.J. Hooker, Charles, and who's the boss? You perverse, you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got her breast implants. It does not matter that you will forgive her in this supposed comedy about aliens who are going human. There are so many things that make no sense and are never explained. How did you know strangers? Why was the alien hot for pepper and cinnamon? Why did not the stranger find it? You get the picture. Before a stranger plays with his boyfriend and assumes his identity, you can see it in Alex Menesese's body. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason why this waste is good. Stay behind the shower and your friend and continue to do business.
