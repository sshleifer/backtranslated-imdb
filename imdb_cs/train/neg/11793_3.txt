Deep Shock plays as a television movie: a whole bunch of commercial actors, a badly designed creature like a "bad guy" and a script that is more technical, political jargon and meaning than he knows what to do with the movie I checked for a creature (like to see what filmmakers are thinking of their designs in these cheaply made video clips), and straight from the bat, I'm disappointed because the creature on the box was not in the movie. The actors I expected because of the type of film is (really quite general and not convinced after a certain point). Music was a typical, non-sophisticated symphonic music action. I liked the design of computers and technical devices along with mini-sub design. The movie even ran very well, and the guide screens let you know which set you are looking at. But it's lit up that there's no such story. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 3/10 stars IMO. A boring quest to destroy a mission that blows up the North Pole and protects it ... a bit lame. Even the lamer is marked by a loving relationship between the two characters you do not see. Chalk this is a movie that tries to get the actors from the bench and into the video. Do not bother.
