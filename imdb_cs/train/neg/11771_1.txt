This was shown as part of the 59th edition of the Edinburgh International Festival, though for the best reasons she left the forces that are. It seems to be the first Thai language film, made with Thai actors and crew but directed by the West. You do not have to bother being honest because this movie is dull, boring, boring. Why does something suggest why some mystery is hiding, why does it give you a gentle feeling when you can stab yourself home with horrible voice drops, obvious shots and top scenes? Spurrier clumsily popping up the endless clich√©. No hints, no quarrels, everything is on the screen, no need to use our ideas. Are you interested in coming up with a "scary" bit? You will not get used to it because the soundtrack will become increasingly intimidating and rising to a sinister rise. Hell, I'm doing words that describe how bad it is. Are you wondering whether the redeemed demon is real or imaginary? Why do you tax yourself - it's really a snake, and yes, it's really biting his crotch, and screaming everywhere. it's a weird, turbulent movie for several reasons. It was supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the thunder is marked and obvious. It could be a horrific attack on the strongest side of Thailand, but the director has a dirty, cuddly style when it comes to showing barely puberty adolescents. Perhaps it was that he had thrown himself away as a Western population that had caught the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe the whole thing was just pants. Uninitiated, awkward, repetitive, hackneyed - all the candidates for the best description, but boring seems the most appropriate and sincere. Everything was seen earlier, probably better, often with more thoughts, rarely with less imagination or flare. Excuse me. Going for every number. Really terrible.
