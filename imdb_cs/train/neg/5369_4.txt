Does it look like the brilliant Shonda Rhimes team has outsourced writing this somewhere on the coast, maybe to MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of one of the many tiresome, promising beginnings but predictable during one season of David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they receive are so unusual, they are hardly compassionate or sad. And that's what really makes good tick ticks - dramatic situations that you're afraid of, "it can be my" sentiment. They're not fun either. The actors are pretty good, but the fence lines are dead and can not be brought back to life. I'm a therapist and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. The person who wrote it shuddered ethics and transmission / counterfeiting at Stanford. Someone should give them an ethical code that they could read (an episode with a wife bleeding from the nose and engaging the therapist in her). No therapists are not that bad. Women wishing for the men who moved - were given to death, we all went through "Sex and the City". Addison, in his youthful aggression against a guy he likes - a very inappropriate age - looks so unnatural to a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress does not believe herself and does not do it well. The only successful / thrilling development is that Addison is faced with the decision to move to LA and "Voodoo Dr" and to make up for it with widowhood. This concept could work with a completely new writing team.
