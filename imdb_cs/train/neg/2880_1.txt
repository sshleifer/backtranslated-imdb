I've never seen a movie in such a short time. The only thing that saved was a fast-forward feature on a DVD drive. It was like watching a badly produced CBC movie. There was obviously no money for lighting, shooting, sets, locations, screenwriters, editors, actors ... There was no story! I need to write ten lines of comments ... Bad, terrible, terrible, miserable, anxious, furious, bleak, naughty, dirty, kiss, disgusting, fragile, pungent, poor, prickly, smelly, stinking, ugly, and do not know if I can Continue to finish all ten lines of how bad the box-o-matrix production is!
