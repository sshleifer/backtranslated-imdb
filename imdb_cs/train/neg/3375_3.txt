Hello everyone, If you've seen "Singing in the Rain", you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember Donald O'Connor's "Make them em Laugh" dance number. If you've seen a "royal wedding," you remember that Fred Astaire is dancing on the ceiling. If you've seen "Jailhouse Rock," you even remember the title dance choreography of the king himself. <br /> <br /> This is what is missing here. There could be some dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was Chuck McGowan's "I can do it." the mere fact that you have talented people on the stage does not make a great dance movie. Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure. He showed the camera on the stage and thought it would be a good thing. Screaming to explore people for a part in Broadway production is not fun. Michael Douglas would be equally ill if he was in Western or comedy. It's okay when he's in the Michael Douglas movie where we see him screaming at someone we'd like to scream at. Here it does not work. <br /> <br /> The cast was good except for Michael, of course. A good movie could also be made using songs that were in the production stage, but somebody should think about how to make it. Next time they do one, I hope to call first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
