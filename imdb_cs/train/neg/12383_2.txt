While some performances were good - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and two Italian girlfriends recall - the story was lame and subtle, the emphasis on girlfriend racial background was best worked out, and relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not as real people. I found out that he had gone madly reluctantly in many moments, which was funny. I can hardly understand why the local post here in SF says it's a good movie, and you wonder that WHO has published a glowing review of IMDb. I was very disappointed in this movie, and I was actually going to the theater to see it, based on a bad connection with Garden State, which is a much more entertaining, inventive and more film than this one. In particular, I must mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden, and according to the number I almost left, and some of the audience actually gave. Then there was a silly culmination in the cemetery I saw arriving 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like to be deceived to spend my money so unnecessarily.
