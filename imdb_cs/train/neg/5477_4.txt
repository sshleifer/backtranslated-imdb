Take the original SciFi movie and mix in a bit of alternative / revisionist history and get "Aztec Rex". Apparently Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first conquer Tyrannosaurus Rex and her friend. That's the point of this movie. Considering the conspiracy it could really be sucking; the fact that it's just a kind of sucking is the tip of a writer's hat. There are several problems. For starters, Cortes plays Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers indigenous Mexican inhabitants, the Aztecs play all-Hawaiian ensemble. T-Rex looks pretty good, even though some of them are shot, CGI has faded. And they die too easily; I suppose if T-Rex were real-life, he could probably be sunk or at least wounded by a relatively rudimentary 16th-century weapon. But it will take something from the movie. There are also several graphical T-Rex-swallows-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they were working well. There is a lot of action and the whole colonization angle is predominant, but it does not interfere with the Dinosaur angle, unlike other recent scifi dinosaurs "Warbirds". Overall average (but decent according to the original SciFi standards) film, which has modest 4.
