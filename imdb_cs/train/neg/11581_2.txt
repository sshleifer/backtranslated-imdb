This is really a terrible movie. The boundary (as it is) is completely undetectable. (I think it has something to do with extortion, but I'm not sure.) Half of the dialogue is a useless clich√©. The other half speaks different actors in such incomprehensible imitations of "southern" accents, which (fortunately) these words can not be recognized. The only real tragedy of the film is that such a historical talent as Mary Tyler Moore was obviously in such a terrible financial or personal situation when she appeared. <br /> <br />
