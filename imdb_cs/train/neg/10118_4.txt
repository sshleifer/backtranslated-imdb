Adorable director Mervyn LeRoy gives a drama to a movie that competes with the best soap operas. High drama appears in love and unbelievers in New York's socialist ensemble. Oh yes, do not forget, jealousy can cause a corrupt heart and murder. All star casts include Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, James Mason, Ava Gardner, Cyd Charisse and Nancy Davis.
