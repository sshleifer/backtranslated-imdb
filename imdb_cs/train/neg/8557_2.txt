Do I admire "Kissing on Your Mouth" for its sincerity? pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from lead / director Joe Swanberg. They are not afraid to show the truth of everyday "private" events. Unfortunately, the film falls into the "Brown Bunny" area, though with somewhat more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, does this mirror "Bunny" with a lot of nothing happening or too many cinematic shots aimed (or frankly blurred) for absolutely nothing? legs, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I see why this film was released and why people rent: real life sex scenes and full frontal (as well as male and female) nudity. Besides, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learned about a post-college couple male / female roommate in which a man has obvious feelings for a woman who sees him as a friend while constantly having sex with his ex-boyfriend. In addition, we are exposed to everyday events of their boring life: working for their parents; works on sexual awareness projects that are extremely uninteresting on their computers. Everything must work, the dialogue must be interesting and real. Not one job and it's as boring as watching someone who is going to an hour, ie "Brown Bunny." The only outstanding actor is Kate Winterich, and she even does some dubious action. (I'm still watching / listening to the DVD in front of it.) Again, I admire the filmmaker, especially Swanberg, that I defended it all, and I'm not afraid to show myself or the showers, but overall the film will be flat. It has narratives that do not fit into scenes, too many boring daily events and unconvincing acting that interests you, other than soft pornography, why you rented it.
