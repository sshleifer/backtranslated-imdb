When you look at this show, you are not quite sure whether the story or the action is much more annoying. First of all, the story of each episode is very predictable, writers have to use every possible clich√©, you can guess not only the general conspiracy, but the layout of the scenes as well as the rows of each character, which will show some kind of collage of each police series there. At the top of all this comes the "news" of the show that the good are good and the bad ones are bad and that at the end of the day the good will win and that we should all love each other, be a better person and better citizens, all done most seemingly. Actors as the vehicle of this report and nothing more will use a limited amount of acting skills: the smile of "I am a good bearer," the appearance and the position of the body "victory is ours". bad boys have "I'm bad" and wink and "you caught me" look, followed by "I'm good for nothing and I should be out of the company" band band (this kind also summarizes the overall development of each show). The real story or not, the show is waste, another proof that the producers do not know about the audience that we are all considered idiots. So this series makes every possible attempt to betray your living brains.
