Priyadarshan's actress HERA PHERI was a nice situational comedy. But this movie really does not have a story, but it's pretty humorous but illogical. Actually, that's not the right story, but it does manage a nice flow, though it's not nothing great <br /> <br /> The first half has 2 fun scenes like where Akshay and John invite Neha for lunch and others when Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half is bored slowly, but the other half is more fun, even if they are not a script Jokes are funny even though one is wondering how he never hear the voice of everybody inside the room? but it's pretty funny But the movie ends abrupt <br /> <br /> Direction is fine Music is good Akshay Kumar excels in its part that has now become its second skin but it's his film completely and he shades all the others <br /> <br /> John stumbles all over and fails in comedy Paresh Rawal is cheerful Rajpal is alright Girls are sometimes loud and also unpleasant Nargis, Daisy and Neet seen now) are good in parts, but too often yelling Manoj Joshi is fine
