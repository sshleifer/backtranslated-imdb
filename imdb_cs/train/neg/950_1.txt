I recorded this movie on AZN on a cable. It sounded like it was a good movie, the Japanese "Green Card". I can not say that I have never liked Asian film, on the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a huge fan of John Woo's films in Hong Kong. I did not like light-hearted movies like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I'd like it. Well, I'd rather cut my wrist and drink my own blood than look at this tedious and ill-acting movie. I think director Steven Okazaki had to have Quaalude water because no one in this film had a personality. And when one of the characters attempts to act, unlike the one or two rows of mumbles, their performance appears to be forced and unbelievably fake. I honestly did not think anyone ever acted before ... the only person who was right was Brenda Aoki. It seems amazing to me that it is promoted as a comedy, because I did not smile once. Even more surprising is that CBS's morning news calls a "refreshing breath of comedy". It was neither a refreshment nor a comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think of such things. <br /> <br /> KEEP this movie if you do not want to see the boring predictable line of plot and wooden gaming. Actually, I think "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better movie than this movie ... and I went halfway through this movie!
