I love bad shark movies. I really do. Hysterically, I laugh at them. and the scifi channel had a marathon of them, culminating in the premiere of his new original painting by a hammer: shark madness. Based on the previews, it seemed to be very fun. basically remake of the benchley creature. this was preceded by the demonstration of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is jolly in the jail movie. I was in a mood; I was ready to go. Bring it, hammer-crazy-scientist-human! oh, God, that movie was wrong. bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is the theoretical reproduction in my worst, my friends. when the drug is excluded from animation and is attracted to a table that shouts its head because the shark-human hybrid fetus absolutely crazy "scientist" deliberately implanted into her womb wants out ... Jesus monkey. that's what I call interfering. <br /> <br /> This is really how it works: hmmm, a crazy scientist thought. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his bottom with a hammer shark, because the sharks are not cancerous and the other hammers are reproduced through the placenta. Look! perfect amphibious creatures! I created the next development of the human race! I KNOW! let him multiply it! but sorry if all the sharks did not make my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping hot girls, I still send to his little paradise in the jungle, still eating it. but check it out! among the random people who conspired through some insignificant plot, ended up on my research island, the woman my son was involved with before he died! I'll bet she'll do it! it all leads to an extremely touching and cordial encounter: woman: will you impregnate me? mad scientist: no. he is. (indicating that the shark in the tank was moving) how sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE THIS FILM. at all.
