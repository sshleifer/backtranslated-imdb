Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Several movies are actually 'so bad they are good', and Zombie 3 is not just bad, it's unfortunate, bad in many ways, that a completely new language may be needed to describe them all. <br /> <br /> More than that, it is a film that Lucio Fulci attributes that even according to his standards he has absolutely no coherence, meaning or reason. But we can not blame Fulci because it was not really a director, but Bruno Mattei, who does not even have Fulci's sense of style to help bring the movie. Mattei seems to have brought a little into the film but a stunning misunderstanding. So it makes me ashamed to say how much I've enjoyed every minute of Zombie 3. It has no redemption - in a genre known for weak characters, a weak story and a lack of skills in making movies, Zombi 3 pushes the boat, but it's even more fun than Nightmare City. "Action" begins when "Death 1" gas is stolen from the military base and damaged in flight. Who is the thief, why did he steal him, and why did the US Army think that creating cannibalist legions of living dead would be a good idea? All these and other questions will fail in Zombie 3. <br /> <br /> After hiding in the hotel, an infected thief crashes out of all the green sculptures that grow on his face, an army that somewhat stupidly decides on how best to dispose of its the body will burn and send "Death 1" up into the atmosphere ... Zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombies! (if the zombies are cannibals, why not the zombie birds attack other birds?) Then we meet our "heroes", a trio of horny GIs and a girl's horse girl. There are other guys with them, but they are not important - NEVER is important. You will be hard pressed to remember one's face, let alone a name or find a reason to look after them. Finally they hide in the same hotel as a thief ("a week ago, this place was buzzing with life, now it's a buzzing with flies!"), But they are not afraid of the undead. <br /> <br /> That either you will be fully absorbed or you exchange a damn thing. The screenplay is so scary that even the greatest acting in the world could not save it, so it's as good as having some of the worst - and not just human characters - the zombies working here are still low. There is no consistency in how zombies are behaving - some behave in the style of time, others are fully engaged in fists, or are harassed by machets, not to mention zombies who are still able to talk (the trick that gives the film is HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING) . They die from shots on the chest (rather than on the head) and even are discarded with a good left hook. How Can You Go Zombies ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on a badly executed 80th event is often reminiscent of an episode in ... <br /> <br /> Zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, seemingly waiting for hours in absurd places at the chance some poor wetlands pass by and get scared of their lives. They are hiding in bushes, garages, chalets, roofs, water, and even under pregnant women. At one point the zombie woman follows the stairs. Kill and eat it? No! To push her into the water, these zombies and their crazy sense of humor! <br /> <br /> There are plenty of gore. The limbs are hacked, injured by mites of green pus, and it's a lot in the way to eat meat and people get their faces recessed in. There is nothing that corresponds to the original mesh piercing, but if the bad make up the effects are your bag will not let you down. All this and I have not mentioned the horrible music, the inexplicable flying zombies, the scientist whose acting really managed to stand out as really bad or the final chill ... in a genius twist on the original radio station overcome by zombies, Zombi 3 us gives a real zombie DJ! "He went to their side!" our escape from the hero before promising to continue the fight against the undead in the sequel that unfortunately never came. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 is a trash - it would be no waste in the world if every print was destroyed and all records of its existence are erased, but somehow it seems to me that my life is richer because I am it saw. Did I say it richer? I thought about 88 minutes shorter ...
