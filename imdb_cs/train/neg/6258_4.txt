Writer-director Tony Piccirillo has customized his own play about a direct, recently widowed person learning to be HIV-positive over the last three weeks; he watches one homosexual partner he ever had, brought him to the apartment and linked him, forced a blood test for a guy and promised bloody revenge if the results returned positively. An interesting idea sounds better on paper than it does. James Marsden is captured realistically cynical and crazy, but his own man-made manners are disturbing - it's like watching the Tom Cruise roadshow. Scott Speedman has a harder job with a more demanding role, but his personality - turning from a shy person to a hijacker at the border - is not convincing, not even the interviews that have two men. Marsden's homosexual boy is not, of course, unfavorable - he is compassionate for the moment of the Speedman's situation, but he does not respond or behave as a gay man in this situation. The film is not exactly eliminated, but it is a scam that is further disadvantaged by bad editing, poorly conceived obstacles, low productivity, and a great finale that is sad with stupid premonition and soapy melodrams. * 1/2 from ****
