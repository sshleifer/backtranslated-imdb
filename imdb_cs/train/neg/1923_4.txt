It's ironic that the poem Dr. Seussa, who emphasizes the non-commercialization of Christmas, should be one of the most encouraging, sold and successful celebrities. The general essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's curse against Christmas comes from an early childhood incident and that Whos themselves are captured in the materialism of the season, except for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film makes an ardent and ambitious attempt to capture the tension and sentiment of the story of Seuss's stories, but the end result is a film that hides and never compromises the emotional punch of Chuck Jones's animated version. Jim Carrey is remarkable in his performance as a devilish Grinch, but whether it's dialogue, stepping or strange happenings that rushed to the initial conspiracy, the transformation from the bitter crazy to the cheerful benefactor simply does not ignite convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and make-up work is amazing, but behind technical triumphs there are one or two elements that are missing here. <br /> <br /> Succinctness? <br /> <br /> Soul? <Br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones made the initial adaptation too well in his 25-minute cartoon, which according to Howard in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey and the crew are very capable and talented, but what seems to be a winning combination is only weak and fruitful in their final product. If you need to see a full-length version, rent it on a video with an animated version of Jones and you can see how bigger and shiny it is not always better. I give this movie three cans from Who-Hash of five.
