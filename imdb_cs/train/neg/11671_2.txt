I need to say - it's a smell! (I gave her a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> Only see if you are suffering from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of sceneries that chew and ring this movie. There is no tension, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threats to the hero's health. Several disagreements, mild voices - that is to a large extent. The secret is nothing that would not happen to anyone - the last "secret" in the movie is entirely predictable. This plot relates to a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), an artist who is hired to paint a series of wall panels in a huge hall in a large mansion, a very rich, older widow's wife, and a growing mother's relationship daughter, an old woman longing for her. It turns out that the daughter of the older woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can even put together the rest of the pieces together. Even the mysterious scene that threatens our heroine will not reach the point where you really worry about its security for maybe a second or two. Why it still hangs after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also the question that there is only one servant in this huge mansion, a loyal valet, who seems to do everything - cooking, cleaning, serving food, answering the door, etc. Everything but obviously locking the door - because it would be the only one an explanation of how one of the characters simply enters the room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to grab your armchairs and lean forward on the edge of your seat because there is no "strenuous" tension in this movie - just a tiny, pathetic revelation that from time to time they will get. <br /> <br />
