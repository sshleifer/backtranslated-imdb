When the film began, the first four minutes looked like California travels, I wondered if I got a tape. Then I felt relieved when I saw Paul Thomas in the scene with beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is hidden by Jimmy (young Tom Byron). Jimmy's Aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior, so he hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do this without an animal, robot role playing or aspects of incest. There's one good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. My grade: D +
