No matter how you look at this movie, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a horror, then it's an unimaginable movie with monsters that are hand puppets. <br /> <br /> When you look at it as a comedy, then you notice that most of the humor is falling apart and it's just chrome. When it comes to romance, you will wonder why the guy will stay with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an action that you can not really take for a hero hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie simply does not give you anything fun. As mentioned, monsters are obvious puppets, and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins-like film. This, however, has the worst-looking monsters of this genre. The animals looked pretty good, just like the Ghouli, and even the Munch puppets looked better than these. The characters in this movie are unbearable. The hero is a whimpering security guard, his girlfriends always complain, they have a girlfriend who has a terrible military friend and another boyfriend who is a lie. At one point in the movie, the hero and the military guy fight with toys ... this movie is totally stupid. I like the scene when they are in a terrible clubbed (which of course is not a club but probably a dinner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 years old and look younger than any of them.
