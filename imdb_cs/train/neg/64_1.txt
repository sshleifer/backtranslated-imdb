This movie was terrible. The end was totally terrible. There was no movie for the movie. The only thing that was decent in the film was acting Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not make their acting any justice. If the scenario came close to capturing a half-hearted story, it would be worth it. Instead, the performances of Robert DuVal and James Earl Jones are totally unnecessary on the terrible story of God ... or his lack. Not only did I let myself wait around the movie for something to be done by filming a movie ... a real movie ... not just a total dialogue between the characters for what was absolutely no reason at all. It was nothing but a normal dialogue that would take place in this period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only strange thing was how Robert DuVall portrayed a tiny, senile, drunk, old man. Throughout the movie, including the end, nothing happens. When the movie ended, I was amazed ... amazed that I was sitting the whole movie and waiting for something interesting to be watching the movie in a moment. It never happened! People's theater suddenly began to roam, so it was clear that the movie really ended, and I realized I had lost two hours of my life watching the film without a complete conspiracy and no meaning. It was not a story. The whole movie takes place in the daylight. And it is done. One day in the life (and death) of some Southern at the plantation. How many stories can happen during one day (other than a training day)? The performances of the cast were excellent, but they were unnecessarily unnecessary for such disappointment in the film ... if you even call it a movie.
