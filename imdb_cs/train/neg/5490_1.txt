When I was a child, we were always babysat, and we always photographed or saw a movie in the cinema. That's one of the movies we've been watching. This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, I think it could be Walt Disney Pictures! The Martian falls to the ground, transforms himself into a human, spins a man and tries everything to return home. But he is scattered by the wonders of the Earth. The only good comment I can make is the selection of actors, Christopher Lloyd as Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But besides, it's a complete crap. Poor!
