The funniest scene in this movie is probably when our rescuers get medals and plaques and what not. So the basic idea is that the police overcome these gangsters as millions on one but they are helpless because the guns are a little bigger. I think the police ammunition simply reflects. They decided to shoot this documentary in a documentary style with fake interviews and everything and seriously what's wrong with these guys? They speak as if they were armed with scrolls. Well, I admit, it is likely that it is still dangerous to be in the focus, although the situation is for your advantage, but you will not. And why did all this solve 44 minutes? I think it's a very long time when you're surrounded and you're allowed to shoot. They're about ten feet apart, they're absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy bigger weapons to increase their heroism. And then yeah, there you are, one of the cops will really hit someone. Bullet was probably diverted by a light column or the like. I had a good laugh.
