For life, I can not understand why they want to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It's so distrustful. Some ways, unfortunately, are the pleasure of wine. We must all admit that we have seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw it in the US recently. It's pretty bad. I admit it. Jerry is doing a terrible job I think he wanted to do. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in it. It's played basically. All she needed was her lover, Kid Rock. It would be perfect. So I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just look at the "Jerry Springer Show". It's much more fun than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
