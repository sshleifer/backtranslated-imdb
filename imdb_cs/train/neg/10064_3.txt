movie pokemon was a terrible movie. unlike the first, it's not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real track was built. in the first the interaction between the characters was decent. subtracting brock and adding trace was bad. tracey really has nothing to say or do, and unlike brock does not offer any comic relief. the only good point is to see the vampire actually have jelly over the ashes, and her early enthusiasm when his girlfriend is named is fun. Overall, this movie does not need to be hired and the short film has done nothing for me or our wife before. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well, maybe another will be better. cant ge it much worse
