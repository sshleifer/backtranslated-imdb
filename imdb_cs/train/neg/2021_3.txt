Ronald Colman won an Academy Award for Best Actor to introduce himself as a popular theater actor who is completely lost in his roles, especially as Othello Shakespeare. The critically acclaimed film George Cukor has a beautiful pedigree written by an estimated team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, funny banter looks like a confident and backstage business is exaggerated. Miklós Rózsa also won the Oscars for her score, and Shelley Winters has several great moments of a heavy waitress (when the Colman Theater is breathing and asking, "What are you?"). Otherwise, this scenario is terribly obvious, surprisingly attractive and not very fun. * 1/2 from ****
