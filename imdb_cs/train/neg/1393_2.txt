I thought watching videos on compliance were boring. This movie did not go anywhere quickly. What could have been somewhat raw half an hour episode of a twilight zone turned into a seemingly endless loss of a movie about people hiding them in cars, a picture of a kid's pool (he really needs to answer his phone by the way) his work, and Heuy and Louey are sitting in yellow control room and repeat "T minus 10 and count" as if something excited. He does not want his hopes to get up. The best thing about this movie is to see James and Gerald McCa, in something other than the famous television celebrities there, and it is pulling to find something good. And do not start my music that was completely composed of Tympani, some big marine mammals, and microphone feedbacks. This movie is as close as I have one yet, but it gets 2 because I actually managed to finish this insomnia treatment and did not have to leave in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
