I wanted to read more comments before I leave my review and most of them definitely manage: This movie is charming! From acting to unrealistic animation to countless mistakes. In fact, I was hoping that the flaps would be extended by fancy sections (no engine-free flaps could be extended). The chassis can not be started unless you have electricity. The little small fan that went was not enough to lower the chassis. One thing I thought was strange was when they landed, the rear wheels touched down, then one nose broke, and he hung the plane with both rear tires in the air. How did the captain use the left and right brakes on tires that did not touch the ground? Forgot spoilers? The word to the director: Find out * all * about the aircraft before attempting to "airplane" a movie. I apologize for technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10.
