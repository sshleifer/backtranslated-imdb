I like Seth Green. His performance at the 1970's is always very attentive, but last night I felt the need to re-evaluate the show. The only four young people will inherit an apartment in New York that most of us would have died. Grandmother must be heiress to have such a place in the first place. So I felt the need for realism. Anyway, this land of four best friends got this apartment was not credible. I would be thrilled if he had to move with one of their parents, which would be a great mood and malfunction when presenting the show. It did not seem like much humor. I watch it just because it drops before My Earl's name is on the winning Thursday night. I think they should come back, scrap this series and start over again. We need more family-related series. What Seth and his friends are moving with his annoying parents in the suburbs after the fire burned down their place. It could have Dabney Coleman playing father and Christine Estabrook, playing mother and dysfunctional siblings. A list of options with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is blowing.
