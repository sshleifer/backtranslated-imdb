Huston's films are often badly matched couples - in Huston's films: "African Queen" "Heaven Knows Master Allison" "The Roots of Heaven", "Misfits" ... "Barbarian and geisha" is another good example, . It seems that the Japanese thing was fashionable at the time because it is "Sayonara", "the world of Suzie Wong" and "tea month of the August moon". Huston's efforts could be the worst of this bad part (except "Susie" maybe). John Wayne fits perfectly into Ford's world, in Huston's like a bull in a porcelain shop. His Japanese partner is totally insignificant. the dramatic scene (cholera epidemic) does not save the film from absolute boredom. Only those who enchant Huston with every piece of work have to choose between all the other great movies.
