Anyone who loved two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film. All the magic and romance have been modernized from the original story of a girl who does a good deed behind a mysterious old lady and in turn gives her "three". Three what? Not three wishes, but three trips to 1800 on a frightened elevator ... The first novel is Time on the Top. The other is all in good time.
