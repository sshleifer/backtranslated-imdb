The facts about National Lampoon get into the movies, even as National Lampoon's film madness: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is bad, even according to standard Lampoon standards. 2. It's not funny. 3. Nobody goes to the movie. <br /> <br /> When I finished watching, I began to wonder why the "National Lampoon Goes to Movies" on Earth and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. It would be like calling Austin Powers' An American Guy into a movie. "No LAMBON's so-called" Satire "is fun and no one is watching movies, which is a bit of a problem, I was hoping it would be something Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not This was the first National Lampoon movie after an animal house, although you can not say it out of the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> I've noticed the pattern, really bad films are usually renamed, and this little catastrophe falls into this category, and it has two separate titles-it's likely to help try and promote it to people who are too stupid to remember how bad it was that they got home video criticism in 1982/83. "Hmm, Madness movie?" I never heard of this movie! Let's borrow it! "And then, realization:" Hey, wait a minute, that just go National Lampoon Goes to the Movies! " <br /> <br /> MGM / UA was discarded, never released to theaters or DVDs; it occasionally appears on television several times in a decade, which is the only place he can find. Is it divided into three stories? parody of videos with self-expansion, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality / cop-girlfriends (I think). The first segment plays Peter Riegert (animal house) as a frustrated guy who unfolds with his wife and does other things. I'm not sure what it was because it was so boring that my mind began to drift. As long as the sex scene does not appear. Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a wand (not asked) who decides to become a queen of margarine in order to interrupt the supply of dairy products. Ouch! It contains the only fun line in the movie: "I can only love my son!" If you think it does not sound very funny, are you right? It is not. Just imagine? that's the top of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III is about a policeman who chases a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) just to lose his nerves and shoot the guy. It contains one fun scene, but is it extremely excessive? only Lloyd has any kind of humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely unreal. The part in which his victims suffer and the humble policeman stood by looking at how it all evolved, at least laughed, or two. It is a shame to see that such a half-collections are named by low standards. The writers of each segment clearly believe they are very ironic and smart by spoofing so-called Stereotypes? The mistake is that the film becomes one big contradiction, preferring standard T & A instead of conspiracy; rough humor instead of humorous dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired. It is easy to see that none of the actors have been enamored with the material, mumbled their lines, often poisoning that they rarely make eye contact with the camera. The movie is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, only on one line, and even half. Two laughs, a smile and a very laughing laugh. Compared to Madness, many other good comedies seem to be a regular laugh. I like the National Lampoon's Vacation series (or at least three of the four installments) and their classic Animal House, but their recent killings of a direct video bomb such as Golf Punks (with this great comedy genius Tom Arnold) are a good example of why their magazine came out of the press more than a decade ago. It is really old, really fast. The heart is seeing a new film, called Gold Diggers, is released with their "stamp approval". Is it like condemning a movie before even theater hits? Perhaps they should not advertise their name anywhere? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> the criminals in the room and watching it every day for the whole month is so bad that I can not even begin to explain its nasty shamefulness.
