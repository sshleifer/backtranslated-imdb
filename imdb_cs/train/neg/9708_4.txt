When theater employees find the old role of the film, they decide to show it to the Midnight Night projection, assuming it's an old coil. Unfortunately, it is an old Nazi experiment with mind control that changes the audience into the hordes of ruthless zombies. I do not understand hate for this movie. It is a low-budget independent production with a number of camps but does not deserve the "IMDb" here at "1.1". It's so funny. Obviously, filmmakers have reasonable knowledge and love of old horror films and create fun tributes with their links and homage to various of them. He has feelings like Night of the Living Dead (in many ways very similar), Evil Dead 2 and The Dark Army, and many others. I liked explaining how zombies, though they really hypnotized thinking that they are zombies, actually have the physical attributes of living dead - perhaps unbelievable, but I appreciate the efforts of writers to explain it. Gore's effects were decent for the budget, the acting was fine and the story was fun. I liked it.
