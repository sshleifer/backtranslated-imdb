In the 1970s, Seed focuses on convicted serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in six years. He is sentenced to death, but he did not die in an electric chair even after being shocked three times. Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers conceal this secret by burying the seeds alive. Seed falls apart and goes after those who put him in his living coffin. Filmed by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing but a snort film about trying to stretch the envelope of a dignified society and can not deliver in any aspect of the story. And he said it was based on real events, because if one survives the electric chair after three times shocked, he will be liberated. This is an urban legend, and it would never have happened. Like Boll's other abomination ("In the darkness"), "Seed" is absolutely scary.
