In the autobiographical story "Romulus, My Father", Eric Bana of "Munich" fame plays a poor German emigrant who is trying to raise his son Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in rural Australia. The biggest obstacle to family stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Frank Potente), who grossly violates her wedding promises by not shy away with other men. In spite of a very unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to divorce her, masochistically torturing herself in the hope of one day returning to him. Unfortunately, he is a kind and good-hearted Raimond who must testify about all these marital turbulences - and that is his memory that serves as a basis for the film (Raimond Gaita later grew up as an author). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulus, My Father" for what he is trying to do, I can not honestly say that I like it because the film has some subtle performances and serious intentions, it just is not enough to have refuted a terrifying story and funeral stimulation that leave the audience as desperate and depressing as the people on the screen. Serious dramatic drama is one thing, but this continuing fight in adultery, madness and many suicides (let alone suicide attempt) is something else.
