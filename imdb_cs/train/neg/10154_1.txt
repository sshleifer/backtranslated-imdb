how this movie can have 5.5 This movie was a piece of skunk with ** t. First of all, the actors were really bad when I wanted to say that Charlie was so slowed down. because at the very beginning, when he bit his head into a wooden cottage (which became about 1/4 inch dense (it's really cheap as a fragile wood) and did not even think he could cut it out, threw it) the other person who did set, is angry as * in supplying things to build them. the only good thing about this movie is the idea of ​​this t.v. show. bottom line DO NOT BUY your heavily earned money for this piece with ** t they call the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0.3
