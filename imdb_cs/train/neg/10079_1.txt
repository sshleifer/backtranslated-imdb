When I was 11., Lube 2 was like a rupture. It was a carefree, shameful, euphoric, and heavily addictive experience. My sister and I would follow her, overturn her and watch her again and again and again until we died, or did not become too confused and hostile to one another. So if you are a eleven-year-old girl and you have reviewed this movie as "brilliant" or "funny" or "better than the original fat", you are blamed on your young teenage hormones and you can be sure that this stubborn child if you are not a little girl a justification that would suggest that grease 2 is something that is just unpleasant, carefree, embarrassing embarrassment for everyone involved in their production, distribution and / or consumption. For criticism, I'm going to explain the film with a dignified explanation why it's blowing? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-made musical instrument, songs should improve narratives or develop characters. In Maze 2, with several controversial exceptions, music is obscenely useless. Most of the songs seem to be overly generous ("Score Tonight", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin") without making a specific statement about any movie characters or motifs. Moreover, all the music is uncomfortably stupid, and no one in acting can show even the worst the ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. T-birds should be bad and if not at least a bit sympathetic, but instead each of them is annoying humorous dufus-defeated. Finally, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael a sacred T-bird jacket and takes him to the gang, Michael should kick him on the floor, spit on him and duck away to fervently brush any part of the body that touched her. But, of course, it took it as if it were gold, because despite the fact that there are plenty of obscure masses, there is no more honor than being with T-birds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> as a man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is dirty, slack-jawed, a bubble of rubber smacking, a dirty sweatshirt, a carefree coarse and spooky dingbat. So besides being pretty (I think) that does not have any sympathetic features, the audience would have no justification for the depth of Michael's attraction. I could go on and on, but I did not want to mention the gross inferiority of my predecessor, since there are obviously so many people who believe that such a comparison is unfair. But I say to those of you who think you would want to return to this mess for the old time period: Maze 2 is an experience similar to how to live your first kiss again. Now you 're 32 and you kiss a thirteen - year - old kid with acne and sluts. The spell is gone and you feel dirty and anxious. Believe me.
