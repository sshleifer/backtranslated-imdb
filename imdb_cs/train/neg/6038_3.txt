I had no other expectation than to have fun for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what I was. Of course it's campy, of course, that some of the dialogues were not perfect, of course the "special effects" were a little hokey. That's exactly why he liked the movie. It's a perfect fit for this genre 70. Horror classic. <br /> <br /> Talent must begin somewhere where it is true for actors and crew and what better material to improve your skills than this. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to another movie from these producers and directors.
