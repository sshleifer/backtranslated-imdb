This movie had the potential to be much more than it was. But it not only fails, it also provokes nausea and righteous preaching. John Cusack is even smoother than the Garden of Good and Evil at midnight. The difference is that this time it is supposed to have a southern accent that clearly loses several scenes. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino is doing his belly, but he seems to be going through this movie and collecting a paycheck. He is as good as usual, but he barely stands. <br /> <br /> Support for casting in a feminine romantic interest that has added little to the story. When we talk about the story, the "who really cares" the story, where Cusack is a self-righteous Mayor's boy who just has to look for the "right thing." People do not do this way. Cusack's character loses all credibility at the end, which, without revealing it, is sermon and nausea. The final scene makes the penultimate stupidity seem to be deep. It's also totally inaccurate, but I'm not getting into the law. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie number. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes, and for the last hour it's really a sermon, a proselytism, and a suicide movie. Better without stupidity than a pile of junk mail.
