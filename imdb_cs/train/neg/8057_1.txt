What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. The cut tries too well to look good and nothing will change the viewer while giving him a strong headache. The conspiracy is confused and of course extends from what began as short (story or film). The plot makes only less than ten minutes of good story, and it is only painfully stretched until it reaches the minimum length of the feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They are rising. Finally, the conspiracy is so lean that you may even miss it if you do not pay attention, which is difficult to watch. The game is not even impressive. Characters are badly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things happening in this movie is that anyone in charge of a score / soundtrack, had no idea what the movie was, or what it was supposed to be (not that I'd blame him for that either ). As a result, half of the music in the movie is not suitable for scenes at all. Also, what was with all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushka and the main character? Naturally it was to attract young men, but it was so cheap. And the first scene has something to do with the rest of the movie? At any conceivable level? At all? The two scary guys probably had nothing to do with the movie, they were just there to have some hunted scenes. I doubt anyone really would have talked about such an ill-assembled film and such a blatant and terrible attempt at the Hollywood attempt for a somewhat interesting idea. But I turn. I recommend it to children with low attention, who do not mean a really horrible horror thriller if there is some sex and before (although this may be true only for the Killer Cut I've seen). 1/10
