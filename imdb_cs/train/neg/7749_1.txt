This movie should NEVER be created. From bad animations to bad play. I'm not sure at which point the people behind this movie said, "Well, it looks good! We'll do it!" I was amazed at how really this movie was. At one point, which is very likely to be the worst, computer-generated saber, the gold tooth will fall off the roof that hits the idiot maker of cats in his mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the film was a paralyzed sabotage that was killed within minutes of his first appearance. The other two can kill a few heroes before they are burned and shot. Then there is a random one waiting for the victims in the jungle ... which scares me for just one reason. Will there be the second part? God, for people everywhere, I hope not. The film was clean waste. You will receive credits from the power point to end the presentation.
