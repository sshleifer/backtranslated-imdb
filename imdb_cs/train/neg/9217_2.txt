Yes, the only thing that remembers this movie is that he played young Tom Hanks, who will be a prominent star in Hollywood a few years later. Though it is not a movie that should show its talents a lot and the only thing that could be considered somewhat fun about this movie is the scene where she thinks she sees the monsters and runs the guy. Yes, this movie is about playing a bad game that makes a group of people who use their ideas and try to find interesting scenarios. Basically, a peer-to-peer type of Dungeons and Dragons, cleverly transformed as Maze and Monsters. It seems that the filmmakers thought guys should not have fun in any way if they did not come out and did not drink, drugs, they had plenty of unprotected sex, and bothered other weaker children as all popular children do. No, these bad people played a game that really required them to use the brain or not! Not that if they have brains, they can really think of themselves, and some groups will not brainwash. Yes, I think this movie is absolutely stupid and is wasting time. Perhaps it could be a film against addiction, but there are fewer people who have died in the Dungeons and Dragons far in their entire existence than telling what they call drunk driving as a moon.
