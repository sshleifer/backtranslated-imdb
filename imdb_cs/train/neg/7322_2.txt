I'll give credit where credit is due, and I'll say that Linda Fiorentino gives good performance as a heavy-drinking actress who does what she wants. It's sharp, deaf, hard and very sexy; she is much better than the movie deserves. But that's IT. This boring, upset film is a shattered mess, trying to be a stalker thriller, a murderous thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and a parodic erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not even a little thrilling. For example, who thought that Thomas Howell was considered a desirable leader? It is not ugly, but because it cried out loud, it seems that Fiorentino is the goddess of hard chefs, it is with the kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the presence on the screen to take the lead role. <br /> <br /> The script is by far the worst aspect of the movie. There is no strain because Fiorentino's character has terrible phone calls, there is no secret about her guilt in the murders that are at the heart of the movie, there is no feeling of liberation as Fiorentino gets Wimpy Howell to lose his inhibition. <br /> <br /> Look at the interesting but poorly executed cameras by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes and one really great sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides, my first impulse would be to give this to the baskets down and borrow something different.
