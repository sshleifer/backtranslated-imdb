KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, which I recall with the BOMB rating) was my introduction to the work of Honda's Director Culture; this is not necessarily better? it's just that I've learned to be more tolerant towards such a really low tariff! <br /> <br /> Here we get two Kongs at the price of one: ugly and intoxicating giant monkey and robot variation that looks even worse! Is the Simian creature living on Mondo Island (!)? where it is shown to be fighting with several other monsters and spinning a trio of people. Of course, he falls on a blonde (and indeterminate) hero; in fact, more interesting is femme fatale in the cock with the movie is a vicious mad genius? Dr. Who and the sporty anemic look and cloak usually associated with the vampire! He kidnapped King Kong and hypnotized him to gain Element X, which is embedded in the icy wastes of the North Pole; seemingly a huge monkey is more radiation resistant than its mechanical counterpart (and to ensure full cooperation that even captures its three "companions")! The female agent then has a heart change, helps the heroes (one of which is typically American) and is killed by Who. Kong eventually escapes and goes to Tokyo where he has a final showdown with the robot. Doctor runs away from the chaos in his sub? who, at the request of the Congolese Sense of Miss, was massively executed by a huge monkey.
