This movie was incredible. and not as well as some said. At first the main character is a very unattractive ginger. Secondly - WTF is happening with this vanity love. The plot is basically: the boy wants sex, so he buys the van (which is fairly just). Unbelievably, because it looks like a mantle, it scores with a lot of chickens! And with some disappoints. Then he scores with a really hot cat and realizes that he loves the annoying bird that is difficult to play. He then races the races with a friend of the hot chickens. And he will try his van. At this point danny devito saves the day. Though he did not need it, because the predatory child had first gone over when the van was tipped. I gave it to two because I am willing to assume that there is a 70-year-old Vanning subculture I will not get, and also because it's about 70 years.
