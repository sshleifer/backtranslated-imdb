Vijay Krishna Acharya's "Tashan" is an overly hyped, stylized, product. Sure, it's one of the most stylish movies, but the masses refuse it as far as content is concerned. Why? The script is like an amateur like a 2-year-old child. The script is a king, without a good script or the greatest director of all time can do nothing. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner "Yash Raj Films" and Mega Stars that appear in it. But nothing on earth can save you if the scenario is insignificant. Thumb down! Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran. But how could this role be right? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact, he is the only rescue pardon. Kareena Kapoor never looked so hot. Looks stunning and leaves you, everyone stands up. Saif Ali Khan does not get in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The failure of the films in the box should be kept away.
