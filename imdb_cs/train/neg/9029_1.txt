This film eliminates virtually every actor's talent in what might best be charitatively called "potboiler". Despite being launched with the "Top Gun" action, it's all uphill with lots of stereotypes and unlikely situations going on each other until you try to choke on popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are so many nasty stories in this movie that I guessed at one point when it was made by jumping together the discarded TV series. <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican role of the drug master is ridiculous and his 'coworkers' went straight out of the Quinn-Martine police show in 1970. Costner's character is wooden and does not give us reason to believe he really fell in love with Mendes's wife . We did not even believe that a woman is struggling hard for affinity and jumping the first hot body that comes. <br /> <br /> Definitely the best movie 'B' and a huge waste of time for all involved.
