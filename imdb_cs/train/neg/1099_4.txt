I was shocked by the absurdly unbelievable conspiracy of Tigerland. It was a liberal fantasy about how the army should be. The dialogue was hard to swallow along with the stupid things Colin Farrell had in order to escape his superior officers. I still thought, "Hey, that's why the boot camp is heavy, that the soldiers had to fight and turn them into a coherent unit." There is no room for unobtrusive attitudes and men who will not follow orders. "I was rooted for Bozze to get up the hill because it was so dangerous to its fellow-guys. I did not want to fight alongside someone like that in the war because he was more interested in people's feelings than what was necessary to protect his unit. <br /> <br />
