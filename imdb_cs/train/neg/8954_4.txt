I had great hopes for this movie because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I do not think I would understand the premise of the film if I did not read the book yet. The film is a noble attempt to show the despair of people who are trying to break the bonds of supernatural government, but the book shows the suffering much more thoroughly. Corrupt government officials have a comfortable, almost luxury life, while ordinary people are trying to reach bare needs for survival. Maybe most people feel so against their leaders and rulers, whether they are actually oppressed or oppressed. Orwell's dystopia seems to exist in many places in our modern world. Since reading the book, it has been several years, but sometimes I hear links to Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak in media and informal talks. Probably many people who use these terms do not realize where the conditions are. I strongly recommend that you read the book.
