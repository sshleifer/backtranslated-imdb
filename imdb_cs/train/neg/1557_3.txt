The film is essentially a boring string of scary clich√©s that do not offer a true intercultural view. The Middle East is described in a particularly irritating way: there are muddy village villages, dirt in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black clothes and belly dancers. I wonder how the camel and palm trees are missing from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very scrupulously sketched and many situations are hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you are looking for a cultural insight, you should skip this movie.
