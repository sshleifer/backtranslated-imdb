Finally, I thought someone would do justice to classical music by H.G. Wells, not another version that is in the wrong environment or time, but firmly based on the book. Well it certainly follows the book very carefully, and that is the only plus to this mess. <br /> <br /> This is 180 Min (yes 3 hours) long, the book is only about 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines was nervous to come here and say "If you can do better ..." I would say "yes, I could" and never used a video camera, a dramatic school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid a lot of money to get the crap out of the United States, do not make the same mistake as me.
