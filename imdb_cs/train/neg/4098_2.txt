Though it is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say much, I'd prefer to look at the dry colors) it's still upset. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from the low-budget guys. I was boring to buy some DVDs to support some Indian creators, and the kid was sorry. Some have not been officially "released" (not bootlegs - bought by the filmmakers themselves), and I can not even tell how bad everyone is. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they appear in other little Indian movies that are friends. If you are friends of these guys, it is likely that you were in your movies and enjoyed them. But for those who had to watch them? In any case. Bad video, bad sounds, bad behavior, bad plot ... etc. It's not funny either. I gave this 2 just because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's all about it. Maybe it does not even deserve 2. A 1 1/16 star that turns out to be slightly better than the first (which I wish I could evaluate in negative). If you want a decent budget without a budget, give some of LBP's "friends" to Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. They are really decent.
