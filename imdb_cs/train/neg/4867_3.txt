That's what we need! Another remake of vintage Hollywood cinema, with Eddie Murphy again disappearing in his second round after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we have extraordinary ideas in creating quality film, ladies and gentlemen! She has some hints of hope for her lovely and wonderful animal images that can act and talk to people. Things can unfortunately only get worse. Jokes about buying and sex links kill this piece of "family" entertainment instantly. Even parents and children saw ad on a trailer on a family channel followed by total disgust and disgust at the cinema. It is sad to say that this is a more advanced millennium, but enjoy it while it lasts, because things can get worse over time. Another problem has become a brand new DR. DOLITTLE. It is absolutely without fences, it is too flat. I hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock! We need more talented voices than many overwhelming celebrities who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I have to agree on my local papers, which are among the best five of the worst films in 1998. Again, the original version was not good. Murphy's next project could be PATTON unless he's careful!
