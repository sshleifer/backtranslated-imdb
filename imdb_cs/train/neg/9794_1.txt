I really do not have a clue as to why some people find power showers even remotely interesting. The costumes are totally ridiculous, and the people who play in them look just as stupid at the same time. There is absolutely something remotely interesting about executive guards. It's just a higher-priced TV ad that's meant to sell extremely cheese-based plastic garbage for unsuspecting kids all over the world. I can see from the notes that it is forbidden in New Zealand and from what I saw I agree with their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
