This movie is terrible. Not offensive, but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a small town in the mid-1960s. Father, head of school, is going through a half-life crisis. Enter nice teachers from a big city that is beginning to challenge students' thoughts with some thought-provoking things like yourself. The supporter does not agree with her teachings, but she is pretty. You can join dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is full of a small urban lifestyle and wants to live. He gets some bad advice hanging out with some bad boys and apparently not planning family planning at her school. Shocking! When he saw director Paul Shapiro working mainly on television, this film is played as an adult version of an extra-curricular special or very special episode of one of the more secular sitcoms.
