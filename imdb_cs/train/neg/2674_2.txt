Someone had a great idea: let Misty Mundae do her own, R-rated version of Lary Croft - burning two guns not only in spotted suits but also without toples. It was a great idea. The problem is that people who have had it could not come up with any font or budget to support it. That is why we get a "movie" that barely achieves a medium length by playing many of its parts (often in slow motion), and was apparently shot exclusively inside the garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still obvious: she is incredibly cute and has the natural beauty of the girl-next door. However, her two star stars, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are nowhere close to her league. If "Mummy Raider" was introduced as a YouTube video, I would have rated it higher, but it could not get more than 1/2 and 4 out of 4 as a DVD movie.
