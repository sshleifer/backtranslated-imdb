It's another bad movie that you probably will not have to watch. The conspiracy could be much "thicker" than it actually is, and it would be better done as a "blockbuster" movie. Participation leaves something that would be desirable, even if you can not give a finger to what it is. This is one of those looking at late night TV, maybe in the US, simply because you can not sleep. Watch out if you want, but do not expect too much of it.
