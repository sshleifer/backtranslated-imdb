It was a good story, but not so good. I liked the theme and the main story that was not as clear as it might be. Perhaps there was too much going on and lack of the ability to rule everything in. Acting was good for bouncing, some were stronger than others, and even stronger actors had their moments of lesser acting acting. It took me a couple of months to go through the whole movie because it paid no attention to me and the flow was bad. I just watched it and I'm glad I did it when the movie finally moves and has some continuity to the end. Again a good story, but the delivery was under par. He would recommend it for the story and maybe a little eye candy, and I think it a bit.
