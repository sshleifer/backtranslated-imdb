it's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. it's so bad I found it to be quite nice. acting, oh god, script, you have to be a child. how can you imagine that the writer came up with things like: - a boy doing fireworks at school, a fireworks so powerful that when someone hits, he flies back a hundred yards and explodes. - The girl is trapped in the cell, the killer tries to open the door. gets the drill, but the wire is not long enough. first makes an extension cord, oh horror, and then, when it ends, drives through the door and trains the killer's head. WOW - and there are lots of other similar examples. oh yeah and what happened to George Kennedy was great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
