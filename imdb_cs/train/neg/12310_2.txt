Steve Martin should leave the effort to make the remake of a classic comedy. This part is completely unresponsive. As well as the pathetic Remake Of Out Towners, this film falls on his face. As somebody thought Steve Martin might even come close to the amazing performance Jack Lemmon is out of the box and the same goes for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could play Bilk's part better. Martin is great when he makes his own original characters, but unsatisfactorily tries to repeat the classical work of other people. It's a sad statement when the most amazing part of the movie is included in the first line of credits when the movie is over. The line "Manufacturers gratefully acknowledge that the United States Army is totally incapable of cooperating" was just one line that really laughed at me. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. This ensures that you laugh, unlike this mistake, which should never have been done. I put this film in the same category as the classic Lemmon and remake Psycho. None of them should ever happen.
