I thought this movie was disappointing, as I expected it would be much better than it was. I'm so glad I did not pay to see this movie and that I should not be sitting in the cinema for this. Where to start with this movie, the acting was average, the humor was terrible, and the overall story of the film was not strange. I thought this movie was going to be great, but it was not just a muscular time. I think the acting in this movie was terrible, none of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think if we had a different actress than Jay Baruchel, it could have been better, but all the time I watched this movie looked high and I did not feel like doing that in this movie. Now Alice Eva did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie had no names and had very little influence in this film. Humor in this movie was not funny at all, in this movie there were several films that were fine but nothing to tell their friends to understand. I think Jim Field Smith was having this hard time, because he could not decide whether he wanted romance or comedy. I honestly think he has to hold Burger King ads. I think this movie could be better if the writers went to another director. The story of the movie is like any other hot girl, just OK, darling story? Boring I think it would be better if it had more originality, but what a useless thing. I honestly would not recommend anyone to see this movie. I think you would have more fun with the dentist than with this movie. So save your pain and you just do not see her.
