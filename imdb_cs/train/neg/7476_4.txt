Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jackson's first Bad Taste and Braindead movie. I have to admit that these movies are never tired and I say it the same way. Jake West is a director who apparently lacks his own inspiration and decides to steal the ones he is looking at. I lost the number of times the main Hollywood movie was quoted by James Camerons Aliens most notably. The amount of blood and gore shown here is also not funny, the other end of the film becomes tired and pulls out. Perhaps it would work better as a short film. The actors are poor, the direction weak and the conspiracy does not exist. I see what the director is trying to do, the honor he tried to pay, but others have done the same much better than here. 4/10
