The young boy sees his mother being killed and her father hung up. 20 years later, he gets a bunch of friends to get exorcism, so he does not look like his father. All stock figures are in place: nice pair; "funny" guy; hard (but sensitive) hood; smart girl (she wears glasses - we know); jerk and two blondes without personality. Everything involves some silly wooden statue that comes alive (do not ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when we jumped 20 years later after a great opening scene - all the bad horror movies do! Dialogue is terrible, acting is bad (except Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) And killing is stupid and / or non-imaginative. My favorite scene is when two people are supposedly sexing and the statue knocks a man out of bed to show he's completely dressed! A real bad, stupid, incoherent horror film. Avoid at all costs.
