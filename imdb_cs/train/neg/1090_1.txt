it was the most important film I've ever seen, because there was no plot and it seemed that the actors did not matter. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot, I laughed so much that my ribs started to hurt. bit, where the old people, when they captured Robert Duvall, was ridiculous. At the overhead level making a movie noir does not include lots of rain sequences and unnecessary details on the main character. this is an unsuccessful attempt to create a Noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer from incoherent scenes. because it was based on John Grisham's "handwriting," and I do not see it as one of his books on film adaptations because he does not find any of the exciting and engaging stories like movies like "a company" or "a storm".
