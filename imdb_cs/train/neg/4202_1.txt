... I miss something? "unexpected plot development"? "conspiracy with subversive joy"? those viewers who are looking at the same Arquette that I have just exposed (in today's self-evident underachievement of sadomasochism) ... I just joined this page and I simply made sure no one else was lending this arson at all. ... this movie was embarrassing for every single person ... a quick question: Sir Stevie read the script before he put his thumb up Kate C.? if so, then it must be the same Spielberg, which radiated "scare the duck" ... do not do it, "it was a hit" - I guess Msr. Reddin is not very pleased ... DVD packaging promised "surprising horns" and "twisted story ..." Story !! Story? Is that the bullshit that makes old Bobby McKee and his traveling group of Structuralists sound like geniuses ... Sundance? Berlin? Toronto? I have a home video about my pussy, which raises more interest than Arquette's negative-dimensional loss loss display ... and talk about deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T .; thank God, just the moment he thought Dave would call the cops! and thank Siva for the police just caught a real killer ... what !!! I was still waiting for credits when there was some kind of attack against Arquette and his "hidden millionaire" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, you will not get lost: what the hell was the kitchen scene with the "athlete leg in the crotch" gag ??? are you worse in this or "fair cause"? I do not know hey movie lovers: why do not you do that and you pick it up along with "girl girl" and "white chicks" and then do sepulky (or it is seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you ....
