This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (brother Joanne Dru and later permanent guest of Hollywood Square) and Tommy Noonan was encouraged as "new Lewis and Martin," is just shy of ghosts: fast and nothing works - there's one scene in which Noonan defends grenades with officers and politicians in anger; they are about five feet apart, Noonan is thrown between them, and the overall reaction is that every flinches. In the midst of dreadness, it only relieves Julie Newmar's appealing, there are several moments of clarity: Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and seizure, and their timing is almost perfect - clearly, they are well-groomed comedians. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to save this step, unfortunately.
