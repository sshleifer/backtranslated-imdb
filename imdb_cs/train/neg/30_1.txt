I did not like the idea of ​​a female turtle ever since 1987 we knew that TMNT are four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each of the four brothers is named after the great names of artists such as Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello, so Venus has no no sense or plays any important part, and I believe the old TMNT series was a lot better than the new one that contains Venus. The female turtle does not add any action to the story that we like the TMNT story that we knew in 1987 had new enemies in every part, there is good reason to have some action, but female turtles are a very weak point to some action, we want to see more of the new TMNT series, the same characters we knew in 1987 without the female turtles.
