Ok, so I found out about this movie and I watched a preview read almost all the reviews and I hardly discussed whether I should watch it or not. Before I even watched the movie, I was emotionally weird about it. so I was not sure if I was looking at it and would be disturbed for a long time. So I decided to risk it and watched it and heres what I thought: The start started fine for me. He seemed to be heading in a decent direction. I got behind the scene of rape, and I could not imagine why people were so concerned or bored with the film. Do not get me wrong, rape scene was as sad and scary, but it really did not bother me a dramatic point. When I came in the middle, I understood the boring things that were happening. It was about 5 minutes of shots than people who walked and said or showed nothing! his only thing is to have a shot where one shows some kind of emotion, but this movie did not have it. It was about 3 of these pointless scenes where you see the main character Maya gets out of control, but did not get it right, I wanted to quickly move forward. Then, when she was engaged in a hardcore party, it was not so boring, but still a little boring. Oh, and as a note, Rosario Dawson still worked great. Well, after an hour of absurdity in the middle, revenge will help May's attention. This is where it is disturbing. I felt bad for him or not, he got what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I felt after all. I can not really tell you if you want to watch this movie, because its so ... I do not know that I can not find a word that would sum up it. But if you choose to follow, you will not be used.
