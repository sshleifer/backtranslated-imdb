This film is soaked. It was really a loss of my life. Efficacy was unfortunate, conspiracy was unlikely. A long, long story short, these people are "terrorized" by this poor "crazy killer," but they can not quite defend themselves in any way. And after they took the raft on a camp trip, without equipment, they showed up in a camp that was already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothing, and the daughter's headphones. Besides, when their ship disappears, they are panicked to be stuck in the woods, but then the daughter's girlfriends are just coming up and they obviously never think they could just go out of the wood as if they got to them. As I said, this movie is upset. Full joke. Do not let your girlfriend talk about watching her.
