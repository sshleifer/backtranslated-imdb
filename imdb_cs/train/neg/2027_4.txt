Unlike the other two concerts of Endemol USA (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the speed in this show is relatively slow on the screen. DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow stimulation, because games can change peace - or end - at any time. Risk is involved in every action the player takes, the rewards are very variable and it is difficult for the player to leave with a lot of money. Suspension is usually used. <br /> <br /> Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is too slow. When the question is revealed and it is clear that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that in the next few minutes absolutely nothing will be exciting. It would help the pace of this show reveal the correct FIRST response, and then the player chose the dancer instead of Shat losing time and talking about what happens if the player gets a bad answer when we all know they are right. Random dance is a filler that really feels like a filler. Too much time is useless when it's not enough ... and the fact that players can not leave the game will soon ensure that there's a lot of time left over. Oh, and I'm not interested in watching Shat shrink his groove, especially right after the meal. <br /> <br /> I am a lifetime fan of the game, but I even had a lot of trouble sitting in an hour. It needs either fundamental change or early retirement.
