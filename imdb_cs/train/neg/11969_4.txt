If you like to have fun, do not forget to check out this movie. If you like the hero of war, do not forget to look at this movie. If you want to see great acting and excellent script, do not forget to check out this movie. If you like the typical Hollywood war movies that end up just in time to give a politically charged public appeal to the size and glory of the war, check out this movie. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I always care about war films because I think if they do well they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a bunch of boys running around the country saying they are making frantic clich√©s, doing the most prestigious things, and defending themselves with the same oppressive force and brutality as the oppressed. This film is shameful to the movie and to the United States of America! Can you imagine that you are a man from Europe or Africa or some other country, and watch it when it is said that these are really Americans? No wonder all of us hate! Please, please, do not waste time on this piece of junk mail; if you have to, wait and hire her. 4/10
