I was so excited and thought about watching this movie when promos first came out in November! It looked great and songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it! This is a movie that links 6 couples together. It has more than 12 people! There was a huge number of stars on this film. I think director Nikhil Advani could not handle the situation well and he should not have many people in this movie because it would make it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil, "Kal Ho Naa Ho", "Salaam-e-Ishq" lags behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors in this movie are songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are amazing, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy has done an excellent job and has done excellent work over the years. I think the ratings of this movie can go up because of excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with is that the director should not include the nudity in this film, which is made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I've found it to be an extremely harsh follow-up with family! Although some find this boredom as a comedy, it's not something you would like to watch with your parents! I think the best acting was Salman and Priyanka Overall, I think it's a good movie!
