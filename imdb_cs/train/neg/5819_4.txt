This is the story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. Parents divorced, and Mom stayed in the east in the house. Father Murray Abromowitz moves with his children in California and moves around Beverly Hills to give his children the best possible education. Things really get fun when Marisa Tomei comes, Murray's niece lives with the band. The film deals with various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the rich neighborhood. Jessica Walter is a woman who wants Murraya to move with her since she wants a partner. Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno are coming to an end. Starring Murray's brother and sister-in-law; they are also Tomei's parents. In front of the children, Reiner will allow Murray to remind himself freely that he has paid for them all. The film ends after a fragile remark when an embarrassed family moves from their fantastic trenches and takes a horse around Beverly Hills in the car. I think the film supports independence and good old self-esteem.
