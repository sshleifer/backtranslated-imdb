I think most people want to believe there are extraordinary things and this film has no restraint in trying to make the most of it. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and graphics are the most modern, but it does not work from a scientific point of view. Hydrogen chargers? The size of the Mack truck should be useful. And then there is still a possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just do not try to postpone it as a fact. Some people will always be misunderstood. The whole movie is fun, but I found myself constantly speaking: "O brother, what a burden ...". If you want a FAKE document, look instead at This Spinal Tap. Or at least turn off the sound.
