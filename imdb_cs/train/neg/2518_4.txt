Think of a darker version of one of those boys' shows like "Power Rangers" and you have this movie since 1990, "Robot Jox". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever goes out wins. Robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of those that are out of these shows mainly because they are less varied, so when this movie is not good, it's not bad to watch. They are there, as I recall two robot battles in this one, which will end in bad and final settlement. There is a conspiracy plot some way as a traitor is revealed, but ultimately the plot is not anything that will hold with you any time after the image is over. The games themselves look like huge toys for rage, but it is a bit fun to watch. This movie would also give a lot of other movies with similar devices like giant robots and tournaments. So it's worth it once, but probably not more.
