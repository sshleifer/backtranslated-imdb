costumes, dialogue, historical accuracy are terrible. For example - Stacey Dash and hanging scene. The line was accurate (as I did), but that type of nose broke the neck of a man. Mrs. Dash remains hanging at the end of the rope without the bad effects until the rope is shot. This type did not allow strangling, but at the end of the fall he killed them. And before they enter the bank (in a flash), a group embrace in the street - with their bandanas hiding their faces - would be obvious to street people. Bad editing - it's a battery under that shirt, and it's obvious that the "long ride" clip shows them I'm riding in succession, then reversing the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that she kept the scene with the horse crazy - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was bullshit.
