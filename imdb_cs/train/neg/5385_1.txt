I do not know where to start. Cast is a lot of people who have never done anything before or before. Debralee Scott is featured on envelopes but does not appear in the movie at all. Writing is quite bad, even in college films. This is, of course, a very low budget, with one scene in the house of the association being extremely torn. <br /> <br /> The characters are typical for college films - shy guy, nerd, sweet black guy, tough guy, guy with a mustache, attractive girl, little town girl, etc. The taught teacher is about what you would expect .. middle age of a heavy man who gets easily turned away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not want to go to college move, clean yourself out of this. It's so bad, it's not funny either.
