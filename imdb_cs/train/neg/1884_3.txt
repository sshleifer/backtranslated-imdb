Fragmentary film about a couple of people in Austria during the wave wave. This kind of movie is done more often, and above all, better. Stories actually have nothing to do with others, except for the poor final: "people are cruel". An ugly body, annoying people, and a movie that takes too long without it really mean ... Ultra realistic? Hardly ... Boring? Indeed. Even the wonderful Franzisz Weiss will save this chance! 3/10
