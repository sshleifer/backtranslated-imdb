Until the last few minutes of the film, I would shoot a 7 or 8-star movie. However, the end is so terrible and "hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the film. The land revolves around the submarine and the possibility of receiving an order to burn its nuclear missiles. Captain Gene Hackman is on his way, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is first to confirm the commands. The problem is that you need to run the BOTH captain, and the 1st officer must use their boot keys at the same time. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firmly until it eventually leads to an armed rebellion aboard. Eventually, an error appears and the missiles are not running. Cold. However, there comes the part that is simply not ringing. After they are back on the floor and go to the control committee, Washington and Hackman (who have just spent half of the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddy buddies! Huh?! It's too ending for the movie to become for me.
