From the stupid "quaint African natives" of recorded records with our badly overlapping principles acting as narrators, with terrible fake ears that transform the captivating Indian elephants into African elephants, to the absolute lack of any logic, to the constant Maureen O'Sullivan's perjury "Tarzan! Tarzan! ", there is nothing about this film that would deserve a classic. <br /> <br /> 4/10
