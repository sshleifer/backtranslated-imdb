During the Christmas breaks, a group of college colleagues remains to help prepare dormitories that should be torn apart and replaced by apartment buildings. To make the work a little more difficult, murderous, the Chucks-wearing psycho is wandering in the dorm hall, drinking on a group in various violent ways. Written as one of the 74 'video nasties' released by the United Kingdom in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation before it first looked. The term "ugly video" will capture some images of some great explicit gore, violence, sex, etc. Everything that a horror fanfriend is about, so after hearing all this information, I settled down in the Pranks (another title) and I expected it to be like ... and that's (non-original scenarios) and general direction fail, it's simply not pleasant to watch, a non-original scenario is missing and often throws random things for no real reason (such as the initial killing). There are some great death scenes, including very nice face melt (which can be seen on the poster), but that's a positive one. the story seems unimportant, the killer is not cold or frightening and suffers from the only serious mistake that he should always avoid from all the slasher: it's a little boring. Overall, for the movie made by some UCLA students for $ 90,000 (which is more than doubled today), The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a complete mess. He has a few good things and is quite observable. . . But like a bloody film that tries to be at the level of movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it just can not compare. Do not wait long and you can have fun at least. I hate to say this, but this is one of the few movies I've seen that would be better with a remake. . . and yet they go on big works like Black Christmas. Oh, okay. . . <br /> <br /> Mandatory elements of horror: <br /> <br /> - Subgenre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are several brutally cold killings and gore is fine for the most part . . . but nothing special. They also off-screened some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: It's a little uninteresting (for me) nudity, but not too much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Nah. The ultimate monologue (s) of the killer made him quite unstoppable. - Scares / Suspense: Jump or two, but not very effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I guess so, but I just did not care enough, and it's just as obvious as a nose on a murderous face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Humbug! <br /> <br />
