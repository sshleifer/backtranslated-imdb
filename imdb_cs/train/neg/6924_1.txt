If this movie was worse, Uwe Boll would be driving. This absurd mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I've seen this mass smoke, but I remember that I wanted to do serious harm to everyone involved. How can one give this movie more than 1 star, amazes me to the favor of all those who have seen this tribe. I give her one star because it is not lower. All copies of this film should burn the land sown with salt and reserved as a landfill for the worst waste. No, one copy should be kept in ultra-high security and shown only to filmmakers as an example of how to do it.
