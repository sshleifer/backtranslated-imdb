This film is remarkable for three reasons. At first, apparently capitalizing on the success of two Superman series, this low budget was made and released to theaters, marking George Reeves and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the hole is re-used in the series. Outside of the city, Silby penetrates six miles of a deep oil well into the "hollow Earth", allowing it to come to the surface. Forget more holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Secondly, unlike most films about the SF invasion of the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) power in proclaiming and promoting tolerance and accepting the difference against a furious crowd of segregation vigilants. No "moderate reporter" here! Clark Kent, deft and confident, takes control of the situation all the time ("I can do it!"), Even helping in a hospital dress when removing a bullet from Mole-Man! Like Superman, he is much finer than Clark towards loathsome Lois, but he is also the voice of reason and tolerance when he leans on vigilants as "Nazi stormy soldiers." <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from Fleisher's animated animated flying Superman to two live action acts by flying in the Superman Adventures was not yet.
