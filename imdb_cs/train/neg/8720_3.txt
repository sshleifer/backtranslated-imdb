Postpone Dr. House Repetition I Missed, and Desperate Wives (New) to look at this. I do not know exactly what troubled this movie. I never thought I'd say it, but I want to get 15 minutes of glory. Script, Direction, I can not say. I recognized the status of actors (usual suspects), but I thought Herbert Marshall was a class, and he sat down for good fire. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: where "office girl" does with 029 keypunch and puts cards in 087 sorting. LOL @ "Computer". I want somebody else to identify other devices - 477? It's before this dinosaur's time. And we dinosaurs do not have much time to waste.
