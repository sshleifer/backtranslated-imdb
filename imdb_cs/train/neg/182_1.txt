This is the worst sequel to the world of movies. Again it is not. The murderer is still killing for fun. This time, however, he kills people who made a film about what happened in the first film. That means it's the stupidest film ever. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it. If you value one precious hour during this film, do not look at it. You will want to ask the director and the person next to each other, which made him do it. Because it simply does not combine the original stories of horror, action, and crime. Do not let your children look at it. A teenager, a young child or a young adult film has this effect on people.
