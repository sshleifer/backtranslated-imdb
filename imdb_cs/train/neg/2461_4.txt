Probably more people are afraid of a dentist than, for example, small monsters or terrifying looking virgins. Which one is really the ideal theme for horror film, really. <br /> <br /> Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he catches his wife by cheating with him with a boy's hook, he gets caught and his anger and frustration brings his job. Well, give the furious dentist a workout and a mouth and you can probably guess what's going to happen ... As I said, a great idea, but not delivered as well as it should. Specifically, the end is huge. Last note: looking at Mark Ruffalo (can you count me, the everlasting sun ...) in this. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
