That was disappointing. It started well, but as it went on and lost every opportunity to climb, it fell flat. Maria's effect is terrible, she never seems to mean what she says, or even know what she's saying until she says it. She showed no real emotions at all, not for her beloved goy or for her mother's story. When Lena seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lenin's story. There seemed to be no real connection between Lena and her mother, except her mother seemed to have a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The anticipated balance between Hanna's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was just as a clich√©, and she had failed unsuccessfully. The wedding was absolutely unconvincing and stupid. The culmination of the protest was insignificant, and no matter what Lena did or did not do to affect the outcome, it would certainly show a certain complexity of feeling at that time, a scary view, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the movie had any depth or sparkle. It was very hard to take care of someone, even the little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she refuse him when she called from the hotel? There was no context or explanation.) If every link was removed from him, he would not notice. <br /> <br /> A simple story that was confused by the bad character's evolution (who was his mother, again?), a weak acting and directing that made everyone look as if they were acting. You almost heard "silence on the set! ..." I began to think it was good 7, but as the film went on, it quickly dropped to 4, then earned 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene. It was probably a cold and sterile movie, as I saw. The terrible loss of a good story.
