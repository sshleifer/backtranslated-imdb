Mr. VanHook had a good idea and kicked like football. Unfortunately, it was not a goal. The historical subject of the giants is good, but pour the milk and you end up with a giant cheese. I say, take this wheel and throw it off the cliff. I could not even watch the whole movie. It says a lot because I rarely left a movie. I always give them a chance to redeem at the last minute. It is impossible to buy something so bad. At least the acting was good ... NO! <br /> <br /> The only thing that 'drops' in this movie is rating. 1/10 and sinking into negative numbers!
