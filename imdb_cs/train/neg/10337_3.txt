Man, the end of this movie is so terribly inappropriate and dated that my entire aesthetic movie class laughed like a fool. Now most of the rest of the movie was fine. It had several unintentional fun scenes but had some really good shots and photo editing. Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and whatever happened to make Baby Jane among the others. The problem is not with direction, gaming, or any technical one. The film is only destroyed in the third act. Why? Murders, twists, turns, and figures have rotated around the NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the hell did the writer smoke when it came? The way it simply comes from nothing can be the greatest Deus Ex Machin in history. For all the complaints on Burton's Planet of Ape, Living David Gale or Notorious, I think THIS is the worst end of all time. What he left.
