Nice average scifi movie. This conspiracy was more or less obvious from the beginning. Although acting was reasonably good, the font seemed to be very clich√©, using the ideas of many films. Basic Fiction: Scientists working on the deep space exploration platform have rescued the fighter from the crash into the red dwarf, orbiting them. On board, they find a stasis that fails at that moment. After two to three minutes when a person wakes up in a cell, you realize he's a complete fool. Something that completely escapes the crew of 3 people on a research ship ... Then it becomes the tearing of all other films that involve a psychotic fool who terrorizes innocent victims, overall, I think speed 2 was a better survey of a subject I did not even consider good film. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, getting strangers and watching it again. <br /> <br />
