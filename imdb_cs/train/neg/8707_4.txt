This is one of the most funny movies I've ever seen. I rented it as a joke, I expected it to squeeze out of the first scenes, and allow me to just say that I never really did not like in my life. The first scene where ninjas accidentally jumps out of the air and starts a huge and ridiculous firefighting action is one of the most incredibly funny silly action movie moments in my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but more of a movie that makes fun (and does not mean at all) an action genre. I did not see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think there is so much that I missed. If you want to see a movie that fits perfectly on six packs or some herbal remedy than I insist on renting the film and sitting down and watching 100 years of progress in the cinema, throwing in the trash and getting to the carnosours
