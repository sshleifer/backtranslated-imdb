I will only give it 3 because it shows the history we need to know to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments of the British gentleman. The movie was pretty awful. All clich√©s, no real plot. There are also historical and technical inaccuracies. Check out the technical specifications on DE 529 or any Everts Destroyer Escort and see what I mean. Now I'm in the US in a black historical moon and I'm going to call a racist just because I say it, but the history of this ship is not so great. They did some escort work, chasing a "submarine" that turned out to be a heap that hit. We apologize, but the blacks did much more in World War II than this stupid film gives them. This movie causes them to be like whiners. Let him call a name, I can handle it.
