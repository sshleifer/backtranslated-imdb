I quote Oedipus Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even made !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I am by no means Uwe Boll hated as most humorous people on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll films like postal and tunnel rats are cheerful bad and therefore fun. But honestly, this movie was terrible. I hated it enough to give him a zero rating if I could. The story is just crap! She spends four fifths of the film in which the plot is conspicuous, and then they have a center that is just a scene of grizzly terrible taste without taste! Eventually it ends up with "villan winning ends", which is quite acceptable, but it certainly could be more tasty than this! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said before), I'm not against violent movies! I'm the king loving violent movies! I Loved Saw Movies, Movies Hostel, Tokyo Gore Police, New York Ripper, 28 Movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, Every Tarantino Movie, Every Sam Peckinpah, Cannibal f ** king Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just cruel, sadistic and perverse! And look at the movies I just mentioned! If I liked the Cannibal Holocaust and not this, then it must be bad! Uwe, do not forget again! You're funny when you're light, like Ed Wood. It was just a terrible experience! I felt terribly after all when I saw it! <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE !!!! Avoid all expenses !!!!!
