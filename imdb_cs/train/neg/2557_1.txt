Actually, I like asylum films. I made the habit to see as much as possible. Even the tricks they did were great like EXORCISM AND WHAT THE KILLER IS CALLING. It's just chaotic. I can not believe that the same people who make DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE really shot this movie! It's not even ridiculously bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which is by the way bad). That's just bad! I think that I can appreciate and / or forgive the bad effects or lame special effects in the Asylum film, but this film is too serious. I really hope SNAKES ON TRAIN is better. Now it's a movie I can not wait to see.
