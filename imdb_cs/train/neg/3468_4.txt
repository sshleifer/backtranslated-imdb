The student is filming an actress in category B (polite diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror film her mother (terribly dull Kylie Minogue!) Tried to do 12 years ago. It's a curious choice of conspiracy, because every Aussie horror fan knows the genre is lamentably missing from female directors. The film has a curse because Molly had to kill a psycho killer on the original set. But she's back because she needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people are starting to die on a "set." Cut is the Aussie attempt on a modern "slasher", but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it denies half of Wes Craven's 90s movie. Lots of film world names - looks and la "Scream" (except that it's Aussie's name-fall - Jane Campion ... see how it's not that funny) and much "it's real or it's a movie" la "New Nightmare". Editing is bad, music is annoying, effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: at some point a well-dressed girl in the filmmaker tells the owner of the house that shoots: "Do not worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own," it reacts to, "that does not mean anything to me , you look like you live in a landfill! "Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-time boat was enough not to let her rent this one. "Here is a diet coke?" (how does the movie go in the car) and "Does anyone know where to buy tofu?" (the first thing that speaks on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (oh wait, I thought.)
