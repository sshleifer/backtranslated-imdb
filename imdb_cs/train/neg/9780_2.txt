Good Lord, the one who did this turkey must be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer can not see this movie, have to watch something else or have never seen a movie ... 9 of the ten stars? What is it, is it as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Unintentional funny, incredibly incredible characters, absurd situation, it looks like he was shot in Griffith Park (which is pretty good - MASH was shot at Griffith Park), a dirty script, almost everything that could be wrong with the film, in one package . It should be required to view all potential film makers as an example of how the film might be wrong. It reminds me of something a student USC can do for a movie class. <br /> <br /> Give this to you when you do not do medication and you will find yourself in a high camp.
