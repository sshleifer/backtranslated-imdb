I loved watching the original Azumi with his mix of live action manga, impressive storyline, great soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), Edit, not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto that perfectly filled the part. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but when I finally saw, I felt I won the lotto and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 rises where Azumi has ended, but that's just 2 different movies, much slower, the action is not so exciting and equally choreographic and there is not a lot of character development that was obviously driven by the same person who was responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHE franchise TOH (if possible!) That this is a lost opportunity.If even in this installment Ryuhei Kitamura continued, but there are some beautiful Japanese forest sceneries that we look at as slow action unfolds and we briefly introduce ourselves that are quickly killed, even real evil men, killing too easily without too much fighting. the boy Spider (from the episode Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was probably an unforgettable fight scene. they had a top combat scene with camera barrel effects, Azumi 2 brought us Azumi cape cam! Azumi's bouts at the end were not convincing, but Aya still does a good job. She looks great in Cape ... but where did she get it? I do not think I will follow this again and again! ...what a shame.
