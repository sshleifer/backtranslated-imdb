I loved Dewaere in the Noir series. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Well, it's a couple of guys who boast conventions in those absurd and irreversible ways. many people think such behavior is fun. This was a boring, useless exercise to shock. I find Blier's face on his face, poisoning his face behind the camera. The Noir series was a valid expression of personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the very first moment we saw Patrick Dewaere as they appear in the deserted park, we get an idea of ​​an amazingly beautiful anti-hero with whom we will spend time for the next few hours. When we see an unhappy middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places," we have an honest warning that the two hours spent with these boys will be exhausting. I have difficulty in stopping "3" for this unpleasant distraction.
