In short: it's a romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES is something more. It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. He wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, adjustments that make it feel important. The dialog is sometimes clever. There are some "laughs aloud" moments. But here is what keeps it from finishing being something more than a formulaic late-night cable, in flight, time-killer: David Schwimmer - How many times can Joe sad puppy puppy look into the universe with open the jaw before it starts to annoy? Perhaps some saliva would help. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - is really flat and not just in the chest. Her role is to be this lively, pretty, caregiving girl who is just getting into bad situations is, as a result, very confused and that's why a sad bag like Schwimmer has a chance with her. But Gwenneth plays it very boringly. Combine it with a puppy-falling tear face (above) and you have very little chemistry to take care of. (I still imagined someone else in this role - for example Kate Hudson.) <Br /> <br /> 3. Scenario and plot - Things that happen only basically do not mean truth; all the problems are finally wrapped up with such a neat and calmed bow on the top that it sounds like a whistle and the songwriters just said, "Oops, time pack it up and get the train to catch it!" So they pulled out a book about the Hollywood pattern, checked all the boxes, and left home.
