I just read a review of how to defend this movie because it had a low budget, now I have a point. The CGI monster was reasonably well animated, but it was done in the worst way. Combat scenes were not in combat, it was just one shot of an actor, then one shot of a monster with great interaction at all. When the monster concentrated, it looked like it was in the paintshop for. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use models and puppets. They do not have to look like fantasies, but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jackson's early movies. As for acting, Beowulf did a descent job but did not try to try the rest of the cast or forget where they are. <br /> <br /> The scenario seemed confused. One minute they will speak as if it were a modern day when you chose Shakespeare's next drama. I'm not saying that it should be everything "you" and "it will be," but you have to find a coherent balance, so the lines sound like coming from the same person. a part close to the beginning, when Beowulf quoted the old law that would be found if he did not work on other movies about worship and worship. In short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but yet again.
