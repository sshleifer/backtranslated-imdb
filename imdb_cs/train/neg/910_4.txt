The storyline was very straightforward and easily traceable and contained lots of unstoppable comedies until it was simply bored. Some of the audience looked funny, but I like smarter humor. There were several well-known Swedish actors in the film and their performance was decent with respect to the screenplay. Lena Endre was good looking as always. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original movie, so I can not tell if it's better or worse. If you love movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie could be useful.
