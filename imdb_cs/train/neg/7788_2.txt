I've noticed how all the other reviews of this movie tell you how "healthy" and "entertaining" are. These people need to get out of the house more often. I do not know why they are looking for this unpleasant, insignificant, helpless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no talent, and his infertility is exceeded only by his friend Pamella Austin, a former model (one more reason why to ban the insidious practice of introducing impotent models on the unsuspecting moving public, a foul custom that unfortunately continues to this day). Good support (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) is trying hard to draw any sense of it, but without success. I noticed that the two directors shared credit, although "credit" is not a word I would use (nor "the director"). Regarding "healthy entertainment," there are many types of movies that are available without killing your loved ones by forcing them to sit. Find one of these movies and skip this option.
