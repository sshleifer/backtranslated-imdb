This stupid comedy really does a good job of losing comedic talent. In particular, there are poorly used Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman. Perhaps I laughed once or twice during this movie, but generally it's a boring movie, with a little stupidity that fits well. The assumption, though routine, was still not bad, but once the plot was set, the film did not work anywhere. Do not waste time with this outage.
