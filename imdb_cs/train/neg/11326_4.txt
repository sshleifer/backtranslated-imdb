This is one of two post-apocalyptic fantasy films made by Albert Pyun in 1993 - and it's a bad film. Apparently, all of his energy came to "Nemesis," a fun non-stop action movie and a much more expensive look. "Knights" is a clumsy and cheesy sci-fi that reminds too much of a video game (new opponents are constantly appearing and must be smashed as quickly as possible). The only thing that this movie stores from the trash is Kathy Long; is not a particularly attractive woman, but undoubtedly a brutally effective combat machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, given his age at the time (58), I hope his pair was well paid. (* 1/2)
