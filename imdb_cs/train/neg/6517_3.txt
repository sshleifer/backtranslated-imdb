I went to the premiere of this movie and, while it had a few moments that made me laugh, they had some very serious mistakes. First, it is a humorous exploitation of a true divorce that seeks to find love in LA. What is being introduced to it is a depressing, narcissistic and tireless story in the history of love life and the professional life of the director. Jokes quickly wear out and find that you do not care what this person is all about. The laugh is that the director is presenting himself as an extremely annoying and heavily flawed character, and then he expects us to be interested.
