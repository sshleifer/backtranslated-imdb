Do not use the US version. It's with added American shots and the worst dubbing you've ever heard, probably made Americans from New York. Dabing is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think the black guy from Bronx is doing Chiba's voice. I could not watch the whole movie that was so bad. Instead of this americanized version, you look at Chib's other commanders like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
