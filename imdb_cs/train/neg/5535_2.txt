I think the biggest failure can be boring. Bad is really better than boring. This thing has no breath. This is interesting to happen in Cambodia. How many American films from the 1930s are taking place in Cambodia. However, the conflict is a bit difficult to understand. Even the movements of soldiers are a little confusing. What reduces it is a love story. Why are the two guys so totally overwhelmed by a blonde blonde I do not know. I thought he should continue to use his zombies (such as they are) and forget about it. The film simply breeds. A perfect microcosm is where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest through water to get to a secret place where hieroglyphics (or whatever) are being kept explaining how to convert people into zombies. I thought they would never get there. One guy has two steps. It stops. He looks around. The other guy is behind some columns. It takes two steps. It stops. He looks around. The other guy is hiding behind some bushes. This is the film in a nutshell. Then there is a bad and insipid dialogue. In fact, I have a lot of patience in terms of B movies. This is unbearable. By the way, a better name would be the Revolt of the Hypnotized.
