One Stinko from a film featuring a fictional plot and, to be dear, had less than an Oscar caliber. But for me the worst mistake was the complete jamming of jet aircraft and especially 747. Some of the biggest mistakes: 1. No flight engineer (or even flight engineer) 2. Incorrect identification of F-16 traps as F-15 (no resemblance) 3. Loading passengers in the "rear luggage compartment" allegedly accessible from the cabin - such a space existed, such that such a heavy weight that would make the aircraft impenetrable fire 4. Balls with a hollow point that would not "harm the aircraft" 5. The whole landing procedure was so bad I wanted to rage. SR-71 (with all airplanes) with pressure seal 7. Opening the cab door - out into the wind - in flight! <br /> <br /> Hello, it was a really bad movie. list of the 10th year's bottom.
