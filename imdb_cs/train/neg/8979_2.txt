It was Jon Pertwee who said, "It's very hard to be funny but very easy to be stupid." Well, if this is the case of PASTY FACES, it's "Very Easy". David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his acting seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and styles from outstanding British like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a totally underdeveloped script and jumping up and down to talk in a very fast voice very loud. Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but is not enough to destroy the movie because there is not enough film to destroy. PASTY FACES is scary on all fronts, especially in scenarios. I did not understand why it was the way it was, it seemed to have stopped very suddenly and stupidly. Oh and other ugly mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US and a green card to work there - this movie would think you could get off the plane and start a new life in America without any permission - I still get a reward for blood donation in America - People who know the Americans and who donate blood told me that I gave up donating a few years ago and that you can buy any type of gunfire. If I know that America's weapons differ from state to state, but no arms stores sell against a tank gun over a counter. So we have a very wrong look at America from a very unreal and oh-so-unfortunate movie. Maybe it's BRAVEHEART revenge for a very Hollywood look at the Scots? Maybe, but this will not stop PASTY FACES from being a sad comedy
