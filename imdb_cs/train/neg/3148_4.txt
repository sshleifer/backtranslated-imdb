In essence, the story of a man versus nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, a lush jungle in Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film really never goes. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later attracted to Dana Andrews, the planting chairman. This plantation is under the spell of the late father of owner Peter Finch, whose spirit flies to the Elephant Walk, which becomes the main point of dispute between Taylor and Finch. Elephants are determined to restore their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built to the right of the road. Animals get angry and provide the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good time trying to keep a faithful wife despite marital problems with Finch.
