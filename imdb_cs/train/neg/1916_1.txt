This movie is completely garbage. Some poignant intellectual was calming down by trying to achieve the superiority of the aristocrat over the working class. Nothing more than a bit of self-satisfied catharsis. If this type of movie is set in the US, it will definitely be a big joke. And simply because it comes out of the "other side", it does itself a masterpiece, wonderful amusement for some Western washed brain and / or brains (some George W. maybe :). The typical consequences of the Cold War, a sort of joke. I would say that if all this Soviet intellectuals think of all these years - as is stated in this movie - then perhaps they deserve all the miseries they claim to have gone through. BUT NOT! because like many others I read and looked at real works created by truly significant Soviet intellectuals. For example, something also relevant to a dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotski's - is a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, true sadness, true pride and dignity, one of the best things in the Soviet era.
