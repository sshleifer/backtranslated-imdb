It's hard to say what's worst at this show: bad acting, bad acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, bad settings for the season, bad scenario. It would be nice if the screenplay followed the story a little closer - there is plenty of tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a lot of good material and a better storyline than the writers could come up with. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> I see that this film was made in "only" 21 days. This shows in inadequate quality. I begin to think that this is the general (bad) attitude of the Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to shooting movies from classic stories in the last few years. !
