The "Brain Machine" at least transfers its own brain to the skip and tries to find out what's going on. Four subjects with different backgrounds and levels of intelligence were selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of humans and the environment. Given that the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them has no known family, it should be a tip - none of them will be missed. The whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creeping known only as a general, but seems to be taking over from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. Call the senator well. There is also a shadow guard that the camera is constantly zooming in, who later says he does not follow his direction from the general or the "Project". The pity that it was not more efficient was quite easily overcome before the whole thing got into the cablooey. If nothing else, the film is a true treasure of technology in the 1970s that includes repeated phone footage, room-size computers and a teletype machine that does not stop. Perhaps it was the basis of a spare movie title - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make sense. As for myself, I would like to consider the name suggested by the murdered experiment of Dr. Krisnera called "Project of Group Stress". This also applies to actors and viewers. <br /> <br /> Keep your eyes just above the general's head at the pool when he asks the agent on his weapon, his head over his seconds. <br /> <br /> You may want to capture this movement if you are a desperate Gerald McRaney fan, could he ever be so young? James Best also appears in a somewhat atypical role as a mysterious reverend, but do not tell him Father. For something a bit more in its alley, try to get your hands on 1959 "The Killer Shrews". At least, the man does not pretend to be so serious.
