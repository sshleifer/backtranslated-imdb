No, I have never seen a series of "Santa Slasher", "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or "Christmas Evil". I have heard of their reputation or MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.). I thought I'd rent this rent because I heard it appeared as a link to the "Fat Guys On the Movies" section. /> <br /> Mothers should be against this, but not for the ooooohhhh "killer" Santa, but for the fact that this movie was just bullshit. Boring, long? even in just 92 minutes, crap. The little boy sees how Santa gets into the chimney in 1947, delivers gifts, eats good things and miracles, sails through the chimney. The boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to witness that Mom and Santa are getting. It seemed that this boy had slowed down for the rest of his life, even though the scene was almost as brown as when Ralphie's father got in the "Christmas Lamp" legend. He was so uneasy, he went to the attic and cut off his own hand. Fast forward to the future! Now it's in 1980, and dirty boys work in a toy factory. We get a monster about it being a bit wasteful and running down both children and parents. Who is naughty, who is kind, crazy. Does it make good two-thirds of the movie to make it eventually? as if it were not a precursor from the first frame. NO FILM should take so long. <br /> <br /> I admit that this movie had its excitement but only because I was still waiting for it to do something, nothing for someone. When he finally does, he punishes "who's naughty", it's as graphical as the "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I did not mention closing the WTF. I think it was a metaphor, but in fact it's just as strange as the rest of the movie. (Take a brother who is upset that his sibling kills and his solution is killing.) Do not open this mess even on Christmas Eve or Evil. Again, I did not look at the other "Santa-Slashers," but this was a bad breath. He created tension because of the nature of the film and never delivered a decent gift.
