** HERE are SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Recap: Mia (Helin) returns home from main Stockholm to the village of Rättvik to celebrate the 70th birthday of his fathers. She is by far the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petren). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla divorced and moved the town away. Mia is still united and focuses on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hostility among sisters, and conflicts arise everywhere when confronted, and everyone has personal problems that are difficult to cope with. When the party continues (and consumes alcohol), more and more secrets will be revealed and more and more conflicts ... <br /> <br /> Comment: It was the work of a new writer / director, it was disappointing to see this film tracking exactly the same traces , which old Swedish comedies / dramas have been through for years. There are no new elements or ideas. This film draws on three main areas. 1) Disturbing humor just based on characters who are crazy about themselves. 2) Pain and 3) Anxiety. This step focuses on the last, because it almost forgets the first point as the movie continues. However, no loss, because the humor that is there is not funny. The performances from the cast are good, I think even if it is lost for all the anxiety and soon forgotten. I hoped there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. Finally, there are better ways to spend your time than you are watching. <br /> <br /> 3/10
