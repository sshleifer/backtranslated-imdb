Still a famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) did not start filming for four years. When invited to take part in a new project, he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to release him to the wrong Latin Quarter in Carlson to explore the work of the supermarket director. He sees the splendid Spanish treasurer Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he becomes attracted to his ability. His driver will never come back to catch him, and Scarlet goes to the actor. But first she has a job interview as secretary in a construction company, and her actor helps her to be ready; then spend the afternoon together with a pleasant time. I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, unnecessary "10 items or less" is a complete disappointment. This low-budget film does not seem to have a storyline and is supported by the chemistry and improvisation of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, and in fact nothing happens in 82 minutes. The unequivocal open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with Morgan Freeman returning to his world of silver spoons and telling the simple laborer he will never see each other again. Was she afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy her perfect world with her family? Or was it a class clasp, and is he realizing that his imaginative neighborhood would not be adequate to the plain-class worker? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("The Star in My Life")
