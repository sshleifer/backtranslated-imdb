Being a fan of a slasher film, I usually sit down to watch every slash film that passes through my retina, which sometimes causes more damage than my brain, I say. While on the second night surfed the canal, Sleepaway Camp II clashed with me. Of course, I wanted to check out how I heard about Sleepaway Camp's permission, but I've never seen anything (for shame, I know). I notice that since I did not see the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously because perhaps what I think is wrong is quite deliberate with my own franchise design. I suppose franchising Sleepaway Camp is a joke in itself. Damn, even the name looks like a deliberate joke. Sleeping camp? It's good fun. I can appreciate the film because I just want to put together something for pure camp horror value, but it's about as far as I can go. The performers in this movie have found that the cast of the original Friday 13 looks like the singers who release Macbeth. Fields require bad acting, but come on. Pamela Springsteen, as an evil assassin without touching reality, has done a better job killing my interest than killing the whole actor. As for comedy, it was several times when I laughed but it was a little and far. <br /> <br /> Eventually SAC II is quite boring and I really wanted to sleep camping. Deaths are so obviously staged and false that you are hardly appreciated. If you are looking for comedy film fame with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If surfing over a channel does over that, check and see what else is.
