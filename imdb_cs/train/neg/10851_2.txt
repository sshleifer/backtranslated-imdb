This movie was made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I'm not one of them. I think it's just an imitator who went on a black-metal bandwagon (I'm still not a black metal fan). But when I wore this DVD case to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic something is, the more it tries to convince. So I assumed I was on a roller coaster ride with rubber boots and I did it myself, with dirty backgrounds. Now that's what I like. I got home and went inside. My patience lasted for 15 minutes. AWFUL CAMERA WORKS AND DISGUSTING QUALITY. And it was then (2002) that it looked like it was shot using a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Perhaps a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a pleasant environment for this ... picture. <br /> <br /> After several months I returned to him (in the neighborhood) and saw half. Then I mentioned not only the mentioned aspects. My displeasure has evolved. I noticed how funny Dani (1.65m, 5'5 "height) looks in the boots on the platform and tears the man's head apart. (Yes, tearing, his head apparently did not have a skull.) I also found that this movie can But after a few more tries, I finally managed to finish this movie - a couple of months ... (Yes, it took me 5.5 years.) So - Dani was actually funny like he did not do it yet, so I was not positive. HELPER from Satan / Manson / super-evil-man and the movie did not make sense. Why? I think it's just very, very bad, in fact they are both and that is to a large extent. the stories that joined Dani's character were about a man who STEALS someone LEG because he wants to use it as his own .. Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> Acting ROCK BOTTOM CGI is the worst ever Stinger beats it, boy, is Stinger's CGI baaaaad.) The story does not make sense And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not us The only thing that can watch you is unmotivated violence and gore, blood and intestines are doing quite well. Why, you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as it may be - and enrages ... and then it's what has fallen ... Why? We never know but we know that this cat must be about illegal <br /> <br /> You may think that after my comment that this movie is so bad, it's good, but it's bad. <br /> <br /> Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one for gore.
