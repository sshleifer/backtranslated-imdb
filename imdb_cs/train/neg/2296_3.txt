"Back of Beyond" takes place at a diving dinner / petrol station in the middle of the Australian desert led by Tom McGregor (Paula Mercuria), which suddenly finds itself in a place of trouble when visitors get unexpectedly. We get what first seems confused to be a memory in which he and his sister (although their relationship to each other is better understood later in the movie) are speeding up through the desert on their motorcycle. It then appears to be in the presence of the incoming as a terribly quiet and sometimes moody character. We know one thing is certain, and it's a sort of McGregor's spiritual sense, his predicting of dangers, and that's - his clairvoyance is little relevant to the story, most of which concern three diamond thieves who break up in the car and who rely on Tom to help them out of the way without getting in the way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, all three of the most suspicious allies are breaking each other. But not in a way that would actually lead to something that would have many secrets or actions. In fact, the entire film seems to want to build something significant all the time, but it really can not. Even the end that acts as a trite campfire story (and the one who really reveals a lot of error telling) is almost as absurd. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's worth trying if you do not think of a terribly slow stimulus, but at least you're in a mood different than usual.
