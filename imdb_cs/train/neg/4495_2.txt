Spoilers like this and Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original Matrix. It was not a deep film, even though Fishburne was trying to philosophize, but it was pretty good, fun and I have a weak spot for the Hong Kong games. In the original, Neo was a secret life from a rather unfortunate Anderson cube worker. On a day, corporate drone, and at night, a brave hacker. Eventually he is eventually forced to choose between his lives his actions - he becomes a plotter fighting the machine or returns to the safe forgotten world in which he began. Interestingly, when he finds out, life is somewhat angry. He has his girl next to him and his companions, but he eats a scream, dressed in trails and lives in a really dirty machine. Yet the truth is liberated. At least part of the entertainment of the first film consisted of "What if it was me" raised in the mind of the viewer. What if they were able to be impossible? What if I was "One"? It does not matter what you are, One example with such a great title. Agent Smith also made a great evil man because he embodied all the fear of the authority we carry with us. He was motionless as the ending and merciless. At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> The film does not fully take over the ideas of the original film and it does so with a lack of taste, a bad writing of scripts and a bad adaptation that I can not believe they were planning to change. When the fifth-degree dialogue, with different long words, drops accidentally, I find it hard to believe they understand what they are saying. My short list of failure characterization: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> The main "personalities" of the matrix are introduced without the need - the keymaster was, for example, a cute idea, but it's just not such an interesting character. Fishburne loses his role as a "counselor" and gets nothing to replace him. People of Zion are not particularly, but you do not really _want_ is the world's run. <br /> <br /> Special Issues Issues: <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are useless and intermittent. In Matrix, you felt that Neo could lose, and that something bigger had to happen to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded is only an attitude that concerns a particularly poorly rendered video game. Fighting on the highway looked quite fake and not so interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing Problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, the combat scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> Rave lasted too long - everyone in my line at the theater watched their watch. Not because we mean good dances and good orgies, but because we did not know how people saw it or it did not matter to us. Whatever the hack was writing creative soliloquy, it should be black business. He shouted, using words that the screenwriter did not understand clearly, and it was a waste of time and a step-by-step. The Creator's speech could have been made the tenth, and with a greater threat, that "Zion exists to give the rebels the place to go to destroy the Matrix." There are too many people now who do not believe, the matrix is ​​in danger of collapsing and killing any person who joined him, and he can not die or support the people of Zion, let alone others. You can choose from Zion one person who will form the new Zion, while I will delete the memories of the people who are currently in the Matrix. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we've got a long and stretched band, and if someone claims to be deep, ask for transcription and try to split sentences, each of which is too long with a few clauses and uses words with brighter , <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, summarize, it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I saw the third, and over what a number of reviewers said, skip it, it will not save this turkey. Reviewers who feel that the second and third films are "deep" should go to see deep movies, maybe read a book or two about rhetoric and debate and perhaps a little philosophy, this film is hard to understand, but it's hard to stomach <br /> <br /> Scott
