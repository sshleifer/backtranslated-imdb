The film did what it was supposed to do: show how the young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity. However, for most of us, this subject has been sufficiently researched and in most cases more sophisticated than here. The film was fixed on a breast that soon became boring and I lost interest. If it was on TV, I would go to the latest news in the Starr report. It's boring to find this movie.
