First of all, we all agree that Lorenzo Lamas can never be considered an experienced actor, barely even decent, sometimes simply miserable. However, in this bit @ *! ^ Tzv. SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the drawing. A veteran veteran called Jack Kelly, known as a Soldier (who is to be as hard as a leather strap and then someone you can trust when he sets his legs over his legs and turns them on the floor) that his family was killed and his sister kidnapped . Therefore, he continues his solo mission to save his sister. He had some potential but still thin. Get started. As an actor myself, I'm qualified to say that these are some of the best acts in the history of art !!!!! Lamas is, of course, alone. Jackasses playing the Clampets / Deliverance should be filmed and filmed for their so-called performances that are offensive to all actors, particularly talented, who never get their big break! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. Prosecution is so-so in BEST, and fist-fight is offensive. I saw more real matches at the Renaissance festival (and you were quite fake)! Readers, Listen to Me: Avoid this amount of money at all costs! IF YOU ARE THE ONLY FILM IN THE CREW, YOU WOULD YOU BE RESERVED! Because of the number of your brain cells, it will NOT track this thing!
