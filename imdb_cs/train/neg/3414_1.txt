It's just terrible, really terrible waste. Yes, we have beautiful naked women who dance and have sex. But while it can work in the mechanism of porn film? can even be hit like a porn movie? it tries to mask itself as a "movie" with real things to say, with real emotions and fighting. It is not. It's an excuse to find naked girls and have a fun time. I'm sure that all these women (and men) in this particular film would have proven themselves in porn movie in the 1970s. . . but not in the true film industry. The performance was disturbed, so bad, I mean, really terrible. Writing was even worse. Can not I put all the murderers? they had nothing to do with him. A very broad structure or plot of the film could be done and done well with good writers and competent actors. A very broad structure or conspiracy is a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar as a sniper. These missiles were motivated by men who do not respect their wives enough. If there were more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less gratuitous sex pictures, we could have something to work with. This movie was meant to be filmed, produced and marketed hardcore porn movie all the time; it would be more money. It is a practically pornographic hardcore movie and remains the only non-porn movie I've seen showing a male penis.
