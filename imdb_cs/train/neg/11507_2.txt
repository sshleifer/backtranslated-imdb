Guy Ritchie's exalted endeavor is beaten, beaten, raped, kicked, shot, stabbed, spit, stabbed, sodomized and abused, and left behind as dead Madonina's terrible performance. Her acting was very much like a graduate of Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie has done a bit of a noble attempt to solve it, and if you exclude all the scenes his wife has, it's the best movie. I think the best acting work at all, Guy had to be soothing to his wife that her performance was so good he did not shoot again. If you can watch Swept Away or cut your nails for 89 minutes ... go to the extended pedicure.
