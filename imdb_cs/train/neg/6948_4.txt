An interesting idea (four African-American women crushed under the helm of a company that has been revenged by banks) is being destroyed by the terribly slow direction of F. Gary Gray and the absurd script (Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentional moments of fun. Instead of sending out stark comments on the role of urban women trying to keep them alive in a world where people are cruelly abusing and humiliating, Gray, Bufford, and Lanier prefer that their unsuspecting audience be immersed in the deep notions of the opera tragedy. It's the worst melodrama. Gray has his actor over every tired line, and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the release, instead choosing to practice the camera on artists' faces. They are actors like Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise, and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is fourth, and as an actress she is an excellent rapper), they need a more secure hand than Gray to lead them, and as a result they pull off the camera as restless and uncomfortable. Avoid.
