big secret, but the movie goes downhill. The start is promising with a car wreck, and a woman and her daughter are burned alive before a cop, Edward. He is traumatized over and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter appears from an old girlfriend who has asked for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to the island community mainly to women. They do not like strangers. A lot of stuff is with Ed, who was staring around the town around the girl. This caused the movie to be too long. Eventually, it will eventually improve a bit to the end, when we learn about the crazy rituals that a woman performs, and finally the ominous plan that is available to Edward. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: I would skip it.
