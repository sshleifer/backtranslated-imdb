Well, you'd rather sit in this amateur hate and try to move a middle-aged mother who has a little more to do with her young adult or old teenage daughter than she would want. She stays in Tunis, her mom looks around the apartment, gets to reluctantly decide (can not help), bring her costume and dance in the local cabaret. Meanwhile, her daughter takes a dance lesson. The common denominator is the Tunisian drummer. This movie is so full of filler that I watched the DVD at x2 and read the headlines, quickly traversed much of the very common dance and loooong shots of walking (going everywhere) and more walking and just dawdling on the x4 just to get this boring, ruthless, low a budget that has sometimes earned some good critical crying. Go find out. (C-)
