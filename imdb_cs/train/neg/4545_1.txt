This exciting fusion of crazy and extremely bad film in New Age may not "open" you, borrow one of your favorite verbs, but it can leave your jaw and your stomach hurt with laughter or anger. Based on James Redfield's best-selling book, published in 1993, this kitsch robe follows the spiritual awakening of the American history teacher (Matthewa Settle), who travels to the deepest, darkest and most deadly Peru and smells of air or something else illegal. Especially what he finds out is the Shangri La schick harbor inhabited zombie smiles, which may be nuts or hardly drugs, perhaps because they are often accompanied by blooming bowls and occasionally shouting from the heavenly corps. Although it is said to be "energy," this quality is definitely missing from the butterfly cast whose figures include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly settled in camp pantheon. For those who take care of it, they are an army, a terrorist, and a Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni gave insincere direction, while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the scripting cheering. In short, this is the worst movie that appears in 40+ years of watching movies.
