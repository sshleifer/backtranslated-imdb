Another British romantic comedy that appeals to the audience around the world. This faint effort is an unintentional parody of this genre - all classic clich√©s are here from meaninglessly devised misunderstanding to run after train departures to declare love. The characters are one-dimensional cartoons except Love-Hewitt, which can bring some coherence to the film. Things are threatening to escape during the discovery of the film in the plausibility division of the spiral; our graceful suspension of faith will eventually collapse during an absurd end. If you are looking for Bridget Jones, Notting Hill's experience, you will not find it here.
