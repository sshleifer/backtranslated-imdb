I expected much better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring predecessors of the main series. After the first 30 minutes I waited for it to finish. Characters are talking a lot about religion, computers, programming, retaliation, etc. There are gangsters, mafias who make hits. However, Caprica does not have the original series to compensate for slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you useful advice when watching movies: Generally, if there is plenty of excessive exhausting excitement, then you know the movie will be crazy. Caprica has a lot of it. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his bad abilities by throwing several naked bodies. It never works, and everything she does is demean (very) young actresses who are concerned and I'm sorry. Directors / writers doing so should be banned. <br /> <br /> If you want to get bored for one and a half hours, borrow Caprica. There is (free) porn on the net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise you will be driving and nothing you can see here.
