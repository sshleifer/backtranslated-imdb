This movie had five strokes on my "hurter card". I saw it when I was in Virginia in the mid-1970s. I saw it myself, so I was not scattered when I watched her. Bright. It was the bravest, the total celluloid waste I've ever seen. I know that others who thought this movie thought it was amazing. I offer it to you: if it was so amazing, what's in the box office? End of discussion.
