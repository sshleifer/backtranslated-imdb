I just saw this premiere on MTV. I have to say that it was immensely mediocre (at best). Dialogue does not explain the story very well and I felt there was a lot of plot. There is no one good character in this adaptation because of bad behavior. I just found out that all the characters are too obedient when it comes to someone they love. Also, love Cate and Heath seems very incisive. They look more like brothers and sisters rather than lovers. I do not understand why my father would accept such a thing under his roof. I was looking at this film due to the few actors I respected and liked to watch in previous films, but as I said, it is extremely difficult to look forward to any of the characters. The performance of Katherine Heigl was spooky, which was a complete shock. She was terrible when she was Edward's terrifying older sister, and I just did not have enough lines for Aimee Osbourne to even criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great he had seen him in the recent past, and although his character was a little fragile, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Eric Christensen and Mike Vogel, she was supposed to be our heroine, but she started like a lamentation and excessive. I just did not like this movie or the music in it. The Christian punk band MxPx appeared shortly, but that little look did not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV has done a great job convincing me it's a movie that was not. I just imagined something completely different.
