Philosophical intellect can destroy everything they want about the important (represented) meaning of this film, but it's just: intellectual drool. This film is a creative bankruptcy and some mistakes are infinite suicidal vibration as a substance. Yeah. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Godard was not a fan of Stones. Pity, because it could be great. He captured the birth of this timeless song and instead decided to cover the music with a guy he'd read from a real detective magician or some kind of crap. <br /> <br /> Then there are endless shots of what looks like 60 librarians who alternate paintings on people's cars. And then there is a seemingly endless "conversation," where the actress was greatly instructed to answer only yes or not on all really deep and intellectual questions. There's a sucker in a purple suit who reads another bull from a book that goes on for only about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something on the dump. It almost sounds fascinating? Well, it's not. But for the unemployed film school fools who did not care about becoming lost opportunities to have full access to Stones, bringing Sympathy to the Devil into the world and rather to hear something English boy read instead of looking at nudie mag covers, this the movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More specifically ... maybe Godard is just hurt.
