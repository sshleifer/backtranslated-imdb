Chinese Ghost Story III is an unnecessary sequel to two fantastic movies. The film brings special effects that can be expected but painfully fails on all other fronts. Actor plays very silly cartoons. You have to be still in your diapers to find their humor killer and remotely fun. The plot is predictable and the development is sometimes irregular and often slow. At the end, the film begins to resemble old Godzilla films, including shameful special effects greater than life and (well, yet another) Godzilla head spirit. Maybe I would grin if I waited for the camp. It's amazing to see what fans of fantastic garbage have to match - in this case, because someone thought they could push a little more money out of a successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo.
