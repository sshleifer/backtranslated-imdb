This movie serves as an early warning for anyone who thinks they can write and direct their own film. Do it, you can not. Because there is no one else to tell you if you have encountered big holes in your conspiracy, you would not have meaningful transitions, a tough, unforgettable dialogue, and you could have a cool Korean legend of embarking on a pile of celluloid turd. <br /> <br /> I wanted this movie to become a creepy popcorn movie, I really did; I like a lot of dirty movies. But as soon as I was forced to ask myself what the hell happened and why, my lord, why? more than a few times I can not take it anymore. I would also like to have someone explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.
