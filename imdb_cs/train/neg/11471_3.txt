Is it a coincidence that the Orca was made two years after the jaws? Orca is not exactly a "jaw rupture", but it is obvious that she was trying to profit from the Jaws success. Firstly, Orca, in my opinion, was a bad film, not horrible, but definitely not good, on average at best. The conspiracy is basically a male whale killer (orca) after seeing his friend and his unborn calf killed by a fisherman looking for revenge. I could not stand to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is bad and, compared to the jaws, it seems that the director, producers and writers were almost without talent. As for acting, it was very average and believable, but the real characters are not at all the best. The effects were fine for their time, and the tracks of the killer whales looked pretty good. Violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people. Music is exaggerated and very loud, it drowns sound effects and occasionally irritates. I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whales (whale killers are not the only friend, as shown in Orce). Overall, this movie was, in my view, bad / bad because of the reasons outlined above. Some people will appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans, so I will not bash this film and I understand why some people may like it. My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for his concept maybe 5/10)
