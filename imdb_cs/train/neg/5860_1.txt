It is difficult to accurately portray the complete horror of this film. A completely new vocabulary must be invented to describe the complete absence of something even remotely recognized as "humor" or even "fun" in the "Rabbit Test". So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: <br/> <br/> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) The combination of "hubristic" and "amazing"; is used to describe too ambitious debacles such as the "Rabbit Test" movie. Joan Rivers and Hollywood Square Producer Jay Redack have hardly exceeded their modest ability to entertain at this 82-minute festival of misery. I'm trying to put the plane together! a stylish comedy with a fickle collection of gags (a commentary on Joan: German doctors were not in fun from Vaudeville) destroyed the tombs in Catskills - that's bad enough. But combining this film crime is the River's directing style, which can best be described as "ugly" and occupying one and the future - is so eager to be delighted to throw even the weakest of them. <br /> <br /> Adrift in this Sargasse Sand Sand is an unfortunate Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the unfortunate protagonist of Lionel. Watching Crystal in this slide is more like watching a blind man walk through the minefield; eventually the reflex of reflexion becomes a half-term condition as a cheap joke after a cheap joke that explodes in his face. I can only speculate on what audience might really experience the Rabbit Test. Cabbages, mollusks and slightly retarded lizards are all probable candidates. But for self-confident, thinking people - I would love to recommend pouring eye whitening before I recommend "rabbit test".
