This film is narrated by the eyes of a young teacher at a Catholic school and watches the genocide of RAWANDAN around him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation of Rawanda's past history and rivalry. Then he jumps to the story as he tells the eyes of a young idealistic young teacher who does not take life or the situation too seriously. When the driver approaches the road block, he plays with the driver I.D. without realizing that it is a serious moment, and that if the driver fails to identify himself as a proper troop of soldiers, he will be killed. And so he treats the developing story of chaos and develops around him. Suddenly he realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. Media cameras can not stop the mace and there are too many mosquito-controlled machetes. the title comes from the captain of the army and says he will shoot the dogs that go around the dead bodies around his complex but they will not shoot the militia - the men who kill people around. Mainly because they did not shoot at soldiers yet. Eventually, he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, runs his tail between his legs instead of facing immanent deaths with school children, promised not to stay. It's more a matter of studying character and coming to Jesus moment for one character than a story about genocide in "RAWANDA". This film did not have to happen in RAWANDA, with any of the genocidal hellholes that may have occurred around the world at this time.
