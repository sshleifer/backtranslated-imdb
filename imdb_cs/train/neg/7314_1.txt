Anyone who read my review of "Alone In The Dark" by Uwe Boll will remember that I compared the unenviable task of sitting through this piece of human waste so that they would pull all the hair out of their hands. Well, take this analogy a step further with this inexhaustible waste piece and try to imagine the pain that you get teeth extracted without new-capacity. Do it and you will have a general idea of ​​what Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" is all about. I never believed that no film was able to overcome the painful blow that Uwe Boll jumped out as "the worst movie ever." But in all honesty, I have to say that Cabin Fever is approaching. This is another sad excuse for a film that had absolutely no valid reason to meet any form of theater release. For someone who claims to love a horror genre just like Eli Roth, he created the only annoying and complicated patchwork movie I've ever seen in my life. How do you like that story? Think about the potential that this conspiracy would have without badly written characters, without bad writing and without all that unnecessary and dysfunctional comedy. The film that deals with grotesque flesh can and should be much better than what Roth revealed to us here. This script has failed so many levels with me. And when I have no doubt about the obvious talent that this director has, I know he was given a great deal of time for an idea that could well define the horror genre. producing lost opportunities would be a really rough game of words. A generous amount of blood and worrying special effects will not save her, and that's one of the things I usually run for. In fact, there was nothing about "Cabin Fever" that I could easily recommend to anyone. When three quarters of the crowd step out of the theater in half, you know the movie is falling rapidly. My best advice to those who read it would be to simply rent out before buying. One tour was more than enough to know that they would never be bothered with it.
