Whoever wrote a "nice" post had to be a friend of these boys. This is bad for the game in the garden. In fact, it's not even a backyard, it's a couple of guys who beat each other on a trampoline. Every boy is about 45 lbs wet and there is no unca amusement value in this. It's just a few bored children who even give the shipyard a tardy name if it is possible. If you want to see some fun backyard, pick Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It performs in two of the biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They have really gone since they got there and professionally trained as "real" for the wrestlers. They went legitimate and got up. I recommend these 2 boys. MDogg is crazy and out of the hook. So do not waste time or money on this dirty DVD, there are "better" back yard videos out there.
