Now I like science fiction cartoons. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I was looking at the premiere and was inevitably horrified. Characters are general and stereotypical (Do they really need a African-American person to wear tiger-striped clothing and speak Jamaican accent? Why are all Asian figures yellowish and glowing? Does my mother have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) Until the moment things become unrealistic, predictable, rough and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities, even stabs, at Astro Boy. Let me explain (oak names for young people): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Konstantin / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay. Short resemblance to "My Life as a Teen Robot," "Star Wars," Teenage Horse Ninja Turtles, "Kamenští Riders", "Sailor Moon" and more. They are ok. Not to mention abundant racial / gender stereotypes. Do not even start me with cues. I'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Do not even watch. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
