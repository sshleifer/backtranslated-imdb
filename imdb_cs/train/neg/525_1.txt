I looked at other comments and I was very amused when I found out that only people who really did work on the film clearly commented on it. I think I hate to say bad things about amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, put it down a bit. "Pioneering" is a little over the top. This is production at a Boston school that does not even reach the level of amateur college film. This is what you would expect from a few children. Stupid action movie without great creativity. It's pretty funny if you're willing to have fun. It's not something you'll ever see unless you're a student at Emerson College.
