Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the SNL gang are setting new heights with sketch sketch format, each level is unhappily worse. Luckily, Chevy is hardly finding it, and he can not be accused of this total current. It's really very, very bad. While it was supposed to be a political commentary on the USA at the time of its release (1974), it is still not funny or acute observation. Sketches are too long, and any satirical impact they may have is lost because they are exhausted until they are completely bored. This is credited as a Chevy movie debut, and I am pleased that everything he did after that has improved. Avoid even if he is curious.
