and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the writer had never seen a horror film before and did not realize that every thing he wrote was cliche and hackneyed and was perfectly parodied in movies like Scream and Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> Among the scary bits is the most written BANAL and BORING dialog. Stupid "junk". I wanted to strangle myself. Honestly, "The Hills" have a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was not necessary to make this movie. The front lady is uninteresting, and I still thought, "Me, really?" "Guy is obsessed?" <br /> <br /> All the characters act stupidly, including the police. (There is no sleepy cop sitting in a car with a window rolled down just waiting for his neck to be destroyed.) A serial killer simply murders anyone without the slightest problem. No resistance of the victim (or door). Nobody has any protection or even the slightest idea of ​​a fight back (or overturning the security lock at the doors of the hotel rooms). People are mentally handicapped sheep. If you are a gore fan, you will also be disappointed. All kills are kept out of the screen and are - tasted - tastefully done. (So ​​boo hoo for you!) None of the murders is the least interesting. Most of the time has already happened at the time we find out. The only missing cliché was a cat that always appears in these films. "God, you scared me, I thought you were a murderer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And then at the end, when it's time for the killer to die - well, let's say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> Spectators inquired curiously and spoke back to the screen. It was too foolish to believe and it was not scary enough. Do not support this kind of lazy movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carrie or Friday 13th or Halloween or Scream or Scary Movie (some of them) to get good fear with some original twists.
