Manoj Agrawal after the fall of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this film The film has Govinda in 8-9 roles, like his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later also has disguises <br /> <br /> He is simply a useless detective to send a case to his friend to get evidence against his wife, whose photos he loses at the airport while flirting with Rani <br /> <br /> Dressing like Sardarji on the plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easy and short it will do it? Then he disguises as a French singer and enters the television to get the lol evidence and then as a maharashtrian (yes inside the TV itself) The rest of the film has the same misconception and ends in a predictable note. There are some funny scenes such as Govinda, which has been demolished by African and many other portions of Manoj Agrawal is OK Music is OK Govinda's actors once again proves to be one of the most watched actors As usual is a tastic fan, although he has played such a role before it fits into all the ups and rolls too good here, though a lot of hyped 6-7 rolls actually fit in the movie Rani looks fat, the teams are doing well with Govinda it's nothing great and still doing that kind of role Among the rest of the Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johnny Lever is too loud sometimes and funny in places in one role and irritates like older Tinnu Anand is alright Satish Kaushik is cheerful, Paresh is alright Tanaaz is alright
