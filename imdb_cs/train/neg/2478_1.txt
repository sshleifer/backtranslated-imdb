This movie is S-L-O-W. He spent most of the movie and waited for it to begin. <br /> <br /> The setting was gloomy, the scenario was gloomy, the cinema was grim, the plot was bleak, the budget was low, the low budget movies were bad, but this had no redemption features.) The plot was more consumed with revenge, slightly deranged hunter than real Wendigo, who has a very short look at the end of the movie. This in itself was a disappointment, for this "Wendigo" was just a bizarre mixture of tree and deer. Everything about the movie was insignificant. The little boy's parents seemed rather lighter, and at times seemed totally disconnected from his son. Whether it is bad acting or a bad screenplay, I'm not sure, but it has only increased my disappointment and boring. <br /> <br /> There was no reflection, nothing that would be of interest. With no real intrigue or cold factor, this film screamed so painfully that you did not care much about what had happened. <br /> <br /> Wendig's atmosphere reminds me of the boring film at the ceremony end of "Mr Bean's Holiday": a film that is artistic and nonsensical, trying too hard to be deep and meaningful, but it has come as tedious and boring. I would never want to watch it again. I watched it until the end in the hope that something interesting might happen ... but no.
