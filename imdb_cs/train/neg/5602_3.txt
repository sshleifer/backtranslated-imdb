"Pandemonium" is a horrible film spoof that comes from more stupid than fun. Believe me, when I tell you, I love comedy. Especially comedy spoofs. The "The Airplane," "The Naked Gun," "Blazing Saddles," "High Anxiety," and "Space Spheres" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a genre. "Pandemonium" is not there with these movies. Most scenes in this movie were sitting in a stunned silence because the movie was not so fun. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you look at comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a couple of times, and that's all you have ever experienced. Geez, "Scream" was more laughing than the movie and it was more of a horror movie. How bizarre is it? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
