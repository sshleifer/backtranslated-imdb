I realize that the US Army was demoralized in 1971, but this movie was incredible. It was a training camp, not the SS SS banner in Sven Hassel's novel. The writer must be the real hatred of the army. The psystrozant, who still banged the crap of people, belonged to the prison cell, and the unnecessary black top sergeant had to be exhausted. These men went overseas, receiving units would certainly think about where all the inappropriately injured recruits come from, and they would be investigating. The scene that blew it completely into the air was electric. Farrell, an alleged lawyer in the barracks, would have an instructor behind the barrel for issuing an illegal order (torture in violation of the Geneva Convention), a real NSA, a sexual assault, and the behavior of an enemy officer. Intead just goes away. After that, discipline slows down to foolishness and the film becomes inconsistent. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
