I have to watch a good movie soon, because it seems like every other record or something is something I despised. However, my history speaks, I can not say lies. Bobby Deerfield, and he's getting big green banana peels for him. I never thought I'd see a movie crazy stormy feeling like this one. Al Pacino does not perform in this movie: Features. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a car racer, just staring at the camera. It's totally terrible. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in love and there is simply no chemistry. Did Sydney Pollack drive this movie? There is no trace of genius behind Tootsio. Is that the same man I was greeted with at Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Go, you do not go away from Bobby Deerfield.
