Oh, cheerful! Joy! Another movie that is so bad that it's good! Or, I thought. In fact, this is missing "so bad its good stage" and goes sadly to "could be so bad that it was good, but they twisted and did it wrong." <br /> <br /> The start is too long. Shoot for half an hour and it could be more challenging. Then he gave such absurd drawings as "the man who sabotages the mission to save Earth because he has all the food in stock and will be rich if the mission fails!" Spirit !. Or the bomb plotting device most recently seen in Dark Star. Guess what ... as in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add in the hyphen "We can not act on our way from kindergarten" and you have a solar crisis in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> The bright relief is to be in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we have called it in this film), whose only purpose in the film is to guide the baby around the desert and call the child's father to come to pick him up. .. finally. Between riding and making phone calls, Jack empties nonsense and laughs and starts, but contributes little to the story he is. In short, he is the best piece of film. My prize for "The Most Ironic Line Delivered Straight-Faced" is dedicated to Charlton Heston, who met his eldest son for the first time, commenting that his son looks a bit "out of shape" while he stands there with his bowel arched over his waist and desperately needing Captain Kirk Corset. who has a bright white hairstyle that for some reason was thinking about Andy Warhol. Besides these fools, the film is very little. The end is a sequence copied from (but graciously shorter) than the final sequence since 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips for this movie more if you are stupid enough, <br /> 1. Whenever a bomb speaks, I think it's Tarquin (believe me, it works!) 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and wants to talk, convey it by reciting a line from a planet of apes like "Destroy your dirty feet!" or similarly. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the female eye looks for stress (that's most of the time), she still hopes she will have the hope of having an aneurysm and soon die. <br /> <br /> 4. During the infinite scenes, "the ship has disintegrated again", I still hope engineers / engineers will throw Scotty as "You can not change the laws of physics!" or some such crap. <br /> <br /> Other than that, do what it takes to get you over this. I looked half and woke up to realize that I had not missed anything, nor had a plot (ridiculous, though it is). So you do not have to worry about tuning for a couple, you will not miss anything.
