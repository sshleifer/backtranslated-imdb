I have always written this series as a complete stinking fest because Jim Belushi was involved and heavily involved. But one day there was a tragic conflict. After the White Sox game I realized that the remote control is somehow on the other side of the room. Now I could get upstairs and walk through the room to get a remote control or even a television to shut down the channel. But why not just get up and walk around the country to watch television in another country? "Nuts for it," I said. So I decided to put my couch on the couch and take what happened to me. What fate had the episode of this show in store, an episode that I remember very little, except that I did a very broad, general thoughtful judgment based on zero objective or experimental evidence, and, again, I was absolutely right! This show is a complete raw pie! Belusha has all the comedic delivery of a hairy beacon. Women are physically attractive, but too Stepford - they give the viewer some real feeling. There is absolutely no reason why you should not move down to a local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flame thrower and send every copy of this mutt wreck back to hell. <br /> <br /> Except for the great comics of Larry Joe Campbell, the greatest American comic actor. The guy plays Belusin's brother-in-law, Andy, and he's gold. How good is it really? Well, besides being humorous, his job is to make Belushi well. It's like trying to make the warts look good. But Campbell pulls it in style. Someone should invent the Nobel Prize in the Buffoonery comic to win every year. Without Larry Joe, this show would consist of Courtney Thorne-Smith's slightly free Curator, who shuddered Belushi with the pan while over his head, while alternately defeating his chest and playing with straw on the floor of the cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell labeled Comedic Bacon as it improves the taste of everything in it!
