A stupid rich man around 1800 wants to visit a close mental asylum to see how the famous doctor cares about his patients. In spite of initially hostile responses, he is cordially invited and presented by a good doctor. And as his doctor tells him, he speaks and talks and talks !!! And when they talk, the loop runs amok here and there, without doing anything particularly productive. While there are some events here and there (and some of them are quite troubling), it's amazing how little and the brain is the whole thing - it lacks life and energy, which is special for horror. Even a person who thinks he's a chicken and his clothes as one is quite tiring. The more your guest visit is, the more disturbing it will become until you eventually realize that the prisoners have taken over the hospital and tortured their breeders. Again, despite this twist, the film is incredibly lifeless in many places, especially when it moves very slowly when a bizarre ceremony takes place, or people are just pulling a set. Only when the asylum workers are in the prison cell, starving, the film has a real impact. Considering this conspiracy, it's hard to imagine that it's boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitative movie have it! Now with the same conspiracy and competent writing, acting and direction, this was COULD an interesting and useful film. You know, now that I think this is the plot of one of the episodes from the original Star Trek TV show! You know, the one with "Lord Garth, Master of the Universe," and Kirke and Spock are crazy about this and his crazy followers. Last note: The film has quite a lot of nudity here and there and includes a raped scene, so be warned in advance - it's not for children. In fact, considering how the film is worthless, it's not for someone! However, with the version contained in the "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics," the press is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all these bodies because the print is so dark.
