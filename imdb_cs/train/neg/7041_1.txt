What else can you say about this movie except that it's just horrible. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons why they see it, but that's it, but their talents are useless in this junk. I think they used double in some of Adam's scenes, like running, because you can not see his face. If Adam was embarrassed to be in the Zombie Nightmare, think what he must feel to appear in this ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but Zombie Nightmare is a classic (check out Mystery Science Theater 3000 first and last) compared to this group. The gang is very unpleasant and over-performing by some actors. Of course, the Wild One returns with Marlon Brand, Tina looks amazing. I hope she and Adam get a good paycheck! Fold!
