No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it's a much better idea to have it behind the camera than in front of her. While this film is not without interesting elements (cage from hell, etc.), it is balanced shortcomings. One thing, Angela, a murdering counselor, seems to be about the same age as the campers. Having an older, more threatening director would do a lot for the movie. And then you have murderous scenes. The budget was apparently too low for most of them to do the right thing (no word toy was intended), although someone drowned in the outside toilet is definitely original. But overall, there are plenty of movies that are more scary / fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching.
