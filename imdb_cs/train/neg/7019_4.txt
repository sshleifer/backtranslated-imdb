After seeing the Smother poster, I knew I was going to live one of those intolerable movie experiences that would take me out of my sight. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film had a solid cast that I thought was a rescue movie. Unfortunately it did not happen. Mother is a terrible movie, but it's not furious. That's the best I can say about him. Scenar from Smother the same guys from the St.'s license, something that explains they have something other than talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor. I seriously did not smile once when I was watching this movie. After a large number of rubbish that was involved in it (as monumentally cruel and frantic as I said that), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career is blown away. However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she brought her predecessor for decades, on films such as Annie Hall or Baby Boom.On Smother does her best effort with her performance but her character is so terribly written she can not do anything about it . Daffe Shepard gave me a good impression of appearances on Baby Mama and Idiocracy. However, he does what he can with his character. Mike White also makes good efforts but does not get too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (like he showed on films as a good girl and a school of rock music), so I would like to see that he is one of the scripts of this film instead of just acting on it. Lil Tyler suffers the same situation of all of the previously mentioned actors:. <br /> <br /> The worst failure from Smother is absolutely boring and inoperative. His screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we've seen at sit-coms.Staj away from this dirty comedy.
