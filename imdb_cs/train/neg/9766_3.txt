Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most diverse and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was the only one responsible for some of my favorite horror films at all (like Edgar Allen Poe adaptation "The Red Death Mask" and "Pit and Pendulum") as well as some unbearably cheap and lazy garbage quickies (like "Hauntted Sea Creature" Gods of the Shark Reef "). Corman also made a few movies that are simply unclassifiable and ?? just put ?? almost impossible to properly assess. For example, the "trip", as well as this prominently called "Gas-s-s-s", may somewhat be described as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are incredibly strange movies influenced by hippie-culture. Half the time, when you have no idea what's going on, who are the characters that go back and forth across the screen and where it all goes to hell. This plot is simple and yet highly effective: the strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally released and immediately destroys the entire world population aged over 25 years. This could be the basic premise of atmospheric, gravel and nail, post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman have decided to turn into a trippy road-movie comedy. None of the characters will ever try to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths; they only take part in the streets and find a small syndrome of juvenile criminals. "Gas-s-s-s" is unsatisfactorily boring and tries too hard to be bizarre. The whole script seems to be improvised on the ground and not at all funny. It's definitely not my cup of tea, but the movie has a true fan base and many admirers, so who would I say is not worth your time or money?
