Annie Potts is the only highlight of this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really upset that someone has stolen Corvette, who, along with his classmates, has turned into a hotrod (perhaps the worst car that appears in the movie) and is leaving for Las Vegas and Annie, the evil genius, who stole his pride and joy. If it was not fun to watch Annie Potts in a very early role, it would get rid of my eyes, and that's too bad for Hamillo that she was not interested in several acting lessons. Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo.
