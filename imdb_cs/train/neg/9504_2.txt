The only reason I was watching this movie was that I recently read Robert Hougha less than a perfect, but interesting, fictional description of Big Cat Mabel Stark's life. Beats appear as a character in the book, in less than flattering light. I did not realize until I checked the movie later on IMDb that it was originally a series. Whoever modified the original run time of 233 minutes on the 68-minute versions available on DVD, it all does a good job. The shortened version plays as well as any B movie of that period, despite many "duh-what?" moments. For example, do we really expect to believe that our hero dug that morning grazing about twenty feet of deep tigers without getting into dirty iodhpur? Looking at chapter titles, I see that number five is called "Gorilla Warfare," and eleven is called "Gorilla". There were no gorillas in the movie. I think it was the place where some pieces were made. Historically interesting.
