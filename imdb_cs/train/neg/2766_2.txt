I went to this movie with great hope. Under normal circumstances, I'm not too sharp on my movies, and creative movies are * always * fun to watch or I thought. I will write good parts of this film: - Creation works. All creatures were well made, their movements were realistic and fit well into the other shots. To be honest, the effects of creation were the only reason why I gave this film 2, rather than 1. Now, bad things: - acting. Good Lord, I've seen bad acting, but this movie has a cake. None of the characters is even close to credibility. It is like the director who sent the call and collected all the worst attempts. I tried not to giggle too much because I did not want to upset someone else in the theater, but the acting was really bad. - Story: The whole story is full of plotting the hole from start to finish. You can select at least 5 holes per 30 minutes of film. Of course, punching holes are supplemented with cheese. This is probably one of the most cliché, not the thoughtful and utterly deepest stories I've ever seen on the screen because I had one serious misfortune that I sat down and watched Parasite on the SciFi Channel. - Dialogue: This is a world where everyone says it's the easiest and most cliché they can, with any chance they can. In this world, every line seems to have been told previously in at least 30 other low-budget creative films. It's a world of cheeses and clichés. - Special Effects. While the effects of creation were absolutely amazing, special effects failed. Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of them are in the presentation. And this movie has no slideshow. It looks like special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show to be honest. Summary: Dragon Wars do not know your time or money. The concept is good, but it is captured by the bad direction, action, dialogue, and film cheering. Wait for another big monster to come out. It must be better because Dragon Wars are totally terrible.
