OK Director Fixes LOVE ACTUALLY Director Nikhil Advani after debut with KHNH doing his second half and waits <br /> <br /> He makes the movie 3:30 o'clock +, losing patience, time.etc The viewer looks like 3 hours to sleep watching this movie OK <br /> <br /> <br /> OK had 6 stories so it was necessary but why? 6 stories? Do we have an Anil-Juhi story convincing, but boring television shows do not show such stories? We have the Govinda-Shannon story that's fun and works well <br /> <br /> We have the Akshaye-Ayesha story again credible but soon bored and the emphasis is put on comedy more and that too nasty boredom comedy We have Salman-Priyanka's story , which is the worst not only played, it makes no sense at all <br /> <br /> We have the story of Sohail-Isha who laughed at you and the trick works occasionally thanks to the boredom that was set by most other stories <br /> <br /> We have the story of John-Vidya a good story in all respects <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But until all the stories come into pieces in n pieces, the viewer is bored and sleepy The peak step is not particularly attractive The culmination of the Salman-Priyanka story Handling with Nikhil Advanim (SEL) is good, but too many songs Kinematography is pretty, every story is given a different look, texture and it works Actors G is good, some stories are well mastered but weak on places Music ovinda rocks, after releasing the return with the BB he actually makes you laugh and love him in this movie despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts his role well, although he looks out of shape and tired John excels in his part, Akshaye Khanna overestimates the change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too much above average and Isha has nothing in common Anjana Suknani is denied <br /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve the prize for this movie that you are shocked Salman Khan does not just act just as if he were in the sleep and that the false accent god Priyanka exaggerates such a standard you feel as if you were throwing something on it, get to the end better Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is ok Shannon is alright
