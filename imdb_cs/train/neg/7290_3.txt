What a long, exhausted, useless film. I'm sure that this movie is gorgeous, but how fun it just does not mean. Ralph Fiennes was in some fantastic movies, the English patient, Schindler's list, but this was such a rent. He seemed not to go anywhere, his character was so shallow and steady in the beginning that he was amazed that his "sister" was at all interested. Do not bother paying for renting this movie, buy a copy of an English patient instead.
