I saw this movie in DVD format. My copies may have an impact, but I was disappointed with the lack of a DVD screen. Let me say that my first reason for viewing this movie was Claire Forlani. While it's fun to watch, I feel it has not met my expectations that I have found from her other films. I was really delighted that Arkin looked at the humorous performance. The other two actors, with whom I was not very familiar, so I can not compare their performance, but they were quite nice. Acting is, in my view, the only great quality of this film. The storyline, while some might say slightly convincing, lacked direction. I feel that the main problem is based on the scenario and not on the direction of this film. If you like some of these actors to a large extent, then I recommend this movie, but otherwise leave it alone.
