A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to a doctor (James Karen) to try to open. It works, but Adams is slowly realizing that there is something serious about the baby ... <br /> <br /> A pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done with a modest script - the basic idea is fine, but it becomes screaming predictable towards the end. I saw every "curve" coming in. Direction is wrong - he seems to have no idea how to make a basic scene. The production values ​​are - nice. Very shy. Gore scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turned them off when a pregnant woman began to sting herself in her stomach) with miserable special effects. The film eventually derails at the end when it is obvious that they have no idea how to end the movie. Some good actresses get it somewhat. Adams, Hayenga, and Karen are all good in their roles and they keep me on alert, but it was about it. This film was barely released in 1991 and still remains unknown - it is easy to understand why. I give it 4.
