Primal Drugs (1996, Jonathan Winfrey) International terrorists will be surprised when their cargo appears to contain live dinosaurs. The army command team now has to think fast if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species instead of reptiles. You look at the envelope and get your first impressions of the film. This is to a large extent. The effect is only acceptable from several characters. The story is bad, the entire film is based on the army and the navy trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film came out three years after the Jurassic Park. Instead, this movie seems to have fallen 13 years before "Jurassic Park". Dinosaur costumes are so poorly made and I think costumes. There are, of course, dressed people, and this film is not making any attempts to hide this. The scene where the dinosaur runs along the corridor is created in a way in which someone seems to be making creatures. This is one good thing that comes out of this movie. Short run time. Only 1 hour and 15 minutes do not waste too much of your life, but you are still trying to avoid it. <br /> <br /> "It's like Friday's 13th night moth." - Officer (Brian Currie)
