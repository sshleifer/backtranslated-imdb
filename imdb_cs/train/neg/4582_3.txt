To learn the basics of quantum mechanics, you'll spend $ 9 per textbook, not with this movie. I'm a little afraid that the money I've spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping to Guyana. I do not think the directors really got a point, but they seem to have tried to do a few: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means our lives are deterministic; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means we have free will; 3) Science is really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is hard to watch and 7) here, put this little paper square into your mouth and you will see some really groovy stuff.
