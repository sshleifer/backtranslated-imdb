Right now I'm talking about whether I should even finish watching this "poppycock" movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with a buried movie set, and that was it. So far, this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There's a buried set, some wolf with a swordsman running amok, amulet and a bunch of bad actors attacked by a masked wolf, whatever it is. What I missed, I had a good sense to send out these nonsense, it's a chase with dunes, some really bad C.GI, some incredibly silly dialogue, a more mischievous C.GI and a hero of fighting paper. In addition to the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redemption. My mistake to keep looking. - MERK
