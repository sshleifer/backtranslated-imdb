Many people like to point out this television movie when they quarreled with the huge legions of Hanks-philes out there that Tom is actually making miserable movies (I think the "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on "Dungeons and Dragons-style," which ultimately drives our young Gump to hallucinations. The story is pretty early in the 1980s and focuses on the imminent threat to our youth, which are the bad roles. <br /> <br /> But I rather see "Maze and monsters" "What happened to Chris Makar?" story. we all remember him as a "Red Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as an unfortunate Clifford in "My Bodyguard," where he gave us all the wildlife excitement by defeating the crap from Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who regularly read "Dynamit!") That they are great things for him. <br /> <br /> And then came Ron Jaffe. The line between bad and bad writing is sharp, so I let you decide what makepiece performance is in this sense. All I know is that the last major release I saw was "Vamp," and that was in 1986. He played a small role like Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and Snowman," but at that time was Brat Pack the torch passed through the others with even hair and blinking curriculum vitae. I can not recommend this movie with good conscience. Be careful to see only the younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace than Ron Jaffe has fallen into his soul.
