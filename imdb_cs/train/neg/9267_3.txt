After the disappointed "Final Conflict," the series touches rock-bottom with this very weak fourth entry. At least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien as he simply transforms and copies ideas from "Omen" (the animals are afraid of Antichrist, the death of one man is very similar to a death photographer in the first film). But what looked exciting and creative, looks stupid here. And the little girl looks just like a spoiled kid.
