From Richard The Condon (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this confused story of political intrigues and assassination. The story, narrated almost in a comic book, is difficult to swallow. The whole star cast, this bad effort is not a complete mistake of casting and crew: the novel was full of the same shortcomings. It looks as if the story is actually ridiculed by the more honest efforts outlined in the "Manchurian Candidate". Disappointment in all directions.
