I shouted my head as he saw that this film was my first film experience at the age of 13 months. I remember that it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I was watching television a few years ago. Big mistake - the acting is wooden, the land does not exist and the film lacks merit if the 23 year old T & A is what you are going to do ... 0 / ****
