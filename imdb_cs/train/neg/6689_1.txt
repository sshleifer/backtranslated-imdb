I can only assume that the other reviewers of this film are shareholders in a production company because it was perhaps the worst film I've seen in the last five years. From the initial shot of the rabbi, who laughed uncontrollably for no obvious reason, it was clear that the actors killed in the film would be considered "level B". As soon as we started this movie, my wife and I had a great mood and we really enjoyed the fun popcorn movie. We knew we did not borrow Citizen Kane, and we did not expect to see the most beautiful film. However, after 40 minutes of the most unfortunate misfortune I have ever seen, we have shut it down instead of unnecessarily losing more minutes of our lives. If it's a "comedy" without laughter, horrible acting, thin plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this movie is for you. Frankly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene. I can not justify writing a longer review on this picture because I've been trying to find one joke for almost an hour.
