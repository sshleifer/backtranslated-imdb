The Animal Farm (1954) very well read about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are unconscious or ruled by an iron fist and empty head. Unfortunately, none of this movie is showing. What we have shown is a propaganda book with a lot of fingers and waving. Animations and directions were good in terms of budget and time, but the very essence of George Orwell's novel is very absent. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how to adapt a novel or simply be interested in seeing the adaptation of this brilliant novel, then by all means of the watch. I just found it to be somewhat average. Only one man has an opinion. <br /> <br /> Remake is a notch below but not much.
