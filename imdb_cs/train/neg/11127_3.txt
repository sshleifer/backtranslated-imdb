I'm not sure what Diane Silver thought when he made this film, but of course it had nothing to do with Richard Wright's romance on which the film is based. We read this summer novel for AP English 12 and just watched the movie. Regularly recording and checking the clock, I considered the chance of a lightning strike. Of course, the sky was absolutely clear, and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a five-paragraph essay. Wright's novel debated about the very real themes of the killer's mind and the psychology behind him. A silver film lifted the killer to the victim, which was not what Wright wanted (see: "How Bigger was born"). <br /> <br /> I'm going to make it short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness in Raphael Lambert's speechless words, skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not a noticeable material. <br /> <br /> ... :: Sighs :: Now I have to write an essay.
