I'm a big fan of Troma, but I do not know why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so boring that I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Some where the conspiracy summit is called "but what Satan does not know is stuck with annoying tourists" Well, it did not seem to bother him in the movie, just me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is an actor who plays Satan, I like a bad movie but it was just boring.
