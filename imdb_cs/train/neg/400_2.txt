I rarely did these comments, but I felt compelled to save the extra pain I had with watching this movie. It's so stupid and unlikely both in the overall story and in details that you simply can not break with distrust. The problem starts soon when you see the government researcher working in New Porsche and going with his team at a restaurant that looks like a castle overlooking the Capitol building in Washington D.C. This kind of life on government salary? Cha! It's getting worse. By the end, when the bad guy starts killing good people, the other group acts so stupidly that you want them to die to clean up the genetic pool. Special effects are pretty good - the money of all manufacturers can buy it - and the main actors were great in other films, but the scenario and direction are sad here. Many people have been amazed that there are some deliberate intelligence behind previous films by Paule Verhoeven (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this film should stop thinking. It's just bad.
