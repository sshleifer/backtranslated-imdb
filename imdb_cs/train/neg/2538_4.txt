In the 1937-1939 Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto's films. At the end of the series, however, it was obvious that the studio "jumped shark" to say so. This phrase suggests that the TV show has gone through its premiere, and executives have decided to revive the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, the "The Brady Bunch" presented annoying "cousin Oliver" and "Family Ties" presented a weird baby that grew only six years in one season! With moto movies, they jumped the shark by introducing comic reliefs because they thought these intelligent films needed to be re-madeled. In the previous movie, Warren Hymer played an uncomfortable wrestler. And in this film appears the figure of Archibald Featherstone. Featherstone can be just one of the most unpleasant examples of comic relief at all because you have always hoped someone (best Moto) would kill him just to shut him down! Though he has to work for the famous Scottish Yard, he shows all the intelligence and brainworthiness of the damaged rape. Again and again, his scenes were outraged and unnecessary, and Peter Lorre just looks pained when he stands there and looks at this kneeling "act." It's so bad that it really destroys what COULD was, thanks to its clever plot, one of the better Moto movies. As for the plot, Queen Sheba's crown will appear in the opening scene. Moto, now more international policeman than the original amoral figure, is within reach to protect the precious object from theft. In a great twist, some thieves try to steal the crown independently of each other. Overall, the movie is observable, but there is also enough evidence that the Moto series should end. With the approaching World War II, movies could not survive much longer, as the sympathetic Japanese figure would simply not be accepted in the US or in the Allied countries.
