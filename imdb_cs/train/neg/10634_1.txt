Writer / director Bart Sibrel based his work here around the can of film, which he says NASA mistakenly sent him. It says it shows that astronauts are pretending to have television footage from a trip to the moon by using camera tricks. Astronauts have been in a low orbit all the time, and the editors on earth have put this raw material in a few seconds of completed film. Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so slipsome that he does not realize his "backstage" shots are actually taken over for the most part by a 30-minute live broadcast (also on this reel) that saw millions of people not hidden in NASA's vaults suggests. And we have to wonder why Sibrel makes his own record of the sound of astronauts in the shot because astronauts' hearing, according to their own words, clearly explains that astronauts are only testing the camera and not plotting shots. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> Finally, someone can view the raw material without having to buy Sibrel's hacked version. (He'll show you more of Zapruder's JFK assassination movie than his "smoking gun.") Sibrel thinks he's the only one who saw it. What is more revealing are the clips from the raw record that Sibrel chose not to use, for example those that clearly show that a properly distant Earth is glazed with window frames and so on, thereby destroying its claim that mothers and transparent films were placed in windows spacecraft creates the illusion of the distant Earth. As with most films of this kind, Sibrel relies on innuendo, unsuccessful premise, misleading comments, and selective quote to manipulate the viewer to accept a conclusion for which there is not real evidence.
