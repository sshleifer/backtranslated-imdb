It must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have to disagree with another commentator who said the special effects are fine. I found them to be quite bad: it was simply not realistic and so fake that it just turned away from the real story. Maybe it's a distraction because I did not understand the story completely. Archaeologists are looking for a "set". They do not bother to say what sets or what is so special. It also makes it unclear why they are looking for it in California, while intro of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. If you're filming a movie that's going on in the desert, really go to the desert. Beginning - An ancient ceremony - seems to have been shot inside the studio instead of the desert. <br /> <br /> The action level has been constant throughout the movie, with no swings and falls, no climax. It made the film look short, and it is definitely professional for this particular movie.
