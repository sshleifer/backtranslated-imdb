I'm standing in the plot when Alice, who survived the previous nightmare, finds that the fatal dreams of Freddy Krueger are starting again. This time, the assassin smiles through Allen's unborn baby's sleeping mind. His intention is to "reborn" into the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her son? This movie started really good because we saw Alice dreaming that she was Amanda Kruger, who was stuck in the room and was raped by 100 Manikas after she was rushed to the hospital but she had already stopped a pregnant lady but then she Amanda gave Freddy again. <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people who come back from the 4th movie and then get to some new friends long before Freddy starts killing again, just as the first dead she was in order, not as good as other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself seemed terrifying in this movie at all, the nightmare was just boring indeed they were not scary or scary at all. /> <br /> The action in the movies was fine for the fifth film in the series, but overall, I think this movie was really boring. (Worst movie series, Freddy Dead is the worst) 4/10
