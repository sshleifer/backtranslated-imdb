In essence, it is an excessive, malfunctioning action / comedy. First I would like to say that I had fun with Wayans' brother Scary Movie (1) and continued his moments. Unfortunately, White Spirits do not even reach half laughs. <br /> <br /> The humor in it is totally crude. If you like burping, farting, stupid phrases, you should probably look at it. When it's not raw, it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film gave me everything that was totally unfortunate, just idiot. <br /> <br /> However, I followed the whole thing because I was with a friend (otherwise I would not bother). The story is undoubtedly thin, it was also in a haunted movie, but at least there were laughter fast and steady. I think this is probably one of the main issues with this movie, too, laughter does not come fast enough. Some jokes are attracted for too long when they are in the first place much more nasty than humorous. If you prefer your comedy with several brain cells, avoid it. If you want a stupid comedy with more laughter, look at the haunted film, airplane, hotshots 1 + 2. 1/10 A completely unlucky, thin story, a film that seems to be based on one idea (what if we dressed like white cubs for the movie ?) but simply did not have enough material.
