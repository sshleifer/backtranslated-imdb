The longer this film went on - and it seemed to be patient - that the more I was angry, I was quite frankly expressing the loss of time that sits in this complete nonsense. How will people on Earth get to such films, or even get the money for such garbage? Do not be fooled by the relatively high ratings of IMDb, because it proves that you can sometimes crazy people. And in this image, the main players are obsessed with weapons, so it's not hard to solve the way this movie unfolds. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how US society has such an obscene and fateful "arms culture." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> He comes to a family with two spoiled children, a teenage girl and a boy; cared for a strict lonely father who barely equals. The cowboy is seduced by a teenage girl or vice versa, and the catchy boy is seemingly taken to the mockery of the deceased. The cowboy spends all the time in a state of unreality and depression. A complete loser who prefers to go to the beach then works for life and then burglars to his family because he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to watch either a sad unsuccessful loser in a world of fantasy who has death, or even see a poor family that is not really much better than white baskets?! This movie is unnecessary <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
