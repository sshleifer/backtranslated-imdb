I spend a few days devoted to Ron Howard before I completely swear my job. Unfortunately Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now captured in many of Lucas's features. How else do you explain his fury? His only useful film was, of course, "Willow". Everything else, including this, is too dependent on superficial junk. Some spoilers. He can not even have a semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, Poor Howard, who was so stuck in his Spielberg knockoff features, that he would quickly forget him. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old poetry: "love conquers all, even sickness." For Howard, it was too bad for Lynch to get more skills over the whole subtext. Shit, Disney did it better than this. Ron even looks at the possibilities presented by reality. <br /> <br /> Howard's commentary is terrible. Do not even send DVDs. <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Cinematographic bagpipe
