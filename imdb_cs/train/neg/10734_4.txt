I have to read a negative professional review of this movie. I think I forgot something. The beginning is interesting, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and have fun with fanciful stories. That's the best part. After three steps, the film is divided into three threads. This is the moment when the boredom is being used. Of course, the thread with Felliniesque babushkas, which make dolls of chewed bread, is at first glance opening curiosity. Unfortunatelly, the director defeated this man to death, and even absorbed a wild parcel line that did not lead anywhere. Bottom line: Two-hour plot. If you have insomnia, check out the bed and have a good night's sleep.
