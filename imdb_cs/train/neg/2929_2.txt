It's not funny - how can anyone connect it with Monty Python? That is absolutely absurd - there is no laughter. That's not funny. Over the top, but ugly, strange just for strange interest, and it seems to me that these people have been on something constantly. Unfortunately, something that did not make them fun. <br /> <br /> It should be given a few points for effort, etc. In fact, there seems to be laughter-or is there any? Humm ... Since you barely laugh, it's a questionable question. Maybe I'm doing it unjustly - maybe it's some exercise. Some sort of art - in that case, something does not matter. But these guys playing women with high voices raised their noses. Come on! It's not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one monk heir Monty Pythons intellectual joke and that's Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.
