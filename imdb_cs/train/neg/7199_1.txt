Why?!! It was an insipid, unintentional and embarrassing film. The embarrassment comes from being out of town where they did ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people make a BAAAAAD movie? When this movie was originally released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and no robotics. It all changed along with the cute courtesy of Disney. WHY???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. Seeing Matthew Broderick making fun of his own movies was no fun. Sheesh!
