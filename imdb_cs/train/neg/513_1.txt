Burt Reynolds came to the point of his career where he seemed to be walking. He will appear with his comrades in the movie and take a big paycheck. He did not think he cared that the product he represented was a clean bun. <br /> <br /> No movie was more than "Stroker Ace," which makes "Cannonball Run" look classic and "Cannonball Run II" looks observable. Save yourself to a few racial scenes that are worthless at any cost. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson is as bad as a blonde blonde, it's embarrassing. If the idea that Burt does it with Jim Nabors and dresses like a chick, it sounds fun, then it's your movie. Otherwise, choose almost any other movie comedy and it will not be worse.
