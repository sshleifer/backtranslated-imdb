I stopped at BB and picked up 4 zombies to watch over the weekend. Now I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the subculture's acting and the sets will be suspicious. So I do not expect much. But he should have a story at least. Stories do not suffer anything except time ..... obviously, they did not have time. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like a new wave. The zombie image on the front cover will NEVER appear in the movie. It was totally horrified to watch and there was nothing to offer the genre. Running is only 81 minutes, but it took about 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie because she was in a computer in another room), it sounded like zombie porn ... which if you think sounds a bit rough ..... but it was not even good. The only suggestion I can make is that maybe a writer has tried to do too many things and ended a disjointed mess. without borrowing and still feeling ruffled. I rated it as 1 in 10 because IMDb will not allow me to use decimal places.
