A trio of criminals with a low life, led by Matt Dillon, broke a burglary late at night. They flee, but they are speeding through the roads with the police who are just trying to persecute the terrorists. Police, of course, lack terrorists against a terrorist gang, a real terrorist gets rid of them, and thieves are forced to flee in a small dip in the bar and take hostages without knowing why the police want to catch them. And guess who else has chosen the bar as a shrine for the night? Incredibly? Absolutely. And from there it goes downhill. Spacey gained good acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but they are all unnecessary. Mostly because after all the characters are stuck in the bar they say everything they do for the rest of the movie. Endlessly and without a goal. Long before the end of the movie, you stopped giving a damn about what happened to them.
