You do not have to write a script for this nasty outrage! Just sit down and watch a couple of Moonshine women and guests provoking each other before the "The Jerry Show" sounds an armed audience! Violent and unpleasant, this cash on Jerry Springer's real program reveals everything a convincing talk show does not show you in the air - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos produced by "police" producers. Even the outer world of Springerland reveals the most amateur action of the decade! This will show you that GONG SHOW MOVIE has a central role in the film Turkey. Change Channel! CANCELED <br /> <br />
