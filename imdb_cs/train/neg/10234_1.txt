I keep it short; thanks to Greg, he helped me explain briefly: Captivity is about a guy who drugged a girl with a drug, tortures her and tortures her, then presents himself as a prisoner to have sex with her. This is the only curve and curve of the film. This is torture as a slowing down of movement. And it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad that it's good; it's just bad. It should also be mentioned that there is a "spoiler code" among critics that does not dare to break even though some were tempted because they are so shameful. Why NEVER have cojoons to grow up and say, "These are garbage, and that's why," is out of me. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these dealers.
