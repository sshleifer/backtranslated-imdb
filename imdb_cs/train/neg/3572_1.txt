The fabulous "Z" Channel in Los Angeles has shown this movie to Pius Zador about six months after "Butterfly". I had such hope for an actress and then move from bad to clearly WORSE in this movie. <br /> <br /> Again it was the 1980s and I must say that Harold Robbin's work was tucked away by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susanna was shaking (she hated her way of writing women), the work of Irwin Shaw captured many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had her kingdom in the late 1970s, and then Jackie Collins came to make women stronger and more equal to men every direction in their books, even more. This is the reason why this work is rustling. Harold Robbin's work in the eighties did not come to the audience. Pia Zadora, one of Robbin's works, was like throwing kerosene to fire. Support for the cast was not a help either. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was horrible to look at it and look worse 20 years later. I was hoping for Pia actress and it was all over it when it was done. It would be hard for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (though John Waters dropped her in "Hairspray" was a spark), despite having a nice singing. Hey, Pia, wherever you are. Hairspray can go on a tour! Join the show. Perhaps you are the biggest story about returning. <br /> <br /> I just hope it burns for you if it does.
