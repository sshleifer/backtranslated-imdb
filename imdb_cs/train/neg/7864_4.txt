The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it will be and no more. Of course, this is not an Oscar-nominated movie, it's just a pure entertainment that you can lose in just 90 minutes. The conspiracy is basically a group of National Guard guards who find themselves fighting the notorious mutant hillbillies on the last day of the desert training. It is they who fight back all over the movie, which involves a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie) because the whole thing is constantly flying blood and guts and also another graphic scenario scene that is nonsensically worthy of the shock audience. <br /> <br /> I would have Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure fun, and it's just. Even though I kept looking at my watch as the movie continued, because it started pulling because of trying to shock an audience with a graphic gore and an occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just fun, something you get bored when you're bored and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
