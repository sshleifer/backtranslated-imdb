Do not waste your time in this place. As shown, characters do not have redeemed values, and monitoring their interactions is just torture. "Gothic" was at least fun, it's crap. If you like to watch the demanding and spoiled poets who overcome each other, it can be just your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete blockbuster, and why others choose to spend more than five minutes with him, is really stunning. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with any spine, but she even comes out of all suffering without respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic place. I also remember that I saw another superior film based on the same subject, but did not catch the title. I hoped it was, but no such luck. Not recommended.
