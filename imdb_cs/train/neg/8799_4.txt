Kudos the patience of Paul Muni, who every day spent hours and hours in make-up to look at part of Zola. Muni was one of the greatest stars in the 1930s, and I wonder how many people today - apart from classical movie fans - know nothing about it. It has been a field in the field for at least ten years. He could win the Oscar for this performance, which would give him two in a row because he won it by playing Louis Pasteur a year ago. My own opinion is that while he tended to exaggerate a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". No matter what he was playing; you were forced into the screen and watched him. Unlike Pasteur's role, I thought this story was a little bit of what we had seen over the last 60 years: the hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress its contempt for the police or for the army, and that means telling us how these organizations are "corrupt". Film lovers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In this respect, this film is far ahead of our day since we have seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts support this story. It also does not diminish the successes of the Zolly as a social reformer in any way. Good for him! I wish they spent more time by showing it than concentrating on one process.
