I thought I read somewhere that it was the last production of the Monogram, but it's true or not, it does not matter, because if it was not, it should be. This is a deadly blunt issue that plays John Carradine with gray hair to appear as an elder scientist who is experimenting with the help of his young disciple (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead back to life. Each time their objects appear, they seem to have a whitish face like marble when it lies, attached to a laboratory table (big problem). Carradine can restore his faithful dog after his death, and mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through the walls spiritually (wooooooooohhhh). That's all she wrote. For ultra-cheap Monogram quickie, this thing at least actually uses more imaginative-schmancy lab settings than is usually assigned. The funniest joke in the movie is that "older" doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" Shayne assistant as "m'boy," when in fact Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did!
