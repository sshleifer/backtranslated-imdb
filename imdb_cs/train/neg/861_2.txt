Disappointing the movie. The story has established our protagonist as Chrissy, the "young", somewhat ugly individual drifting, who does not do much. Actually, she does very little to make a narrative, so I was not surprised to see the focus on my relatives. It's a shame, Chrissy seems like an interesting character. The story was predictable, and at times he felt quite formulated. So now it's a question of when we're going to see Campions, Jacksons and Tamamir's foul ground with surprising film stories that will inspire you to have fun for two hours? <br /> <br /> Technically, a disgusting picture.
