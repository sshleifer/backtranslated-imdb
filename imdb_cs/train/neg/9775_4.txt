Fine performances and artistic directions do not have a good movie. This movie is so bleak and depressing, I could not feel absolutely no joy from the "happy" end, which included the unification of the strike. Humorous attempts involving the pregnancy of the lake are absolutely disastrous, and every film involving Brother Baldwin has a strike against him. A positive note is that Lang is still one of the big underrated actors in America. I give it 4.
