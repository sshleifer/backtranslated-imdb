Oh dear, dear. I started watching it without knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I see. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved the government's plan to capture a terrorist leader's forgiveness of one man who is unarmed and expects to capture him and run away with a rocket package. If it was really that easy. Finally, I found a movie worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
