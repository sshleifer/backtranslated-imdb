What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler alert" and then "reveal" that they used the word F-LOT in this movie - just like every two sentences. I did not like this movie at all - too many hints of sexual perversion, strangeness and cheating. And the promise was out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of these points are for the sexy moves of Mira Sorvin on the dance floor.
