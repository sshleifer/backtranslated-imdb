I was impressed when I saw how a little movie from 2008 somehow won Oscar for Best Picture of 2009 and so went to look at The Hurt Locker. unfortunately, everything I invested in two hours was an awful confirmation that this movie was awarded purely for off-screen reasons. The direction and visual style of this movie are some of the weakest you ever see. when it's not busy being another Bourne Identity Tribute to the horrific, annoying "shaky cam" visuals, it shows all the features of the second day soap opera when it comes to lenses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> - from the worst recorded records. in fairness, actors do the best in the circumstances, they simply are not enough to hide how bad the project is. The whole movie feels it's intended as some "mockumentary" that they were a lot of humor, and so re-edited the best they could to make it a serious drama. if you spend two hours on this movie are two hours, you'll never come back and two hours useless that you'll be sorry for life.
