This movie should be a "jolly" story about Santa Claus and his "magic and mystical" miracles. But instead, it looks like absolutely scary. The two things in this movie that appear in my mind as scary are 1) Santa's look. Have you ever seen more terrible looking Santa Claus? and 2) "The evil crowd of Satan" Pitch is just weird dances are just furiously watching. Watch only this movie if it's a MSTed version or if you like very good laughter. I can not believe it's a kid's movie.
