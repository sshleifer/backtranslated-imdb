had some beautiful poetic bits, but it's really just art-fartsy throwing - along with no direction or resolution. how do these people get through the film school? who gives them the money to do this bullshit? it could be a lot more, a great lead actor and I always like Fairuza Balk, but go, an alpha-rock metaphor just staring freely unable to find anything convincing is so tired and it's definitely not good movies. the director has to leave and live life for a long time and not come back to the camera until they really have nothing to say. it's like a school of arts with peaks, just juxtaposing lots of serious paintings, and I hope you hope hopes like hell come up with poetry. it can work if the director really has a vision, or has a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here it is just a fill of space without consequences. I felt the lazy ending moments before it happened, and the screen shouted "you lazy bastard" when the credits appeared.
