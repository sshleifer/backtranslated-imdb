I wonder how actors played in this movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half and half, pretending or being natural? It did not matter that, even if she was going to the ceiling, it would not change the look of the movie. Brian Cox worked very well. I almost thought he always behaved as dirty, dishonest, in a dirty environment where no one really cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is, what's she doing in this movie. This movie is really bad and disgusting. Who would pay to see such a tweezer?
