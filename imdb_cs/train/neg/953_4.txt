"Happy Go Lovely" has only two things. And the two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. It is a British (Excelsior Films) version of the M-G-M full-length musical with stars of the second degree. I would like to imagine that Vera-Ellen considered this role that she could eventually move her into the status of a major musical star. But I'm sorry that Mrs. Ellen's chance did not pay. Opening with a terrible Scottish number and overcoming a terrible dialogue on other boring melodies, this movie seems to be very difficult. careless. The predictable erroneous identity conspiracy is very thin, with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romer (who is on top in his role as producer) and Bobby Howes (who is completely lost in nothing else), the rest of the cast is completely forgotten. Choreography is boring, but Mrs. Ellen gives her everything. She was never as well known as most other music stars (and she should not be because she could not sing and even did not have a "dance stand" in some of her photos.) But when she danced, it was just so bad that this film, which could make her star, did not give her the tools she needed to radiate. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
