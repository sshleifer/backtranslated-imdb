Sistas in the grove. I'm looking for revenge and bling bling. Besides the hood is a wild western town in the late 1800s. I do not remember any Westerns like me when I grew up. What would Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil Kim, he could say, "Okay, I have to admit I just fine-tuned it to see her." Colorful midriffes and deep blouses are not the basis of the usual Cowboy movie, but they are cowgirls, and they are all right. Now they are not looking for any significant story, and the usual ghetto crime is here in another environment. And when did you last hear John Wayne calling someone, "Dawg"? And I can not remember that Brothers of Earpa hugged and kissed before marching to OK Corral. I watch the BET, so I missed the action, it's a R rating, but I doubt I'll buy a DVD to realize it if I can not be sure it was Lil 'Kim at the event.
