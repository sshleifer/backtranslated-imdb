Really bad follow-up. Part 1 had a lot of fun moments - Part 2 is bad (boring) and apparently money from fans has been lost. <br /> <br /> Damn you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only slightly funny moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, which seems to be written about other characters. It's pretty easy to connect with it ... <br /> <br /> The script is sloppy / does not exist. The director should do any kind of favor and immediately end his job. The game is worse than a second-level school game. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also terrible, but who can blame friends / sounds who have had to work with such an unbiased director?
