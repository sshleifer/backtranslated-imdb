Although it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not true. They have done a lot of freedoms in regrouping events, with the exception of people and the use of sets that do not meet the facts of their life in the 1930s. It was more than just Bonnie, Clyde and WD in the gang at different times, and these people were dealing with the facts they included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight ahead of one shootout and actually returned to the crime. Some events that were shown in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much more serious and she was never saved properly. It was so bad that somebody had to wear it until it healed, and it even froze, so it froze. Clyde also walked empty because he cut off a big tip in prison. I know I was funny and it was a television movie, but even without these factual mistakes in this "true" story, the film moves too fast from event to event and it strikes them more like several separate shots of their lives rather than being a cohesive flowing story . I recommend reading a book or seeing a document if you want to get closer to the truth.
