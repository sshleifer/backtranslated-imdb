This movie is terrible! He concentrates on "Ishtar" in a number of awkward moments. I would throw less than 3, except for a couple of funny lines; but overall this movie was crap! It seemed like they had somewhere in the weekend. Joe Roth is supposed to join Elaine May on a matter of course forever!
