WOW! Pretty terrible things. Roadshow Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor lands in Sardinia and joins with artistic director Joseph Losey for this remarkably bad fiasco of Tennessee Williams. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow who holds a fortress over her island guides, where she dictates her loudly for her incredibly patient secretary. When daughter Burton claims to be a poet and an old friend, Taylor realizes it's time. Ludicrious in the extreme - it's hard to determine whether Taylor and Burton behave badly, or whether it was Williams's intention to make their characters so unpleasant. If that's the case, then acting is brilliant! Burton winks at his lines, including the word BOOM several times while Taylor jerks her. It's really terrible. Likewise, Noel Coward is like Taylor's predatory confidant, the "Witch of Capri". Let's assume that BOOM is about how short the time is and how fast life moves - two standard Williams themes, but it's so badly routed to Losey, who does not do Taylor and Burton to their audience with their most disgusting monologues, the film should be completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has an amazing photo --- the camera might not be aimed at damaging the beauty of Sardinia! Support was given to Joanna Shimkus, great Romolo Valli as resourceful Doctor Taylor and Michael Dunn as her ugly dwarf security guard ... how he and his dogs are doing on Burton's number!
