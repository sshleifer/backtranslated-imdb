I do not even want to call this thing a movie - it's a movie that should not win any prizes. The game was terrible, just like silly scenarios. It's exactly such a movie that so many people think they will take care of an NRI audience, but in fact, they are afraid of a stranger because of their clumsiness and a tremendous sense of "effort" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors who are familiar with English are so hard that they do it convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all the token English phrases that fit into the movie, in Hindi and in the regional cinema for cold spots. There are only a few Indian movies in which English seems to be absolutely true - It was Cyrus recently. Although it was not a great movie, it was a good film and the tongue did not show up. <br /> <br /> I wanted to be ashamed that P3 won the NFA in 2005. The only semi-pleasant part of this waste was Konkana and somewhat catchy backgrounds. In addition, do not waste time with this movie.
