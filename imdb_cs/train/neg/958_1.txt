How did it become an obstacle? Dear God, I do not know where to start, why this movie burned too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the behavior of some characters. The film was too bright, they should do something with lighting, for example, making the environment darker. Creativity on some dead characters has made this film look like a horror in 1970. That's 2006! People do not worry about other people who wear heavy makeup. Most horror scenes we've taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror. Overall Break! That's why I do not watch tagged movies. The only reason why so many people "shouted" watching this movie is because of consensus. How many times do we have to copy the scenes from the ring and improvise that instead of the girl coming out of the TV screen that is coming from the window next door? No matter how you say it, it's still off. If you want a good horror movie, check out the 50 best horror movies on this website.
