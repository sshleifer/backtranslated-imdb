I just watched this movie and WOW it was bad. The only thing that kept me in mind was that it was so GOOD that it was a bit fun. The activity of the characters is cheerful, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall to shooting, to their incredibly bad acting practices (were the bad guys just getting out of the street or were they really actors?), The incredibly poor delivery of the lines, their inexplicable activities (if you are trying to shoot someone through the entrance as they enter, obviously it's what to do is to shoot at the crank!). This film has to overcome the worst written and delivered lines. Working with the camera was also really bad - it's hard to see what's going on in combat scenes to switch camera angles and shakes. /> <br /> I would have voted "1" except I like Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I enjoyed a couple of scenes: 1) breaking the thief's arm so the bones pop up from the skin (that's pain) 2) rabbit drugs eat a brown-fur animal (monkey?) hacking away at a carcass with a mass clip 3) Sonny Chiba performs some impromptu of eye surgery on a boy with his fingers. > <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this really is not worth the time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and concluded that the only ones that are worth watching (and are great!) Are Street Fighter and The Killing Machine series. I also heard that Executioner and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend that you stick with these.
