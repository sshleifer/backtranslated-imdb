I like a movie that has at least a mark of the story. This is not the case in this movie. It is a series of vindicates without coherence. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of a man who collects pineapple cans. A woman with a blond wig never removes sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the movie and we never know why. They disappear completely after about 30 minutes. There is another flirtatious woman who infinitely purifies a man's apartment. There are endless scenes at fast food feeds, where Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is vastly overplayed (I liked the song). The dialogue is mostly food (pineapple, chef salad, and drinks). I suppose most of the actors gained weight during the movie because many fast food was consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is supposedly romance - it's not such a thing. I'm just wondering why I did not hit Fast forward. Did I still wait for something important to happen? It is not. Maybe it's the only comfort for this movie - the scene so quickly moved that it cheated you when you assumed the revelation of all nonsense.
