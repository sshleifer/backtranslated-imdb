when discussing a movie called "Snakes on the Airplane," we should point out the time that snakes are quite a darn important story. <br /> <br /> What we have here are very bad cgi snakes that do not even look like real snakes. snakes are scary because they look slim, crawling and sliding. these snakes do nothing like that. they slide like they do in a video game. they are cartoon snakes. I would go so far as to say that somebody who had the main phobia against a real snake would not find these scary why on earth then would you like to include the extreme close of these cgi failures? why not rely on tension ... all the less is more ethics. or even better, why not just look good first? and then you may still be using it slowly <br /> <br /> one look at what the dancers did. here we have a real slime and gore of exciting proportions. 20 years, we're going to get the pile of smoldering sfx crap "snakes in the plane". when will these people wake up and the smell of coffee? special effects are back! <br /> <br /> surely you could say .. but the movie is a joke, get it? I definitely have the idea, but do it well! In addition to the above, this movie has a bloody dialogue. and the musical and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way. I could handle every other actor's part of this movie, except Jackson. what was he doing there? a man who played in pulp a decade ago. is this career path? offer people value for money? No. I would like to know what Tarantino thought when he was halfway through the movie <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. and it seems that Hollywood offers them just what they want. when I left the cinema, I saw a number of commercials for some really scary future releases, including ... DOA: Dead or Alive, (Next) cgi animal movie called "Empty Off" and another crap looks like a comedy called "clicks." besides, I've seen some terrible trailers, including one for (another) crazy British horror / comedy. I have not really seen the film industry in such a disorder as this one for a long time. I expect this movie to be sold in the DVD section for 1 pound in 6 months. and if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of great-looking snakes and some bad ass that comes out of the samuel jacksons of your lips. forget it.
