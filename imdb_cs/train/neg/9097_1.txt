Who actually made this piece of crap, it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's such a waste of time and money. I hate it creating a low-budget sequel featuring the D-Lister actor and a plot that is so similar to the first. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in a bargaining basket sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To Supermodels for $ 2.99 I'm crazy that I really thought it might be good instead I watched disgustedly because bad acting stereotypes ripped the story and the script from the first. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought -To-video-production was actually a half-decent movie, you have to be cracked or something like that, because I think what pretty much the people who saw this movie thinks what load Crap!
