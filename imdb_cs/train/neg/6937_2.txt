The subject that this latest adman-turned-movieman tries to tackle in his debut (ad) is a fairly old topic of discussion of almost any cultural standard - the timeless romance (the intended game). <br /> <br /> However, exploration (and exploitation for Desi auds) is somewhat endangered, as the usual mood for "pepper, spices and sugar" in the usual mass blend b / g score, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. Creates a nice package with not too much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repetitions follow the movie (after the chef is the main character). But there lies forest problemos - no story! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gives Cheeni Jyada (more) a lot of over-acting. Really when will this guy ever stop? How many 60-year-olds are spinning like this, even if they are having some 30-something? Timeless minds yes, but surely what about this not-so-point point? And the sole? Excuse me, Soul ?! Reasonably good acting Paresh Rawal, who has the only rational role in the film. The director has no sense of realism that would get into all his newly clouded discoveries of a new hot idea. Nowhere is there any real problem or question that such a couple could face other than real marriage, which is just the initial hurdle. The subchapter of a small child with cancer (the first love of a baculae) is not getting anywhere and no matter what little idea that would otherwise be indicative of the presentation would be quickly lost along with the girl's nature. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a nice try, but not quite.
