The story was fine. Akshay Kumar was good as always, and it was the only good movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. She had such a shade, and she wept zero, but she did not look very slender. I do not know why the hell Anil Kapoor took such a bad role. There was nothing to do with the movie in the movie. Just because the Yashraj movie does not mean the actor should take on a role, even if it's bad. He said Ali Khan was all right. I think it's high time for Indian directors and producers to think about Indian customers as a smart place. What we are ? fools !!!! What they think will show the two men who take the SWAT group to teeters and we will believe them. The Indian police are so stupid they are trying to get some criminals ... they took a whole group of policemen 100 + and no one was surrounded by a palace. The action was bullshit and I have never seen such a bad action. Akshay Kumar was a circle of 30-40 cops who shot him ... and he shot them. No cop bullet touched him, but he killed all the cops. Crap. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the director who thought this scene would have retirement. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend NOT ASK THIS FILM.
