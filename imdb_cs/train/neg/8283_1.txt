That's embarrassment to everyone and everything that's going on in this joke. I personally do not care about how Jessica Simpson and her talent, or so many people who find it fascinating. Just like a movie, it's something that would not have been graduated from a film school. The script is a mess, acting is unfortunate and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") did it, I wonder what the hell it is. He did "old school" for calling out loud! It does not even look the same as the DVD "Old School"! Please for any reason DO NOT ALLOW THIS! I see that it is so bad that it is good, but it is frankly welcoming. When we stop seeing the singers who, of course, can not act, try, I hope it will end soon. The worst is the fact that there are really decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this landfill. As for the plot, it is almost non-existent, and so badly executed and written (yes, I know it's another rehash). I very much doubt anyone will forget about this. No matter what you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, excuse yourself for the real fact that participating players are wasting time by doing this bomb. Jessica Simpson is pretty, but keep singing, though I'm not a fan. And whoever shot this movie would not say it on my CV. 1/10 because you can not give zero.
