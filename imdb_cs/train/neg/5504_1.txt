There is no reason why I could understand why this movie was ever made. Why does Hollywood have to continue the terrible update of the classic after the second? (Cases in point: Mr. Magoo, Avengers - terrible!) Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally enjoy, was such a desperate miscastast in this role. His manic portrait of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so undeniably ruthless that he is almost a criminal. His morning, running, grimaces and histrionics give us no reason to look after our character, except for some dimensional cartoon characters. The director must think that quick movements, the shout of dialogue and the "" slapstick had some similarity to comedy. He obviously told anyone who acted as if he had a red ant in his trousers. <br /> <br /> The error must lie in an irresponsibly processed script. I think the writer used "as a mad, mad, mad, crazy world" as an example of a gorgeous comic script. Just like a maniac, which is classic in 1963, it is much better than this flap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good compared. What is most sad about this movie is that it must have been written to address young children. I'm just not sure who the kids were made of. Of course, no child who can not respect himself is known! If they had to do "My Favorite Martian," why did not they add some timeless charm to the original classics? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not lead to a "zero" rating for its readers, this is the only rating to help you describe this travesty. <br /> <br /> One good thing came from this movie, actors and crew were paid - I think.
