To watch a movie that is strangely shot, strangely illuminated, strange stories about these men (and one woman) who have fun by getting bored with them if you want to enjoy a story that does not lead anywhere, a boxer and the other gay, then you should watch this movie. After watching this movie, I almost felt badly bruised and cut out, as the director himself (the film) scared me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which one does not intend to watch a conspiracy or great acting, it is a movie that looks horrified and amazed. Many times as a plane crash tracking or wreck train. If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a movie "B" or even an average movie, this movie is not that. <br /> <br /> Be advised not to take a look at anyone watching this movie. You may want to overwhelm the movie.
