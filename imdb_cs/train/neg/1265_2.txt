At first I did not want to watch this movie because the trailer gave the impression of a joint and too-anticipated film ... but as I was recently pleased to find the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons plus plus affinité", which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (screenwriter " prête-moi ta main "), I changed my mind and decided to try it when she thought that" Prête-moi ta main "would be as good as" mensonges ... "And that's not absolutely. so well controlled as "Mensonges ...", the actors are not as generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as usual) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and be honest, I still do not understand how such bulls have such a success, and it's such a cast ... The story could be an excuse to create so many interesting plots, but it's not as good as Tirard's "Mensonges ...", though it's also written by him, easy, not surprising and lazy work, totally overestimated!
