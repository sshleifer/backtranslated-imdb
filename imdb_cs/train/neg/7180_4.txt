Is it a bigger budget than usual for the genre director Honda (with more obvious sophisticated sets)? although special effects have a strong cheeseiness for them (tons of huge bats and rodents on the display). He also uses a surprising number of American actors: Joseph Cotten, who plays a visionary scientist, looks bad and fragile (but his figure should be 204 years!). Richard Jaeckel, the protagonist, is the hero of the photographer, as the main villains, we get Cesar Romer and Patricia Medina essentially camp). As I have often said, I grew up watching movies in English dubbed in Italian, but listening to Hollywood actors in Japanese is quite another thing! <br /> <br /> LATITUDE ZERO feels like a young version of Jules Verne's adventure and is quite fun at this level; It's really good for Honda to turn the monster-on-the-rampage formula due to its own magic spell setting in this case. The plot includes the kidnapping of the famous scientist Romero? was to settle in an underwater, technologically advanced city that Cotten had invented (the world's most important minds are accepted). We have been dealing with a lot of stupid battles between rivals, but the most amazing scenes are sure to raid the Romero Cave? in fact, Cotten makes pots and takes men in rubber suits (through flames and the laser emitted from gloves!) must surely count for the peak of his acting career; the other eldest in cast, Romero, is more in its element? after all, he was Joker in the television series BATMAN and the movie of the 1960s! Cotten has a blond doctor in his team of dirty clothes and is assisted by a camouflaged Asian; Romero, on the other hand, is lined with Oriental femme fatale? but who ultimately develops the raw material for his efforts (the brain of the girl is eventually transferred to the lion and condor hybrids, one of the saddest creatures you've ever seen!). It looks like this is a 2-disc set from this Media Blasters street!
