It was a disappointment - none of the original nuance. The British seem to be able to make a really worrying film that does not have any of the surprising histories of the American version. The original series has combined both scary stories and softness with great attention to lighting and setting. I have been watching the series many times and I am still enchanted. Just another bad adaptation in the form of a terrible adaptation of "Cracker". Join BBC America or BBC Canada and enjoy pleasure like Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil and then look at "Wire in the Blood" for another truly underestimated, elegant Robson Green performance. Hollywood must look at this actor!
