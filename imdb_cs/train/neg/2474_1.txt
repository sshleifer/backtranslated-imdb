When I watched this movie, I thought, OK, it would be at any moment ... I was wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it ended. The whole waste is 92 minutes. All the seriousness of the party was the best thing when Wendigo, who was at the end, finally appeared and you did not really see that it was so good. And the tail end was really so stupid. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something would happen, but it was a forgery. The worse part is that it was more about Wendig and then about Wendigo. Because the creature would be so bad, you would not be able to tell it through this movie.
