Sometimes I enjoy really miserable movies ... those that sometimes occur when people (even talented people) encounter good intentions to produce film and for any reason prove to be a disaster. Movies like "Attack of Murder Tomatoes", "Plan 9 of the Universe", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate", etc. <br /> <br /> So when I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic, "was considered by many to be one of the worst films of the decade, of course I should have seen it. Boy, I regret that decision. This movie is out of the way ... it's so bad that it's not as pleasant as the usual bad movie. Act, filming, script, etc. It's even worse than a low budget porn movie: the sound is totally terrible, the "plot" is totally incomprehensible, "acting" is ridiculous ... it's a complete waste of all time and money. At least porno film has porn to divide monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a man squeezed a rotten apple, and a "crazy hat" tea party. <br /> <br /> Lighting does not exist .. Many "scenes" take place in a radius or full dark, which is probably as good. "The secretary-director" David Tybor is trying to get into slavery by the scenes ... but the results would be ridiculous if they were not so pathetic. There is some nudity, but such an immense quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressor. I could go on forever and not break all the shortcomings and deficiencies of this really terrible loss of film. For love to God, avoid the wreck of the train. I know that despite (or maybe due to) my negative comments you may still be tempted to see if this waste is really as bad as it claims to be ... but believe me in it ... it's even worse, before I say, and you will absolutely, positively regret the experience (and spending if you lose the money to buy or rent).
