This movie was fine, but it will surely beat the claim that homosexuals are "born in this way", especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman. It almost seems like Kate's gender preferences turned on and off as switches, so this film seems to be a bit simplistic. Also, as it is in common with films trying to promote the agenda, it was unfortunate that those movie characters who had questions or disagreements with gay were labeled "bigots." And it was not a happy medium. It was either Kate's friends and relatives, or they drove her out. This is not typical of interactions between homosexual and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect without necessarily rejecting the choices they make. Unfortunately, none of these interactions were detected by the film. For a film that tried to portray tolerance and acceptance, it seemed like a very intolerant film! Then at the end of Kate, apparently, he decides that after all these years he wants to be with Mace and everything is a hot feud - is that what is really gay? Come on!
