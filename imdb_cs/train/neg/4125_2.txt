Damn! What a terrible, awful Spanish thriller! I had it for about four years and finally I started to do it another night. I looked about an hour before I went to bed. I was quite interested in the whole thing. I finished it last night and I could not believe where I stopped him before. I literally stopped the other before the film went downhill. As I said, I was quite impressed and curious about where the mystery goes, but it stopped correctly when Simon received the package at the bar. I picked up when she opened the wrapper to reveal a laser weapon and then played a game of "terrible" laser marks. Come on! Then it is a great revelation that the whole thing is a terrorist plot of a role playing. WHEW! You can say that the Spanish industry was definitely the director Mateo Gil (co-author of the two biggest hits of Amenabar). There is an excellent score and great photos. But this scenario raises stupidity. As someone has a straight face in the last 40 minutes, she's behind me.
