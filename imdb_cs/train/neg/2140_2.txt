Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is tasked with empowering the Middle East Minister, named Omar Sharif (Neikov) in the country of Turaqistan, which manages US interests. Hauser presents himself as a producer of the fair to allow him to reach Omar. Sometimes such an exaggerated satire may be that it becomes the most unpleasant. Here it does too much: government, politics, music, war, people who do not generally accept society, and I mentioned "war." And that's what we have here - the most unpleasant film that bordered on a very bad nightmare, brought to life. I still wonder why I went on with the DVD. There are also so many members of the Cusak family that John Cusak is embarrassed by the family that is right there or is it just me? It was that the movie John Cusak, while a little offbeat, was good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Mark of what you will be. <br /> <br /> There is too much going on in the movie, accompanied by constant firearms, bombing and shouting that you really can not concentrate, or was that the point? Probably. It took too long to set a hit, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. So far, we have unreasonable doubts among all the cast. And chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Torma? I think so, but you know, boy? girl thing ???? and needed something to take more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what was supposed to be (extraordinary and unpleasant), the performance of Duff and Kingsley was good. But when I saw the figure of Dan Aykroyd, at the beginning of the show, sitting on the toilet that had a dump, I knew the rest of the performance would go to the tank. I did not deceive. I'm sure some will praise this effort, but if the rose is still roses with some other name, so is the mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> Now, remember why I went on with the DVD. I was hoping the story would be a little balanced and saved. Never. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
