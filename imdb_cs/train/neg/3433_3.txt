It's such a strange movie, you can call it terrible or when you sit with friends, the killer can give you a laugh - athon. The strange one comes to mind again and again. Amateur shot, acting even worse and directions, maybe not. The special effects are fun, but the music accompanying the flying demon child will surely be the greatest hit. Find out if you have time to kill. But no, do not try to take it seriously. It is supposed to be a homage to the "Holocaust from Porn". Since I have not seen it, I can assume that it is so bad. It should give 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it gets 3 oversized gore, the only thing somebody worked on. Stay away if you are squeamish, more gore than laughter. Do you wonder if the creators are laughing?
