Repeated music, unpleasant narration, terrible cinematographic effects. Half of the plot seemed to be centered around the value of the shock, and the other half seemed to be aimed at calming the type of crowd that would bore people to start fighting. One of the best scenes was in a "deleted scene" where the office is the principle with her mother. I do not understand why they cut it. The film looked desperate to mention anything he could and Domino spoke about sororites would be the pinnacle of the movie. Fabulous camera work reminds MTV and is not a totally needed or useful movie. Accelerating the movie just jumping around many things and turning the camera around something repeatedly aged on first use. Like directors, they want to use all of these extra shots they did not want to throw away. Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? That should tell me that I will not look out of the preview. <br /> <br /> A favorite movie for the crowd "in".
