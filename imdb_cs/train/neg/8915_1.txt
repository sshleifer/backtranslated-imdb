My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which seems to me pretty good because I'm trying to judge this movie for other people. Please be tolerant of the opinion of other people. It is obvious that writing in the spirit of Nietzsche's work is not understood, so I wrongly changed my comment completely. I think it's really a bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Subject: One should be very cautious when filming a film about a philosopher who is still misunderstood by the masses, and there is a passionate debate between the peasants. One thing the philosophers agree is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So shooting a movie about his life, which obviously includes his "ideas", is something you should be extremely careful about or, if possible, not doing at all. Wisdom begins by knowing what you do not know. Maybe we think it's not a show of the film itself, but the film is not about an imaginary character, it's about the life of someone who actually lived and had / has a great influence on the world yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about tomato, I can express my thoughts on the story itself, but also on the selected subject, tomatoes. Producers are responsible when they make a film about real facts. Especially in such a case and this responsibility was not accepted. Scenario: One of the first things I noticed was ridiculous accents. Why? It dissipates what it should be; Nietzsche and the truth he found. It does not help to give things to the right geographic view or time! Come, do the right English or better; German! Even Mel Gibson got this part right ... and let his characters talk to some crazy Aramaic in misery. Second, it is well over-acting. <br /> <br /> 3D, Assante is not an actor to show Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the facts are quite out of the question. <br /> <br /> And so on. It's a waste of celluloid.
