Mary Lou is a whore whose spirit is trying to avenge those who have allowed her to come to her fiery death in 1957. Well, the film takes place mainly in 1986. The film falls into the 80th trap of strange / silly special effects, including some strange demented rocking horse. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the ghost of Louise Mary makes people bad things and tries to take over the body of one person. Whatever it is or not, you will have to watch to find out. The film is largely boring and is based on a pile of worthless characters. This is also not really a continuation, the only common thing with the first is the name of a high school. It has a mean. horror movements fall, gore, unnecessary nudity, knocks on the Catholic Church. Basic things, boring. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty decent to give him 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
