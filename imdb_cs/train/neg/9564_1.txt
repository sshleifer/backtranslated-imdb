Some people think it's the worst movie they've ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I really saw a worse situation. <br /> <br /> That said, movies I can remember (that is, those I did not prevent) that were worse than that were so bad that they physically hurt all the senses involved in watching the movie . Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are those that want to scare your eyes or punch with sharp objects in your ears to keep from scaring you another piece of your soul. > <br /> War Games: The dead code is not that bad, but it comes very close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but I did not expect any miracles. Let's just say that the original was not really so great in the movie, it was basically just a camp-based youth film that appeared to him with a geek. <br /> <br /> This is all I hoped for something bad, but it could be cracks on my geek-strings. Was it too much on demand? Is it really impossible to do better than original war games, even for direct video transmission? It seems to be too much to ask for it. Stay away from this movie. Initially, it's just as bad as "Oh yeah, that's bad, but I look a little, maybe the end will be good as in the original." And then it gets worse and more, and finally believe me that you wish you did not see this movie.
