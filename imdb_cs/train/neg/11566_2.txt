Maybe I did not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Obviously, the default value is OFF. When the final credits began to move, I could not believe it. Like our poor, but beautiful protagonist, I felt used, dirty, cheap ... The characters were drawn in very wide strokes and the writer's contempt for the rich Thatcherites was all obvious. I consider myself "Roosevelt Democrat", but I would find myself a bit more subtle. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem could be with me. I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture. At least not. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevented me from being "1" was a pretty scenery, a man and a plant.
