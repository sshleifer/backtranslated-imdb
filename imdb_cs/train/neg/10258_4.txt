The country is destined to be by Father Pergad and a group of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said he was cheating that his producers who told him that a lot of great actors are involved) is Father Pergado and he's doing his usual, serious and scary routine. Cast is not too bad, though most of them have left acting. The movie has horrifying sound effects (mainly created by pressing keys on the old computer) and ridiculously thinking - for example, they show the scene in the sky because it feels like a clock at a time. Despite this, the story is very humorous and competent to make production adequate. Interestingly, one scene is Albert Band and Jackie's wife; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charlie Banda Assistant Benny Burton. In spite of my fertile nature, I really wanted to see how it all worked, and so it was quite a pleasure.
