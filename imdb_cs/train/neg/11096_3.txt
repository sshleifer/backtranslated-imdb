I had a lot of hope for this movie because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first film) was absolutely awesome, most certainly a film low-budget movie I've ever seen. But most of CLAIRE DOLAN is totally useless and flat. Scene after scene seems to have accidentally thrown into the mix without much thought of narrative or character. Is Claire trying to escape prostitutes or not? Hard to say. Why does he pick up a trick at the airport if he wants to escape this life? Why then does not he get the tricks when he needs money in Seattle? Why should we see her coloring her hair on what is essentially the same color? Why does Claire accept some Johns and not the others? The filmmaker does not seem to know that. <br /> <br /> It feels like it's all improvised (though I understand it was not the case) and the creators just wore the camera as if doing Verite's documentary. After the screening I saw, Kerrigan advocated his lack of narrative decisions by condemning the film story as politically conservative. It sounded like a learned rhetoric. I think it was a criminal act. I am sorry that the creator of the film as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN would continue to make such a lame film like this and then defend him with tired old "political" clich√©s.
