There are bad movies, then movies that are so bad that they have become almost art. That's one of those movies. My partner and I are still both shocking shocks, you know, staring into the universe and drowning! You can say that the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) had a blast and definitely did not shy. I give the other three out of ten just because of the unfortunate sadness and really bad effects of the gore. During most of the movie, I laughed out loud, so I think you could say it was a good time. Watch out for the observer, the above words do not in any way assume that it is a good movie because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to project a movie with such a big name!
