Seriously, I think very seriously when I first started watching the show, I thought it was good. But the land got worse. The story was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he is stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the strongest figure in the show. How a mother can treat her own son, well, if she was a daughter in law, but she was her own son. I'm giving this show 4/10 just because the first few shows were a bit funny. Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha are doing a great job. I do not know how these shows are playing for so long. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored like me and have nothing else to do, I would recommend you follow it.
