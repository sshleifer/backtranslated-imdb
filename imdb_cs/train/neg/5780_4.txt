I really wanted to love this movie and I followed the whole story with the idea of ​​improving. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever, but it's never possible. The assumption is good, the cast is great (I was especially drawn to witness the return of David Naughton) and God loves them, you can say that everyone was doing their best. It's simply just over and over again. The "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest films, and despite the fact that it looks easier, you should probably forget that you are trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and should be seen more often ... they are the reason why we get 4 stars from us. If you are going to have a "Spinal Tap" horror, I suspect you might want the guy who made the "Spinal Tap" to bring it to him ... just thinkin 'there.
