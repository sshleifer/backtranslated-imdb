OK. It's not a bad film version if it comes from the original script. But it is not! Which part of "In this story there are no women, except for Foulata and Gagoola" did the producers, directors and writers not understand the Haggard performance? I think it's just plain English. I understood it at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, Colonial Africa, the relentless desert, and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. This should be more than sufficient for the weakest manufacturers to work. But, nooo, they have to put "romance" into them. Pathetic. Return to all the bad souls who thought it would be close to the book. Give up. Until Peter Wannabe comes to us and "does it right", you can read Tome again. BTW, there is a book on the sequel (actually pre-quel) called Allan's wife. This gives the background of the Quatermain story. It's a little scary, but good.
