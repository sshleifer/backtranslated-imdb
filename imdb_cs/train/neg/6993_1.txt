What a terrible movie. I can not believe I lost 90 minutes of my life when I was watching this re-make. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer were playing this movie? Mehki Pfifer is great at E.R and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. Musical background I must say that AT ALLLL does not fit the story and it's amazing how you can find those directors who have absolutely no life in creating a well-balanced film. Hopefully, in the future, no such terrifying director as this one would ever be able to destroy such a great classical movie. This movie should not be the first. I'm glad everyone who saw it, tell me I'm right, because I could not be the only spectator who would not like it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 of 10.
