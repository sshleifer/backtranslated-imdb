Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his top hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not that he's upstaged at least in this unusual unsuccessful strike on RPG players. Jokes are out of chaos. He does not have enough cloth to keep the typical length (especially wounds) of SNL skittles, much less than I've had eighty silly minutes. Big William Katt (the greatest American hero, house) deserves much better. One thing and one thing in itself makes the fact that I saw it worth it in my mind, and it is publishing about it here so hopefully, just hope that I will save someone so bad experience.
