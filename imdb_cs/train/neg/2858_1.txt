It must be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were horrible, the acting was b-film and the effects were free of Nintendo 64 qualified. You would think that it will make a little more effort. Of course it's Scifi channel, so you should expect it to be low, but this is a cake. Shit, I'm still laughing. So, when you do not believe in the movie, this is good. <br /> <br /> Even though there are some "well-known" actors and actresses, it's hard for me to believe they do not realize that the quality of this film is worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> Graphics could have been good in the sixties or even early 70's, but it came, that's 2009! I will not earn spoilers, let's say if you played "Jurassic Park" on Nintendo 64, you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie. Definitely not worth it in 2 hours it took you to sit
