I know actors and actors like to try different kinds of movies - hey, nobody wants to get in the format - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (best birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should know better than this. "Angels in the Outfield" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something comes in magically and saves the day. Do I even have to say how it ends? The film is just a low escape (examples of high leakage are various sci-fi films of the 1950s). If these films had a political undertone - or at least they offered us a new look at life - then they would be fine; this is useless. Far closer to the devil than the angel. Also played by Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey and I suspect they do not want to emphasize in their biographies.
