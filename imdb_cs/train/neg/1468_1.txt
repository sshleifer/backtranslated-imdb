A beautiful cast was wasted on a worthless screenplay. Ten or so adults reunited in the summer camp they attended as a teenager. Could it be a million years? It's just fantasy and boredom. Are they teenagers again? Repeat their jokes, games, good times? They may try but in the end the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any tension? Terror? Comedy? None of the above. How anyone can be amused by this disgrace is behind me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
