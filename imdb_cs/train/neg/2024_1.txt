Try to make a success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 versus 100 comes this lame eloquent experience - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy "dancers" shimmy out in shiny red dresses. The contestant gets the beginning of a phrase, such as "Which Team Lost ..." with three choices, A, B or C, each who completes the phrase. The contestant has three options to answer one of these three options. William Shatner, on his unpleasant smarts, asks the competitor if he wants to "block the answer," and when the competitor says yes, he selects a "dancer" to whom he calls "Show me money!" Opens the scroll that has the amount, and if his answer is true, he adds this amount to his winnings; if wrong, the amount is deducted. (Theoretically, it is possible that the competitor will actually end up on this terrible debacle thanks to the Sacker's money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if the contestant selects a girl who has the dirty scroll but is correct, nothing is wrong. If he responds wrong, the game goes to sudden death and has to answer another question. If it gets wrong, nothing will be left. Before going to the commercial, Shatner yelling, "dancing" and Shatner, the contestant and 12 dancers shaking booty. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for "the last dance" and everyone shakes them. <br /> <br /> I give this show 6 episodes the most, at this time hopefully this pathetic apologize for the game. (It could have been even worse - they could somehow support Cuba Gooding Jr as a host, although I think he is a better dancer than "Shat" as they call it today.) <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess What - I was wrong! It only took 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
