Fairly dim. "Reversals" are quite predictable if you've seen some movies over the past ten years, and a few interesting parts (where someone uses contextual tracks to make decisions) are scarce and lack a lot of punch because "secrets" have already been mentioned before these are explained tracks. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> The acting is fairly decent. The story is simply not very interesting. The whole "upward" assumption becomes astral projection (not fun). <br /> <br /> The operating scene is initially tense, a little uncomfortable, but then it becomes totally banal. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible but unforgettable. Terrence Howard, the least interesting role I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Boring, overall.
