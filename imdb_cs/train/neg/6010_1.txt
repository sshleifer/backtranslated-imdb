This movie is perhaps one of the most challenging movies of the year 2000 I've seen! Especially music can not create tension when people suddenly disappear. Such aspects, such as martial law, do not deal with the necessary gravity. The story itself has problems: the UN could never take over the world because the United States would not allow it, but countries such as China, Russia, Japan, etc. They would not even have. It would also play against someone trying to take over the world like Nicholas Carpathia. It reminds me of James Bond movies, but they have bigger action! The film is, of course, intended for Christians and Christians only, and they may like it. Since I can not count on a Christian, I find the whole idea absurd. This prophecy also appears to be, if true, dangerously close to another prophecy of the cult to the end of the world. Why are we afraid of such opportunities when we can achieve the best possible life on Earth
