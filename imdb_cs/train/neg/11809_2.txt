He bought this movie in a basket at Rogers Video for $ 2. I really like a good movie B and it seemed to me that it looked good. The film is quite a clich√© "1970" and is quite groovy for it. Unfortunately, the story is hard to watch and there's not much going on in the movie. In fact, I turned it off after 45 minutes of watching and after a week I figured I should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was. The movie has good points in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait ... for them. <br /> <br /> If you are in B movie, it may be just for you, just notice that the movie is slow and it's not really happening and I have not mentioned much story line ... <br /> <br />
