AntiTrust could be a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director has released his best scenes. In the scenes he's in, he's just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-plot that is simulated on a partial conspiracy in "Get Carter," but in Get Carter it handles the plot better. (I blame the director) The director's homage to Hitchcock was nasty. (It's a scene that Ryan Philippa's character realized he might not be able to trust Char Tim Robin, at least I think it's a homage to Hitchcock, there are scenes on the DVD that have been cut out, I think the director should believe in his instincts and do not listen to an experienced audience.
