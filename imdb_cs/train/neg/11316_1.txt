The Knights were just the beginning of the series, pilot, he could say. The plot (I really should not say there was no plot) was not logical at all and there were many mistakes like [warning, I sum up the plot]: At the start of the movie somebody said there were only a few cyborg (bad), but after climax, Nea found out that there is much more. And it was said that cyborg was hard to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill her with one blow. The film was just a clean kick. I was not surprised to find out that the leading star is a kickboxer. <br /> <br /> There was one positive thing throughout the movie: watching it was a lot of laughter and talking about it with your friends. I recommend watching her if you need laughter.
