This is a bad film according to any standard. The story at Match Point had a certain intrigue and direction and writing a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixes her own culture with classic English murder and examines what to do with it). <br /> <br /> But Scoop has nothing to do with it. It is badly written, the two wires are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest. The genre that spoofs requires at least some subplot with witty explanation and ties-why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in locked rooms?). Allen is a wonderful and humorous version of the various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Jade Scorpion, etc.) that has given us so much pleasure over the years. Even the Hollywood end had a great central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left this time.
