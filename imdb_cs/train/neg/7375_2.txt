This movie was heavily dimmed by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or how should I tell Steven So-dull! Just as before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to rewind his own lines, letting someone take his voice behind shots when the sound had to be looped. Several movies before he did that, but I do not think so! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, everything said, this movie is pretty bad. It would be much better without Seagal, who became the cartoon himself. Do not bother. Anything that's behind is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and the Seagal movie. What takes me so long to realize it ?!
