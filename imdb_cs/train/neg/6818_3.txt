In this movie, joe pesci slams dunks basketball. joe pesci ... and be consistent, the rest of the script is not as believable. pesci is a funny guy who saves this film from sinking in the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles are bad enough. assembling tothe totally body, instead of the man being an archetypal villain, looked more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there is a token piece that is assigned to a dog as a girlfriend or something like that ... I do not even remember ... it was forgotten. Everyone who evaluates this film over 5 or 6 is a paid member of a movie studio trying to reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those millions of media assistants who can not criticize effectively (you know, people who feel wrong if give anything below 6) <br /> <br /> Stay away ... far. and the shame of a comedy in the center where I saw this movie. they usually choose better.
