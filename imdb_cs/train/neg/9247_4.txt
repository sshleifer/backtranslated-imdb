"Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay film. While this group of films is more observable than their 1914 counterparts, it seems that this group is a bit below average. The Gag, with the storage storage storage storage and the heavy fortune that Charlie woke from a dream in which he caressed the lady's head, just to stroke the mop head he used as a quill pillow, are both classic Chaplin moments. Both are ironically the beginning and the end. The center is filled with a fight with a competitive co-worker and arms bank to get a girl. Mop is probably the greatest physical backing of this film and Charlie uses it for a professional comedic effect, though it's the intention of its character or not. Mop seems to be Charlie's alter-ego, who does the things he wants but can not with his own two hands. Interesting things, but it's better.
