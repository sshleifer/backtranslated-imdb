I started watching this movie and I expected some barely acceptable Hammer horror film wannabe ... and I was not far away. There are lots of gore seen, and a lot of chasing, but the other half of the film is a few ironic twists. The holy cow, in fact, they thought a little about the story and did not fall into the predictable things that were originally expected. And let me say, some of the "untaxed" nudity was not so unsuitable as it suits the story and setting. <br /> <br /> Do not do me wrong, it's still a bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's shadow smarter than really scary pieces like Mesa Lost Women and Robot Monster.
