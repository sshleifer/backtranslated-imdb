There are a few things wrong in this movie - Brenda Song is one of them. I do not believe the girl is a miserable actor - honestly not. I believe he has the wrong lines. It's just "the vain, rich girl", and although it's fun in the TV shows she's playing, I can not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> What you should expect when I sit down and watch this movie. The movie was not so awful ... at first. Wendy's reaction to Shen was absolutely natural. How would you feel if a man who claimed to be a reincarnated monk pursued you by commanding you to wear a medallion and insist that you must fight the "great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is a fiction, but it still has its foundation in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in Wendy's family were women. Correct me when I'm wrong, but I doubt the monks would be okay with it. Of course, they might have done it, but they did not provide any explanation. In this way, it was only possible to contribute to many attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> But do not forget to go on. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the movie continues. Yes, he is a teenager, and it is almost a return home - I mean who wants to fight evil when returning home? The problem is that when "evil" begins to manifest, Wendy does not look as awesome as it should be. She is extremely carefree - even for someone like her. She still does not care about her training. I use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will take over and all good will be gone." Wendy: "Hey, talk about pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, let's go Wendy. Let's also dance if you should be properly trained. Shen naturally allows her, but his character has an excuse. Better that he works with her than he does not, and she does not train at all and lets them both kill. Oh, talk about it. Shen also told Wendy that it was his fate if he died in the battle, as well as her grandmother (I suppose that part). This makes Wendy's acts more unforgivable. <br /> <br /> As the writer has, Wendy returns home and this "great battle" is exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you even have to guess? Yes, he finally goes to battle, because when he tries to leave home, the monks (who caught Shen in the body of her coach and teacher because she "feels strangely fighting the old man") informed her that Shen went to battle alone, and so she went to save. <br /> <br /> At first we see some decent fighting, that's really fun. Finally, great evil comes out of Wendy's body for returning home and creates a real embodiment of the fractured body parts of old warriors. Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets all "panicky". Then Shen goes and protects her from this guy - forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name - and he can kill himself. Wendy captures Shen and makes his long descent from an unbearably high strike <br /> <br /> <br /> He cries out the name of that article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy became too far, too fast. No, I will not let it be justified because it was her "destiny" and she had "strength inside". Since he learned healing? No, worst ... why could she ever raise people? So Shen is resurrected from the dead. Then Wendy and he fight against the guy. <br /> <br /> Lose the way easily. The worst part is when he jumps together, kicks him at the same time, and is forever out. The monks greet Wendy for her sacrifice. Two Things, No. 1: Does the writer and director of the screenplay say that the battle needs a little more "softness"? # 2: What a sacrifice? The fact that she did not go home? Because the girl did not break the sweat or even bleed. I mean, come on, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Hello ... continues. I know it sounds maybe I should give the film one, based on my remarks. Part of the criticism you need to know, however, breaks something down. You do not necessarily try to look bad, but if it is there, you pay attention to it. This movie has a lot of bad, but something fun happens when you never really expect something to be too big in the first place. So, I think it was okay. Not that I'm not saying it's wrong, it would stop if someone watched it.
