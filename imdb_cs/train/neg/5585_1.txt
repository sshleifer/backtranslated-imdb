The role of characters in the movie is a problem. Man to Human shows a British anthropologist who kidnapped two pygmies and brought them to Scotland and then realized that they were not animals or underwhelmed, but actually equal themselves. The problem is the role of the pygmy in the movie - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet have a small, stereotypical role in the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) ends up as the hero of the film, because he "drives" pygmies ... No idea of ​​how the two hostages feel from their view of their suffering ... I think it is a shallow film with a one-sided fundamental racist view ... never failed to resign from the view of "white men"
