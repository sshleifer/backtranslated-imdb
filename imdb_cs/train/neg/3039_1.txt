I can always say when something happens to be a hit. I see it or hear it, and get a good feeling. I did not feel good when I was watching the preview. In this movie I was not excited and I do not even know it is rated as one of the worst 100 films. I was actually true. The first thing that fired me was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebony (I am by the way black), but for the film they could use a better title and this time use a title that does not have a bad grammar. I've heard dialogue, seen acting, and all I could do was face. I also think the theme of the dance film is exaggerated. At least "You delivered" was, in my opinion, better. Even the soundtrack did not dare me.
