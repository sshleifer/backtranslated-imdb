I read somewhere where this film should be remake of Noor's 1949 film, "Criss Cross". I found it disappointing, but it was even better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "neo-noir" from his day and it's in color, two things that purists would have disabled his movie status. <br /> <br /> The biggest negative thing was not cinematography (it was okay), but a confused story. Hey, some of Dashiel Hammet's stories from the 1940s were similar, but some of them were not interested either. The filmmakers did not help the situation by recalling the memories that looked like every three minutes. No wonder this was a story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that there is so much confusion in a 45-minute tag that no one cares about. I know I'm not.
