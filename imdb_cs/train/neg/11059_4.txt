"Dahmer" is an interesting film, though I would not use "horror" or "thriller" to describe it. He's rather a tiny figure who seems to be a special assassin killer. Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who murmured, murdered and spread his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney, played well by Artel Kayar. <br /> <br /> Rodney is a more interesting character: fascinated by Dahmer and once escaped the attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives the second attack. I think the film is incoherent because it briefly portrayed Dahmer's formative years as events could create the human monster we see on the screen, and we do not give any opinion on Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies for his victims. <br /> <br /> The roles are well playable, but the story is thin.
