This movie is a waste of the film. Do you think the mission map of a military mission plan will be placed on a bench stand on bright daylight for everyone with a telescope or a zoom lens camera to see? It happened in this movie. Do you think that a DEAF person would actually be included in the active army in Europe during the Second World War to serve in the "black" unit ... cooking, supply, funeral details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you think the black (and allegedly intelligent) officer would choose this same DEAF K.P. be part of an active combat mission to protect the dam before the allies have come to destroy Germany? It happened in this movie. Would you like to be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that a German plane was coming from behind to kill him and kill him? It happened in this movie. Would it surprise you that a group of US soldiers who are holding a barn at a farm on which the Germans would have lost their emotions when looking at German soldiers who were only 50 years old? They did this in this film and left all possible barn entrances that the Germans could check completely unprotected. Would you believe that over the wavelengths and in clear English, the captain mentioned the rank of the general, if not his name, as the person he spoke with, and that the general, in plain English over the open waves, said that the dam must protect another day? Maybe they should send ambassadors to tell him what direction the US attack would be, just to make the Germans a little easier. This so-called movie should be placed on the list of top 50 worst movies. If it was, I'm sure it will be good. Watch it at your own risk.
