This is almost the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've ever seen. I say it quite a lot because I also saw a soldier playing a villain ... but from what I heard is not considered a Jason Scott Lee movie. That's it. And if it is any indicator of the quality of these films, I do not see any of the others. Lee is basically acceptable as a martial artist ... like leadership, he's terrible. He will be struggling with random, insignificant characters after several minutes of film, probably because the scriptwriter could not find out how to stretch the film to the minimum required run time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and apart from the fact that he is demonstrably crazy, he barely looks like a villain at all. Most of the movie is basically Lee persecution of villains in time ... or maybe it's the opposite. I can not say for sure ... and I certainly would not have noticed it again to make sure. The effects are not really horrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill and kill Hitler. Somehow the film also touches an interesting idea. The story is too complicated for your own good. Stimulation is wrong. I can not think of one positive thing she could say about this movie ... I really can not. It's just too formal and unnecessary. If I only had a time machine, I could go back and prevent this movie ever being made ... no, it does not matter. I just hope that the smallest fragile mind will be exposed. Listen to negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to the fans of Lee, and no one else. If you are looking for a good movie ... well, that's not the case. That's for sure. 1/10
