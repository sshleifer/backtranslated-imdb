This is one of those cheaply produced films. The characters seem to lose all sense. The assumption of the story, kidnapping the son of a boy's father is very good. But the story only seems like a joke belief. Whenever your mother is advised not to do anything, you know well that she will. It's a bit attractive and it's not worth browsing.
