I thought a horror film with Orson Welles would be weird about it. Necromanita was certain, but it was a little weird that it was good. The film really has a scary feeling because it deals with the Satanist / Witches contract in a small town and the effort of a young woman to escape them. It seems that the director deliberately tries to fool audiences with flashes and dreams. There are too many unanswered questions to the final. What is worse, as the story is so confused, it is very difficult for someone of the characters. It seems strange that Welles agrees with this film, especially because he does not have much work to do. Perhaps one day they will come out of this film with a tape of outputs and bloopers. Now it would be really fun!
