If you saw Sholae in 1975, do not look at this movie. If you have not seen Sholay since 1975, go WATCH IT. But do not look at this movie. This film contains all the ingredients that might be bad when preparing a Sholaye remake. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain as best as possible (probably only 40 minutes of a reel that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just play Amitabh with his character, it would still be worth your watch. But like Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely secular and the only reason I think he has occupied Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitab of his young days. Sushmita Sen keeps well, with grace and make-up. But the award for "Best Performance and Every Role to this Day" must go to Nisha Kothari. She will be able to worsen her acting at a level that even college drama would overcome her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take it to this movie. :)
