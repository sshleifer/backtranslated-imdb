You realize you've watched EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing an Islander, but you think that after looking at the rushed, smelly heroes who walk through the bush with the egg on a spoon for half a decade, you simply commit to something a little more original (and interesting ). And I'm not even talking about the validity of the concert I'm interested in talking about. It's hard to break the mistrust in that "Bushy Bill" eat a rat when the entire crew of producers and cameramen is placed in a conditioned bio-dome that is changing and blinking mochcinno with moxies. <br /> <br /> What is the appeal here? I do not care about these people or their sad life. I just do not get it. But if you find yourself fascinated by hairy, unapproved people, I suggest that you turn off the TV and just go to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat. They are called CROSS PEOPLE, and you can sit for free and awaken your extraordinary ability to get a variety of cigarettes from a large number of waste cans, which eventually hits a "plaque" and creates a home-like Cancer. Frankenstein - go ahead and ask people to change the food when the "Aqua Velva" smell in their breath is enough to suggest something else. And the best part? Like the Survivor, every week one member of the tribe "Leaves" "Island" when they are unceremoniously sent to a local institution when a terrifying untreated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks on speed! Now it's fun!
