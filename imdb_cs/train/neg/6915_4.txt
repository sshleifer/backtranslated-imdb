This is one of those movies I remember being in the tin years before anything is happening. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not very good either. Alec Baldwin was quite good, but the plot is at best the smallest. Cast is pretty good at what's given, but again you're just as good as a script. Baldwin drove it, though I could swear she did not do everything, I thought I was reading somewhere, or a lot of reconstructions were not bad, but she definitely had some potential. Though his work on "30 Rock" is nothing but genius and should be busy for a while. I just hope the show will be laughing at La Seinfeld, but perhaps not so long. It was 9 years. So if you want to see a movie you can not get too much of, but it will not really hate it, it's for you. I do not remember the last time the movie was packed until it was finally released and only on DVD. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again because their excellent, but not too many people saw "The Edge". Now pick up the great movie for fun.
