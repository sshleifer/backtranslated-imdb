Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) kills his child and his wife furiously invades the home invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) is trying to help him in post-traumatic stress. Then Archer finds himself in a confrontation with a man (Til Schweiger), who hung up and nodded in a chair. He told him it was the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and could do what he liked. And there is a large assortment of tools to help him ... <br /> <br /> The film is first interesting (and shows the real limitations regarding blood and gore) but it becomes stupid for a minute and has some very unlikely plot fences and revolutions. It all ended with the last step that was so old and stupid that I was shocked that someone really thought she was going to use it. How did these talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer get involved in such bullshit as it is with me. This gets three stars for acting, but stupid conspiracy and really incredible interventions make them sit down.
