Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnnn! : = 8O <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <br /> <br /> Oh, excuse me, sorry, you fell asleep there for crazy. Where was I? Oh yes, "The Projected Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz <= 8. </ p> <br /> Ooops, sorry. Yes, "Designed Man". Well, it's crazy sci-fi yawning about nothing. Some man with an orange head will show up on the laser, he'll get to death. Eventually it will disappear, end. The movie is not interesting either. Misty, crushing, stingy, stiff and deeply boring, "Designed Man" is 77 fixed minutes, nothing in the game. Boring as drinking water. Boring as dust in your ears. Hollow like Ethan Hawke - we're really talking, people! But wait for our bored cousins ​​from the whole puddle, MooCow now makes the right review for "The Projected Man": <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ .. <= 8.
