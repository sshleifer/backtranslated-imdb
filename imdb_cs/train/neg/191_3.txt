... to live in Montana, and not to live at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "The river is going through it" is definitely a well-shot film from a cinematic stand-point. Great landscape, Redford works well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there's any story at all). <br /> <br /> I am sorry that the narrator / author who is as dry, narrow-minded as his father, the preacher. When controlled, he does not manage his own life, he lets himself watch his brother, who is also in a cage in a small city environment and loses his life. The author never fails to motivate his brother, but at least he realizes that he is missing the smallest number of homosexuals. Everything is fishing, where he watches in the style of his father and the old man. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it's possible from the beginning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
