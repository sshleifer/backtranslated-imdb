I bought this DVD because it has a curry in it and the mpaa rating says; "Rated R for Strong Violence and Sexuality, Nudity and Language." <br /> <br /> which the IMO should say correctly; "Rated R for Strong Violence, Sexuality, Nudity and Language". <br /> <br /> The word "sexuality" should come from a "comma", not "a" because of the huge difference in its meaning. I think a lot of people watching this movie agree with me that sexuality and nudity have not changed in part. my first impression when I look at mpa's rating was to watch something like a "live" movie. that's why I felt cheated. the story-wise, it was so - after all, who really cares about the story, if there is a beautiful curry. I know not. <br /> <br /> Of course this is just my opinion. Joseph
