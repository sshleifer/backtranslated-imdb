I tried to sit with this bomb not too long ago.what disaster. acting was atrocious. There were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a leading balloon. This was mainly because the reaction of the actors just did not mean the real thing. It would seem to be a modern takeover of Hitchcock's original "rescue boat". I think Hictcock would turn circles in his own tomb in the same mind. From what I suffered, there is nothing convincing in the movie.it boasts several semigraphic names, but they do not participate in their characters, but you know it was fair that no one is really to blame. I think I'm sure the script exploded at the first explosion. LOL.it it's possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along.but for me, I'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out.so if you do not have at least a 3-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this stinker / 1/10
