I was born in the 1960s and I grew up in the early 1970s and watched TV "Movies of the Week" and loved the haunted movies that were commonly depicted, including Crowhaven Farm, Bad Ronald, Satan's School for Girls, Kolƒçak Night Stalker ", etc., but this is just stupid. Of course, the writer was trying to make the terrible murders of Manson a few years ago. Film stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" glory as a father who takes his family camping on the beach. The family encounters some hippies who, for some reason, decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist attitude is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat them to hell or something, just do not move and scoff at it. The actress is pretty, the story incredible, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in bikinis, but that's about it. Ignore this if you ever broadcast on TV.
