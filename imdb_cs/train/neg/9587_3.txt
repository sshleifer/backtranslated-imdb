Recreation of the 50s (London) Soho and the upcoming people. Based on a cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. Nothing more, nothing less. Give him $ 15 million and make $ 15 million of pop video. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who can not actually act is one thing - but two hours? What he meant. Besides, who are viewers? Who is interested in a book that was well remembered. The usual London story about a chancer who enjoyed a chance. <br /> <br /> What could really drag this movie down? Oh, I know, songs of the third grade that seem to be in place. David Bowie overlays the film title several times, and that's the pinnacle. The soundtrack is a clay pigeon. <br /> <br /> There is one good thing. Good recreation of Soho. It is a shame they could not think of anything that should be in front of her.
