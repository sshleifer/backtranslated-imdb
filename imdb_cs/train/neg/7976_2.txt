Believe in God or not. Believe in Jesus or not. Do you believe he is the Son of God or not? The choice is up to you. Director Denys Arcand really did everything he could to bring Jesus to a mere historical figure, the social worker, the son of two people, instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary who opened the sky again for us. Encouraging a big bang, the world comes from evolution instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian who brings some "modern finds" actors who play Jesus in Passion Play, which is happily integrating into their play. The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where Passion Play played a sexual relationship with one of the female Passion Play players in Montreal instead of showing his love of God through celibacy. More often, it is clear to see the dismissal of the director of the Church. The director tried to create a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of acting. It is an admirable attempt, but showing the Resurrection with Passion Play organ transplantation in other bodies means the director thinks of Jesus. My opinion is not important, God's view is, but I would not want to stand in the face of the director and actors as he stood before Jesus' throne.
