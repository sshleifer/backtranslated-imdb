I know you've read it before, countless other movies undoubtedly if you read the comments here, but the voodoo academy still stands as the absolutely worst movie I could watch. undoubtedly really bad they are not even available to buy or watch on TV, but still I think it's fair to qualify that I'm not just a stupid tenant he chose wrong. <br /> <br /> "I saw two thirds of the bottom 100 movies placed on the imdb and I with every opportunity I tick the remaining, most of them standing on the head and shoulders above this ... exersize in absolute monotony. bad movies (like those who do not have the humor or how bad they are) how many people you have to watch to make it all the way, if you can watch it yourself, it's not that bad if you can follow it with one of your friends. It's bad, but it could be a lot worse. <br /> <br /> We needed 5 to make it through the voodoo academy, and even the funny moments watching bad movies (like three times in this when I do not know) I could have a dry taste in my mouth, yes, I saw it, but I also made four of my friends to look at me to do it, I hope we pray, we saw the director cut out. . cape For years, there could be a version with 20 minutes of big eyebrows with children's oil glands that wiped torsos, just scared me. so many of the films are concerned. <br /> <br /> I thank david dekoteau for taking this film for two days for a short budget, as I meet him for persuading people to pay him, is undoubtedly a celluloid version of some of his fetish. but it's not a good movie. the original shop of horror was shot at the same time for a comparative amount of money (due to inflation) and was a complete jewel. it is not a justification for how bad a child is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> .. is interesting for the time that she dedicates herself to pectoral massage. no matter what your harmony or sex is ... friction simply can not keep that sort of time on the screen. acting is cheese ... but not too horrible ... I've seen a lot worse in better movies ... but somehow it's partly a competent delivery of some of the worst lines you've ever heard in a movie that really grows. <br /> <br /> Let's find out if, just like me, you are fascinated with the worst worst and only if you follow her with a group of people who are ready to work to get through it. it is not any ha ha ha set hesitant matter. it's a test of endurance that you probably want to omit. I'm sure it's worse ... but I would not be surprised if it had the name decoteau.
