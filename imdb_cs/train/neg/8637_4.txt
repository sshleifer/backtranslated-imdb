More mysterious film, in which some ruthless elements of horror are thrown; average total. It starts with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sexual partner gets out of bed, goes to the room of her crying child and kills her. Wake up. Then the man dies in the hospital and spits blood. His deceased daughter will come and he will be able to contact his dreams (I think), and he wants to find out who killed him before his body is completely decomposed into the grave. <br /> <br /> There is not much secret about who did it or even how; most viewers find it long before they are revealed. I'm not sure how he'd be killed, it really would work. In any case, the horrible elements get inside: a cruel autopsy, the recurring dream of the man who kills a boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into the eyes that are then cut, and several shots of a man decomposing both in nightmares and in the facts in his grave. I was a little surprised to see Clive Barker! Interesting.
