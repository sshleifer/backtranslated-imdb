Not only was he always inconvenient to listen, but he had no jokes. I swear that some fancy Asian guy who tells you mommy's jokes would be more fun than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe a few funny moments, but at least I can laugh at least once!) Leary said he stopped using drugs in one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still on top; he was just some dirty noise, which mostly involved the drug. One of his jokes was something like: "I do not want to use crack, especially with the same name as my ass." "Oh, man, how did it come with this?" I swear that the only guy to close f ** k is Denis Leary, thank God I did not have to see him, this guy is upset, if you're just amused by the promise and "jokes "where you can come with you, then waste your time with this unwanted goods.
