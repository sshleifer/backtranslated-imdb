I found the Darkness to be too TMAK. She had some great idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and a few tricky moments that made you UGH! But, it was swollen to the point of confusion. You do not know what's going on in dark scenes, and for a movie that's shot at Super 8 Film, you've got it all wrong. As with Nathan Schiff's movies, it's too much. It seems that director Leif Jonker wants to create an original film but lacks the know-how. The camera is never pointed at the right place, a lack of groundwork such as shooting simple dialog scenes and the way light can damage the movie. The actors are all quite unequal and hammocks. But despite these negatives, music is good, gore is a lot and ranges from silly mastic to really good appliances. Is he a classic, as he says? Is it worthy that both discs are worth praise? NO. But it's a good first attempt. Now if these boys cease to praise on their backs for this film (from what I understand the only one that ever ended up) for a while and try again, they can do better.
