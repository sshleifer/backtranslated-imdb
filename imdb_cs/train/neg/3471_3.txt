this film had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck did not really try to act, shape or shape. He exhausted. Nothing about the movie was plausible. The first problems were at the beginning when one gives everything that has value to the salvation army of Santa Claus, but it does not show why. Then grandmother puts her head in the oven - really beautiful and does not have anything to do with the movie - it's not even in the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation of Ben Affleck's motivation to choose the house he chose; There was no credible reaction of the family he had chosen; (Example: Characters Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck descend on a steep slope - it's an incident that suddenly falls in love with her.) Riiiight ...) Anyway, there was a funny moment or two - but in the movie it was a rarity. It really needs another transcript (or 4). I hope you will enjoy it!
