A sexually obsessed chef leads a double life: one as a "happily" married man with a ten-year-old child and the other as a sexual ghost. Most of the documentary film follows him for five consecutive days, and in the backstage with Nastassya Kinski he is said to be a clinical sexual therapist, listening to his story and intelligently researching him. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and is the only major adult character to take off his clothes. If she had, I would describe this film as a big fat "F." As it is, it measures F +, which means it's still a failure unless you get bored. It is probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning the garage. The "diary of sexual addiction" falls into the category of movies we once saw, we want it not.
