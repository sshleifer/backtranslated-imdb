This is the most confused item on IMDb that I do not have yet to encounter. All previous reviewers behave like this movie. This is not a movie. Rather it's just a featurette that's extra on DVD from the movie "The One" It also nowhere to be 90 minutes that it is listed here as. In fact, it's barely more than 13 minutes to cool Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So, this IMDb record is quite fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews because they are all right. You can trust me because I will never buy you, dear reader, BS. And that is true. I think u can say I'm a "One" Reviewer who cares.
