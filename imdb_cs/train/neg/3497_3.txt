Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show does not complete. The character is not even distant, and it is not a situation where you think she is "she is such that I love her" just "is such a bitch". This character is just old fair, stupid, b * tch.Sarah seems to be trying to hold this show because it's just half funny. Mood, a dialogue that's so damn boring and dry, is like listening to your grandfather going further and further down the beads that he gathered as a child. The Sarah Silverman program is so incredibly boring that I was thinking about changing the channel to watch the old repeat married with the kids something that is funny because the characters are so "naughty" and "rough". I'm sorry but I will not find a show full of dry humor and an angry story from the walls of the stories of an angry, bitter, defeated angry, bitter life with her annoying sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with cold anywhere near that funny. to stand this show, although generally I find Sarah Silverman to be "I love her because she is such an ab * character" as in School Of Rock, and most of her stand up. I think this show is bored with the characters who think they are evil and say and do things for shock value, such as a constant pube, diarrhea, and a general hit for laughter. Sarah Silverman is trying to be humorous, and he does not succeed either because he needs laughter or better writers. Some have compared it with South Park, but it's not even close. opinions on Sarah Silverman, and it will not become an annoying troll, so you will not see that I'm abstaining and constantly posting things like "This show is angry," and "Why is not it canceled yet?" such as the Sarah Silverman program, if you like.
