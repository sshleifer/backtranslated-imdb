this movie offers nothing but the deepest conversation. in fact, I would probably not be able to imagine how nonsensical the movie, how synthetic the dialogues could be an hour ago, but I've seen this video again. in a movie that does not depend on a strong script, we expect to see at least good and tasty conversations and even some humor, but this film lacks all. You hear me missing them all. there is no point I would like about this film, none. I hate that. I'm sure somebody will do it. the title is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and things, even though they even fail in their nudity. I do not know how much I enjoyed watching a lot of watches, and I certainly recommend that you do not do it. the worst movie I've seen all my life. if someone offers you to look at her, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
