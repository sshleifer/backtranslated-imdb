What do you get when you mix a piece of cliché with an inconspicuous way and a group of characters you do not care about and an unsuccessful attempt to create an attractive visual style and even more cliché and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget? Why, you get one of the most unbearably unprecedented movies you've ever done! I mean, of course, Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people could say when watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the story is how it was in the past, and much more skillfully than in this film. "" Wow, look at all the flashing lights and the grainy film of texture and the complicated transitions! The director tries so hard that things look great and create a visual style! It's just bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or does not make sense with the scenes in which they are, and it's also bad that most of them find it irritating! "" I heard I exchanged a dialogue in about twenty thousand movies! "<br /> <br / > "I saw this scene in about thirty thousand movies before!" <br /> <br /> "Uh, it was not about revealing this plot in about half an hour It's supposed to be surprising? "<br /> <br />" If this movie should show a "hard chick" two around digging your butt ... why not doing so much? "" I can not believe how vague this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long is this thing? I feel like I've been watching it for more than four hours. "" I have no idea what has just happened, but I also do not have a strange feeling that I would try to find out. <br /> <br /> "It's over yet? <br /> <br /> "I want the money to come back. "<br /> <br />" Tracks in this sound track are abused here "<br /> <br />" It is ironic that all the curses they use actually reduce the impact of each one. "<br /> <br />" UGH. "<br /> <br /> And finally:" Maybe I have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me. "<br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a failure in almost every respect. in a fire and this movie is played in a single room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider burning alive. <br /> <br /> (If I sound bitter, it's because I just spent over two hours watching this movie and, uh, I did not like it much.)
