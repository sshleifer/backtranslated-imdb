If you are trying to build tension in the movie, it's always a good idea not to create it beyond the total number. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butch Brothers have not yet realized it. <BR/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is upset, unlike most of its characters who (if you did not work, are vampires in the first few minutes, then you are shaming), bulk supply "no one knows where I am" cheerleaders and homosexual drifters that waft comfortably and with fast food swagger, around their insulated doors. The only trivia of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place, but the rest is ridiculous and careless. <br /> <br /> Constrained to sticks (as opposed to bets) regularly because of their taste to fill their basement without blood, they are really not very clear. If they were to cover their victims, they could run their own small backyard and reduce their mortality rate, allowing them to settle down and get chinty. Why did the manufacturers consider it necessary to introduce incest twins and homicidally older brother, I'm not sure. This added zero to the conspiracy, which was unfortunate because there was not a lot of conspiracy that could begin and no shock value at all. No one ever said why the parents died if of course it was not explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. It is obvious that a social worker had to be warned for some reason for a family, but again, it was for the spectator to write his own reason. The only well-rounded figure was the youngest brother to appear as Pugsley of the Adams family. Indeed, he was too rounded and had the appearance of a child who accidentally wandered from the class of Watchmen to a very bad horror. Oh heaven, he had. Do not mind, darling, you have another donut with a wonderful blood center.
