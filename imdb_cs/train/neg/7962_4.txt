Sequels have a frantic habit of being disappointing and the best credit I can give is that it keeps this old tradition. These three stories are not as good as any of the original Creepshow. It seems that the best of the trio includes wooden idols that come alive to avenge the heroes who killed their owners. The second story is about a monster lake that looks like nothing more than a lot of floating bay, and thinks about how anyone can be afraid of it. The third story includes Stephen King's story as a truck driver, but besides, it's a pretty unforgettable story about a traffic accident victim who returns from the dead to the person who knocks him. <br /> <br /> Watch the original Creepshow instead, or if you've already done, then be happy with it.
