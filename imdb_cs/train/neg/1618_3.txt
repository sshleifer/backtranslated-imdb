I went to see this movie with the best expectations. I saw Jacquet's previous movie (penguin march) and I heard a very positive review on the radio. But I was very disappointed. Most of all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally nothing happens. I tried to describe the content of the film to a friend and we both ended up laughing because I could just stomm things like "well, then it will be cold, then spring, then there is the eagle and the river, and once it is dark and the girl goes to the cave and other times the fox has children "and so on. After about half an hour I began to sigh, to stare, to turn my eyes, to curse the reviewer on the radio station, and hoped it would soon be over. But the film went on and on. When it was over, I was deeply in the chair that I looked a bit like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying part of the movie is (a) A girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She has the same clothing throughout the movie (one year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Gratitude. She's cute, no doubt. A movie about the beauty of nature like this would be better without her presence. I find that she is constantly hoping she could get a bear, drown in a river or something terrible. (b) The comment of the adult voice of a girl who tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, superfluous things. (c) music that desperately lacks gentleness. When a girl jumps happily, the music jumps around. When a fox is threatened by an eagle, music becomes a threat. It reminded me of very early filmmaking and was too predictable. It is true that many children who have seen the film with me naturally liked it, at least in some way. So my warning only applies to adults: If you have more than ten years, avoid this movie. In most other places, you can get better (and cheaper) sleep.
