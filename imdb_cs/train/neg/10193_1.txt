With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the film capabilities, while in the film he clearly states that his work is "objective". Obviously, it is not. For some reason, many scenes of "shot-by-chance" are obvious settings (when the bad goat "accidentally" falls off the cliff, you actually see the smoke on the right side of the screen!). Secondly, his hiding of one important piece of information: The Hurdy people were as they were for a specific reason, which is just implied in the film. It is a goiter, a disease caused by lack of iodine (salt). This belly is the cause of their cretinism and Bunuel had only time to do his research (heck, if he checked "cretinism" in a medical dictionary that would find "goitre") he could finally tell the truth about these people (Doubts). Instead, he constantly judges his films, talks about them as "critters," over and over again, dramatizing the action, preparing scenes to create a share, all of which is unacceptable to documentaries who claim to work for omnipotent objectivity. Bunuel speaks all the time in this film and does not give a single word to the people he is filming. They talk about them and even judge them. This piece is defective on its roots, its ideology and it's a real shame that it's considered a great movie.
