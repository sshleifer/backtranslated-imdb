I was sitting at GenCon just because it was quiet and I could sleep. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Was she the girl who played Flo and Abe Vigoda, or something? <br /> <br /> Really, a piece of unlucky garbage. The characters were stereotyped with no sense (I mean ...) and wooden, most of them looked like they were on the autopilot. The so-called "merry" situations described in some three so-called reviews were so hackneyed, I was writing for writers. I'm confused how someone can find it worth their time, seriously. I'm only giving 3 out of 10, because to be 2 or 1, it should be either five hours long or more Kelly LeBrock.
