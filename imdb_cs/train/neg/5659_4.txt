The disappointing end of the season that started so well ... Exodus Part 2 and other major episodes were among the best seen on television in any series where it was rather bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if it was an episode, it was a disappointment, but the guitar music that accompanied the final sequence was ridiculous and would be more home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if a corporate execs did not like the ending with a low key note and wanted to jam. They disappointed and somewhat spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not a trend in the future. Still, at least, we saw the return of a certain man, though somewhat bizarre and trifling done.
