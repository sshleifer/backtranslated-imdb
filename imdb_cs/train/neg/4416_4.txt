A subtle box of faith and teachings of the Catholic Church gets a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, a dark humor is played by a medium called several commonly heard rhetorical questions, especially "If God is so good, why does he allow evil in the world to exist?" Diane Keaton is excellent in his role as an exaggerated version (although some may disagree) about stereotypical religious teachers who refute the "line of society" and condemn half the world to burn in hell. To celebrate her 25th anniversary, she invited her first students to come back and perform at their Christmas competitions. However, when the quartet "updates" her play on the parody of Mary's "disgraceful" teachings, the nun is over the edge and sent the story spiraling into a chain of unfortunate events. The end will finally leave the audience with feeling sick in their hearts. Not recommended. Watch the game instead.
