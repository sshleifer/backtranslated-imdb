Discontinuous, unclear, bad scenario, poor photography, and direction ... all the apparently ill-conceived first attempt to commercialize good people on TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has been a great success in the past by helping to bring "China Cry," the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and much of his programming and who loved "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to someone. They do very well with their ministry, but that is not an example. Do not waste money ... go to "China Cry".
