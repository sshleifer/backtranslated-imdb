The biggest mistake in this movie is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people would ever be cast in Macbeth's professional production. The hearing of a loud voice by David Lansbury working hard with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" made it impossible to believe that someone would ever think of his role. I still believed he did not get away because he was a miserable actor; not because there was a bigger name available. Then, when we see part of the play on the test, it is difficult to believe that the director is not a parody of things with the hopelessly bad, bad way of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand verses and directors, interpretations. Sometimes directors are so nervous about having their movies (and writers think they have the ability to manage their own works) that they have settled less. This seems to be such an example.
