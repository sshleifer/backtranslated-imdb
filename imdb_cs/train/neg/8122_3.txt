Painful to watch and not entirely due to empathy with the struggle for characters. Two of the main characters, Mother Cynthia and the acclaimed daughter of Monica, spend much of the movie that is ravaging and hot blackmailing. Their characters are so strong that their redemption to tolerant personalities after quick family catharsis is incredible. It was not to wait. I wish the charm of honesty among the families was less headache.
