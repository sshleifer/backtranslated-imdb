I think it's hard to believe anyone would shoot this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the exorcist was gentle and scary, Stigmata was dull, clumsy, and too formal. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've seen in a while, but the pictures do not do it for the downward spiral patronizing the exposition that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this movie was topped when compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website has increased this interest. The website contained many stories of "real" stigmas throughout history. However, the scene by scene, the movie is so obsessed with its quest for "authenticity" that it becomes comical initially, then it is quite hard to follow to the end. I began to get suspicious when the priest, commissioned to investigate the potential miracles, went to the beauty parlor where our heroine would reel her hair and obviously enjoyed the priests. The story: A woman without faith in God begins to accept the wounding of Christ (Stigmata) and is confused and upset about suffering. The priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie obsessed with Satan or a vessel for Jesus Christ? The only miracle in this movie is that it finally ends.
