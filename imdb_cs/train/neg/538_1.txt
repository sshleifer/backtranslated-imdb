Wow, losing actor's talent. My husband and I were sitting there, both of us thinking that this must be improved, these actors are too good to waste time on this bullshit. Unattractive characters, scripted script, and seamless stimulation do two hours long. Actually, I could not hack and let food shopping (litter cats were better than this movie). The husband stayed and confirmed that he had not improved - at the time Buddy was killed, they wanted everyone to be hit by a car and end up with their miserable lives. It will be infinitely fun. Beautiful scenery and costumes can not keep this alive.
