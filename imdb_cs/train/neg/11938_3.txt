The film started pretty well. He was a man who was struck by a glowing green meteorite, gaining superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, ability to talk with the dog, superspeed, heat of vision, and the ability of the plant to grow big and fast) and fight crime. From here it's all downhill. Meteor Man gets a costume from his mother, fights with resident gangs and has many suppressed encounters with gang leaders to help you prepare for disappointment, excessive, and surprisingly it would not be. It would not be so remarkable if it was not like watching a boxing match, where the two fighters pretend to collide with each other as spectators look on while the fighters just keep on dancing. Despite all these nonsense, the film has good points. Clearly, if you try to take your own gang, they will come home and harm you. He states that gangs and communities need to see their real enemies (great bosses who use them for their own purposes to crush honest people into the existence of the ghetto). It also says people do not need superhero if they are willing to work as a community to destroy predators who are hurting them. The only message that is really lacking is that voters should ensure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H. W. Bush) are also not cheaters. <br /> <br />
