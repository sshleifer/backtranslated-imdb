I saw this film with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's really fun, and that's very fun. <br /> <br /> Gael is totally terrible, I think he just can not act, period. He should give up now, because acting is obviously not his thing. Its stars are about the same caliber, I'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do better than everyone else! The director should be ashamed to put his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I do not think Oscar is on the cards for this guy. I never wrote an IMDb comment, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do so. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this movie, do not be 0/10 if it was 0
