What was the sound? It sounded like it was all dubbed. Otherwise bad. Plot = bad. Accents = Poor (even Dougray and we live in Scotland), Acting = Bad, Harp = Poor, Sexual Scenes - Bad / Cringeworthy. We still did not trust it until the end. How could such a good choice of actors so badly perform? Will they ever have a decent job again? bad, bad, bad. By the way, we gave it 3 because we were at least tempted to watch it for his bizarre plot, etc. And to the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce of the 1940s. How did it happen in 2004? OK, OK, there were some OK bits. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray had a nice ship. Jennifer looked nice in her little outfit. But how come the sister got all the men?
