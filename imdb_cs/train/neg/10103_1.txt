This movie brought me. The title was perhaps the biggest idea I've ever heard. I thought it was an independent film about zombie outbreaks and their attempts to take over the US and a group of lonely survivors, join the group and plan zombies. NAPROSTO ŠPATNĚ! It's a psychic policeman with the weakness of killing his female arrests, getting what comes to him, when zombies come out of their graves to be avenged. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or the region. Where to begin with this cinematic disaster, our nation has done. <br /> <br /> First of all, women zombies look like Victoria Secret models with a dark eye line and a pale face. What are the zombies, but the mindless, controversial intelligent, cannibalistic murderous machines they eat because of their primitive, most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and take-off and runway models, talking like in the poor movie movie noir and not behaving like a real zombie. Surely food and killing are there, but where is homelessness and terrible corruption? Though it's a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of this genre and asks, "Why can zombies be beautiful vixen slayers?" I think this film would be considered a really bad Indian film that was made and manufactured by garage drug addicts. I do not intend to recommend this movie to someone who loves the zombie genres too much, is it an insult and just as scary?
