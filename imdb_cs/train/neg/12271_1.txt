Scriptwriter Lisa Lutz began writing a screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 <br /> <br /> Is it even in business? If someone gave her another chance after this bite, it is for the happiest person ever at a price. This movie is angry with no end ... I will never be surprised what will turn into movies ... and the fact that they did make the writer put off for a bit? Seriously? I can write better than it is in my sleep. <br /> <br /> OK, how many lines do I have to write? I do not have it at all. I think I'm a "newbie". I think I do not understand why there should ever be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a quota? Seriously, I do not care if you have a single sentence. or even one word of answer. I think I am? <br /> <br /> Thanks ... is it enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This movie is worthless.
