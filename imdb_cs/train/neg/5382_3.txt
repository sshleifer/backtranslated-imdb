Certainly a product of young brains, this piece can very well appeal to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find his place in the world while obsessed with every neurosis. However, I can not imagine that a heavy amount of narcissistic navel observation, humor, or a trivial subject would be particularly interested in anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheral figures that the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt are encouraged to such absurd cartoons for the comic effect that they can not deal with it in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, one has to give some stylish points to the film makers who apparently grew up in videogeneration and use all the conceivable editing tricks in the book to smell a non-existent fence. Here you can remember 2 points. First, beware of the fans of the festival. Second, even if you live in the age of youtube, not every account of their worldly lives deserves a great screen-treatment. But these young filmmakers have the right to make their film, and if another 20-something can find something that could identify with it, then the better. Still, I could not help thinking at the end of this film about how this new generation that is just arriving will move in a real world that presents so many problems and complications. At the age when each child is constantly assured of how strange they are, and that everyone deserves a 15-minute exposure, resilience and the ability to cope with adversity does not seem to be exactly the strong point of this generation.
