Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle will come to see the new Ollie woman and child. The problem is they do not exist - Ollie is probably done! So it is up to him and his friend to find a lady with a child who agrees to act like his family. It's not a strange story, as I've seen at least a few other quiet shorts with this exact conspiracy. The best of them was Bobby Vernon NOT KID ME. It's a lot better than ONE QUANTITY - probably it was a lot because it happened ten years later - when the comedy became a little more sophisticated and relied less on unnecessary rot. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some movies that people make firearms wildly, kick and stutter, etc. With a little provocation. It is sad that at the end of ONE MULTI, that's exactly what they are doing. None of that makes sense, and it was like just exhausting thoughts about stories. Overall, this is not exactly a milestone in entertainment. It's just a lack of payouts that you'd deserve to watch if you're not an obsessed, quiet fan like me.
