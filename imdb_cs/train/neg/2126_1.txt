Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is pointless to catch him as plush romantic leadership. The fact that he's dancing so well, the pikers so effectively, and throws himself into the work so completely that it made him look even more terrifying. In his more intense moments (with a girl at the train station, the final with Rosie) I could not take his eyes off him that he was so repellent. You're always waiting for him to drop a nice guy and start calling. Vanessa Williams was a real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. By the way, if you see the production of the scenic musical film, the 1963 movie and the 1995 movie, you'll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, the same song assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.
