I have never fully understood the popularity of the Saban Power Rangers exhibition, which was simply the second American version of the Japanese ultra-popular super-seyah series of the last three decades! What's cool in the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. Of course, many children say the powerful guardians are the greatest, but they would be wrong. /> <br /> I'm sure if they spoke Japanese, they would learn how much better super sendai is over the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is absolutely terrible, try it instead of Super Sentai! Looking for a better show, try instead Voltron Third Dimension!
