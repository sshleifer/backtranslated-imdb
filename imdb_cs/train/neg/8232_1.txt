Five over the eyes is not worth the hand, I have to admit that at one point I was really anxious, for about 30 seconds no one was making noise and I thought my speaker was blown or that I did not hear with a constant shout and me and the speakers are in thanks thanks for asking, so much that it was the best piece of film. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time by telling you a plot, read more comments for it. <br /> <br /> If you bought this DVD, but you did not unpack it, do not take it back and ask for money back, you do not do the same thing unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> I actually screamed on TV, "They're in the car, looking for camera lights and finding a friend first," I swear, but we can guess where they're going. <br /> <br /> If someone bought this movie (it's really good), it's yours a dozen times.
