One friend told me about John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was the favorite writer of the Bukowski writers - an author with similar play and humor, except for one generation before. "Ask the Dust" was the first Fante book I've ever read and remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a great piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer who for himself and the outside world is an exaggeration for himself, a masterfully talented author who has no idea how to write about real experiences he did not have. In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, without any idea of ​​how to make the graces of the women she desperately tries to write in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, settling down for her first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer, and how he eventually remains the story of his unsuccessful attempts at love, is biting and real without touching Hollywood's end. The film adaptation remains for a while faithful to this book, but moves into the film trap of love of persistent racism, illness and death. The heart of this story is that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is crazy, and their love has never been and would never be a real thing, no matter how much one of them wanted to find each other. This film broke the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with a slogan. I can not believe that the one who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make the film about it so bad.
