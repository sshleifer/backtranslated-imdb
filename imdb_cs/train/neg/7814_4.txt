After a long time in space, looking for the remnants of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) portrays a wicked plan, using the crystals he stole from Solitude, to create new land and dive into the US. After so many wonderful Superman movies, Christopher Reeve, or TV shows like "Lois a Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", there was a huge expectation for Superman to return to this version of Bryan Singer. Unfortunately, this terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, a lack of emotions and overvalued IMDb. Additionally, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something ridiculously ridiculous. Twenty-one-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is misplaced, playing the role of mature reporters and experienced mothers of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays in "Smallville" teenagers Clark Kent. The figure of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly cartoon. Last but not least, and despite being an amazing Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, older and older than the rest of the cast. The end of the conclusion looks like a soap opera and it's terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
