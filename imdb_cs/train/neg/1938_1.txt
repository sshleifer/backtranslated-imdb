Where to start? Amitabh son, played Akshaye Khanna, is 30. Amitabh has been in prison for 33+ years ... he <br /> <br /> A) Telepathically transferred the sperm home? B) Has he asked a good Pakistani guard to send him a post? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> , yum, wonderful ... and obviously wants her - who would not, right? ... But when her father got up and then killed (I hardly think it's a "spoiler" as if you had to be dead and blind to not see it in the movie) is quite senseless to this catastrophe and peak (metaphorically) of her hat, leaving her to save her father, ignoring the losses and saying (paraphrases) "If God wants it, we will meet again ..." Basically it means: "I get my father d My work ended, I'm sorry for the loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- Callus under normal Hollywood standards ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this awful time-loss movie that you can drive all jeeps there is only one - as in the dance sequence - no matter the quality) great belly dance - but not okay "Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever insist on acting lessons?) for better movies about the Indo-Pak conflict ... Veer-Zaara is pretty damn good - 7.5 / 8 I would say !
