I heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to joining another great cable series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it slowly eroded away with every episode I watched from Season One. (did not do it for the first six episodes) The song was non-original, fictional and portrayal of Blacks embarrassing. Dialogue felt compelled, just as writers are trying too hard to be smart and hip. It was a precious moment when I actually emitted audible laughter. The characters have never evolved enough to take care of them, they were selfish and uninteresting. I'm absolutely GRADING adding a brother-in-law (which was to be taken off to Catch A Predator) and removing Hodes' daughter Quinn from casting her by sending her to a boarding school in Mexico was so unintelligent and clich√©, I had to conclude that the writers tested the loyalty of the viewer. Episode Episode I liked the characters and could not go through many technical flaws in the story. <br /> <br /> Add to that I heard that Season Two was not that good, so I lost all my motivation to continue watching this game. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect that this show will be a challenge to you unless you are, of course, stoned and then all bets are turned off.
