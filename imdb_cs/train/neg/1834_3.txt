I can not say much about this movie. I think he speaks for himself (just like the current rating here). Two years ago I leased them and I absolutely regretted it. I even tried it when I watched it twice, but I just could not. I can safely say I have absolutely no desire to see the waste of time ever, ever, never. And I'm not one that could erase the movie, but I really believe it's terrible. It was not funny either. The only bits I enjoyed were the scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this movie was destroyed for me by both Jack Black and Ben Stiller. All I think when I see one of their films is just this horrible movie now reminds me not to lose money. Amy Poehler is also uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think my opinion. The stars are for Walken, by the way.
