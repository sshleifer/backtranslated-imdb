OK. For beginners, the taxi driver is amazing. this is not a taxi driver or an amazing one. what is wrong. but I thought it was bad, which means she has some redemption. like dialogue ... wow. there were more or less no plot, the characters were silly and the film was a sermon. there were some places I thought the movie would dive into a driving type of driving type that would hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder. I can not even believe she is there like 20 other people who have seen this movie. yeah, it's worth watching if you're really bored and want to reaffirm that someone can make a movie or at least try.
