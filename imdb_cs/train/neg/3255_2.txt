I saw this movie in the penultimate week of 1975. I was 13 years old and I thought it was enough and fun at that time. Then I discovered WORLD Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of old magazines. I had no idea, not even before I was about this doctor, but I quickly became one of the most enthusiastic Doc Savage fans you could ever meet. I read (and still own) all Bantam books, started comic books (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all the strange events about heroic fats), and had a wonderful time with every adventure I took with a Doctor and ORIGINAL FAB 5 The Book of Philip Joseph Farmer - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage has become a bit of a bible for me, and I still enjoy the feelings about my Ph.D. In this way I have to say that this film really missed the boat. It's a movie that did not know what he wanted when he grew up. The screenplay was infantile and had little resemblance to the pulp story. These stories from the 1930s were short, and if we look at the outline of Lester Dent (AKA Kenneth Robeson) for their writing, they broke into the PERFECT 3 drama that shouted on the screen. One would think that with George Palhe and Michael Anderson on the rudder it would be better. Perfume items lack a goal, and more serious moments are almost there, but they are short. It is interesting to look at the fact that they have hired the other character figures (the guys who were really only players and bonuses in front of this movie) who are very liberated. Paul Gleason has, of course, become a great utility in all aspects of entertainment, and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the others disappeared from the map. I want to own a copy of this movie because it's the only film version of my hero, but I'm afraid it's not going to look too much because it's too painful. I would say 0, but instead I gave 2 out of 10 for some of the artistic direction periods (Doc record at the end was a nice touch) and cast 3. Stingers get in the sun for a while.
