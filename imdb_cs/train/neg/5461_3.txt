Like all cult television shows, there is a group of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they rate virtually every episode, such as the biggest EVER shows. While some of them are truly gorgeous classics, the truth is for every big episode, there were a few that were average and at least one that happened. However, just like the stubborn Trekkies, these zone lovers insist they are all gold. In fact, it's what I was originally compelled to review some episodes of a couple of cult series instead of the films I usually watch. Though this is not the worst episode that has ever happened, or is not among the worse, it is bad by any reasonable standard. The widow watches the long process of civil war soldiers passing around her home. Eventually, a very unexpected procedure appears and there is not much excitement or tension.
