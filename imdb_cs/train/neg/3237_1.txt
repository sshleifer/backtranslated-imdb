Not that I fell in love with the realistic blood collar, but when I was waiting for a bloody DVD bath, and what I get is one bloody scene (eyebrow) at the ends of asinin fake slamming and rotating a table chair, I end up thinking "well , that's 43 minutes of my life forever. " I would not even consider it the "films" of the flower of flesh and blood for the exercise of will; to see if you can sit them. The flower of the body and blood had several tough places. The Diabla experiment did not work. It was at best, stupid and worst ... well ... really stupid. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I gave the DVD to think "oh man, it will be wrong." After I watched them for a thousand times, I watched it faster. <br /> <br /> This movie would be interested in two kinds of people. 1) People who are looking for F'd movies just to see how it really does, or 2) Horror full. I was looking for this and other guinea pigs for this reason, but even if I fell into the category of the first, the film should not sail my ship. In fact, I could imagine that this movie is increasing its bloody lust ... as if "You're going to stop bitching!" So, in conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for collecting. If you want the bloodshed that traditional horror does not provide, get traces of death. Sure it is too, but at least you get the blood and scrap you expect. The only reason I could see that someone praises these bulls is that they feel they have it. No artistic merit that I understand, no reason for her notoriety, nothing. Just a poor attempt to be shocking.
