This show was absolutely terrible. For one George is not funny, and his children are a snobby of a small sprat. He also treats his mother without respect. As a Hispanic, I am very offended by this show and the way the characters are displayed. Plus a dysfunctional family thing was at the end of death. Once I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done millions of times? I thought ABC would get into my senses and pull this piece of garbage out of the air, but we will have to have a stomach sadly until "they shit the shark." In my opinion, they have already done so.
