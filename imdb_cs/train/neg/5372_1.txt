You are wondering why this image was ever made: the plot as such is absolutely incredible, if not ridiculous, the characters (the experienced Jonasian versus the younger, quite fascinated) are quite predictable, ending totally dark and impossible to understand (maybe after several views, having a masochistic tendency, the idea is you have to read the book to fully understand what is going on) and acting is bad. Was it a basic idea to show that French filmmakers are able to make Americans in the genre that include "Seven" and "Silence of lambs"? If so, it is a complete mistake. It was, however, quite successful (and has a certain kind of cult-like the first French serial killer) and seems to be considered a good export product. Strange.
