I had the feeling that I had opened for a few minutes, but for 20 minutes I pushed through the fast forward buttons. Too many footage of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) goes from room to room, down the corridors, door and street, and so many shots that look puzzled and confused. It seemed to me that the story was originally mentioned as short (20-30 minutes), and then reached out as a work of love between director Grieve and the star Zelniker (they wrote the script). <Br /> <br /> It might be more fun if one of those characters said something I had not heard before in many other movies, or if the end was not - disappointing - the one I predicted three minutes into the movie (atypical for independent / smaller studio film). At least his heart was in the right place - it was not your standard Hollywood manipulative nonsense.
