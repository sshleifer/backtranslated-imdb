Is it a "worse" Star Trek TOS episode? Perhaps, at least it will be my vote as at the bottom of 5. I think this episode does absolutely no exciting sense. Do you see anything that makes you mad? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feeling, music is amplified, almost forced to increase the feeling of suffering to the extent that it is angry. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholos, Romulans, higher creatures like Triskelion or something other than Medusin, these are very boring aliens who have had episodes. McCoy tries to tell the famous phrase "He's Dead, Jim." Spock puts protective goggles while transporting the ambassador, but Kirk does not. They go through this frantic "barrier", which I forgot for the third time, boring. At least three episodes of the third season will be "Specter Of The Gun" and "The Dove Day" and others that will follow, so Trek will be a decent show that will watch syndication where people like me as enthusiastic fans. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the purple color, her kind of purple-purple, as if in the corridor outside the ward, a sidewalk that is normally gray is now purple. We never had a violet bridge, but I saw its interest, I noticed it in several episodes, it was done with a light filter and it works well, but in this episode, it's nice in the corridor.
