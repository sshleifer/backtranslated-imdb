Awwww .... yes, it's a heart and all that some unhappy families are being accepted by ABC / Sears and their home is "renovated." Here ends the humanist appeal. I liked it very soon, but now this show has become disgusting. The ten needy families could get relatively luxurious homes with plenty of good for every family that every episode of the show is sorry. People in Habitat For Humanity must shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen-year-old boy to have a whirlpool in his bedroom or to have a "Low Rider" bed? Does my mother really need her dilapidated, non-routine and corroded old pick-up truck wagon restored and "overcrowded" by some of the best personalizers in California? Newly, this would have done pretty well, and probably a third of the prize. Do people really need a room in the plasma room thirty-six inches in every room? And then there is the question of who will pay increased property taxes and service bills. Even after the "makeover" has gone, somebody still makes a living. I doubt friendly friends in social services will see humor in all this. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than an ABC rating and a quiet advertisement for sponsors.
