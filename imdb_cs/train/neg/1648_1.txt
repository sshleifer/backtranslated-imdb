Personally, while I can really appreciate good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy some of the smartest bullshit. You know, the moments when you just want to sit and watch some terrible action movie about how to kill time. This is the only movie I remember that actually stops in the middle and I have no desire to return. The plot was so conceived and predictable, I called what the next scene would be easy (and usually it is not very good). The actors were scary, I saw a better acting game at high school. Even the scenes were bad, the flow was bad. This movie is like a parody that forgot to fun.
