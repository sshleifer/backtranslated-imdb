After a fairly successful MASTI, which was even better, Inder Kumar returned with comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film SEE NO EVIL, WRITE THE ZLIN. The film reminds HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Kader and Anupam play on the blind and deaf, > <br /> This movie is a boring exercise The film has jokes of such nonsense that you do not feel like laughing like Sneal Dabi head jammed in the back of the horse and all those comedies of the type we now do not smile but mock <br / > <br /> The film starts with clich√©s and some scenes are sad as long as the story never moves in this half or the comedy is bored Twist is well treated and the other half becomes an action movie where the blind boy and the deaf go to rescue the heroes and we have all OTT to chase scenes and fight scenes <br /> <br /> Direction Inder Kumar is bad Music is OK, one song stands out I FEEL MY ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivek is a hro well timed is very bad and is fine in serious scenes For some reason he still makes a comedy and ruined his career Fardeen Khan is better but too wooden Among the rest of Esha and Amrita are heroes Boman Irani bothers here Snehal Dabbi is in order
