He was born, raised and educated in Scotland. I was horrified at this disgusting depiction of a man who was no more than just a cattle pest. Even worse, the thread of the whole film was sex in one form or another, implicitly or verbally. To look at this, one would think that the 18th century in Scotland was inhabited by a lot of sexual degenerates and homosexuals. Lange was a joke as a young mother at the age of 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking "baths" in Scottish Lake NIKDY is not as usual as it was portrayed - but it gave them yet another opportunity to show how we were sexually propelled. Save money and watch Pinnochio.
