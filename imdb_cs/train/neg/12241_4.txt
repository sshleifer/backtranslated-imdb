This is one of the few episodes (if not only) with an inconspicuous error in telling the story. In dealing with the situation in Ralphie, Christopher claims he heard of the death of Pie-O-My on a fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context it is quite clear that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must kill Ralphie. There's no way Chris could hear about the accident. Who should tell him and when? At the time when Tony's call was pulled from delirium, no one else was informed. Tony knows it - which is even worse! Hearing Christopher that the death of Pie-O-My can only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself lit a fire. Given the impressively complicated writing process that the authors themselves said on DVD, I'm really surprised that none of them did not realize this problem. The story just does not work that way. It is useless to add that I am a huge soprano fan. Otherwise I would not care.
