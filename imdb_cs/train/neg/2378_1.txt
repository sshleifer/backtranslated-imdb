Why would a legitimate actor who read the screenplay participate in this bite? My God is really embarrassing when I look at it. I can not imagine that these people feel they are part of them. Also, there seems to be some controversy over whether the Phoenix River had a movie in the film. He was unreliable, but his role list here (IMDB) gives him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister for those who have already asked. This movie is proof that no matter how big the "names" you have. Sow's ears do not produce silk wallets. I like Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe somebody sometimes explain to me the reason for this movie. It does not have any cute, fun or even comedic features compared to the fact that it's all bad.
