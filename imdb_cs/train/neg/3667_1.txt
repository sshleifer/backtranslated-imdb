The opening scene "explains" why Hurt is later "immune" to the "contaminated man." It is a pity that he does not explain anything: How he got everything he did / what it was / why it worked so fast. Then we go to "Budapest today". OK, was the opener in the past or in the future? It turned out that this is a past, of course, but for a minute it seems as likely that the film will change to the beginning. I'm sorry I should have paid more attention, huh? Or maybe it is badly done. Then there is a lot of confusion about the different jobs he had in related fields, and he eventually mentioned how he should die from the original experiment he did not find. Oh! So ns and the private industry gathered to poison one of their best guys to watch the effects? He has to be one of the best guys, he's friends with a chemical company, for God. Then there is the substance itself: Technically poison, but it mutates in immune "carriers" so we can have what we want; poison, illness, allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How comfortable. Then there's a protocol: They jumped into the situation without having any idea of ​​what's in stock, or how to prepare for it. Did not the producers have enough money to show proper washing when the crew just left the scene of the deadly unknown substance? I still thought Hurt was dying of bad cleansing techniques, and the open scene would eventually become closer.
