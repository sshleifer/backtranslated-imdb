If you love movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; to avoid this film waste at all costs. It is an unmistakable, dirty and unimportant waste that should never be discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. The very worst movie I've seen in the past 18 months; mind-insensitive bad for the entire 86 minutes of his runtime. If it was much longer, I would not be able to write this review without using absurdity. Consider yourself a warning!
