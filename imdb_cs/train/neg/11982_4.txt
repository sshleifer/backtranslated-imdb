In 1925, child friends, Marie Dressler (Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (like Lizzie Praskins), supervise the marriage of their children, Anita Page (like Helen) and Norman Foster (as John). Before Mrs. Dressler's celebration, she will change the estate of her small town bank to her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brought many bank closures and financial uncertainty. Banker Foster is able to survive due to the wise planning of Mother Dressler. But Mrs Moran is afraid of her fortune and loudly demands complete withdrawal. Other Warren Bank customers hear Moran's rant and start questioning their own solvency. Soon the family is in a financial crisis. Dressler's huge critical and financial film hit "Emma" was released at the beginning of the year, and MGM had to get a new Dressler movie as soon as possible. Dressler's hit in 1931, "Reducing" and "Politics" still make a lot of money; and Dressler became the US Box 1 Star Box in 1932, according to a list of industry standards compiled by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" surely celebrated Dressler's status, but production seems to be unceasingly careless and hurried. Cast is well thought out. Any other care in the direction and editing and some retaxes would help? they probably needed it in halls for holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperita (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
