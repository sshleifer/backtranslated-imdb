I read a comment Chris_m_grant from the United States. He wrote: "A fantastic document from 1924. This geography of today's Iraq in the early 20th century was strong." <br /> <br /> I like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads from Iran, the Zagros Mountains and the Landscape and watched Grass, the nation's nation fighting for life. These traditions you have seen in the movie have lasted for centuries and will last as long as life lasts. I am alone in this area of ​​Iran. I'm Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but Bakhtiari Zardkuh area is in Iran not in Iraq, as you said in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. The use of the Iranian man as Iranian is almost like the American acceptance of Mexico. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
