Not only does this film have a bad plot, bad direction, and terrible acting but it opens a whole new meaning to racism. In this movie, "white" girls are fucked, "white" boys are wana-be gangsters and successful (yes again) "White" entrepreneurs are rebellious toilet rescuers. <br /> <br /> I just wonder what would happen if I did exactly the same movie with exactly the same story and script, I just did about the Caucasians. "Dude, that's good when you see that you've stopped walking with those black chickens." No one noticed it, but now look at the movie and reverberate how they portrayed the new "White Boys" of Zealand. Suddenly, her white people are the main cause of the aggression of the gangs, and they cut off for a quick bang. Only female girls have a heart, there is no such thing as if it was not a crazy white girl. He refuses to do this film without making a repulsive profile in the Caucasian community in New Zealand. If you think I'm up, look at this movie and see what you're doing about "white boys." Just because the Samoans have decided to call "white boys" in real life does not mean it's funny. If I said, hey, black boy, I'll lose my teeth. I do not see this movie. Do not waste money. Do not be racist.
