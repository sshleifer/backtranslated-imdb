Many other reviewers, including many, whose views I respect, keep this piece of European horror in a high regard. I personally did not like it at all. His incoherent attempt at the atmospheric period goes beyond sex and violence. Jess Franco, in his best form, makes these films very well. Unfortunately, the unfaithful exploiting filmmaker Joe D'Amato is not. D'Amato's most famous films are infamous due to their high share. This, the first film from him, does not have constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness" did. Last but not least, it is a discontinuous film that does not engage the audience in any way. Without the pain factor it becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoyed this film, but I just considered it a perfect example of an incredibly lazy writing. For the film there are several plus. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in it and looks nice and often naked. Klaus Kinski's cult film icon is totally missed in the subplot without linking to the main film. It seems that the role is poisoning and does not have the manic intensity it does best. Music score is nice and some short moments inadvertently funny gore. Yet it is a demanding and unnecessary movie that can be incredibly boring. (3/10)
