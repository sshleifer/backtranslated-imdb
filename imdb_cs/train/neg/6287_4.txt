I read about this movie in the magazine and I was impressed. A woman who one day sees herself as her own car. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... but it's not. First, the name. Broken? Broken ... what? What is broken? The ... oh, wait ... I get it, the title is itself "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, this is virtually the only thing that goes on. The assumption is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in "mirrors". The cross between the invasion of body hijackers and mirrors and rather the average in it. The title would be "The Boring," because it portrays every scene for bloody ages. Or perhaps "The Confusing," because it does not explain anything, not in the story or in the story itself, just some vague idea of ​​evil copies and somesuch, affected by cheap horrors and deadly scenes, but nothing tangible. It's just wrong. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting and special effects are quite good, but this is not a difficult task again. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel unhappy, a little confused and maybe not at EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and do not look at this. Simply put, there are better thrillers.
