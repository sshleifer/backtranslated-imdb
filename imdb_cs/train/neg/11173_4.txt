If it was not for bad dialogs and script. I think the direction was really in contact with it. The actors tried to revive their characters. But eventually the thing that was really missing was a solid script to keep all the pieces together. I would highly recommend not to look at it. If you're not a fan of Al Pacino like me and I'll watch everything he's playing. Although the result is rather bad lately. This is after S1m0ne the second very bad movie for this actor, who once knew how to choose a role.
