It is often said that movies can never match the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the film so "good" as a book, but it is an insult to the book. I'd rather see the novel of Milan Kundera burning fire than that "something" that the director probably calls "adaptation." All the beautiful philosophy that asks, "Is it better to carry a heavy burden on my shoulders or to cope with the unbearable ease of being?" Is postponed, and instead all the movies deal with the sexual adventures of Daniel Day Lewis (I can not tell Tomas) with his foolish wife, his mistress and other mistresses. Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said that bad directors are making bad movies. Do not waste time and money. Read the book, it's worth it.
