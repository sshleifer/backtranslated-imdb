Swedish action movies have evolved over the past few years into something that imitates American hardcore action movies like "Heat," but with a low budget. This film follows the same rules as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that he is trying too hard to make a cool and hard film. The story was seen before, the dialogue feels artificially and the action is very bad, especially from the main actress. The film attempts to paint a picture of soldier robbers with heavy cooking without any reproach and investigators who have completely lost them with the problems of the past, but at the same time they are quite rational. It does not work well. <br /> <br /> The bluish photographic style does not seem fresh anymore, and it did not do well in this picture. Only very few scenes really look good. The sound is quite strange and sounds like a lot of real dialogue. I'm recording the main quality of this film Stefan Sauk, though he did not make the convincing portrait of the SWAT leader, has some really funny lines. Also, the music is pretty good.
