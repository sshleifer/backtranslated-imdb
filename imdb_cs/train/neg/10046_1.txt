I was not overwhelmed by Dante's first season, which offered "Homecoming," not a terrible story, but rather a clever political statement with the undead. The Screwfly situation is a story about a virus unleashed in the world that causes men's sexual effort to be replaced by murderous tendencies toward women. The episode begins with a short film explaining the way scientists have killed the propeller. Then there is a short scene when one is arrested when the bodies of women are discovered in their house. I suppose this is meant to show the beginning of the outbreak, but it is unclear because it never happens again. The episode comes for a moment with the misleading figures of the blah blah. It sounds cold and mysterious, but the episode stars worsen and worsen as they make their way forward to their sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
