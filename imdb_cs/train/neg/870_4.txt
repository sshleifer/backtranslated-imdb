At the end of this thriller, Alla Sheedy's frantic picture of the day is being used creatively to create more than one terribly bad image. She convinced that if she had such an unpleasant role as Bette Davis, she could do it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons why I can see it. If you were interested in what Sheedy looks like in two old fashioned glasses (but why would anyone?), Then here is your answer. After all, crazy woman Sally Kirkland, who is hungry for sex, is really difficult, and even if you like it more than I do, you have to admit that tensions are falling sharply during these scenes. Savage's drunk crude insurance agent is just as unpleasant, but at least it's a small role. From leading actors Nicholas Walker inspires no condolences for Paul Keller's misfortune, and his acting is wooden. Dara Tomanovic is better, and during her scenes with Sheedy the level is a bit rising. Sheedy's meticulous, compliant performance (though often appears to be an automatic pilot) is admirable in itself, but out of context with others. The sets are coarse, the camera works indiscriminately.
