Uninspired and undecided "new" Columbo, who sees man-in-the-mac attending his nephew wedding, just to make his bride disappear on their wedding night. Columbo examines ... And that's about it: indifferently rendered and surprisingly full of flat screen scenarios, given that it is written by Robert Van Scoey who wrote a very pleasant story of Columbo "Murder Under Glass" in the heyday of a detective; there is no murder to speak of, and the greatest amount of ingenuity that Colombo has provided to the screenwriter is the constriction of the suspects through photographs taken at the wedding, among which are all who have been there! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Insult to the history of the series, with a correspondingly acting soap-style. Very Excluded Things.
