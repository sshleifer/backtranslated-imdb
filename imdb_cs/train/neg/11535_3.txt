Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven career woman who raises the working class Danka Dyer for night entertainment. After a silly accident in the country they are brutally attacked. After recapturing and following an accidental encounter with one of the attackers, their thoughts turned to vengeance ... I thought Straighthead was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I did not like this phrase, I would say "Straighthead" video ugly. It was definitely the movie that would have no budget pass-through directly to the video during the dark eighties. Frankly, I do not know how "Straighthead" got a cinema. I do not mind sex and violence in movies but have to marry a film with a) a good plot or b) a good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straighthead" did not. No progress in plot or character and too many inexplicable and vague. Fortunately, "Straighthead" did not go anywhere quickly. It was only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It was a pity because there was a glimpse of an interesting movie that turned a particularly interesting one in the last third. How often do I say, but it would be good if it was done correctly. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they have nothing to do with this film. She is particularly underestimated (and is still particularly well suited). If you want to see good British film revenge, find or buy Shoane Meadows "Dead Man's Shoes". It's a small masterpiece. Last weekend I should have seen his "This is England" instead. What sera sera ...
