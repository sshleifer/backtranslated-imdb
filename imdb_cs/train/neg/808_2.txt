Extremely disappointed film based on James Michener's novel. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the performance of Marlon Brando. His south shot was ridiculous. Suddenly I laughed when he spoke as it sounded like an older South Bohemian lady who came home to go. Brando, so great in previous films, was reduced to laughter. Tyrone Power in "Proof of Prosecution" should be nominated for best actor instead of Brando. The film that deals with racism has dealt with an attempt by the US government to avoid marriage between American soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando had a stone face in the movie. His transition from anti-relationships to one will occur when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and legends were pleased to see how he could accept such new opinions. Only Mr. knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki have received Oscars for their performance. Nothing of the performance was as impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and nothing of what was obviously described. Miiko Taka, who has taken great care of Brand's loving interest, has done better in this film. She showed a great feeling as an anti-American who found love with Brando. Her face was carved out of the misfortune she had for the loss of her father and brother in World War 11. She realized her dance was not her way out of this existence that she lived. Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in the "Ten Commandments" first to the bigotted mother of Brand's Love. Her performance with Ricardo Montalban was useless. Patricia Owens, like Brand's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
