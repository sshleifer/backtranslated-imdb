Forgive me for being obvious, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course there are extremes in these two broad categories. Movies like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars are comfortably in good category. At the other end of the spectrum are those films that simply do not deserve to be named. Sometimes, however, someone produces a really sad film. A movie that should be featured as an illustration of how horrible a movie can be. The film is more than bad. Such a movie is Maiden Voyage. In short, Maiden Voyage is the story of a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a group of dirty criminals who demand ransom from the same evil ship owner. Of course, aboard is all American hero, complete with a chin and a carved chest that saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that opens up new depths. It's all wrong. Effect, direction and so-called plot are eagerly poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of every unfortunate viewer. Even an American spectator would be disturbed by his shortcomings. Yes, it's so bad. He will be tempted to compose a list of things that angered me about this film. However, his stupidity rather than a stupid conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I think. Imagine in your mind that you are a bad kidnapper and you stand in an open lifeboat on a quiet sea. You are in company with a hero who holds a whipping bomb. He said the hero threw a bomb and dived over the deck. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would drop the bomb as far as possible into the sea. Not this guy. He watches our hero swim and then tries to disarm the bomb with the unfortunate (for him) results. Enough was said. Such extinction would deserve a mention on the Darwin Awards website and could be an appropriate conclusion for the lives of the production team.
