It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so much difficulty in remembering his accent that he could not deliver his lines. The plot was definitely not worth the name of John Grisham. No wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters. I did not even want to watch the whole thing. I decided I did not care who did it, and then realized he did not care!
