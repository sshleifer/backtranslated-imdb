We brought this film as a joke to a friend and could be the worst joke. The film is hardly observable, and acting is terrible. The worst child's actor ever used, and Hasslehoff gave substandard performance. The story is shameful, and in the places where we were so bored, they were wondering what the hell was going on. They try to be spooky, but it's just ridiculous. Just terrible
