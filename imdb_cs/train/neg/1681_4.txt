Freeway Killer, is a madman who shoots people on the highway while screaming a lot of mystical singing on the phone. The police think she's a casual killer, but Sunny, a blonde hero played by Darlanne Fluegel, finds a sample. Likewise, he was a former cop, James Russo, joining forces and bodies in search of a thief who got rid of his spouses. Also played by Richard Belzer, this movie has its moments, especially if you like car chases but it's really not a good movie for the most part, check out if you're really bored and you've already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown, otherwise keep the highways.
