However, it is an amateur, exhibitionist film - or an effort for one - which is as interesting and courageous as the composite book of high school student moods full of the death of "poetry". It will certainly disturb audiences who are hell bounded by being concerned, but success will be credited to themselves, not to the director. To actually get under one's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent as well as eye and ear. The film contains one evocative image that is displayed as quiet (and also used on a video player), but without the development leading to or from it. If the director had an eye, he would see it as a possible starting point for an interesting film - that is for the film.
