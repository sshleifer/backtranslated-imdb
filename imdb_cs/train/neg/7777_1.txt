This could be a cute movie for kids. My grandson watched it once. he looked at it a second time when I was watching something with him. <br /> <br /> When a teddy bear loses on the iceberg and is in the water, he tries to get a piece of ice. "I do not want my 3 year-old grandson to watch movies with such words." <br /> <br /> That's why it's rated for kids. She should be child friendly. That's what I'd expect. eliminated by warner brothers and G rated I would expect it does not have the cuss words in it. In most places, the lyrics do not fit into the movie, as it seems later joined. And the film stretches in many parts.
