The premise of this film was pretty decent, but with a partial action it was just boring and boring. SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of death, it was accidental, though it was murder, it was not like he wanted to do it. Also, through some flashes, there is a secret that reveals that such events make justice to a certain extent. There is no emotion in this movie. In the first 20 minutes is only this woman who calls her sister and hears her message. It was boring and boring. Some polishing and better acting could be quite good.
