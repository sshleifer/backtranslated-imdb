Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing wrong with the film. Even if he never made a masterpiece to B. Mattei, he used his work with a bit of humor and foolishness that made him entertaining director Eurotrash. But in the last 10 years it seemed to have lost it. This film is simply empty, nothing to awaken us from a deep sleep, into which you will sink after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (that's probably about a snooker?), No actors, no dialogs as bad as a 90'TV movie. It's even worse than his last cannibals and zombie epics. So relax Bruno, stay in our mind forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as: Zombie 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro inferno, Virus, cruel jaws and a few others. So if you do not want to see B Mattei, who has a new film of the spirit of Jess Franco, to pass this. I do not know how a beautiful craft career was watching old movies and having fun.
