I went to this with great expectations. Unfortunately, the dialogue is totally stupid and the overall film is not far from inspiration or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic of behavior behavior. Today's children need creative stories to inspire them, making them a "charming" event. It has just happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars ten years ago. (How many children did they represent becoming Jedi Knights and lighting their own lights?) Do not waste your time and money on this.
