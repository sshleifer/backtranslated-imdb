I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested in how he did it as a writer / director. I could not be more disappointed with this jump. The film was so incoherent, and the cinematography was so hot that I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. The actors were very good, but it was such a loss of talent. Not all actors are treated as writers or directors, and clearly Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the movies I've ever seen in 50 years, it's the worst film ever. Please do all of your work, Mr Hopkins, and keep yourself in the acting that you are excellent and let them write and direct those who are talented in these areas. If I gave less than one film, I would definitely do it.
