Okay, allow me the new word: polyphobia: fear of polyamoral relations. It's another one in a long line of films that start by telling the audience about some kind of trio just to turn to the dime and go out with all the preaching about how necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamous solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the pleasure of loving more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Lightning. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: after several decades, polyphobia will be as big a faux-pas as homophobia, but guess who's too close to realize it? This is the first time: the producers of this film. And so much they like. Why even make the ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned type of such a movie? He seems to be open-minded with gay, completely ignoring the fact that we live in an age when monogamy turns into a gradual monogamy that gradually turns into swinging and polyamoric. Open your eyes, people, please! This is disappointing, the fly running. (But damn, I have to say Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive.) 3 of 10.
