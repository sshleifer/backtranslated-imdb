This is a bad film B masquerading as mockumentary. Porn filmmaker has almost as much screen time and dialogue as any other character. It totally destroyed any "documentary feeling" he might have wanted to create. The fact that the film is not really a mercantile is the slightest problem. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film has nothing to justify the porn business. It's not even strange. While there is simulated sex, the amount of nudity is mild for the R rated movie. Sometimes, someone will be a good mockumentary about porno industry. It is not.
