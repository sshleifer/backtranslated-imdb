I had a "privilege" to take part in the special screening "Absence of Light" at the Ohio Horror Convention. First you know that you have trouble when the director introduces the film, saying: "Now keep in mind that we did not have much money ..." Not that budget-free movies are bad, but when the filmmaker uses them as an excuse, the results are always bad . And there is no better example than this undignified sleep-fest. <br /> <br /> In fact, "Absence of Light" is the first in the world of underground cinema: It's the only time I've seen what dream I was taking from talented genre vets. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd, and Reggie Banister accidentally enter and leave the film and prove they are as unattractive as non-amateur names. Who are their characters? What is it talking about? Who cares? Everything is so boring, you stop worrying about anything or anyone. After thirty minutes of the endurance test, I surrendered and left the theater. No wonder most of the cast occupied. <br /> <br /> Every curious fan of genre would do well to stay away from it. With some luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
