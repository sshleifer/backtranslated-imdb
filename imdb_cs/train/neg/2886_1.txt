Terrible, terrible, terrible, do not waste money renting this movie. It's like a low budget for Canadian TV. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen and there were many more. This movie is not worth it to be inserted into a DVD player or VCR. : ~ (It is possible to write ten lines? The game was terrible, there was absolutely no flow, I saw a movie for TT killer BTK and it was much better (compared to this) what are they going to produce this film, but if we was to educate or tell the story of the BTK killer who escaped them a kilometer. It seemed to be more infomercial for animal rights.
