I participated in one of the premieres last night and I have the following comments: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you have been directing a bunch of music videos, you NEVER ever give the skills to shoot movies. The film had surpluses of persistent shots that did not make sense, terrible angles and terrible lighting. Editing did not help. When "Dixie" appears late in the memorial service, her mother told herself about her hands, but it is never clear what the hell he is talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The story had a promise, but the scenario was thin and full of Ford Truck holes. We can never understand what drives the characters, what really counts for the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how it is solved. Sixteen years of distance is destroyed in 4 days by seemingly magic. Deep conversations were nasty stupid clichés. (In fact, the whole city was one big cliché of southern life.) Half of the listeners groaned as Toby drew, "I got my blood that was flowing in your veins ..." and we were not interested in that ruthless line once, but TWICE! The revelation was yawning and the dramatic confessions melted away "I was stupid and stubborn". <br /> <br /> 3. The game was fine due to the wreck of the script they had to work with. Toby was dark and he loved most of the film, but when he smiled and brightened, he was charming. It's a shame he did not have that time on the screen. Kelly Preston's actor cake is very rusty and it shows. Lindsay Haun is talented and definitely not her guilty writers have made her character so insurmountable that you do not blame your father for not finding her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make this film more, but they seemed more or less lost. (And indeed, their characters will be lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you are a fan of Toby, you will love songs. Often, however, the film felt like a scene that was only enforced to include one of its songs - or an artist on its record label. For example, the official love song of the film is "Crash Here Tonight". Do you think it will play around a gentle love scene, but nope ... we hear it about 45 seconds when it goes to the commemorative service. It was as if they were saying, "Well, we have to use this song somewhere." The song "Broken" is scary and the best of the movie. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell ... the promising conspiracy never unfolds and the film is terribly unequal as it is trying hard to be a vehicle for music and Toby Keith's product for Ford Trucks. It is that people are rebuilding broken bridges to try to be a force of music, but the story is so badly that both points are lost in this overwhelmed music video. I like Toby and really like "Broken Bridges," but the people he relied on to shoot him deserve one of his famous shoes where you know.
