So "Thinner" ... Yeah .. Steven Bachman (reads Steven King) yarn about a man who gets only his desserts from the gypsy elder he just killed, The story itself is there, I have no doubt about it but I do not know why I he did not like more than I could. I think what really upset me was the actors. I mean, who's the main one? Robert John Burke? Who is it? And let's say loud, can anyone stop hiring Joseph Mantegno for every Italian Mafia role? And when we're on that, must every mafia have to have Italian pasta cooking pasta? The only good acting that's going on here is less than 10 pounds of make-up, Michael Constantine as a gypsy elder. It's pretty good. But the rest of you all do, "better actors ..."
