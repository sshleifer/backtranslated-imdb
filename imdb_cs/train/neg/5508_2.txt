Tim (Gary Daniels) is desperately trying to get into serious TV reporting. When the work he begs for is wrong, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) also says kaononara. After returning home Tim is surprised that his house has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! To call his uncle Martin, Tim will soon try to help his new friend move on the ground. But Martin gets into trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry and more. Beautiful Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to make time with Tim, but this is not the case of true love. Soon everyone on TV watches Tim, hoping to have a story about a real alien. What should one do? For those who have loved an old television show of the same name, along with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy to bind proverbial boots. It's really, no doubt horrible, no conspiracy, and relying on the supposed special effects that have fallen into the plane. Daniels is alright, but Lloyd is just terrible as a stranger who overcomes the storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as well as costumes, set and production details. Even if your kids see the cover and beg for this movie, make sure they choose another movie in the video store. Make sure kids and adults find this film a colossal hole, so they decide for a night in a museum or around the world in 80 days.
