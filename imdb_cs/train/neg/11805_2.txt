Watch the original with the same name since 1944! This is for a television movie, it's just scary! Although it uses (if I can say) almost the same dialogue, it just does not work! Is it acting, poor director? OK, so it's for television, but why are you looking at a bad copy when you can get your hands on a great original? Especially how you will be disappointed in the conspiracy and you will not enjoy the original as much as if you were watching it first! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that differ from the original (it's shorter) but all are worse! The actors who play here simply do not fit into the account! You just do not believe them and who could play Edward G. Robinson on the original performance? If you want, observe it only after you have seen the original, and even you will be very brave if you look at it! It's almost seductive!
