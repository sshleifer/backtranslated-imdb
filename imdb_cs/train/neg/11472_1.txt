Everything about this movie was terrible. Beginning with this film was a pretty good cast, and I find it impossible to fit it so well into the greatest disaster of the genre of gangster film at all. The soundtrack was like one of the very poor tattoo comedy. He had this music all over the film and it became quite irritating.
