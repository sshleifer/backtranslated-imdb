I remembered this show since I was a child. I could not remember much, just a few tiny things about the characters. for some reason I remembered that it was really intense. it also was on a very early morning in PA. Finally, after a long look at the site, I found an episode. the first episode no less. Criminey! This show was so terrible. it was of course only shown that children play labels and have a great time. The show opens with Bhodi if his mom says "My names are not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" then we are forced to watch children who play a laser shield on the song "Legs Relaxed". and not just a little, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just to think about it. oh yeah, and as if I could not get worse, you can not even see the laser rays from their weapons. it's like they're just running on the whole song "Free Feet". later after the bhdi arrive in the universe or where they sometimes have a bad laser fight against Phil Collins's song "su-su-sudio." ah, believe me, you do not want the rest to know. what can i say ...... LIGHT LIGHTS !!!!!!!!!!!
