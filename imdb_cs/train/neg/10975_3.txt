This movie blows - let's go right now. There are several scenes of precious stones stored inside a pile of hell, but no one can redeem an unconscious plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 monkeys" and acts in a similar way. Normally, I hate Colin because he's fine, but he's fine in this movie. There were two lines in this film - one about a boy who throws rock through the windscreens of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's look at it - this film has no phrasing idea of ​​what she wanted to say or where she wanted to go. Story character characters intersect at some levels, but they are by no means evaluated as part of the script. The whole thing is weak and unnecessary and then it is a casual scene OK. But overall - Do not bother if you do not like Irish accents so much that you can watch the mediocrity and is rescued by all who sound like an elf Happy Charms - an American fetish who once catapulted some really miserable movies to success.
