This is not one of those reviews of bad special effects or technologies, or of data about problems that only the most difficult people could relate to, but rather a narrative story telling that most of us really care about. The conspiracy is a combination of Allied and German naval forces from World War II and two civilians (hero and heroine) who are connected to the German U boat and end up in a wild dinosaur country. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Manipulation is not so bad by film standards, and we know from a conspiracy that realism will not be high. What movies like this need are trustworthy and sympathetic figures, along with some reasoning in the activities. This film lacks both. For full-length movies, only 6 characters are available, and 3 of them are hardly seen. McClure's hero is out of "routine" and does not make much sense at any time. The woman seems to be looking for a answer to the puzzle about the dinosaur land they have entered, but the puzzle is not a lot of puzzles and we could take care less. Lots of failure in the movie, which should be better, even in his time.
