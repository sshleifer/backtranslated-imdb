What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions are awarded to "special Hollywood effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or sound. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> I've seen these films (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to go and have fun with. It is quite long and boring. But I suspect that due to the lack of some land development, I do not think it's very well educated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it moved around what they are doing - as a result, the groups seem to be folding around forests for any particular reason and coming to it. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this movie more stars for some way with me creating more empathy and developing the depth of character, but somehow all my characters were still alien. The stars he gets are realistic and show the fears of guerrilla warfare.
