The film, Universal Edition of Protelco-MLC, is a boring narrative of the theory of breaking the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in the cell as "pure energy" and sending it back to "the target area." There is no explanation for why this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner played by the auspicious actor Bryant Haliday, Devil Doll) thinks it's something to do to his and his assistants, Pat Pee (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell Ronald Allen, lives. During his experiment with the famous Dutch scientist Lembach (Gordon Heinz), his machine failed because of sabotage, so his "secretary" himself, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), "attempted" to try to take revenge. Of course he's going to get up and he's going to get out like a "pork roast" with the force of electrolysis people. <br /> <br /> With this new power, some of Cockney's idiots, security boys named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and their head of the Dr. Lab. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He is also able to penetrate into a pharmacy and also steal rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> Eventually, though Hill and Mitchell tried to help him, the clown would destroy his equipment and himself. Overall, this is a totally insignificant film that does not contain any news at all. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing colorful movies you've ever seen.
