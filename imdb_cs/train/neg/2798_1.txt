This movie is bad. If you think there is only one decent scene in the movie, it takes about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's fearless scene). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think playing in high school probably works better. Drawing does not make sense at all. The set was nice and it was not good to have fun. It was just boring and very bad! I saw it at Starz, so I thought it must be at least decent. The miniature description sounded as if it were okay. Your girlfriend is probably killing at the beginning of the movie, after you have to look at some awful music video. The transitions between the scenes are very surprising, and as someone just put in the clips a clip tone without thinking about how to convert them. It's just shooting from one scene to another without smoothness. Something like my accidental transition from talking about how bad a movie is is to explaining why the story lies. The sound gets worse at some points, where you hardly hear it, then it sounds aloud with gay "horror screams" that plunge into random spots in the movie. It's always the same sound. This is officially the worst movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Story: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Slipper: 1 000 000/10
