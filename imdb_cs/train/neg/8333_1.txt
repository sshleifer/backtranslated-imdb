This is by far the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The game is bad and the plot is almost incomprehensible. Whether you like rescue boats or any boat is not important. As for the special effects, the film has none. The entire movie crew was probably on a boat in the rugged seas rather than in the studio and when some men are "stabbing" (if you can even say them), their reactions are totally unreal. Weapons are quieter than mute. As this film can have two awards, it raises serious questions about the state of the human mind. That's it. This review is probably much more fun than watching the movie. If someone is considering watching or buying, I would seriously advise you for understandable reasons. I said it contained a spoiler. If the fact is that some people are stabbed and the gun is burned, the parcel is the president. I suppose this is because they are the only good parts of the film.
