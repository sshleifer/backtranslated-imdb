This third Pok√©mon movie is too abstract for younger children to follow and to repeat the older children too. The film's message - about dealing with the loss - is ruined by the return of a young girl's father during film credits. The team rocket provides fun, but they are not part of a small conspiracy, so they do not seem too often.
