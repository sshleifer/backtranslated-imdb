Against All Hope is a very badly created, sometimes painful, movie. This is Michael Madsen's first film, and it shows he's not good at it. Some people can laugh at this story; an alcoholic realizes that his life and family are falling apart, calling the preacher as the last help for help. After telling the preacher about his story, he accepts Jesus Christ into his heart. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found many religious scenes, as when Cecil Moe (Madsen) went to church but left him quite realistic. I also liked Cecil knowing that his life is collapsing and trying to get help, but realizes that only God can help. In the end, he realizes that with the help of God he can live his life without being drunk. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at all produced. The game is bad, the script can work and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you become a Christian does not mean that you will automatically be able to stop the addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realizes it and works hard to stay on the right path. Overall, if your Christian appreciates how this movie portrays Christianity, and if you are not, you can learn that you are called to learn more about the faith.
