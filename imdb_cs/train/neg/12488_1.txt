0.5 / 10. This movie has nothing good. Acting is one of the worst things I have ever seen, which is really amazing, it is that everyone is terrible, not just a couple here and there, everyone. Direction is a joke, a low budget is hopelessly obvious, the score is terrible, I do not think the movie was edited, brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase. Combines serial killing, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It's not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly flawed. I laugh badly all over. Writing was terribly wrong. Cinematography is really cheap and sometimes very granular, and working with the camera is terrifying. Again what the movie really does is how much the actors are. Raw.
