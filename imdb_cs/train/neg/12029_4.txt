Generally, I find that if you do not see a movie before you see it on a DVD, it's probably a good reason. I have never heard of this movie until I was in Blockbuster the next day and I saw it on the shelf. Since all the good movies have been leased (those I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I'd shoot this. <br /> <br /> Actually, it does not differ much from other genre films like The Singles Ward or RM If you get into those types of movies, you'll probably enjoy it. <br /> <br /> But if you are not a mormon, this movie will probably not appeal to you. There is no way to avoid the apparently religious (Mormon) message contained within, and sometimes it becomes sappy and cheese. Finally, if you do not fall into the demographic area of ​​Mormons, you will probably better watch something else. <br /> <br /> It is true that the movies were very entertaining moments, but I did not think it was enough to save the film altogether.
