I wonder how much this film really has to do with the Bachelor Party movie in 1984, where Tom Hanks plays. Is this film even an official sequel? This movie lacks every department, and you obviously do not see it better. For a comedy, this movie is simply not good enough or funny. It mostly relies on the character of their stereotypical ratings, rather than the film actually represents some good, original and fun moments. <br /> <br /> Of course there is also a very small story present and a naked breast movie than the script pages. Just wait for the things to start. There's a major story line somewhere, but she's so terribly incomprehensible, and she's so badly executed in the movie that she feels more like it does not exist. I think there is even a message and a moral story in it somewhere, but it is again terribly non-original and badly done in the movie that it simply does not work. It's basically a typical teenage comedy, with lots of sexual jokes and nudes, only without teenagers, making the story even more sad and delicious. The movie makes some really bad jokes that are lost for some type of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to have a look at it sometimes. <br /> <br /> 3/10
