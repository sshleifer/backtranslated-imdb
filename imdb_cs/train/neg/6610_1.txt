This movie should not be watched because it was a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to do this remake of the classic Bollywood movie "Sholay", but after problems with the original designers, he decided to continue the project and ... I think I will leave all the good parts of the film (acting, script, songs, music, etc.) out and filming just because we have already hired the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After filming movies such as Rangeel, Satya, and Society, he pulled out Coppola (Godfather); What did you think of RGV? Anyway, the story is, although it's hard to watch, it's almost like an old tendon. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, the new kid on the block to play Ajay (Jay, sholay). Both "bad but fun" friends help the cop first capture the bad guy. Later in the movie, the Officer Officer now hires them as personal security and protection from the hands of the much-wanted Bubbana played by Amitabh Bachan. If you have not seen Bollywood movies, good boys will eventually win. There I saved you the 3 precious hours of your life!
