Reverend Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the studio of the collector of the ancient Max (Vincent D'Onofria) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valerie Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, controls Jack and binds him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000.00 to protect him from negotiating antique "Spanish judges" with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior) who comes with his retarded girlfriend who believes he is from Mars to create a backup team. However, Jack twice crosses the collector and then intruders Jack, Jamie and Piece. The low budget "Spanish judges" is a film with a sensible screenplay with the terrible conclusion that it loses good occupation. Valeria Golino is stunningly beautiful but, along with good actor Vincent D'Onofrit, they are not able to save a stupid story. Still, the scenes to be funny, unfortunately do not work, and in fact they are stupid and not entertaining. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All for Money")
