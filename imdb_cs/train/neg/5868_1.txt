Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Low productive value, the idea of ​​a horrible story, a bad screenplay, a bleak act ... and I can not even come up with an adjective well-descriptive of how bad Joan River is. I know that hell is a special place for people who funded this movie. just below the level reserved for genocidal maniacs that are scaring off children. <br /> <br /> This movie is a murder. <br /> <br /> (Stunning) x (infinity) = Rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at any cost. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not even funny how bad it is.
