This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. At all. Time. In fact, I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this violent movie. Unbelievably boring, badly committed, dirty scripting, often disjointed and too many scenes that apparently have no relation to the overall movie (like when priesthood partner Heath Ledger got on the wall with a spirit ... what was the point in that scene? ...) <br /> <br /> I should have a medal for keeping this movie because it's all running. I'd rather go to the slaps than to look at this movie again. <br /> <br /> It should be packed into the IMDb 100. Let's hope that my vote of 1/10 will help.
