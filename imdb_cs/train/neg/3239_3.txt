Oh, the infamous "Guinea Pig" ... I have to say honestly that I'm the whole series ("Never Die," "Mermaid in the Shaft" and "Flower from the Blood" are exceptions ... and not even you are not great at all ...), but the "Devil's Experiment" simply blows in. There is nothing realistic that would look different than the peak (or perhaps anti-climatic, depending on how you see it) eye spot. the victim does not really care about what is happening, and barely whines or wails while being subjected to "horrible" (often sometimes "merry") torture. "The Flesh of Flesh and Blood" is a more violent and cruel depiction of a fake "sneaky" material, but this film is also falling to a realistic level, and I appreciate the Japanese for pushing the boundaries and for the last two decades they really came to wear the crown in an "extreme" movie, but Devil's Experiment just does not hold. with if you're useless, if for a different reason than to see what the upbeat is, I can just give this film extreme happiness 3/10, just for the needle scene ...
