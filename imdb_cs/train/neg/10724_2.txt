it is a perfect example of something great that is going badly ... so can I advise someone who can watch it? (I still can not believe it will win) .. and I stayed only for the end because the director was there for q and section ... but that was also something interesting .. what is it about? and the first half (worth watching) is three characters: a peddler, a musician and some kind of clerk .. the first two lie about their professions but the third is a real liar .. the other half (do something different .. do not ruin a good evening) breasts and heavy drinking .. but maybe you will see it quite differently ... the judges beat (they drank vodka?)
