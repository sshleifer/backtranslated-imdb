The most difficult nonsense I've seen long ago. Give was full of irrelevance and acting was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To make it even worse, cameras were used that made me feel sick, accidental music was terrible, and drowned the dialogue (maybe it was not a bad thing), and the San Francisco shots seemed to be stolen directly from promotional video of the city's tourist board. <br /> <br /> And the mandatory sex scene was not even half done well. Better lighting next time, please.
