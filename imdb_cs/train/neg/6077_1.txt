Would anyone really want to watch this RUBBISH if it does not include little kids running naked? From the movie point of view, it is probably one of the worst movies I've ever met. Some people woke up one day and thought I was going to make a movie with little girls and call them art, stick them in nature and do not need a story or an explanation of how they got there or why they did not appear to live anywhere or have parents because movies do not need such a thing . I want to comment on the rest of the film, but I did not take spoilers, so I just say I avoid, I avoid avoiding and find the right film
