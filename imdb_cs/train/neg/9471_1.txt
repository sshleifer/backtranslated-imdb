Do not get me wrong, I assumed that this movie would be stupid, frankly, I gave him an incredibly low level to meet. The only reason I even saw her was that there were lots of girls (another story for another time). When I started watching what I noticed was a terrible movie. Now there are two types of horror, it's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends are sitting and laughing and joking about how terrible it is, and then there is such a movie. The cat in my hat could not even create a momentary interest in me. When I watched the first part, it was not bored only bored, but I felt I was somehow disturbed by the horror of this film. Mike Myers is usually great, I love most of his work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that changed directors / producers / writers / whatevers was that they refused to use any color of the original book (red, black, white) for any character but for a cat. Randomly or not, they also refused to capture any original (and it does not matter that I use this word but it fits) the zaniness of the original. The book was like Sunday's cold blood, colorful and tasty, and the film was about as fearless and heavy as a sawdust. Avoid it just like a prostitute.
