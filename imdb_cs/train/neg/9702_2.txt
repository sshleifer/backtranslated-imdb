I do not think this movie was rated correctly. I took a copy and blacked the PG rating and wrote R. I would not rate it for anyone under the age of 17 or 18 regardless of the limit of R. Why? It contains a jungle scene with several homeless people from India. I do not know about you, but that's not something the kids would watch. It is true that this could be the traditional "style of dress" of the African (?) Indians, but ... I think partial nudity should give the movie rating R. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie recently but I think otherwise, it was okay.
