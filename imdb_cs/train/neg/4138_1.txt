Although it will be a good movie because I like zombies and horror films in general. But I did not think it would be a piece like it was. The only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and gets a crazy car behind him! The film looks like it's written by the director and filled with porn actors, I never would have told them actor! Costumes seem to be stolen from the local school game. It looks like a road movie with almost no monsters. There is no fun in this piece of shit, just a horror, but not the way the director intended. I'd rather be raped pedophile than ever before to see this movie! ugh!
