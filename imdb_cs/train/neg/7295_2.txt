First of all because I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He himself can get ten stars for trying to save this totally worthless attempt to shoot a movie. I was initially all released when reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this film gave "the performance of his career." For me, it was an incredible performance of Stevens, who completely destroyed this movie, so I was ready to prepare all sorts of insults with the one who made the above comment. Then I thought what Stevens had done? So I checked and, you know, the guy was absolutely right. During the 17 years since the filming of Columbo, it seems that each of the 33 Stevens projects at that time was a total crap, so it is doubtful that someone even saw the rest of his career. If you like Columbo, look at each of the 69 titles before watching this. Make a favor and save the worst for the last.
