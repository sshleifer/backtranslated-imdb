After 30 seconds you already realize that there is no real budget for this cheap reflection. The story is taken from great movies such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills Have Eyes". I like such movies even though they are duplicated well (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But Side Sho is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is blessed and the music is stupid and completely lost. You do not really care what happens to the characters. So-called bad people are also not at all interesting and rather stereotypical. So what about blood and gore? But there is some, though it is relatively inexpensive and the action is performed very badly. 2 Points, just for gore and blood, but they understand that it's hardly worth seeing, even for gore-hounds ..
