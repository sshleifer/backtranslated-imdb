The stalled saga "not realizable in the army", which attempts to be both surreal (foreign subtitles) and vulgar (gout), but eventually ends up as a mixture of many different types of humor, none of which followed very successfully. Barbara Bach, Bond Girl of "The Spy Who Loved Me," has only two or three short scenes. What a shame! (* 1/2)
