Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi movie (although I think it is now called Syfy?) I've ever seen. But since then I have seen one or two more and I can tell you they are stupid, but this really scratches the bottom of the barrel. CGI is going wrong, acting is bad, scenario is ridiculous and what's going on at the end is unexpected and out of place (if you saw Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I did not want to put the spoiler in my review). In addition, there was one music melody that was used in almost every dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; play it over and over again. And definitely not original; I know I've heard it somewhere (I just do not remember where). This is one thing to avoid.
