I rarely give a less stupid review to a show or movie that I do not like about IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just terribly horrible, it's terrible. I would not care if it was an animated series - it would be better, as I think, but as a live action show, typically the terms "cheese" and "campy". This is the Rangers. Five multicolored spandexes worn by teenagers fight evil with their martial arts. Costumes are scary - they look like something that reminds what sportswomen and gymnast women wear. The game is overwhelming and the fighting choreography is so shocking that it's so bad to see that Jean-Claude Van Damme looks just as good as Bruce Lee, which is in itself underestimated. In fact, they look like they are jumping and dancing; like it was some version of "Nutcracker", or they were ballet, rather than fighting. In addition, there are some cartoons that contain martial arts, but it is fun - yet not so delicious that it looks stupid. Children will show up or not, it's just so chrome and on the verge of absurdity. And while this version is set in America, you might be forgiven for thinking that when you watch some of the combat sequences that were not filmed in the US but rather in Japan; so some "fake" fights and shots borrowed from the Japanese version - only to be built next to the American version. If you like it, then hold Sentai - the Japanese equivalent.
