The anticipation of this expected sequel was really good, and after the remarkable success of the remake I was very honest. The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and awkward. The situation is stupid and out of reason and acting is really terrible. <br /> <br /> This time, unlike remak, there are no sympathetic characters or violins. Gore is not that abundant, and when it happens, it's really bad. Violence is minimal and it is a shame because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for heavy violence. I think there is a SWAT team that is catching a family of cannibal mutants. Surely you expect something else! When I was watching the movies, I wanted my money back. In any case, this is a clear example of how nasty films prove to be a mess and show poor quality in all respects. <br /> <br /> A mess that left remake fans like me. That is why continuation is never welcomed; at least this film is not as bad as the continuation of 1985 to the original.
