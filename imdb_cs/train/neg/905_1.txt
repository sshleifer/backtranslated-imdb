A unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) gets pregnant with a rich man (Stephen Collins). She offers her to take her out of her sense of commitment, but she turns him off and decides to raise herself. Things are fine until a child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things get worse (and predictably). I saw the silent version and the sound version of "Stella Dallas". Neither did much affect me (and I was crying easily), but they were well made if they were dated. Trying to make it happen in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think Midler had enough strength to do so after the incomprehensible success of the "Beach". This (predictably) bombed. The story is ridiculous and dated by today's standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado are doing good, this movie is really moving and I'm bored to the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in supporting roles. Flimsy and boring. Really - who thought it would work? Instead, use version 1937 Stanwyck. I give it 1.
