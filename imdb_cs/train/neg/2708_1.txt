This film is masked as a social commentary when it is actually as absurd as racism itself, which it condemns. Movie premise: African American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst is when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish man. The Jewish man, in a stereotypical way, falls apart in fear and begins to beg for his life ... but the great, strong and defiant Omar Epps stands firmly, fearlessly. We also have condemnation of every member of the brotherhood as an arrogant prepank of drunk or violent. The abused white girl, of course, is beginning to think about lesbian because she is, after all, a weak white girl. When a crazy fool is rejected by members of the fraternity, he must of course enter into skinheads, who are incredible cowards; a particularly big muscular guy who is quickly beaten by strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES EXPAND HIS HUMAN HIS SIZE ??? Yeah, right. Of course black men NEVER refuse their own people and Omar Epps is moving with them easily. The scenes at which the Ice Cube is threatened by their white roommate and keeping them alive are simply stupid - of course, dominant, while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually go out. This movie was horrible, and I could end up out loud. The relatively slow slowness between Epps and Banks is cheerful with the faces they do - it's like watching my nephew and cousins ​​face to face (and everyone under 5). Make a favor and skip this.
