Absence of good land, absence of good behavior, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, lack of decent appearance SPECIAL EFFECTS ... must I continue? Reviews can contain SPOILERS. It seems that actors I READ their line, not so well. Most "actors" behaved as if they were playing in the second stage. The story looked like it was written by one of the above two graders ... it's not really all that is complicated ... it's so simple and DUMB that you think something has to be missing so she thinks she's tangled . No, it's not, it's just as simple as you think it is. DRAW THE "film", that's how I knew it STUNK! Most of the movie was simply sitting by people sitting around (reading their lines) and trying to look ominous. The narrator was ANNOYING. "Special Effects" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can say they are not getting paid or not getting repaid because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it . I love Tony Todd ... however, he was just adequate in this film. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only in for two minutes (seriously)! I would suggest that the DVD be quickly shifted to the two-minute segment of Tony Todd. If I went to the theater and paid more than DOLLAR to see this movie, I would have asked for money. Hopefully, the people who did it will be better next time.
