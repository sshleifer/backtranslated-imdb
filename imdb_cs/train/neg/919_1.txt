Although I have to admit that I was more laughing to watch this movie than the last few comedies I've seen. The budget had to consist of a pocket shift from actors. Production values ​​are so low that the real ones have caused entertainment. It reminds me of Robot Monster, made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the unfortunate victims get their hands and feet cut off. Geez, hard to believe, but the black knight scene from the Holy Grail was more realistic. I was still interested in why the victim did not start crying "No one should go through" and "It's just a wound from my body, I've got worse." It was one of the most fun scenes I had seen last year. <br /> <br /> "Gladiator / Daemon" was also a stitch. Between the scary costume and the odd look of the guy, the end result was hysterical. It's really a movie that's bad enough to be observable. Something like seeing the slow car crash in the movie. <br /> <br />
