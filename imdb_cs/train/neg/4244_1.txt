Contrary to my principles, let me first come to the conclusion because I just saw this piece of "art" and I still have a strong impression. The reader is asked to justify my stronger vocabulary. Well, this movie is totally terrible and I would never bother to write a single word about it if it was not that "44 minutes" caused me to be sick to death, which is rarely happening. The fact that I paid for it does not make me feel better, just as the fact that the film deserves a high user rating. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? She has a fashion title - "44 minutes". One is first thinking about "15 minutes," which is, by the way, a much better film, but still bad in his book, and can really be compared to a certain extent. But how lucky it should be, what they share is their worst qualities. Both represent Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who, with his strong Russian accent, obviously meets popular expectations and prejudices. Its aim is to address the idea of ​​the Cold War. Oh, we miss old good times. Now I do not imply that he is a bad actor, I still do not intend to judge his real performance, but he is simply not here, he is more of an archetype. How anyone can afford such things is completely out of my mind. We can recognize modern American xenophobia. The point in the film, when Taktarov explains to his companion that Romanians are not Germans and that they are in America, is really ridiculous. Can we assume that the greatest desire of the miserable duo is to become "true" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there is a problem with the media. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews, and reporters. The director was supposed to feel the rhythm assumed for 44 minutes. Instead, we are bored with interviews all over the movie, like in cheap television shows, trying to re-discover the bike. In 15 minutes the question of the media is a central theme. The point is presented in such a way that the teacher asks the blunt student, but deserves a special comment, we are focusing on 44 minutes. So I'm trying to determine the purpose of this movie. What is it? Give visitors a good time? Celebrate your weapons? Celebrate the police? Render violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the minor. So it must, after all, promote peace and understanding? I think so, but do not ask me. I just know I did not like it. Oh, Michael Madsen. I admit I'm a big fan. I hoped it would be a clear point, but I was wrong. But it is not his fault. <br /> <br /> As a last note, comparing "firing power" with "will" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am pure, unmeasured 1 to 10 on scale 1-10.
