3-D featured in "The Man Who Not There" means DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This awkward comedy contains bad 3-D effects that make the 3-D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday 13th Part 3" a better comparison. Not to mention that the movie is so extreme. It was one of the many 1983 films that included pop-off-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were imprisoned in this mess, but at least they did not kill their career. Tambor will play on HBO "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's Treasury smash "How the Grinch Christmas Stole" while Guttenberg followed this flop with Police Academy and Cocoon. What is in those projects instead of them in "Men Who Was Not There". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
