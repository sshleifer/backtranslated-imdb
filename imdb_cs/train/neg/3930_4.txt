The Second Renaissance, Part 1, will show how the machines first revolted against people. Everything begins with the only case in which machines claim they have the right to live the same way, while people say the robot is something they own and therefore they can do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> While it's an interesting prerequisite, the story has been really stupid since then (violent!) Between robots and humanity. Somehow it does not seem right, as another reviewer points out, it's a little too clever. Animatrix stories that stay close to the core matrix (especially Osiris) work for the best. As for the second Renaissance part 1, I say she is too violent and too stupid. 4/10.
