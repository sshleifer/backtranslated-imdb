The sequel in 1973, "Walking Tall," continues into a dramatic drama about Sheriff Buford Pusser in Tennessee, but this installment plays like lame TV-movie. Bo Svenson takes the lead role from Joe Don Baker, but is too mild to him; he comes as an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors such as Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui have done very little work. I give the film one star exactly based on my good intentions, but the scenario is a transparent and lazy mass of routine problems and production is cheaper. It was followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall," and in 1978 by "Real American Hero".
