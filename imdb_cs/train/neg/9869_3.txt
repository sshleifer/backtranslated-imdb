The film did not care, the book was better. Does anyone know where she was filmed? *** this was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a dummy, but I think I will still be making comments. and yes, British Columbia is beautiful *** Or why did they take it from South Carolina's coastal setting? (This question stands) The site was essential to the text of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the film. Oh, I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here's my other major film problem. Kim Bassinger was too useless, and what I imagined from the book. I know the book was a book and a movie; well not so well. I found the character in the book much more empathic. The book also produced a rustic, almost primitive painting of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it disrupted the feel of the story and looked inconsistent with the characters.
