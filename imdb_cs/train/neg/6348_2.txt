Extremely demanding nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most of the cast would not have ever performed in her older Allen films. And I have to listen to the unsuccessful Will Ferrell, who makes his imitation of Woody Allen, despise me even more. It seems that the dead 70-year-old Allen should bounce off work when the clock began to stand in the new century. I really tried to get involved in the movie, but it was simply impossible; my snyapses could not burn slowly. So, rather than spitting and killing the afternoon in my sleep in an upright position, I got up and left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where I had a really good book to read it again (George Bailey's big smile thirty years ago, "The Germans "). The whole day finally turned out, not thanks to Woody.
