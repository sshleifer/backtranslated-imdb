Last weekend I bought this "zombie movie" from the bargaining basket and watched it with friends who thought it would be the budget version of "Land of the Dead". Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It looks like they've spent a large part of their cover-art budget, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. where zombie pups come alive and get into the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of anything talking about a cell phone. They really talk to a guy before one of the girls kills him; but as soon as they started to drive, I could not stop my distrust. Some people see it as "so bad, it's good," they're liars. I did not finish the movie, but one of the other reviews says they were at the end of the film, becoming a police officer, which makes me happy that I have not seen him all the time. <br /> <br /> It's even worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT OVERHEAD!
