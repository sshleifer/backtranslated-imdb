I have been watching horror films since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then I've seen good horror movies and bad, but that's undoubtedly the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The conspiracy was simply idiotic. Besides, it was just the gore. I can sue a lot of blood, but it was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, the character at the back end punches and dies with the intestine! Plain silly! Another problem with this film is that its boring and probably the slowest film ever. The end is simply stupid. But again it goes with the rest! Eventually, when the girl gets from the cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from the old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she turns and talks to the girl, the girl thinks her! She turned into a cannibal! Slow Motion Movie.
