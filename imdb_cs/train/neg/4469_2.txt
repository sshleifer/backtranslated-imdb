This game has (disagree) that I am the first game I stopped playing right in the middle and felt like breaking into bits and then burning. Congratulations. FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider I'll ever play, I assure you. Plot: Just writing this word made me laugh. There is none. Nor is personality development. Finally, we have a heroine girl who can take care of herself, who is not a beer, but sadly dresses like a whore and her breast is huge. They had to attract the sexist boy you see. All she does is go to the tomb after the tomb filmed things when it comes. Why he does, I do not know. I had headlines and t.v. as loud as possible, and I still did not understand the damn thing. The development (or lack) of her, her two friends and * villains * were ridiculous. There will also be levels that you have to go through to - give you no hint of what you have to do next, and you will literally be in most boring as hell tombs in HOURS trying to figure out what hell you should do. There is one course (two), especially with a motorcycle (believe me it's not fun at all) that you will be ON per hour with no point to be in sight. This means that another driver and boys in the van will hit you to shoot at you or hit a tree that begins an hour long journey. they have no storyline, do not develop a character, do not provide any variety in the game, have most of the music at the earliest levels of ear bleeding, and give no indication that the player may stay longer in place instead of getting into a nonexistent land. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: It sounds like bang ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, conspiracy or painless play. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these thoughts seem to be extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Close Todd. You won. <br /> <br /> Play the game: The only thing he does is to shoot. Of course he can shoot during shooting, jumping during a shooting or kick when he shoots again. But overturning, jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that everything he does is SHOOTING. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: Intro music is incredibly beautiful. I love listening. In musical music goes from tolerable to wanting to lower your ears away. Visuals: Since this game was made in 2006, I expected the visuals to throw me away. I was just blown, but certainly not in the good sense. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: This game is a conspiracy, no character development, with the hard-dressed young women at the forefront who run the boring tombs for some tedious reason (what may it be that I do not tell you) with an inconceivable shooting gameplay. Stay out of there B.S. !!!!!!!! It's two stars because it has a woman who is not a girl in distress (no matter how little dressed she could be) and beautiful in music.
