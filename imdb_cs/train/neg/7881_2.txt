This film is a portrait of a semi-spirited teenage boy Benjamin who is about to visit a boarding school due to his poor grades in mathematics. He had not done the best of life before, and he had serious problems with respect. After a rough start at the new school, she starts with friends, falls in love with a girl and makes some teenage girls from the American Pieze. In addition to some comic elements, the film is very serious, focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this story, save yourself time and watch something else. If so, keep in mind the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is completely lost. Whatever he does is doing terribly wrong, and then he's all about self-reconciliation all the time. For me it was not such a "charming loser" that you can feel compassionate and laugh at. Instead he and his behavior were really angry with my own teenage years that were not so far I could barely watch. 2) The film is hardly trying to be realistic and the story looks like, the experience of the characters are simply not (except Janosch maybe). And yes, I know this film is based on auto-biography written by 17-year-old, but I have no experience with German schools and German youth, I do not believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) Showing sexual awakening is really an important thing for a movie with this theme. But I doubt that teenage boys are making the "Ejaculate on cookie" contest, where everyone has to hit a cookie with their sperm during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser must then eat a sperm-wet cookie. Although it has amused me a little, it is not funny, nor does it emphasize serious attempts at this film. 4) There is a partial plot about Benjamin's family and his father betrays his wife-still, I do not know why it's there and where it is. It just bored me. Well, I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin, without a message, a concept, a schema, anything, and it is trying to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people may consider it reasonable and touching. If you liked "The Other Sister," you probably will like this too. I hated both. 17-year-old boys should not write an autobiography, and if so, it does not seem to be the best idea to make a film of it. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
