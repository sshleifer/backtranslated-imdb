How many fricken times do we have to see a spook that passes in the background and culminates in a mirror reflection? It was done in two tens of films in a recent memory and forty times in this fragmented, poorly filmed movie. There were only two exciting moments to appreciate ... when ghosts attacked the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, acting was as flat as the Coke Diet in 64 ounces. the cup from which I drew it. The side characters could be pulled from the different Scooby Doo cartoons. It was friendly, old sheriff. It was a feline bizarre that lived in backwoods with the Alabama draw. Lots'o'characters without development. Most alarming was the picture of the murdered child at the beginning. But rather than investigating the murder of a child, which would be interesting, they just let us know she was dead and her parents were hard to reconcile with the community and each other. When they get into the cabin, the scenes seldom stretched together ... with the flashing images of the dead daughter who appeared here and there. Oh ... and the mysterious sounds were too exaggerated. You know what I mean ... the doorbells that open themselves, crickets in the woods, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. I have not seen it before. Again, you will see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over again. MANAGER NOTE: The scary scene is scary only if it does not repeat every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about these things before you call "it's a wrap!"
