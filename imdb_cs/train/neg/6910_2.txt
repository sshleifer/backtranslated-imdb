I've never seen this movie, but I can tell you one thing about your production. While in 1988 I had a comedy / old radio DJ, I called from the production company. They asked if I would write and record a bit that they would get into the soundtrack as sounds emitted from television (the TV screen itself will never appear). I have, of course, wrote the science fiction parody of the 1950s, rounded up some sound effects and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. When she happened to happen at the time, she released a long song, joined me in the production room, and we replied in a single shot. She giggled and then returned to her show as I mixed up with the sounds of the sound. We would never do it if we knew that the "massacre of woodworkers" would be such a step - but again they did not pay us for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
