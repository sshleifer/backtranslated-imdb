I saw this movie a few months ago in the city, which appeared in the film as Greendale, which is the only reason I went to see him. Another local, who was there, just gave me an email notification of repetition, because the first one was sold out and people were averted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Young or you live in / near "Greendale "(if you know a real name, skip this movie, it's mostly a movie designer, it does not have a conspicuous plot, the music is fine and too many texts are incomprehensible, making it impossible to track what few pieces of plot can be. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I could rent a camcorder and drive around "Greendale" and create a better film myself. If you want to see a * good * movie with an ecological message without a conspiracy, go for Koyaanisqatsi rental.
