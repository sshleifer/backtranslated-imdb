A totally ridiculous "periodic" film is just a little justification for his extensive, graphic depiction of the hero's affair with a "beast," a monster who allegedly appears every century to rape some women. This is actually what he does, and the film's view of the beast is really terrible; he is basically a tall kid in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard refill that spills a lot of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I think maybe it's a real turn-on. But I was amused by the initial shots of horses having sex in a public square.
