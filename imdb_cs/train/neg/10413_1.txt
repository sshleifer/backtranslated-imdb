There are no reasons why this movie will look. If you have won an extraordinary amount of money and spent your time exploring the life of all the pleasures and reaching the point where you happen to be at the free end and have some time to kill (as it ever happened), then this film from a video rental shop (if you find it and clean up with an assistant who laughed to ask for this film.) But prepare yourself for being extremely hard-hit by all-in-one (in fact, the best actor People Who Did not Tell), Oliver Reed is leading his big career by playing a drunken picture, but wait, I forgot that there is one reason to watch this movie - Claudia Udy showed her chest!
