Without repeating what has been said above about this film, I would like to add that I look forward to watching this movie ... the cast and work of excellent director Michael Winterbottome, etc. ... She had an unclear shadow of "Do not Look At" now from the beginning. Stay in another setting (again in Italy) to lose the heart of the loss ... or did I see it like that? So I sat there and waited for the story to unfold and turn around what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country .... and I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? nothing will happen! and I do not think anything! You do not even have a chance to get into the character because they are so dimensional and empty. You are led to believe in the pace of the film that something happens to make the whole film turn to his head ... The oldest daughters flirted with the local boys, having the great space to film the film in a different direction, the youngest vision of the daughter about her dead mother ended up as barren and unnecessary exercises, fathers attempted to seduce one of his students, feeling ridiculous due to his age. It seemed to me like the script had the last memory, where they decided that at the last minute they had made all the courage to the story and went for it seemed minimal without it having any influence. When the loans began to (unexpectedly) hurry, you can not help, but you feel robbed by spending your time spent watching the garbage.
