Sunshine is a European import in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, an epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally switches to Sunshine. The family has a modest beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upward moving, changes its name and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society, so successive generations can develop professionally. The story is narrated by the eyes of the eldest son in each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who lacked WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life does not work very well. Sunshine is recognized as an artistic success, but the opportunity is lacking. The story line dominated by world history is predictable and transparent; it is enhanced by voice coverage of narration and video reporting. The family "plot" is based on one predictable event [ie. Habsburg, WW-I, WW-II, fascism, communism, etc.] on the other hand with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is not developed, and important subtexts ("secret" diary and family philosophy) that could give birth and trustworthiness are up to the end. Alternatively, the creators provide generational continuity using common topics of incest / infidelity. Ralph Fiennes shows brilliance flashes, but his performance is not far from award-winning material. Casting "3 for 1" is a spectator that scatters and recalls a rather cinematic trick than a good theater. Sunshine is basically the Hungarian "History Channel" material. It has the look and feel of Wind Waves has transformed with Forrest Gump morphed with Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
