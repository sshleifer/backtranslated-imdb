Beginning as a delicate natural landscape, the fearless and slightly pleasant romantic tale will change the tempo when Edward Norton's initially enchanting Harlan gradually reveals itself more and things turn to a sinister, because the film is gradually changing from the South Romance to the modern Western wild. The Happy Ranch (Norton) travels to the city and enjoys a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), seemingly rescuing her from the dead end of her existence with her bad dark father with a novel of belief, but it gradually becomes clear that there is more cowboy than meets the eyes . Edward Norton? a real actor with a chameleon (with a changed hair on his face) playing on the ground, has the accent a little nasty, but perhaps because he tries to act without fear of an accent. Surely it seems easy to make all the fine adjustments when we learn more about Harlan. However, with too little change, it means we are not sure where Harlan comes from, and it seems that what seemed to be a good performance from Norton will gradually disappear. Evan Rachel Wood is sympathetic without really having to do a lot of things to snoop the eyelids in Norton. <br /> <br /> Down in the valley strikes like a slightly uneven story due to its change of pace and never truly motivating protagonists clearly expresses the sympathy of listeners about characters that remain uncertain. Should we like the drifter or not? Even after the dramatic turn of events remains unclear. This ambiguity is at the expense of the film, as if the writer could not decide what a story he wanted to say, and he settled somewhat hot. If the movie stayed one or the other, it could have been a solid movie, but just like what's left is something like a mess. Fans of old-fashioned romance will be able to enjoy part of the film but will be dimmed in a dark tone. Complete supporters of Norton aside (or fans of the lush scenery of San Fernando Valley), give it to miss.
