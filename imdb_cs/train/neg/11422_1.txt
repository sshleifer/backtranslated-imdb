I saw it in the theater when it came out and just yesterday I saw it on the cable again. I managed to get to know again the feelings of the revolt of this film. The whole group of characters is saturated with narcissistic lecturers. The worst of all is the strengthening of every negative stereotype about dating after 20 years, even because it celebrates people who are "found". The nice boys ended last time, the dwarves went well, the cruelest guys the best. Girls are all toy. Only one character ("Wendy") is seen doing something remotely useful to society, and she gives up her long-rescued virginity in a throw-in single-stand with a dirty, bushly-shot scene that we should think is romantic. What really is the Hollywood concept of young America: permissive, secluded, promiscuous, horrified.
