Shame really - I rarely look at the film and at the end I felt disappointed. I have seen quite a few adaptations by Ira Levine - "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives" - and they liked both of them, but that did not just concern me. When I read (Michael Caine), she decides to murder one of her former pupils (Christopher Reeve) and cut the screenplay for her own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director, and Ivory Levine's work is generally good. I will not go wrong for anyone who has not seen it before, but let's say there's a load of twists and turns. So much of it's hard to explain the film line in detail without leaving it out. I loved the first ... 45 minutes before the bangs and shakes began to appear, and at that moment my interest and my desire began to disappear. Although I must give Lumet recognition for the very fun ending that made me laugh out loud. The main actor - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all great in their roles. Although Worth's obvious false Russian accent has slightly increased my nerves (nothing Irene personally, I think any false accent of any actor would irritate me). You're not sure if it's supposed to be annoying fun, but Dyan managed to bother and amuse her - at the same time. Anyone who reads it - I do not want to give her a chance - you may like it, maybe not. This is just an opinion.
