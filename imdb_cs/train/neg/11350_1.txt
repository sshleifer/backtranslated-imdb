As long as there is 3D technology (I think in the 1950s), there was animation. I remember specifically the Donald Ducka cartoon with Chip and Dal. I do not remember the name at this moment, but the conspiracy was that Donald worked at the circus, fed elephant peanuts, and Chip and Dale stole peanuts. It was given in 3d probably in the 1960s. If you happened to watch Robinsons in 3D in theaters, they showed the picture before the film and explained the details of its origins. There are probably about 100 cartoons made specifically for viewing 3D glasses. This claim was a bad step because it is not hard to prove that it is wrong. In addition, it looks like a bad movie.
