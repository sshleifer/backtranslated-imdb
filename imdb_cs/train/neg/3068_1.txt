Movies such as these are originals, such as album-oriented stations, what music they used to be - repetitive, boring and exhausted by all the original energy by the corporate drones committee. I'm glad Aragorn was not in this P.O.S. Go back and watch the 1971 version, count things that NEVER be included in the modern version, and thank the deity you worshiped somewhere in the distant past to have a ball to write and shoot an original conceptual film that was not based on someone else's ideas, she was not sent over the corporate board until she saw the light of the day.
