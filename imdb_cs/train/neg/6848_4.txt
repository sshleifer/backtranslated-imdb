I have to say that I am quite disappointed with this "horror" film. During my observation, I did not even scare myself. It's not too exciting either ... I finally managed to guess the end of the half of the movie ... So ... what's left? "The Ring" is a totally frightening film. .. I want other movies to stop copying (eg Trademark: long hair). Please give me some original. <br /> <br /> This movie is not recommended.
