In the future of 1985, the government committee led by Howard Hesseman holds a hearing on the first uncensored television network. They are programming that they play as a series of skits. I can name good "skit" movies on one side, I do not use my thumb. Amazons on the Moon, Kentucky Fried Film, The Importance of Life, and Mr Mike's Mondo Video. Notice how I did not mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason is that this film is death in cinematographic form. None of the skeets are even remotely funny, or even the least skillful. It seems like a big invasion is being made on film creative films so I can not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> My rating: F Candy Eye: Dody Dorn goes full front
