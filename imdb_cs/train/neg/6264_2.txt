Nightmare Weekend is proof of the positive view that some people are so desperate to be in movies, they are ready to do almost anything. I do not mean countless women, Starkers in this awful piece of waste (in the end, naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to work with a badly-made puppet called George. Now it's embarrassing !!! Bio-electronic creatures created by brilliant scientist Edward Brak (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a demented felted clown with a green hair wave) is an artificial intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that runs revolutionary equipment (a golf ball with a silver ball) which, when ingested, can reverse the nature of the malfunctions. <br /> <br /> Edward's experiments that change personality have been successful in an animal lab, but a cautious scientist is reluctant to perform tests on human subjects because he fears that side effects may occur. His bad assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such doubts and continues to use three beautiful young women like guinea pigs. Inevitably, everyone will turn into a horrible murderous mutant. Thanks to the beneficial underground special effects, the casting of absolutely no talent and a conspiracy that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes when I was watching the film, and even then I'm not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate), Nightmare Weekend is complete and complete a disaster that even a few sex scenes with a gentle core and a gore can not save. also contains one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen in a horror film: Tony (Bruce Morton), Walkman wearing an idiot who's fun to mad the 80s of music in a way that seems like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
