It was not Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie. He was a great wannabee. It was going to be a nervous, nervous laugh, a movie that claims life in urban life, but it's a shattering camera, a mess. It is much easier to imitate something other than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning I did not have to worry about the characters or about what they were involved in. They always always banged, mourned or wept each other. Only what they did was no substance. Dialogue between characters is supposed to be hip, revealing, instead of trutin and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers who really enjoyed this movie so I could be wrong.
