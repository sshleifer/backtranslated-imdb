OK ... I'm watching a lot of bad movies. I am proud of this fact. Many times there are some gems in B rated bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I've watched. I like a good horror movie ... but one with the theme and sense of movement. The opening scenes looked pretty good. Decent music and pictures. Then down the hill. One of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). Now it will threaten to reveal his secrets. They made it too out of focus. So what's ringing in his ears, and accidentally leaving the stuffing somewhere where it should not be. There is no need to evolve it. So this guy has a relationship with this girl and falls in the motel and hits his head at the end of the table. So instead of everyone knowing about their affairs, they decide to jump out of their bodies. Now her twin sister tries to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well after seeing her sister again and again (like a zombie like a ghost) and even pointing directly to the place of her body she finally finds her. Now the body is healed and she is ready to deal with the only suspect who killed her. The bad thing is, she did not have much of a plan. Just pretending to be her twins and meet the guy where the body was thrown away. Idiot did not even believe he killed her. So everything is revealed here, and even though it has a pistol ... somehow it can strangle it. So the last scene of the movie is from the "ghosts" of her and her twin coming out of the water. So you mean that the bad guy in this movie will win. And not one, but two innocent people are dying.
