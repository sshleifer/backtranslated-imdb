When you look at it and hear the whole language here, it is amazing that it was labeled as "PG," but for you it was a system of seventy years. Peter Falk launches the Lord's name six times in just ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet, few people think it is insulting, and certainly not miserable, who are making movies or people who are "evaluating" them. Cast is a hint of how this movie can be ominous: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors you would not find in The Sound Of Music. I like heist films and a lot of films by director William Friedkin, but he does not give this script and just has too many "gray" seventies "feel, visually and audibly." For those who loved Falco in "Columbo" TV, it must be a shock you hear him use so much shame in the movie, that's far from the one case.
