Warning: This review contains smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> But the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two are pretty good for video on video. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins is a very boring film. Where are hecky Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of grabs during the first 90 minutes, I believe that this series entry is supposed to be a "feature". Unfortunately, there is no interesting character in the movie, except for Billy Drag, who gets too few rows, too little to do, and too little time. What saved the 2nd and 3rd films was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Whenever there are no activities on the screen, you can be sure that Burt Gummer will also be interesting for listening and / or watching. However, in this film Gross, Hiram Gummer plays a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, when Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) on the screen look good, but it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> When I saw that Tremors 4 was released in 101 minutes. Good for video right. But after watching, I'm sure this movie is too long for 15 minutes. There are long sections of dialogue that are boring and do not in any way prevent. Was he in a hurry to get this movie? I think no, more time would be possible and should be spent on the scenario. I thought I hit a gold mine when I saw that Tremors 4 is on sale with ... Tremors !!! What luck I thought I would pay for # 4 to get # 1 for free. Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to pay for the original and I get this mess for free, I can not imagine that I would pay a single dime for Tremors 4. It is best to forget the Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even for fans of the series exists. Tremors 4: The Legend Begins Rated 3 out of 10.
