A recent post, which was proclaimed by a woman who claimed military background, contained the remark "Women's life is no more important than a human being." This mantra politically correct is not true as history, a biological show. Companies have recovered from the heavy losses of their male population, sometimes at an amazing rate. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the war in 1914-1918, when more than two million men were killed. In South America the Triple Alliance War (1865), Paraguay took three neighboring countries until virtually its entire male population was destroyed but fought against the heck in the Chaco 1932 war against much larger Bolivia. <br /> <br /> No company, however, or sometimes could not survive the loss of its female population. Only when the life of the nation is threatened, women are sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but has never thought of fighting troops for its defensive forces ever since, despite the popular image of an Israeli soldier girl. "G.I.Jane" is a hollywood fluff.
