I really had hope for this movie because I saw Kari in several other things and think he has some talent. Unfortunately, this crazy is a case study on what to do in the script. Totally undefined characters without a similarity and without any conspiracy. Is it a road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, neither we nor us.
