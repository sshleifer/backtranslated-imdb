Recap: Complete. Creation, a huge werewolf, is on hunt. Not for meat, not for blood (not that he thought he would bite along the way though) but for a friend. She's on the hunt for the girl. Not a girl. Girl. A girl who is pure (and also a werewolf, although she does not know her yet). Three, make sure that two cops (after the first scene) and one old bag are all who can stop it or even know that the thing that kills and eats a lot of people around the moon is a werewolf. This mighty werewolf, Darkwolf, closes the girl. If it gets, humanity is condemned to extinction. Now the cops have to find a girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf who wants to rape her and maybe kill her, but that she is a werewolf himself. And then they stopped him ... <br /> <br /> Comment: This is one for a boy, a teenage boy. Lots of scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for plotting. Mostly less. Well, I think you need something to fill for some time, because the fence is (expected) thin. And unfortunately, besides the girl there is little to help the plot of breaking. One usually addresses two main themes. Nudity. Control. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things you could call effects. However, they are not too strange. In fact, being blunt, they are very bad. The film seems to be suffering from a lack of funding. They could not afford clothing for some girls;) and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between the werewolf and human form, of course computer, are really bad. You could overlook these things. But Darkwolf itself is very rough and you never see any murders. Just a couple of mutilated bodies. And it's surprisingly small blood, in a movie that should honestly cleanse the blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. Usually they do well, but unfortunately there are cases where characters (or actors) simply lose. Several of these outages could have been linked to the above problems. Just like bad effects or bad budget (?). This could explain why there is precious little shooting, although the characters are armed as a small army and the target is in a clear view (and not moving). But hey, when you're in real danger, nothing that would save your life as a good bait ... Unfortunately, it can not explain the moments when Cop, Steve, the only one who knows how to this problem can be balanced, it is a werewolf who escapes when the only thing he can be sure of is that the werewolf comes to the girl who is next to him and that he can not have it. But surely it will let the creators stretch a bit more ... <br /> <br /> But I would not mind if none of the main actors / actresses got into another movie. <br /> <br /> Make a small conclusion: It's not the movie I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
