I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. An interesting story, interesting features of the character, Ewan MacGregor in absolutely glorious. Unfortunately, I hated every minute. Greenaway was so in love with the film's presentation unambiguously and not for the benefit of the film. I will not even get into the horrific acting of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You are telling a tale of 4 billion teenage windows and calligraphies that are moving at the bottom of the screen and displaying the texts of the music they play. He seems to have lost sight of the real story and the plot, and he has become entangled with foo-foo decorations that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in the glamorous Hallmark frame that says, "GRANDMA HAS LAUNCH!" in large sparkling letters. This film seems to be the victim of the author's ego director instead of what could have been - disturbing and terribly beautiful. In another director (Jeunet? Coppola?) It could be a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it is best placed in the class of fine arts, which is too serious to take.
