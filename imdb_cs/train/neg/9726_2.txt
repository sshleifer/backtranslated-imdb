This is a fascinating horrible movie. It makes so little sense that it begins to create some weird inner logic of its own. Well, it would have been if it did not keep away from the side streets until it finally threatened the weight of its own indecision. The film can not figure out whether it is a straightforward film "Man Turns Into Monster" (as well as all 1950 INGEDIBLE Inserted ING MAN verbs) or movies about spooky big commercial plot theory or mystical execution, or ... or what ? Choose. It's just a mess. Grotesquely over the top and burn in all directions, leaving the free ends clapping all over the place. It was as if Tobe Hooper had used David Lynch pills. Unfortunately he did not get enough.
