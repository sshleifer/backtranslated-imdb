The Gospel of Lou was a great disappointment to me. I received an email from the theater that showed it to be a great and inspirational film. It was neither big nor inspirational. Cinematography was pretty hefty with the whole movie. Many scenes were flashbacks that were done in a way that would sometimes not say what they are. Voices were often distorted for no reason. Also, many people in the movie have been far too attracted. The relationship he has with his ex-son is never clear. Also, the whole movie has one way, and then BAM all the time, is healed and inspiring people. It seems that the whole movie shows that the box is one of the things that is bad in his life and makes him live his life as he lived, but when he changes, he does not leave the box, he teaches others how boxing. Thumb down.
