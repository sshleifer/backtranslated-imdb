Disney did it again. The company that produced "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" created another film, which barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and does not preserve any of the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "The Gadget Inspector" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and the movie that it existed could have been a dream that was then fulfilled. Now that the movie exists, I was very disappointed, even outraged. <br /> <br /> First, we have characters. The gadget itself has gadgets that make it an amusing character with an original cartoon (with well-executed special effects that accompany them) and even has naivety from the original Gadget but is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime itself while Penny and The brain is just watching. /> <br /> Penny has little work; while she played an important role in the cartoon, discovered the crime and stopped her, and occasionally caught by MAD agents, she was just introduced and forgotten, although she had slipped into Claw's base. <br /> </ p> <p> Claw is the film version of Dr. Claw, a rather ominous, dwarf who wore metal gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden from view as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes. Now he's just a man with a stock for a hand, no debauchery behind a character. <br /> <br /> There are brains and mad cats in the movie, but they are very insignificant to them. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the cartoon are not spared in this butcher shop. The famous term "Wowsers!" was mysteriously changed to "Wowser," and the Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and speaks. <br /> <br /> There is even confirmation of the products everywhere. Why is "Yahoo!" advertised as a sign? Why does Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M or Skittles? Cartoon fans hate it, others probably find the film below, and when everything is said and done, this film is another attempt to make some quick money from another old show.
