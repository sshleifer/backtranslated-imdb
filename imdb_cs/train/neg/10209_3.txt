When I was pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. While decent in full, self-erasing roles, Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Float on Hope, Speed ​​2, 28 days) leaves much to be desired. Her character is at the same time ubiquitous, confused and sexually misplaced (part plot of Sandra's past is like an unnecessary fill that will barely develop her already shallow nature). Two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their expertise in forensic and catchy attitudes is threatened by stupid mistakes that shout "We did it!" Chris Penn, as an obvious suspect, is wrecked here as well as Benko's token partner / loving interest. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** Mediocre leaving aside, the biggest mistakes can be traced to the TV-of-the-week plot that you've never completely bought into murder motifs in the first place, and how stupid mistakes (throwing precious food on the scene of a murder, very convenient and framing the chef, two boys together in public, a suitable charity interest in friction, etc.) make the look go from intrigue to bored and disappointed murderers. The end was strictly "by number" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using the clickable tactics now to almost show the top scenes at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience as we arrived at that moment, the final scenes nobody surprised and missed any of the so-called intelligence of the film allegedly to conclude. A rather promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost every direction. * outside ****.
