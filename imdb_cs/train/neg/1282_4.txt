Here is one of those films blurred by the study studio on the happy end. Conflicts that have stretched for a long time will be resolved within minutes. It would be much more interesting if you made a tone of ambiguity. Talented Barbara Stanwyck is averted by a sudden metamorphosis from an independent and assertive woman to a satisfying woman that she has destroyed her entire life. Brent, as usual, is overhead, and then there is an absurd situation where Gig Young plays a character named Gig Young. Somebody will mention "Gig Young" and then who will appear, but the actor Gig Young! It is worth seeing, though far behind what could have been.
