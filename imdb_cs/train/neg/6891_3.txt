It starts really well, a nice intro and build for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the spell is lost. The character is in the same form as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without supporting a cast or an innovative story, making Pie's films more commercially successful. Let's be honest - Heder's behavior was pretty bad. Keaton, Daniels, and Faris did the best, but they did not have a significant screenplay or screenplay to get their teeth into the movie. The film just begins without any tempo or a clear logical plot justifying its length. The end is probably as predictable as they come - so predictable I ticked the spoilers box for this one line. My advice: to avoid at all costs if you really have nothing else to do / listen or watch, and even then you will feel that the producers just cheat you for the hour and a half of your life.
