The brides die on the altar and their bodies disappear. Everyone is concerned, but no one seems to be able to find out why and how it happens and can not prevent them. Take hold of me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for giving these young women spinal fluid to relocate his old wife and keep her alive. Continue with me. Finally, the authorities will find that someone has to kill and disappear, but of course they can not figure out what is unlikely. We just ignore the absurd pseudoscience and go on ... If you get the first twenty minutes of this mess, you and Lugos will treat your lab assistant's whip to not respect one of the gossip she has murdered and explain that she finds she is sleeping in a coffin a lot more comfortable than a bed and other vague parodies of real horror films (a type with budgets and drawings). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and the remarkably awkward police are nowhere to be seen!) And then the fun really starts. Cinematography and acting are all right. There are plenty of well-dressed, very good-looking people in this movie. Direction is fair and the script is a bit better than the material deserved. However, this film can not keep the interest of all but the toughest fans of b-movies. Best thing ... It even ends, but not so soon.
