I chose this title from a friend who was sitting in his exhaustive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection so fortunately I did not have to pay for it. I knew it would be a bad movie, but I know what a really bad movie is after looking at the giants as if the kids did not play with dead things and incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and mixed zombies. there is really nothing that fazes me if it is tremendously bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> essentially destroy it. To confront this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a spaceship and a crew whose task is to fire an antimatter bomb (which it describes as the "greatest explosive at all") into the sun that through some intricate science fiction causes the flare to fire from another angle and will keep the earth undamaged. It does not matter that what I just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with occupied castles (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), the solar crisis is barely able to handle this mediocre rate, thanks to a conspiracy that is starting to be simple, yet becoming increasingly absurd as time goes on. <br /> <br /> The crowning success of this debacle of the movie is the addition of a villainous character (played by Boyle), which insists on sabotaging the mission. Through instruments that are never explained, he sends a malignant minion with an embarrassing haircut to perform some vague electronic control of the mind over the genetically engineered space crew scientist played by female head Annabel Schofield. Why sabotage the mission? Because, according to his sad opinion, he thinks that the flare will not happen, and that if it does not happen, he will become rich because he dug his bad claws into the stock market. In fact, you have the villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation you can imagine. Movie enthusiasm becomes incredibly complex and develops very slowly, in a timely manner by tapping on the use of characters that only have vague or unnecessarily short role roles. I could sit here and explain in detail what will happen to prove the writer's total inability to make a plot that really clicks or catches your attention but I'm sitting here writing this review in Microsoft Word and I know this would take three pages and I would only managed to lose your interest. But then you would probably get the same effect of looking at the movie. The film is unhappy with an extremely bad interview. Imagine if anything that happened on Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters were emitting sci-fi jargon back and forth. Yes, I know they are already doing this, but imagine if it's all they did and that they used that jargon to create vague and almost nonsensical scenes that do not cause any excitement, tension, or interest in the viewer at all. > <br /> This is best expressed when the character in the Zero-G encircles the screw on a metal box before shouting in agony after a few minutes before it suddenly explodes. The script first mentions the character that risks an explosion, but does not bother giving any firm answer to why or how it happens, or why it can not really escape. Overall, you have a sad cross between the bizarre and the laughing. Then we have a few scenes where dramatic work leads to nothing. Jack Palance's power is lost on a character that serves only to drive the hero's guy (not to ask) around the desert before getting to the assembly and killing a bunch of suits. Palance, finally, on his deadly bed, tells our boyfriend hero of his surname (while he is wearing a terrible machined work that looks as if someone has put a balloon under the eyeball), which he had previously been silent about. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats silently, giving the viewers the impression that the name is in the movie later. Perhaps Charlton Heston is an angry admiral who knows him, and the plot goes as soon as his name repeats. Something. Anything. <br /> <br /> Excuse me. Any hope you have will be interrupted when this moment turns out to be another of many miserable, unsuccessful attempts to create a drama for such a filmed character that it would be forever a stain in Palance's career, the rest of the cast is similarly blurry. The film's completion is a painfully sudden ending featuring Schofield piloting a bomb in the middle of the sun in an attempt to redeem its deeds while under the spell of a thief, culminating in another of the well-performed sequences of visual effects that even for visibly complicated care still bring to them looked just as chilly as he really was. The saddest part of this film is obviously a big budget, tragically unnecessary on scenario scenarios and supporting casts behind Boyle, Heston and Palance, who can close the coffin purely by excessive effect. <br /> <br /> Step: D-
