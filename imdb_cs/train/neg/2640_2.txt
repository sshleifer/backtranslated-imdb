Trying to imagine something as unpleasant as SENTINEL would be quite difficult. There are many problems. The result is horrible and charged with plot holes. Michael Douglas plays as Pete Garrison, a secret service agent who "took one" for Reagan during his attempt at his life. A few years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse family, mainly as the first bailiff (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's careful participation in the first lady and a sudden threat to the president himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails to test a polygraph, investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 television series) is listed as a dissatisfied agent. When the presidential assassination plot unfolded, Pete found himself escaping from his own people. His only confidant is the first lady and she is reluctant to tell someone about mutual affections to each other (and therefore Pete first disappointed the polygraph). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president? If he's innocent, how can he help him stop trying to run a secret service? <br /> <br /> One, big, stunning problem with this movie is that there is no reason for the presidential threat. Is not that what the film is about? You would think so! But viewers never leave why the murderer (s) want to kill the Pres. Hmm. Someone forgot to put it in the script? And what about David Breckinridge (Kiefer) Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It appears to have been inserted into the film strictly like a piece of confectionery. What was her target again? Did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and low blouses? There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel that it's ridiculous. The action is too confused "What ...?" the answers that should be uttered by those who were unhappy watching the movie.
