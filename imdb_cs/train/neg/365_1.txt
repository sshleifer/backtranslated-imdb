Wrong screenplay, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic overhead, annoying porn ache that ran continuously over a rewritten script, and a dirty VHS copy can not be bought by drinking alcohol. Trust me because I have cleaned this Turkey to the end. It was so unnecessarily bad that I had to think it was the fourth Springtime saver for Hitler. The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only spark of interest, and it was just because she could sing better than the original. If you want to look at something similar but a thousand times better then watch the Beyond the Dolls of the Dolls.
