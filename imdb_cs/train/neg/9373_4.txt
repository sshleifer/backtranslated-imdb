The special charisma of Martin Koslek brings some credibility to his character of a frustrated artist. In his dialogue, he develops a special sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing person. The character may come across as a real person and is not a typical movie villain. <br /> <br /> The story line is not about what to write home and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is a strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondon Hatton as Creeper. Kosleck's talk, philosophical character contrasts with Hatton's low key, a monosyllabic approach. The Creeper character is not much more developed than the basic level of the monster, but Hatton suggests the undeveloped possibilities and reflects on his story. <br /> <br /> This movie was a lot on the Shock Theater when I was a kid, so I have some nostalgic love for her. It's worth seeing once, and for those who enjoy Forties horror.
