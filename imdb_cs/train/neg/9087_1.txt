Canadians are too polite, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater and mumbled that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their ballots. The premise is that the modern filmmaker interprets the 17th century bible about the love of shepherds and shepherds who were in the distant past when the druids were spiritual leaders. Work in three epochs offers many opportunities for the introduction of anachronism, including silly and impractical dress and special spiritual ceremonies that include really bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct, from which cross dressing and miscellaneous false situations arise. The movie could be jolly like Monty Python, which is very similar, but Rohmer's efforts are falling. The listeners laughed at the jerk, but at slow slow speed. The end will all be in a hurry and it's really terrible. This is a trivial film and a waste of your film time.
