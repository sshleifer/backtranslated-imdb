Let it be so. I actually have this movie. I got what the writer / director was trying to do. I understand that the dialogue should be dry and emotionless. I understand that the conspiracy should be without the climates and centuries. It was the writer / director who went. Very very dry humor / comedy. With all these comprehensions, I still think the film was soaked. The writer / director seemed to try to imitate Napoleon's dynamite with this film. She had all the same qualities. Even the main character behaved like Napoleon. But Napoleon Dynamite was really funny. His script worked. This movie is not. It does not make sense. Well, let me rephrase it. Its only purpose is to tear off Napoleon's dynamite and try to capture this look and feel. Pity it did not work.
