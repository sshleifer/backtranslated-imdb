This story had a different angle that attracted me so much that I bought the previously viewed VHS invisible. That was a mistake. In what might have been a very nice story - about ill-crippled people in the hospital and their different personalities - quickly turned into a very frantic solo opera with dissimilar characters. /> <br /> We have a Blossom (William Forsythe) a stereotypical racist white person who says that the f-word is every other sentence and is so scornful that he did not give him the first name in the film. It's a lot of fun. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast-paced hound. Snipes had to like those fast-talking "hip" arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, as in the "White Men Can not Jump". Then there is the sweet Helen Hunt, who plays "Annu", a great caring, loving person who has an adulterous affair with a leading figure in "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). is hearty, feels-good type of thing. It's just that my heart is melting down by watching these dear people. But if you're one of those who love dirty characters portrayed by people in this filthy movie ..... maybe you really like it! Add Hollywood Political Correctness Batch and Go There! What more can someone want?
