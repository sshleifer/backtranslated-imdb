DECOY is one of those independent productions that are obvious to newcomers, but it does not have all the usual mistakes that most of those films are down. It has a unique story, it has a reasonable impact, the shooting is very good, the hero and the bad are both huge men and background music is not exaggerated. This is the DVD New Version, so people will be here to see if it's useful. I do not know where all the tithes come from because this movie is not as good as you are a filmmaker's mother. The last film we saw in the theater was Warner's Exaltation by JK Rawlings, a very beloved and excellent book, the Phoenix Order. When comparing DECOY with PHOENIX, you think that PHOENIX (as Warners did) had no story that the director did not really do, shooting was terrifying, and the sound score of the sound wall was just a mess. I rated Phoenix and "1" because the scale is not lower. DECOY is 4 times better - in all respects. If you have an opportunity, give it a DECOY chance. Do not forget that it's not "Decoy 3 - Shootout" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not crowded with stupid "10" results, you can enjoy the movie according to your own terms.
