For the first forty minutes, Empire is actually forming: it seems to be a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster film. At that time I did not know why, I thought it was good - but now I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> One of the main issues with this movie is that it's pure and totally unpleasant. I do not care about movies with psychospheres and things that Jackie Brown can show - but they're all so terribly shallow, but it's obviously rated for fun. You literally feel the node pulls into your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is complacent, arrogant, yet ironically enough - it's not that bad. It does not seem to be enough to become a killer. The fact is that at the end of the day, this film is quite demanding. He is not smart, he is not smart, just boring and absurd - this colossal disorder should be avoided by omnipotent costs. <br /> <br /> * from ***** (1 of 5)
