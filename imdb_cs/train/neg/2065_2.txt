I rented it last night. WAAAAAAAAAA's opening (2001) took place for too long. The hitch-maker scene made no sense. Some skits were slowed down. Previously, I knew Chevy Chase worked less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song Total: 7 minutes of good material from 75 minutes of film Everything else was either unfortunate or stupid like hell. Let me give you some advice: If you want a crude film spoofing TV and movies, rent a "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want to have less raw movie spoofing movies and movies, hire "AMAZON WOMEN ON A MONTH" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise do not bother renting this movie. You save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: The Best Kena Shapira Movie is STILL "Modern Problems"
