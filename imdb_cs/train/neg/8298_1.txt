This movie was not very fun, definitely NOT as original or as good as the Christmas story. The characters (except the youngest) try to imitate the previous actors and they fail. Swinging neighbors come from nothing because they were not part of the first film. It was really bloody, it could be good with the original cast, maybe maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip it.
