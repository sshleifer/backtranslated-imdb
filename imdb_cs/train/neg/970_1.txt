normally I'm not a species that feared horror movies, but this film is an exception. some how this movie got into my mind !!! it is a very simple film, but extremely effective, it has a great atmosphere and it leads to some shocking moments, the father of the daddy who descends the hill is a true figure. Another seen was a family photo I did not expect and I jumped out of my place !!! I would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights that will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
