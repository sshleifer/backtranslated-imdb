Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan belong to that group of actors who always care about me despite the shows. I have always found Mrs. Ryan as a charming and wonderful actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always good at watching. Mostly I say "almost" and "almost" because of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meg Ryan does not play a similar character at first, That means Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less pleasant. So, although you usually like these two actors, I recommend you give this film a passage.
