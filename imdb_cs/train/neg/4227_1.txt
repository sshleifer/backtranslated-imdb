I'm amazed that I actually sat and watched it. I love independent movies, horror films and the whole zombie thing in general. But when you add ninga, you have crossed a line that should never be exceeded. I hope that people in this movie have done it greatly, and at least it was not a complete waste. You would never know that by looking at it. Script? Are you kidding me. Acting? I think the trees were pretending too. Cinematography? Well, there had to be a camera. Time. I do not think there was any real planning when shooting this movie. Such a complete waste of time, that I do not give her another comment.
