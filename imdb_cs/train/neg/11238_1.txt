Reading a box at a video rental room looks like this movie is rather fun. You know the type ... funny, but he was terrifying ... it was not funny or terrible. writing was feeble ... jokes could not make me laugh either for their extreme foolishness ... they were so awaited. actors did not do much with such a not so good script ... at least I hope it was not their best .. watch this movie at your own risk ...... I give it negative 3 star outta 10
