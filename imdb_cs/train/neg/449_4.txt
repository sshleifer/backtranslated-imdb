I admit that I only watched a few episodes, but everyone looked quite different from the other. It seems that after the first season the producers decided to completely reconstruct the show, release characters, introduce new ones and rewrite the entire dynamic program. <br /> <br /> As expected, the show is a special, unpredictable teenager, Holly (Amanda Bynes), who moves in New York with her sister Valerie (Jennie Garth). Dignified assumptions: odd couple + fish from water + tall Jinx. While I miss the sitcoms of the past, this show unfortunately repeatedly lacks the brand for fun and it's sad because it has some decent talent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the top of everything insisted on changing the show (Val lived with a regular occupation of one season, then suddenly gone, so he opens the bakery, what?) When things change that drastically you feel that * show * knows it's bad. I mean completely new files, characters deprecated and new show regular! <br /> <br /> On the side note (that's just nitpicking), I know it's a TV show and it's not real at all, but Val and Holly finally live in a huge attic (stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN ! Are you serious!?
