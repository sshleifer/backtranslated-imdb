Body Slam (1987) is a flat horror film. The low budget is decreasing, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and writing and acting is lame. But if you're in old school games (around 70's until mid-1980s), then you'll have more fun than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this film smells on ice. I gave him two because I felt generous. This turkey was "controlled" by stuntman Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a lot of guys and a c-list of actors (Dirk Benedict). The synopsis of this film is about the promoter who wants to combine "hair rock" and the game. But they are others who do not want to succeed. Even more, but I do not want to make it for you. If you can stomach a bad acting and careless happening, there's a few surprises at the end for hard-fought fans. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to my worse enemy (and I think).
