**** WARNING: here are spoilers **** Why do I waste my hurried years when I tracked such garbage? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, worse directing, and we have not yet gotten into acting. <br /> <br /> And of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The hero expert fights against stupid, corrupt and incompetent adherents. One avalanche fades and buries all the heroes who have managed to reach the alive, even though they are going through all sorts of dangers of the cliff. A corrupt partner who caused the whole thing to get fried alive along with his pay money. The second avalanche was heroically diverted by the experiments of a garbage expert. The evil thieves eventually have their hearts the same. The problem teenager falls into the arms of her half-step mother after saving her. Etc, etc., et al., Et al., Further on. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are few reasons to warn against spoilers. You could probably clean up the whole conspiracy if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least I was not too wide from the mark most of the time, predicting what will happen next. And then we did not discuss factual mistakes. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous commentator that although they are usually some of the redeemed features and a bad movie. it would be hard to find some in this. I suppose I gave him 2 out of 10 for some nice sceneries, but that's it. It's been some time when the film moaned me, but it certainly did.
