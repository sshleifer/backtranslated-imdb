I can not believe that those who praise this film do not think of any other film. I was ready for the possibility that it would be terrible, but the scenario (or its lack) is for a movie that is also useless. On the plus side, the general level of craft by actors and technical staff is very competent, but when you have pig sows to work with you, you can not make a silk wallet. The Ben G fans should stick to just another movie they were in. Dorothy S fans should hold the Galaxy. Petra B fans should stick to the Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughter to the detriment of those who seem to ask about it should hold on to the stunning book of Peter Brot, killing a unicorn.
