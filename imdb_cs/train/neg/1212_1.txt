Overall, this movie is horrible and should never be. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no reference to the audience and the characters, for example if you are going to challenge, you want to feel: "Oh, God my, no!" But you do not care in this case, because there is no link , who would have known the character. In the trailer, it seemed like the movie would be great, yet there was no tension what so really. It could be a secret, but it is not. "All he has is a set of tools." it was said on the DVD, you think this movie was carefully planned and cleverly created, but it is not, after all, terrible, very direct and useless. The act is either average or below average, perhaps even lower. In my opinion, it was the loss of my life. "Special effects" and the series were also average, nothing special, what ever. There is not much gore, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie was advertised to make it sound amazing, but really, without being interested, I can not answer it to anyone if they are not easily satisfied, a few battles and a boring story.
