The family moves to an old house in Japan. But there is a catch that is scary (BOO !!!). Aw, that did not mean you jumped. It's just reviews. Set back down. Ah, now it's a terrible scary old Samurai who killed his wife and her lover in a slow motion. It naturally makes 3 minutes of the scene stretching to about 7 or 8. Horrid acting. A terrible story. But how wrong can you ask? It was so bad that my brain began to melt and run through my nose in reflection. It was so bad whenever Doug McClure appeared on the screen, I prayed that I had memories of Small Wonder (Yes, I know Doug was in "Out of this world" and not "Little Wonder", but it's almost the same damn show, & I can enjoy the theme "Little Miracle" better) There are movies that are so bad they are good. it's not one of them <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My rating: F- <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Mako Hattori gets topless, Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one naked, one just naked) <br /> <br />
