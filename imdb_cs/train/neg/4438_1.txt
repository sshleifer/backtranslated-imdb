I borrowed this movie from the library that it could be wonderful. How I'm wrong! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie, it's very painful to watch the scene with her. She's a pretty girl but she's not seductive in this movie, but I'll have to witness her unpleasant attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. It's so ridiculous. And the film dialogue is so demanding and lacks a funny fact that is then acceptable. <br /> <br /> Complete failure.
