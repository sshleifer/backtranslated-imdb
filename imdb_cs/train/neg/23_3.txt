I borrowed this thing on DVD without prior notice. I was suspicious when I saw Michael Madsen, who appeared in a movie I never heard of but was a freebie so why not try. Well, I think Mr. Blonde would love to forget that he ever took part in the shame of the movie. It seems that if your script and dialogues are terrible, even good actors can not save that day. Not to mention amateur actors who flood this movie. Too many foreigners who are not native English play parts of native speakers of English by reading the lines of the script that was to be fired and not filmed. It's unbelievable how incredible are all the lines in the sound of the movie. Music is terrible and out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a bad school game. I recommend that you follow her only to appreciate other, better movies. That's why I gave her 3 instead of 1 that she deserves.
