What Ireland has ever done to make distributors trying to represent the country so pejorative? This film begins as an element for film students in Irish cinematographic clichés: cuddling priests, squeaking before handshakes, cattle squares, biking along rural meadows against the backdrop of Anodyn folk music. But it quickly appears that the main theme of the film is a big dad - About Irish Clicks - a Religious Conflict. This is a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic child is raised, which would seem to be a reasonable wish, though not to the 50th Wexford villagers she must live with. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, they decide to travel and go to Belfast, then to Scotland, where there are several regression clichés. While she is there, her father (who looks frighteningly like George Lucas) and the family at home are exposed to a boycott that is very nasty. I'm not going to end, not because I think people should see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with movies is a central figure: we should be sympathetic to her, but eventually urged her to get our lives. Villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be built, but the traumatization of your children seems to be an inappropriate way to go with it. In addition, she takes over the burden that deepens her worries when she attempts to draw analogy with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: her lawyer told her that she "had to lay down the assumptions" for her return. The film is supposedly based on a true story, but its themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively and with lesser possibilities as clichés have been hidden in the past.
