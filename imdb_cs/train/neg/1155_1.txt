never before the movie made me write a review, but that was just awful. I tried to find out what it was about this film that made snoop to pick it as its first serious role, but frankly it was a bad choice. he did a good book, but it definitely did not work like a movie for me. I found it incredible, lacking in the atmosphere, and suddenly I saw many scenes that are horribly blasted. And the musical master may be just a serious actor snoop ain't.the Dylan mcdermott and pink bush was acceptable but it is not enough, to carry a weak land with a weak conversation. maybe I just missed this point but it did not match the genre for me, did not create any empathy with the characters or create any tension, in fact, I found myself in prayer for the end and suppression of the deep desire to slap all three main characters!
