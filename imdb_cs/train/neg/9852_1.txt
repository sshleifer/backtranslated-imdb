Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of each other. This Fantasy is modeled after the "Walk with Dinosuary" series. Although it is a 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same material and archaeological view. Even mixing fantasy kites with T-rexs and extinction of dinos. Added to show up on the educational channel instead of saying Sci-Fi, it gives the atmosphere of factual authenticity to this show. <br /> <br /> The show itself is about 7.5 / 10 away, while the fun goes. But the way it is presented, I have to give 1/10. Do not get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy, but the way they did it is so bad. I can really see small children and slow adults who believe they found the dragon and that it is real. I also think that it weakens the great "Walk With Dinosuary" series, because now you have to see it with a lot of thought about how fantastic it is in this mini-series.
