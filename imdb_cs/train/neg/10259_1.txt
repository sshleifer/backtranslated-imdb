I saw this movie in the theater when I was a child, and I always remember it as my first experience of being hijacked by a terrible movie with a good deal. Commercial advertising was great, but later I found out that there was an explosion or a "special effect" in the whole movie (about 4) and even in the movies. There was some kind of conspiracy about foreigners, but strangers were never really in the movie, as I recall. It was definitely the case when somebody scared a cheap movie to cheat the scammers. I think my world of innocence ended that day when I found out there were bad people doing bad movies.
