Honestly, I went to see the film, not for the actors, not for the conspiracy, but because it was rated 17 in Luxembourg, and the film must be really brutal or pornographic to be included in this category. Believe me I'm a film rage, I've seen a lot of brutal movies in my life (Ichi's murderer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the worst and worst image I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply stupid, the director is horrible, the playing was average and the music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror soundtracks". There is no single intelligence throughout the movie, and some scenes are really hard. (especially the scene where you can see the embryos in your glasses and you hear the baby screaming - terrible). I do not understand why the film in Germany was rated 16, where the criteria are usually hard (eg Killings (brutal, but making fun in itself and having great cues for Asian cinema and next to a magnificent director) even a film similar to the state of grace is rated 18). Nobody can call a horror film, because it was actually about making it appear to be a gore rather than scaring the public (it turned out that the face of "Creep" in the middle of the film is a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) is just one crazy director who lives in his disturbing fantasies. In some scenarios, you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the conspiracy, nor does it say anything. The plot has holes and defects, the dialogue is boring, I honestly can not mention the only positive aspect of the film, except the British and Scottish accents. If I had something to say, I would like to forbid this movie from the theaters, I fully understand why none of the big production companies have invested their money in this crap. I look forward to getting feedback on my thread and I would like to discuss one topic or another. <br /> <br /> "Bring a dream baby, live a" dream "David Aames
