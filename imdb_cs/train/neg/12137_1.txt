Oh my god! This film offends everyone's intelligence. I really mean who thinks that three kids can fight about 30 to 40 ninjas and win. We are not talking about helpless humor worthy. This movie is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad. The film is a sign, the only thing for which it is good is a time killer or an unintentional laugh.
