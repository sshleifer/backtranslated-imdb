I was gifted with this film because he had such a great premise, the friendship of three women who fell in love with one of the loved ones in a younger man. <br /> <br /> Can not! I'll join quickly. All of these women are drawn in extreme cartoons, which do not support much and conspire and try to bring each other together. Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton would not have had anything wrong in my book, but they are being handed a modest scenario here and said they are balancing the action between slapstick and screwball, which does not work well when women are all well-known professionals a very small town. <br /> <br /> And for intelligent women who spend a whole pile of time condescending the lack of men / sex / lust in life. I felt it could be a lot more if it was a decent scenario and more tension, the lesbian was not anywhere and the women who smoked and drank (all thirty-forties) were very unrealistic - even on the children's scene - screw the baby , give a cigarette! Correctly. <br /> <br /> As I said, waste shame. 4 of 10.
