This movie was bad because it was nothing interesting. It was a remake, but then again, not really. I was very disappointed with Tim Burton's tools. He had great make-up and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we got was just as good as the original movie made for less than $ 6 million? Damn no. So the movie fails in this respect. At least in the original film, the Scene of Liberty scene was shocking, but in this film there was nothing shocking even in the final scene because you could see it coming. And by the way, if you think it a bit and I did, you can see how it can be concluded. I just wish I had time to come back that I was thinking unnecessarily about. This movie would be great and fun if it stayed in line with the first film and received part of "Under the Planet Guys". Here's how I would write it: Astronaut (it really should be more than Marky Mark, because he's not good enough to take care of himself, so I'd give three boys) to land on what they would think it would be another planet, met people (not diminished), town-driven apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, found they were on the ground by finding some ruined ruins running to crazy mutants who live underground, the war between mutant humans and apes ends and then ... well, let your imagination run wild how you want to end. <br /> <br /> But my opinion is that there could be more to this movie. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman line. He's a dirty director, what people think. It's fashionable, so it has to go well. Sorry but no. If anyone else would shoot this movie, it would be much better and would be much more satisfying.
