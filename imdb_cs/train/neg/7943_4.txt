The seventh signature has a big opening hook because the Israeli defensive forces hit a terrorist base. This is the type of hook that is needed when writing a script, catches a reader / audience, and David Bannon's performance while renting a room from Abby and Russell Quinn wins it's a person who is not who he says he is. However, after the third opening third, I found the rest of the film confused and uninteresting with a large number of parodies, and not so completely different from the other supernatural thriller I've seen
