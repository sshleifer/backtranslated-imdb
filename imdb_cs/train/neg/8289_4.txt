I'm sorry, but it's such a bad movie that it's funny. Football hooligans are arguing in a tourist boat? Suits? Tones ?! Alan apparently had no idea what he was talking about when he did, it's so far from the truth you can get. Casting was terrible ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? It does not look frightening, it scares or even hits someone who wants football. What about Yeti? What the hell? Suits, shadows, and seating in the way that they touch each other "the time you got your diaper". Please. <br /> <br /> And Yeti's gang sprays lingerie ICC? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this movie seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. Perhaps the most accurate depiction of the hooliganism crisis of the late eighties I have ever seen.
