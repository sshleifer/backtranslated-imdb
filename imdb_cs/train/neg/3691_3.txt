At first I'm not a fan of Rajnikant, but Baba was a big disappointment. The action and the songs were only average between the terrifying happenings. The story becomes a very preaching. Instead of running behind an office like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seemed to run like another big guru from Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that since the movie came out, Rajni swore he was making more movies! We first had the luck of buying Babu (old Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this one ... it was a great movie that he made for buying this bag ... besides making Baba look even worse! <br /> <br /> Bryan
