Shot was the best story of this film because it gave you the chance to see a passionate and well-formed independent film. Damn when I was looking to fill my hopes How "the film" progressed slowly and fruitfully, my thoughts differed in relation to this "film": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Do actors have to pay the director to be in this "movie"? Did I get a ticket verified at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the Theater! That would be the only exception I will make when I see the movie at home at the movie theater because you can turn around at home. Were there any redeemed values? Peter Lemongelli as a standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially in the collar for dogs. Apart from the fact that this "film" went from trying to be a comedy to a family drama against spiritual humiliation. None of these queues succeeded. Oh, and my girlfriend was really bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
