Wow! This movie is really terrible. I can not imagine how anyone could read this badly written script and give him the green light. Cast is equally second with some really awesome performances from virtually all casts. The story is discontinuous, fragmented and discontinuous. Narrative, Lead, and Predictability. No joke, no spell, no humor. Not only sexy in the smallest. The characters remain as flat as the famous plaque. There is also a powerful stream of misogyny, which has become an increasingly difficult stomach as the movie went on. When your leader (Carrell) is unhappy and unpleasant, he's up the hill. Despite the fact that it is a false turnaround, where love overcomes lust, I have a sick feeling in my stomach. When it comes to humor and social remarks, then we are definitely doomed.
