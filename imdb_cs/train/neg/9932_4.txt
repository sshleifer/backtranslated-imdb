Dan Durya, a perfectly decent B-movie actor who produced a lot of looking noir in the 1940s, can not do much with this: a young man is accused of murdering an unlucky married singer; when he is sentenced to death, his wife decides to solve the case himself with the help of a dead woman's husband. After the brilliant launch shot, it quickly moves into the B-film formula. It certainly looks good, but the twist finish is colorlessly manipulated and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a little stiff. Based on Cornell Woolrich's novel and is passable for one tracking. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
