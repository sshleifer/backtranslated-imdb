Have they used their entire budget by paying porn stars or what ?! <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music, and editing generally were so bad that you think some 12-year-olds want to be a movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was good due to the script ... "innocent virgin" played her role very well. <br /> <br /> Mutants look really cool and it really could be a really great move with the right brain behind the wheel ... but unfortunately for all involved, it's not so. <br /> <br /> Turn left was better than this movie and these guys did not do it, they have no money! The good thing I did not do the movie myself!
