I'm not a bad guy, I'm a big fan of many of Woody's films, probably his masterpieces from the late 1970s (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his concerts in the late 1980s and 90s (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Husbands I really liked some of his newer efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks), but it was innocent, though it was not even worse than in recent years Match Point, but I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a lazy rendition - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes that took off - Woody seems to be also on the way out, line and delivers "Merry "catchphrases" I mean, with all respect ... "over and over again, until the weightlessness all gets a lot of bare. I know most of the actors are the queues to work with, but first they should first read the script - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this - and Woody should actually fall behind the role of the camera in the future if it makes sense for about 20 miles behind. <br /> <br /> It would not be so tragic if we did not have so many great Woody films to match - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody should call it the day before it happens joke in industry. <br /> <br /> Bad bad
