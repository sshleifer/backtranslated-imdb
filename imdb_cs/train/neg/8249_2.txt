Hiya people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is really upset. Think of "Love in fact" in the opposite direction. Nothing is fine, nothing is cohesive, and you certainly will not laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's the overall flop. As already mentioned, there are three assessment points for this blurred film potential. <br /> <br /> A) With Jennifer Love Hewitt's staring star, there will be hordes of boys who share with grace to look at it just to spot a tiny Hewitt with shape-fitting clothing. To tell you guys now ... there are some promising scenes ... but it's really a faint eye candy. "Options" are destroyed here. However I watched that whole thing tried the next scene you know what ..... titillating! B) The end is romantic and positive. It's the opposite and "over the top" is relevant ..... yet it was still a positive point for me. C) Dougray Scott likes a friendly guy ........ EXCELLENT! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> 2/3 is the way through, I am convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt has become another softcore legend. Though it takes her back now ... it is very good for her next movie. And her sister is so stupid. Her husband is so stupid ... and what the hell he's so stupid. Next time. I can not wait for another love actually with JLH!
