Yeah, I saw rough cuts. Uncontrolled sexual scenes. Scene scenes. Nearly the same level as the film "Need" for terrible behavior. This movie is just as bad as bad movies. Bad scenario, bad behavior, bad effects, poor location, bad bits of bad everything. The best "actors" in the film were lap dancers who hired extra vampires! Sean Harry, "Foppish Actor," as somebody else gave, makes dancers look talented here. His amazing ability to drive poorly when he obviously shakes people on the hood (look at the reflection on the windscreen), his inability to turn left, which is a class. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. plus his remarkable use of a gun on a toy, which the props could not even bother to disguise as a real weapon. Other actors on the screen would hardly be able to transfer their lines. It was like waiting for a line that was not there! The special effects were so good that the guys who did it picked their real names from credits! If you want to laugh at a party, then lend this movie ... then there are plenty of good comedies that are just as fun and fun. do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
