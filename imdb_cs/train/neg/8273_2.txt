Many promises and nothing more. The feature cast is certainly according to HK standards, but man, man, it is one of them. No story? That's fine, the action will make up for it as most HK action flicks. What? Is the action terrible, nasty and sparse? The Dragon Dynasty is so amazing to date and is generally considered to be a classic in Asian cinema. That's stupid. They managed to guess a few actors from Infernal Affairs, but they can not bring life into a disjointed scenario. There are dialog scenes where two or three lines are spoken with a cut between each and no continuity in what the characters say. You almost feel that everyone gives a running monologue and just ignores the other characters. Michael Biehn is made of wood, really? Sammo Hung uses a double piece? In any case. Yes. Do not get close.
