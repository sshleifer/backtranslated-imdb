Suppose you've been on a deserted island for the last ten years. They did not hear about Scream and left when Halloween Part 1 entered the cinema. Then this film would be a blast and a whole new vision on the horror scene. <br /> <br /> There is currently a rating of 2.7 on IMDb and does not deserve such a low award. Damn all the way, like "I know what you did," and who-is that when he got to the end he convinced me who and why. No big surprise, just a nice movie that you can watch with cola, popcorn and no desire to get complicated conspiracy, deep characters. If the rental of video clips is out of top titles, you can take them without risk but do not expect majestic work. I've seen much worse.
