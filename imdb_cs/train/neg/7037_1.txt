This is really a terrible movie and a loss of 2 hours of life. He is both restless and insulting, with nudity and lots of violence. However, nudity is not so exciting and violence is repeated and boring. It's also a conspiracy in peace, at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this movie is going to be funny, but it's not. I never laughed when I looked at him, nor did I smile without a smile. The creators of this film tried to combine comedy and action film, and they failed in both. Some badly filmed movies are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
