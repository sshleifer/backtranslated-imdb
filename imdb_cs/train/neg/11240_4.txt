Unashamedly ambitious science fiction by Kerry Conran, for which it is obviously the work of love. Unfortunately, it's just not so good. Everything starts well - with an epic, but reticent score, a mix of Lucas and Hitchcock, and Spielberg's shiny cinema. The film also refers to a series of sci-fi novels, series and films that differ from each other, such as the day Earth became, Superman, metropolis, monkey planet, iron giant, star wars, and a spy who loved me. The film, however, is not as good as any of the following: the main thing is that it's such a love job that is so interested in throwing everything on the screen and creating a new brave estate, Conran really forgets the movie. There is little or no tension, atmosphere or spell, despite air battles, dinosaurs and racing kits. Even the new elements are flat. But it is a broad way of looking at things - these elements mostly fail because nothing really feels real and it is obviously false - the green screen looks like a video game for half the time and it is obvious. Not even the actors do it - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is unpleasant and stupid, Angelina Jolie is useless - and that's all because of a terrible script - a kind that must explain almost everything. It's a decent experience, and some may feel nostalgic, but in the end it's a futile step into the world of yesterday. Nice end, however.
