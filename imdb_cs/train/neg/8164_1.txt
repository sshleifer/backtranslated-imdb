I saw this movie at a real cinema (about $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12 years old, and really in terrifying movies. I remember that I was so excited to see it because my cold uncle had chosen to choose the movie (and we should never have done that before!) And then we were disappointed! Just boring and not scary. The only redeemed thing I can remember was the Corky Pigeon of silver spoon, and that was not all great, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before, and that always left me in the worst. That was what I can recall, one of the most boring, fearless, wasting our collective $ 6, and the loss of the movie. I've read several reviews that say it's worth watching and I say, "Too many," but I would not even bother. Even so bad is good.
