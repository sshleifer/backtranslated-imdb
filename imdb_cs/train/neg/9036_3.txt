I can not believe I'm losing time tracking this waste! I did it because Leonard Maltin got the "AA" rating, and it's usually a reliable indicator of some good entertainment for television movies. The acting was fine, but whoever wrote it should forever be denied access to any communication medium. The plot is ridiculous, the motivation of "bad guys" is totally lacking, and various family interactions are stupid and shallow. For example, the father tells us that the violent reaction to aggression is wrong, but it turns out to be a "admirable" person, not because of his "ignorant idiots" philosophy, but because he is pretty nice with his fists ... <br /> <br /> The only message I was able to gather from this pope was that the nuclear family is good and the alternative living conditions are bad. Oh, and Bad people have become good people.
