I have absolutely no knowledge of Phillipe Pearce or her novels, and if TOM'S CENTRAL GARDEN is typical of her work, I would probably have little interest in her books as a child. When I was a child, I did not really care about the liturgy if it was not for the soldiers to fight monsters with a high number of people. <br /> <br /> Judging by this film version of TOM'S CENTRAL GARDEN I think Pearce writes about lower middle class kids since many of the stories are rotating around the hero Tom Long, who moves to a home without a garden, and suddenly finds metaphysical. You own a garden, it was undoubtedly something that people in the working class did not have in the 1950s, so I think there is some kind of political campaign. There is also a romance involving a young girl called Hattie, but again cynical children are attracted to love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that there is very little in the way of excitement or adventure in the narrative <br /> <br /> This is a children's film that seems to be dated to its source. It is unjustified, but it is a surprise of the IMDB voters' soft ratings. I wonder how many of them would give so many stories to them if they were decades who have just seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy?
