To make such a movie, the threat is real. Do not put up with the Bonzos idea. There is no credibility here. The story is boring and incredible. Playing is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur's Lake (Dagwood), one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Well, at some point he has to face the music and go crazy. I do not care. Are you doing? All these long scenes are set in this sophisticated office (furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most actions happen in a five-minute sequence. Then it ends. Do not bother.
