Demer Daves is a great director when it comes to westerns and the "broken arrow" remains in everyone's mind. As for the melodrama, he should leave to know people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor, or the wonderful Douglas Sirk. The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised when you look at such a delicate screen. The character of Natalie Wood was inspired by "imitation of life" by Fannie Hurst (see Stahl and Sirk) but who could believe that black Susan Kohner was more credible in "imitation of life") and Sinatra and Curtis got stereotyped parts that they could not doing nothing: a poor officer and a rich looking and bad sergeant. who does Natalie fall in love with? France is portrayed as a land of tolerance, where interdisciplinary volumes are warmly welcomed. At that time (around 1944) it was doubtful, it is still for the narrow-minded people you find here and anywhere.
