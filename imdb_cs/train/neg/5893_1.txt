this movie was a fantastic great movie over spooky like hell. and I think it scared me just like a pulse and IT and a sign etc., but with a big movie the wrong ends appear right? RIGHT! these films ended up as miserable things. I think the ghost has come back to the baby house and thinks I've done it now that it means I can call her and it's going to be the right time because she thinks she is. right? poorly. my ass! I do not care if Satan is ghost, it just will not happen. his movies yes, but the worst movies or praise movies like this, make sense, but not. it just showed what I just said and people do not think about it. can anyone tell me why you all did not notice the sad work. the movie ended up in my hospital for me, and that's all. look at number 3 much more ass
