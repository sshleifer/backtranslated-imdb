Unlike many, I do not find the assumptions or theme of this show the least offensive. However, its implementation is a completely different matter. Like so many B-minus films, it seems that all decent shields have been linked to trailers. For most of the 22 minutes, we sat in a fading expectation of any real humor. Or at least something that one should not prevent from being remotely or counting the carpet fibers. With some exceptions, acting is terrible; Comic over-emotion and gesticulating some cast members might be appropriate for late night infomercial, but not a serious sitcom (or Canadian). Regardless of the originally cultural angle, I can not help thinking that it's mainly a bad shot of CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, the tone - and the script - was totally wrong for the prairies. The ultimate insult is that they probably could not afford to work in the site in a real small town (Why? Are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the audience would be disappointed with the exteriors of the Regina Center? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing will soon disappear and that the rest of the world, filled with CBC journalists, will quickly forget about this colossal embarrassment of the sitcom.
