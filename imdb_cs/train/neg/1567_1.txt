I had to change my mind about the worst film in the world that just saw this movie. This is it! <br /> <br /> Do not be mistaken that this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here's a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> A hopeless story (even if it's based on a true story). Haunted behavior (what Judge Reinhold thinks) Unbelievably bad pieces. Children's dialogue. No continuity. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get the picture? <br /> <br />
