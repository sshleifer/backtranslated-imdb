Warner Bros. has produced many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast, economical and very entertaining. I really love how the studio used the less charming elements of our everyday life. This is one of Warren's few melodramas that just does not work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless newspaper editor that revives a 20-year-old story of a murder with tragic consequences. Robinson gives live performance but is surrounded by actors who do not cut mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second lead really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly bad during his big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. Moreover, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in connection with the Hollywood pre-code. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches, but he can not overcome bad acting and inadvertently funny situations. Working with Sol Polito is strong. Somehow, this bite was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture (for the year that "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" gave us).
