well Well, not telling b time guarding just the cause of a big star cast .. I think everything I've seen is a lot of talents wasting their time on the big screen with some pathetic humor that will appeal to I do not know who? some poor songs that will hear who? some pathetic sudden opening justified by who? a race with time? u means waste with time? Ok, first you spoil your child and then you teach him the lesson that we do not know that anyone said that his brilliant new concept is probably some kind other than a man fine fine let me come to comment as people do the movie has a nice message it should be given but it could well be given by a stranger sitting next to you on the bus rather than going to such a wasteful movie to find out that Hindi movies have shown it a lot already and I also can not waste my time writing about waste anyway!
