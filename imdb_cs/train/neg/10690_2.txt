I think it's possible I saw worse movies, but this is a real smell! the plot is unimaginable, but that's not the worst. Direction is not where they're approaching what they'd expect from andy ching. he is able to do good work, but he could not pull this movie together. angie harmon, playing the female will as a reporter who returns for the assassination of the president, actually killed the role. there was no chemistry with welfare, her behavior was flat and wooden, and the 5-inch pointed heels she wore throughout the film were absurd. this excursion to the harmonica puts it firmly on the bottom of the list "b". And what was Cuba good about? he has a number of excellent performances for his credit, but it was far below what we could expect from him. poor james woods and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor.
