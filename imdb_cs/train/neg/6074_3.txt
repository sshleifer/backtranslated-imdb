What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes will be connected to something like that. If you are going to shoot a movie that includes baseball and showing baseball scenes, at least make the action a bit realistic. Why did the crowd stand in the game without a special reason? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie ... what was it? We are somewhat convinced that DeNiro has found his way on the field in referee uniform and that the game is even played in a torrential storm ... one of the worst scenes in a sports movie. 3 Stars from 10.
