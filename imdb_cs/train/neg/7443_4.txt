There were some scary scenes that I always liked more than just, but otherwise this film was rather weak. There were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the film, it was still quite unclear. After watching this movie, I still seemed lost in many ways. For several years, Silent Hill reminded me of something. The film was also unsatisfactory, but it was getting better because it was trying to work and the story really makes sense. This one, not so much. The majority, in the deserted, was decent, but the film stretched in succession and never provided any kind of satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were some scary scenes, but otherwise this film was a mess. I'm sorry, I can not recommend it.
