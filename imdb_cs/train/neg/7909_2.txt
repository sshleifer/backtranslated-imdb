Incredible! <br /> <br /> This movie gets 7 of 0f 10. It must be one of the worst movies I have seen for years. not just that it was incredibly bad, the story (if you call it) was just as bad. Of course everyone knows what happens during the first 5 minutes. This is not a bad thing if you can engage the audience while you were at that moment. That is not true. There is no action, no tension, no spark between the two main actors. Unfortunately it was a waste of time and certainly a loss of my money. <br /> <br /> <br />
