Films gave me sleep before, but no movie ever did it twice, so it took me three meetings to finish. The dialogue was bad. The women spoke loudly and the men were cartoons. And two of the allegedly Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names and clearly spoke with Chinese accents. I'm still trying to find out why the emmental men have been sexually wrapped together. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals heavy choices: do I give this movie a rating of one? or two? <br /> <br /> The films gave me sleep, but no movie ever did it twice, so it took me three meetings to finish it.
