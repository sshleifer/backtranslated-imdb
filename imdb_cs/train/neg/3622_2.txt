I caught it a few months ago in a family channel and from my youth I remembered the TV show and decided to look at him with my 4-year-old daughter. I had to get some psychedelic mushrooms to put it along with it because it's just bizarre! Not only is he a musician with unpleasantly forgotten melodies, desired cheese effects, and star cameras that are long around their collective ancestors, they seem to have been made as a good acid design. Speaking flutes, British children are too old for this kind of crap ... according to Krusty Klown's words "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What have I got?" If you are a huge fan of Sid and Martha Krofft, go for it; Otherwise, if you are not willing to watch before, stay far, far, further away.
