In spite of the great designs in the future, the sophisticated assumptions of the Asimov and Will Smith's great performance, this film does not meet expectations. Clich√©s are thick and fast; (awakening from a recurring nightmare, the Maverick cop has his badge revoked by a hard lieutenant, listing another would ruin it - you see the end of the mile away). This movie is also scenic - you never feel that you have traveled anywhere; what is supposed to be a global disaster never leaves CGI Chicago obvious. The robots themselves are in detail, but the "crowd" scenes look more like bad Disney - CGI is over and over again. And if you can destroy robots by crushing them, why do they need to inject "nanity"? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions seem to bother you before the peak. It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly because of a completely predictable conspiracy that could have come from an action movie for the last forty years.
