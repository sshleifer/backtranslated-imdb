Female nightmares propel her fear of a living funeral. The husband of cheating wants to be dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by putting her in the coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course, B-horror film queen Brinke Stevens will turn into a haunted scary creature. The only reason to see this amateur junk movie is Michael Berryman in a very small portrait and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brink's bloody storm is pretty fun to watch. Special effects such as ridiculous head from head is really terrible. Watch out for "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, we do not expect Fred Olena to have fun, but "Scary Fear" is too boring to be enjoyable.
