<br /> <br /> Once I ignored some of the misunderstanding, it was really a pretty decent horror / monster flick. First of all, I will give some of the good points: the dragon was convincing, especially when he walked through tunnels looking for lunch (a hint: he likes people). - The event was quite continuous and after a faint start, I was somewhat swallowed up by the events. - I'm sorry I was a little bit entangled for the dragon - it's probably the most convincing and consistent figure in the movie. Now for unlikely things ** maybe some spoilers **: - If you were in 1100 AD hunted by a fire-breathing dragon, would you charge his head with gunpowder under his arm? Spirit. - a female character with a all-American name, blond hair and an obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend to be Spanish? Huh? - a leading scientist whose Slavic accent can be cut with a knife and allegedly born in Chicago, educated in the US? - A military helicopter pilot who carries out his own repairs, flies a large helicopter with no other crew, and is a shooting expert and a combat soldier who could start? OK. Uh huh. I will never mention that I give 3 different call characters in 2 minutes when communicating with my base. It's even better than some Japanese monster flicks since the 1960s, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although naturally the end will leave this option open. Or maybe you'll be replacing a real director next time. Despite all this, I gave this 4 out of 10 swing. Add another 2 if they rewrite the story, and Dean Cain gets to eat in the first ten minutes. <grin>
