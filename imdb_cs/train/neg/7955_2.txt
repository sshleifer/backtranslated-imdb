Carrie Fisher has said on several occasions that she made this film during her life when she had a serious cocaine problem, and she does not remember much. That would explain why she shot this film but did not explain why someone else in the cast or crew did; I can not believe everyone has a coke problem. It must be one of the absolutely worst movies ever shot, and it says something. The guilt can not be put on the feet of director Tim Kincaid or "writer" of Buddy Giovinazz, since it is obvious that this picture was neither written nor directed by anyone. They apparently spontaneously gathered because there is little evidence of coherence, consistency, design, conspiracy, meaning, intelligence or anything else. What is really amazing is that some real professionals who have been involved in this volume. Collaborator Robert Joy did a good job in other films and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both veterans in the industry, Marks also was the director and was not bad. Why engage in this accumulation of crumbs is incomprehensible. Tim Kincaid, an alleged "director," made several low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and when I saw most of them, I can tell you none of them is good. But this is by far the worst he has ever done, and it is a great success on his part. Everything, absolutely ALL, about this movie is 12th-rate - at best. Cinematography is awful, acting is ridiculous, "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man," the story is sad, inferior and silly. Do not waste time when looking at the cover of a videotape, let alone rent it. Complete, complete, annoying, complete bagpipes.
