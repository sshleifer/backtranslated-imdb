This is the worst movie I can ever remember. Everything was incredibly clich√© and slowed down. Also, acting was terrible. Working with the camera was not bad, but she still could not redeem it. The writer / director of this film must suffer from Down's syndrome if he believes that this film will help his career. I want an hour and a half of my life back, I've been watching the bullshit. I'd rather watch a video of grass growing than this. I can not believe that IMDb lets me write 10 rows to send it, but I feel that this movie is so bad that I still have to warn others. The reason I lost this movie is that my girlfriend was asking for it from the local library because she thought it was Kris Kristoferson's film, which ended with the title "Disappearances." I do not know what a mistake it was in this garbage that ended up on my DVD player, but I feel that someone in my time, pain and suffering owes me at least $ 20. In conclusion, the director / writer of this film is better off hoping to ever realize it on the street.
