I saw this movie premiered at Sundance 09. Because American beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hope for Towelhead. Unfortunately it was disappointing. In fact, from the countless films I've seen on almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I ever wanted to leave. The worst problem with Towelhead is that it obviously comes from a collection of "provocative" concepts about cultural stereotypes, rather than from organic human drama. The script comes from Alicia Erian's novel by the same name. This is evidenced by Edith Wharton's famous quotation: I never knew a novel that was good enough to be good even though it was adapted to author's political views. This observation is particularly devastating for Towelhead because his political views are so obsolete and simplifying. If it ever happened that Towelhead's white male villains, condescending portraits of blacks, ironic handling of foreign cultures, etc. They were fresh, it's been long ago. For a more detailed review, please review some of the many expert reviews available online. Almost all of us have rated this film badly and exposed the shallow and manipulative tissue on which it is based. On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem easier to bamboozled. As you read reviews in this and similar places, you will often encounter superlatives: "Stunning," "Stunning," "Deep," "Shocking" ... I am afraid to read them, but I am surprised. I have really met a lot of people who consider any book or film dealing with racial, cultural, sexual or sexual issues to be deeply moving, with a provocative, profound insight. If you are such a person, always find the Towelhead and let it move. On the other hand, if you set higher standards, you can pass it safely.
