This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, acting is ... Well, Dani, keep singing or screaming, or whatever the hell you're doing. Random cubs who do not have anything to do are just to catch sexually frustrated Gothic boys. I personally think that this film really suck. Story and characters could be very good if they say that directors, actors and other little things have improved. But the movie is simply bad, the only reason people like this piece of crap is that Danni has it. This movie is perhaps the worst B-rate movie ever. And believe me, it's hard to achieve, especially when you compete with Def by Temptation and the dirty excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, so I see it just like other garbage ... That's really bad. If Dani did it like a comedy, well go. Very good. But above it, I think it's low because it's bad. Look at it when you are in a happy, happy, joyful and joyful mode so you can laugh at everything or if you are on many different types of drugs.
