This movie seemed like I had missed several important scenes from the very beginning. There were the mistakes of continuity and land that stopped as suddenly as they began. I was very disappointed to love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, and he always trusted and respected Danny Glovers' taste in choosing roles, such as the Grand Canyon. I could not finish this film after what looked like eternity, but it was probably just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing that could lead you to become aware or sympathetic to them. There were no emotions in this movie, and clips from their past were badly edited, confusing and useless. What could be a great idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although I think comedy in this situation would be better because I love to watch white people scare and start acting like total idiots, it makes me laugh) has become a carcass of my credit in a videotape.
