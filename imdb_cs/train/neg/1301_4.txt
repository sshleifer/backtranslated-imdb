I recently saw it on Palm Springs International Film in 2009. This is the feature-length directorial debut of the veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven, and on the basis of my observations it should be her last. I hate movies that are so unlikely that you choose virtually every scene. This movie instantly lets you scratch your head. as a young photographer and his girlfriend, working for an international relief organization, have free movement in Taliban-controlled mountains of Afghanistan to talk about their love when the rocket stops the lorry in front of them. They step out of their car to watch as the Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, guns, and grenades performed all five in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts photographing everything when one of the rebels gets caught by a hand grenade that kills his girlfriend. because they are hand throwing a distance that can not be more than 50 yards away, but he somehow gets away. His girlfriend is thrown away and he captures the moment of a grenade impact that kills her and wins the prize for the photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this movie is as ridiculous as it opens. The following year, Bob is on the National Geographic mission at a Dutch resort where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and is placed in the underworld by the underworld of international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I give it 4.0 out of 10.
