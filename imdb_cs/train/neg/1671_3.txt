I saw it on the market at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheapo product bad with it, but you have to do it with a little sex or gore or both. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor who is great for the producers to say. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the spacecraft that descends is cheerful - all the crew hands tremble around! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish people who did it well - at least not difficult.
