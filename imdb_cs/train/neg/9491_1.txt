This movie will really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on the remote control. It is a wonderful boredom in beautiful pictures. Once Hamilton goes relatively lightly to focus shots. However, what was hard to do was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 years old when shot dead, they represent girls much younger than they really are. The whole thing, Lolita, especially because he is an older man, leaves me somewhat uneasy. The hero is actually shaved in the public area to look even younger than she. Come on, sex is a nice time between the adults who agreed. Another thing I found strange was that neither Beart nor Schüte had a boring scene in the movie, no, at least not right.
