I made it short and sweet ... this movie sucked !!!!!! I was looking at part 1 earlier and I thought it was one of the greatest movies ever, giving him 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought Part 2 and 3 would be a good sequel, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and was so completely different from the first one, the conspiracy continued and it is. It was like bad outcomes from the first part or something. I love Walken, but I was sorry for him. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig is in this movie, but do not squeeze, you'll miss him. It was full of cast full of dirty actors and people I do not like, like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a touch of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, one of the most entertaining people in the world. <br /> <br /> This movie will be the first to enjoy you a little less, so do not look at it because you feel you owe it yourself that you are a fan of part 1. I will wait a few days to look at part 3 and pray that it is better than this cage. The last scene of the movie with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever seen on the film. Fast forward or skip if you can not stomach the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 stars - it was terrible!
