I like to watch western movies, but this movie takes a biscuit. Scenario and dialogue are ridiculous. The game was terrible, where did they get it from? The music was fine, I have to say. Luckily, I did not buy the film or did it, but now it got rid of it. <br /> <br /> I was at the beginning when the stranger (martin the cherry) began to tell his story. I have to admit I was looking forward to a confrontation between Hopalon and Tex, where Hopalong shot his finger away and told him to practice for 40 years before he reached his league. But where it all went to the shape of a pear. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would be better, never.
