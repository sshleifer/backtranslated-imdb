This is the first of those collections of "8 films that die" that I've seen and definitely did not want me to see the rest ... even though I've heard that at least a few of them are decent. I do not know, it was not terrible, but it did not do much for me. Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in the outskirts of suburbs, mum and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?) Where it continued to transport domestic spooky food sources whenever possible. The best part was a scary goth sister who, of course, calls a friend from a school that never leaves. Anyway, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on, and so on. This family is like white bread in the Sawyer clan, they're nasty and doing bad things, but they're not souls. I see lots of reviews from the people they liked, and I think I do not know what I missed, but I found it very average and I really would not recommend it to anyone. 4 of 10.
