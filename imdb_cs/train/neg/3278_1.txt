I have to say that many people have claimed that some of us need to get along with the time because the new film "Dukes" is a modernized version. BUT PLEASE. If you think this is upgraded, then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on MSN have also said that (and quote): "You old foggy must get through and besides what it is." Okay, I'll tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm a long way from being and old Fogie, and I can not get it, it's DISTRIBUTION TO ALL THAT'S THE REGION IN HAZARD. The only thing that was in the title "HAZZARD". It was all senselessness, smoking and drinking really necessary. Cast was terrible. Jessica was on some morning shows to discuss the movie, and I sincerely believe it all went into the head. It is by no means Daisy Duke, perhaps a fluke, but certainly no Duke. I love Sean William Scott, but not Bo. It should contain original cast as at least actresses, but even Hollywood knew he would not approve the script. I think that coming to people and today's actors and actresses express a negative opinion, so why some of you give positive remarks.
