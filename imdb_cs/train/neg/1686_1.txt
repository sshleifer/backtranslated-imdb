Imagine that you are asking what kind of movie you want to see, and remember that you see an interesting pendant about "The Grudge". So in good faith we recommend seeing the movie. It's the end of Halloween. And last weekend it worked like a boffo box so it must be pretty good ... so you go. And you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends up doing it, and you can hear audibly that "it can not be the end of the movie ..." But unfortunately it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine it coming out of a movie theater that is ashamed and ashamed of recommending such a dog to the movie. Do you think your date thinks you're nasty when proposing such atrocities, and your proposal will certainly end a promising relationship. In fact, it was so bad that we both shuddered the laugh about how bad it was. I see that Miss Gellar in the movies has no future and suggests that she be kept on television in the future. Actually it will not be long before it is sent to the Buffy Conventions selling Buffy's memorabilia, and it can not happen soon if you ask me. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The story did not make sense; continuity was terrible. Obviously, the whole end was conceived as having "Grudge II - The Return of" Cat-Boy "."
