For shame, it is a shame that a good actor like Joseph Fiennes could afford to be occupied by this nasty shameful head. The film was not only bad but also scary and without redemption. The conspiracy, (was there one?) It did not seem to be waiting. The Russians played silly killing or killing games and the rest of the cast should be declared void for their pathetic performance. I got about three-quarters of the way and turned it off. And "1" for horrible just because there is nothing smaller. Do not waste time on this, you will not miss anything.
