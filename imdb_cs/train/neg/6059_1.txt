I have to say that you are the fan of the man who created the Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best movies. Then you got this POS. I can not reasonably think that it will make all the effort that he did with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at it as if it did not look like a movie. It seemed like someone else was directing him. I do not want to believe that Carpenter did not do anything at all. I just listened to my old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was amazing, especially for those times. > <br /> It uses a style that no one has, and works well for your movies.
