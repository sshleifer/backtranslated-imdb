Like South Baptist, it hurt me to have a below-average assessment of an open Christian film. There is certainly not so much that I want to discourage filmmakers from the genuinely unfulfilled genre. Still, I must honestly say that Love's Abiding Joy is typically a low budget, low key, self-confident Christian film. The conspiracy is predictable, it's mediated (I'm nice) and I'm editing shameful. As a television movie it could be slightly above average, but as a feature film it is very desirable. Continue the exam. You have to have a movie about real Christians somewhere. May I recommend that you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
