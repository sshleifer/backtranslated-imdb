Director Warren Beatty intends to transform the famous comic book for Chester Gould into a live cartoon series (Beatty, who was shown as a detective manager), had the sweet advantages of innocent nostalgia - unusual and interesting from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is a necessary ham, fun for a moment, but in the end tiring. Dick Tracy is trying to take off the gangster Big Boy Caprice, which helps him to love Tess Trueheart, but he dropped him into the evil Breathless Mahoney. In the first half an hour or so, Oscar-winning artistic direction and set design are wonderful to absorb, but as the plot grits alongside predictably (without a real sting in writing) things start to freeze. Al Pacino gets a surprise Supporting an Oscar nomination as a bad boy Caprice and Madonna (which is mostly used as a decorative element) sings Stephen Sondheim's "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)," which won the Best Original Song award. Lots of hearts thanks to Beatty - which was devoted to his vision - but the picture is too cold and calculated. Heat is missing. * 1/2 from ****
