this film brings. the best thing is when the inappropriate teenage adult neighbor tries to ride a bicycle from babysitting and in the background he seems never to be near a motorcycle in his life when he tries to fall short. but this film does not stop there when in less than 5 minutes a scene appears only from the hand that pulls the fence through the fence and into the fridge. Stereotypous barbecue daddy, a few plots that do not go nowhere, and former SeaQuest actress with a bluetooth mobile phone all add that it's a perfect Saturday night at home.
