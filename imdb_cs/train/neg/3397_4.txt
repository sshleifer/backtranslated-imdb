I was interested in the trailer of this film enough to borrow a DVD. The resulting movie is totally terrible! It really is not the worst movie ever made or the worst movie this year, but it's damn it! The main problem is that the movie does not know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting because it deals with the bust of the bride to order, but the film is a mess. What begins with a slightly interesting "comedy" (the word I use in the poorest possible terms) goes in the opposite direction and degenerates into a very dark and unpleasant misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin is useless! Just like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only assume he will do for the money. This is a bad film in almost every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost sexist, you can almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just nasty. A movie that you must avoid if you do not realize Kidman or Chaplin in each of your films!
