* roommates * does not read any further if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Pushing "Phantasm II" has ended; Tall Man kidnapped Mike, while Reggie and the new boy Tim spent most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back and not end up as slaves on the "Red Planet" Tall Man. This is really stupid: the thief of thieves in a bright pink cemetery was just for comical relief and a black karate cat (I can not remember her name) was so irritating that I could not wait to see if the tall man had killed her character. This makes him look almost like Tim's character coming late and eventually hero, but ... it will not quite solve it. At the end of this story, Liz beats the murderers, Mike gets a silver ball implanted into the skull into the skull, the ball gets Reggie, and the dwarves get Tim and no one left to stop the Tall Man. The bad guy wins - how is that surprising twist at the end? It was shot in 1993 and was not released until the '95, and the end of it was final at the time, and though it was disappointing and anti-limiting, it was also a fitting and appropriate end for this weird little series. But the fourth changes this end and adds nothing new but bad jokes and even worse and meaningless end ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
