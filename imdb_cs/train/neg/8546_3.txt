Very unlikely, unbelievable and incoherent Spanish production of ... well, let me see how close I get to it. The film opens with a woman who has one of her cats killed by a young girl. Then she asks her lover to take her away. He says the job and he wants to lose his vacation and says he'll pay for it. The importance of this is that someone is estimating at the end of the movie because the guy, a seductive photographer, spits out beautiful Patty Shepard, the queen of Spanish horror films, apparently taking his bikini for a moment to get her picture for lunch and then to his task at the Witches Mountain - for reasons we never had. Before they go, Patty must stop at the house and out loud, the "mysterious" singing echoes in the hero of our hero. Again it is never explained. The film continues with these two stops in the pub, walks up to the mountain, and finally realizes why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, this film has several aspects that make it better than a bad movie. It has a certain atmosphere, some of the actors are really good (mainly deaf hostin and old woman), the leadership is at least reasonable and the peak - although it does not make sense - is well choreographed literally) with witches in white brassieres and long black hair. It just does not make any sense, although it is a huge insult to me. I could watch the movie ten times and still do not know more than I did after the first look. That's the main problem. Witches Mountain is a curious film from a long line of cheap, atmospheric European horror films that covered this decade. If you get more out of it, better strength for you.
