This is a truly divine adaptation of the novel by Austen. Compared with the American version of Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to remind the book as much as possible. But the acting was terrible. In addition to Kate Beckinsale, who, in my opinion, was a real Emmy in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" to be. He was often harsh and offensive, he had no feeling, and in the whole movie he did not see that his love "grew" at all. It had a terrible impact on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "break out" her lead role and her partner. Besides, there was no chemistry among the actor. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real relationship with Mr. Elton who plays Dominic Rowan. It seemed to her that she was not as broken as she had been portrayed in the book. The movie setting is also too low. Costumes are even more. I wanted to think that Emma Woodhouse would dress in a more modern and elegant way he did it here. The end is also too long. It's good that it resembles the ending of the book, but it's the killer who ends the movie. And again, I see no sense of happiness in Mr. Knightley's face. Finally, I believed that this adaptation is loyal to this book, but to poor actors. It seemed that the film was made without any budget. I'd rather see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, although it's clear that it was done as a "blockbuster" than watching these actors (except good Olivia Williams and better Kate Beckinsale) destroy the whole script.
