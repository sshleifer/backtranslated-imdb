So, what is it ?! I found Nicholson's nature shallow and unfortunately uninteresting. Angelina Huston's character has exhausted my power. And Kathleen Turner is dirty no good fuck. It's not like "I do not get it." It's not like I do not think some thoughts have led to anything more. It is a film that has nothing but the idea that we should accept these ideas, and that is the film that is going to it. The fact that Nicholson falls behind Turner is absurd, but then again. But this does not consider me to be.), Funny, or b.) ... even remarkably interesting !!! It was a waste of my time, so do not let the hype get the best of you ... it's a waste of time! With what has been said, the initial church succession is beautiful ...
