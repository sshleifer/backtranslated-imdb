Anthology is always risky and I think that this effort should be praised. There are plenty of talents. Many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy this movie on the basis of three problems I had. <br /> <br /> Segments first differ greatly in tone and quality. And unfortunately, some of them are interfering with others. <br /> <br /> Second, several segments feel underdeveloped. Like seeds of good stories they never reach. I'm not talking about the happy ending here (or even the end of the season), but rather lacking even the basic development or even the solid setting that attracts you. Last but not least, I did not feel New York and its inhabitants were duly pictured. <br /> <br /> What you have left behind are short high arc movies that may be interesting for some, but the average viewer will remain unsatisfied.
