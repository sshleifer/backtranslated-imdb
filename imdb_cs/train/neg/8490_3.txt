It was a nice attempt at something, but it is too demanding and boring to get over its low budgets. The use of virtual files almost works, but at some points it is bad. They have made good use of that small budget I think. I just want the story and most acting is better. There are lots of parts where you can see what they are pointing at, and it would be great if they actually hit these brands, but not. Misty and incredible story. Bad DVD transmission too. It does not matter to watch the movie in one sitting. I had to turn it off. It was too boring. I can make slow movies. But it's only some of them to attract. Visually, the story-wise, acting, etc. It was missing in all departments, so it never came to a wonderful experience. Perhaps the next attempt will be better for the filmmaker.
