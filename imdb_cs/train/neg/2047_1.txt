I do not want to go to the wound, but ..... it's the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than avengers. Incompetent overhead, unrelated writing, and terrible behavior are the only contiguous elements. Shot on a very cheap video, it looks like a college project but without emotion. Lighting often looks like one sunblock. Sound is a little better than one camera microphone, but everything else is just horrible about it. The disruption is a strange direction without the basics or later resolution, the techies are totally absurd, and editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not bad enough to be fun. It is bad. BTW, packaging is deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> The Left Gate owes me $ 4.00.
