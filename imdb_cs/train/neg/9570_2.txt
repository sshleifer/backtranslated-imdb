For the first time in years, I felt I needed to sign up for IMDb today to get rid of this movie by writing reviews because it was just such a let-down watch. It sounded great when I read it, I was expecting a minimal mysterious thriller, a claustrophobic phantom hunt. Unfortunately, it all aggravates the cheerful, tedious love story and too many furious and teeth-gritty stupid "nobody-telling-things-like-this-except-bad-movies" -dialogues that it's just scary. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick run of the worst misdemeanors of this movie: <br /> <br /> - The screenplay relies so heavily on the coincidence and inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main character that it's just ridiculous. No, it's actually anger. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related: Cheap excitement. Long processions "just in time". <br /> <br /> - Main characters. Well, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced real human beings in real life, but instead gained all his knowledge from bad movies. So his characters are boring, soulless clich√©s of the second generation. They are just fence-devices, holders without the slightest personality character. They are "a man and woman in decay who still love each other". He had never seen before, except for one hundred thousand films, and that was no longer realistic or pleasant. Think of the youngest two-dimensional price in Hollywood and you have it. In this film, there is not even one character that is even remotely fresh, charming or interesting. It's a far-flung, vague resolution that sneaks very badly and needs just one shift, though the word "resolution" may not be appropriate because the movie is a swampy mess that never comes back anywhere. At the time you are walking, you do not care. I just moved the last third of the movie because it was so unbearable to watch. Okay, that's it. No matter how this movie is redeemed, they are all buried under incompetence. Do not look at it.
