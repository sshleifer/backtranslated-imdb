This film was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as Perfect Justice and simply a prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any of the defense advocates or tried to challenge the audience for a real meaningful debate about how the country could be led in such a terrible way. Sure, nobody wants to defend the Nazi view, but it was the BOD of the Nuremberg Path! Four hours when the Nazis just bang. I already did! I really think Alec Baldwin should just keep his husband Kim Bassinger. Immediately after the end of the film, TNT shot the 1959 film Trail in Nuremberg. The movie is better than FAR.
