I have to say that during my childhood I'm quite proud of the many films I've hired. An exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the movie of a cheater of all time in the biography of any actor. Could you imagine what a Whoopie fierce agent would have to say to sign up for this piece of crap? "Hey, you've ever seen the dinosaur show, yeah, they make a movie and you can look at Germany!" After the agent had to refer to the Star Wars a lot. This movie was so bad. I thought Whoopie must buy every copy of this movie and let it destroy it. I just wish she could do the same thing for her memory because my sister still gives me crap for watching this movie. I think I even admit watching Nanny and Kazzam in the theaters (good reasons why I gave up Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a moment), but this is ripping in my mind as the worst of my childhood and the biggest rent of my regret of life, and that was 16 years ago. Now I'm 24 if you want to do math. Whenever I think I will not mention my worst list of worst films because I'm a raped child, I'm trying hard to suppress it ever happened. Screw Whoopie, just glad that people recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst that you are happy.
