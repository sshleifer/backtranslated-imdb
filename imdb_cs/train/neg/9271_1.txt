A small minority that has been seen here praises this film SEX. I know that at the end of the day people have a personal opinion, but someone with more than two brain cells will surely see it as a complete waste. So bad it does not deserve to be part of this license. I can only assume they are telling you how great friends are with someone who is involved in the movie and is trying to make a career. Poor in every way, do not make people different. The story is a weak rehash of previous items, the script is alike. Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not hurt filmmakers for a lack of ideas, and unfortunately, there is a complete lack of fear. Absolutely no redemption of quality, utter scream. I gave this pair of chancers a single mark simply because I had nose to fund someone. They have to make more effort than to shoot a movie. Shame.
