Perfectly stupid weapons. I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal's films intended to fool Jeff to make his forms of dance music at the beginning of this stupid film. The plot is predictable, the battles are fair and Jeff behaves just like the sofa he takes with a weapon in one scene.
