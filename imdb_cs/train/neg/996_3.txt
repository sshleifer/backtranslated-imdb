Revenge is one of my favorite topics in the movie. Moreso, "vanity of vengeance," is one of my favorite topics in the movie. When I saw that Gaspar Noe was irreversible (2002), I expected an even more important expression of this topic. Instead, this film is a weak, elusive attempt, which only expressed the lack of conviction and concentration of the film. SPOILS * The final scene, a volunteer scene of rape / torture on men, was nothing less than a woman's memory of rape. However, the film does not follow. Instead, the stretched scene (which the FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape, both to the extent to which it was graphic and ritualized) is crowned by Dawson's face in the expression of either regret or "It was not messing up anything", while raping her violent continues in the background. My problem with the scene was not a shock, but one of the uncertainties about what was such a graphic scene is trying to get to the audience. I think we feel bad about the rapist? Do we know Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of all this? Do we feel Dawson's regret? In addition to this failure, the film is actually a bit clumsy with more style than nature. The character is thin, the dialogue is monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> Normally, I try to shoot movies according to my own words, but it seems that Descent does not really know what it was. Thumb down.
