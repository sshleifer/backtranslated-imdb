As others have said, it should be a great Hammer-style movie and it seems to me that it's the way it was for most actors to play it ... but the script is so leaded, badly crossed and filled with lots of boring soliloquies Poor Timothy Dalton is populated with most of them) that he is too exaggerated and self-sufficient. It is an extraordinarily weak performance from Dalton, although it quietly sticks to the top scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he did. Only Patrick Stewart, who is really welcome, is the only actor to take off. Freddie Francis might have been a great cameraman, but he was a miserable director.
