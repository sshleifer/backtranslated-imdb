It was perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. The story did not do much, and the acting was terrible. I am a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she is usually a beautiful actress, I can not imagine why she decided to make this film. Her character, Piper, is drunk almost the whole movie, except for the opening scene. On the plus side there were several points in the film where the acting was so bad, I actually laughed loudly. But I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes, but it's 80 minutes of your life that you're totally useless.
