Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was "the one he did pure money for", as well as "the worst film he ever played". Hold on, Michael, were not you in the family and you're in a hurry? And were not these two movies much worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine only remembers the sincerely physically challenging film-making requirements of the 130 degree Fahrenheit flicker (director Richard Fleischer was hospitalized as a result of the sun shot during shooting). What Ashanti really does is not Michael Caine's career low point. Instead, it is a very average thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring sections and a high-drafting tale. <br /> <br /> David Linderby (Caine) is a W.H.O physician who was destroyed when his black wife, Anansa (Beverly Johnson), vanishes during a trip to an African tribal village. Linderby gradually realizes that his wife was trapped by slave traders - headed by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and set off for pan-European persecution that eventually leads to the Middle East. <br /> <br /> On the way, the big stars are tempted for ineffective and unnecessary guest roles. William Holden has a bad kite as a pilot helicopter; Omar Sharif shows little of his usual spell or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison seems to be right bored during his brief role as a useful contact that helps Caine in his efforts. The film is based on the best seller named Ebano, the little-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the tension that made the book so popular is mostly lacking in this adaptation. Ustinov is charismatic as a slave (he seems to be unable to perform poorly in all his films) and Caine creates credible anxiety as a person who thinks he will never see his wife. There are occasional flashes of action, but overall Ashanti is slow-moving. Overall, it is a robust action hockey game - not any terrible snapshot that Caine has often suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly the franticness of all talented players.
