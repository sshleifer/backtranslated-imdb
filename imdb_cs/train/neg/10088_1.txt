I'm an actor, a producer, a director and what I'm going to say. This project was the worst film in the film making history. From the producer to the director and the adaptation of this so-called Film is a joke and I think it's a BIG joke. Why would Blockbuster make that bullshit? I consider my work to be very serious and this film is an insult to my profession. Did the director try to make a bad movie? I think yes. I saw bad zombie movies, but this is Coffie cake and everything on that damn table. TENTO FILM SUCKS !!! I really hate talking badly about other creators, because I'm alone, but please, consider taking a different profession. I respect the fact that you have finished the movie, but I have to ask you "You were in the blood," I mean makeup for your girls, scary Zombie, what do you think. To the whole nation, if I could vote for zero, I should. THE BEST FILM IN HISTORY RECORDS !!!
