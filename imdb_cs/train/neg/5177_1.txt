That's so bad, so it's very bad. The actor is the greatest joke in history. I did not bother to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and it was just as disappointing as it was at the beginning ... I really do not get the taste of people, I'm a fan of horror films and I'm "unable, but I have a limit! the beginning of The Hoast, but that's all, so I recommend you do not lose 15 minutes to watch, I think acting is better to make monkeys, and a big brother with a parent role is just terrible. , I must say that this is not the first time I think the horror movie is bad, but it's absolutely one of my ten films and it will be the place with Portra's Vampire, The Cabin by the Lake, The Hoast!
