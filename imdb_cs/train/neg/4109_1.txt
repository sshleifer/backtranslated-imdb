It can only be described as terrible. It is bad to start and then get worse. When you start, you really have to watch it because you can not believe it can get worse - but do not worry because it does. Another badly written script for the donkey director for non-talent descendants of the past movie stars. It's hard to decide whether the script is worse than acting or whether the overhead is worse than both. As for the hero - all of them, including one scene where he takes all the living lights from the hard one, opens the cabinet door and breaks it against the window. And in another scene he gets into the window and strikes the concrete by 20 feet - or starts to flash - then he immediately rises and gets stuck in the baddies. It's a really funny movie. It cost me only $ 1.
