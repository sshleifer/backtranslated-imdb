I saw a movie trailer several times in the theater and I was excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like the one that was made in the 1990s. She also reminded me of Fugitive Films, walks between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most appealing action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say it's like a television movie. Inaccurately. First, there are much better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, television movies can sometimes be very fun, but this film is just the opposite of having a good time. It's not at all stylish and the most important thing is that the movie's tone is inappropriate. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes that consist of persecution and conflict. Also, they are not big action scenes, but worse is that these action scenes are very tasty as the whole movie. The love between Douglas and Bassinger was unnecessary. In addition, the murderous plot of the president is the most clich√© story in this genre, but they insist on it. And this is not a movie about cats and mice as it should be. Although Douglas is very old, he still has the potential to play in the action thriller. For example, Michael Douglas can not be Tommy Lee Jones. Sutherland is also a bad choice because you feel like watching Jack Bauer and in some ways his character is one of the reasons why the movie is like a television movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a special choice, of course it's too passive or right in this movie, because she is an actress. The movie was not fun for one second, so I could not get it for a moment.
