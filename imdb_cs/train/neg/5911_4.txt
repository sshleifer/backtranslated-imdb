SPY Who Shagged Me is a lot of overrated and exaggerated sequel. The international secret man came straight out of the blue. It was a lonely star, about which few people heard about it. But he was amazingly original, he had sophisticated humor and rich humor, he was always in good taste and he had excellent cast. Spy Who Shagged Me was more commercially promoted and encouraged. OK I admit, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was very funny, or three times that you see all the mistakes. The game was fine, but Heather Graham could not act. Her performance does not seem overly convincing and was not as close as Liz Hurley at first. Those characters that bloom in the first (Scott Evil, number 2, etc.) are thrown in the background and hear and do not have many separate scenes. The film is simply overcome by series. In particular, I hated the way they completely ignored certain scenes in IMOM. When Vanessa was killed at the beginning and Basil sat, he knew he was a fempa all the time. What was that? They killed the number 2 at first and now they bring it back without any explanation. It's supposed to be a spy spoof, I do not think any of the characters even hold a gun in the movie. It's just on the way, further and further down the point. <br /> <br /> New characters are very unwelcome. The whole mini-Me`s fun of my size 'joke is very fast. Fat Bastard is just a chrome excuse for gross humor. Overall, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is either without taste or rehashed from IMOM. <br /> <br /> If it was the first movie of the series, I would probably be easier. But the series started on a note of dry joke and then dropped to the level of humor. So I'm just looking at this movie if you did not see your predecessor because The Spy Who Shagged Me is the ultimate disappointment.
