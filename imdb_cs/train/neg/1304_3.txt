A very low budget police crime movie about murderous detectives trying to resolve the murder of a woman whose body appeared in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only hint of tattoos on their arms. Although issued by RKO, it has the appearance of an independent production that has been captured by a study for distribution. Cast and crew, except for a few exceptions - among them the young and uncovered Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - are made up of complete unknowns and showing it. The performances are universally subgroup and are not accepted in high school training film, the direction is frantic and shattered and, as has already been mentioned, there is no chemistry among the main actors. However, despite many shortcomings of the film, he has some good points. Instead of filming in New York and the extremely low budget of the movie gives him an authentic resemblance to the far superior "Naked City," the shootout in the dark basement is treated well and some investigative procedures are smart. Otherwise it is not much to write home. However, it is believed that at the beginning of the 1950s a look at the strongest part of New York appeared, and enthusiasts of old cars would be thrilled to see the legions of 30s and 40s in the streets. > <br />
