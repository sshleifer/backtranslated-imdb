It is the most basic kind of traditional spiritual story without the revival of the use of Irish sites. If the big M.R. James has ever come up with this thin story - does James really have a story called "Thin Ghost"? - he would not be bothered to make it public. Orson Welles appears in an impassable end as a favor for shooting old friends, producers of this film. His presence and one film in-joke would gain this will - o'-the-wisp his Oscar nomination. This is still proof if it took more than ever that the Academy Awards were never a guarantee of merit.
