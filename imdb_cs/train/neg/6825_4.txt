Once a big action star that has fallen from the face of the country ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead agent of a federal agent. Connect with some former stars to clear the city. <br /> <br /> The low key, often up to the point of softness, the "action" comedy usually does not work. Part of the problem is to distinguish Chris Klien as a former action hero. it's not bad, but it's really not credible, like someone who was considered a hard man. As I said he is not bad, he's just wrong, what's his story. The real problem here is the combination of a scenario that is not really fun and sometimes looks artificially, and the direction that walks into the port of darkness. There is no life in the way things are set. It's as if the director had a list of shots and went through the list. Ensures an unbiased film. And yet the film occasionally comes to life, for example in the final show that ends the film. This sequence works, but because the older parts of the film were melting depleted for the most part by their power. I can not really recommend the movie. It is worthwhile if you are a fan of actors or you are a fan of independent film in all its forms but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
