The Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films that these guys have directed appear to have gathered and filmed with friends who have zero talent in the afternoon when they are bored (the lines are totally unrealistic and unconvincing). I have found that 95% of amateur films and 90% of domestic video footage are better than this movie (although similarities between them require comparison). "Hey lets if someone is so stupid to buy our movies!". Let's hope no one else was. I apologize for those who are involved in the Fly because this review is somewhat cruel, but I was a drug that read your fake reviews and bought the movie.
