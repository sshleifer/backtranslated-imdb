I like Columbo and saw almost all the episodes, but this is undoubtedly one of the worst. A stupid, unnecessary, useless, confused pile of insurmountable mischief that loses both the spectator's time and the talents of the talented Peter Falko. "The plot", like that, seems to be forming when the film goes even without the slightest hint of ingredients on a formula that has made the show so great a success. One part of the proceedings I found extremely mysterious (or possibly annoying) was the character of Peter Falk, who was introduced to wedding guests as "Lt" Columbo. If manufacturers insist that the name Columba remain a secret, why could not they completely omit this line because it sounds ridiculous? As I said, these are pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it as a plague.
