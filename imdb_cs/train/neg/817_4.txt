"You will not shoot those little creatures. They did not hurt you in the first place." Second, they can be radioactive. Oh, the joys of a non-budget 50s sci-fi? Despite this special gem, Superman and Mole-Men are quite unstoppable, even with a poor 58-minute time. Is it cheaper (the only Superman exhibition of flying is incredibly opaque of several animation shots) and quite dull with it even if it has a surprisingly altruistic message? mute Mole-Men, a polite actor with widespread skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without a hat than underground animals released from their underground world by oil drilling, are not malicious, simply misunderstood, and George Reeves steel man to prevent a local small- lead Jeff Corey to kill them. An interesting counterpoint to paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little intention than to recommend.
