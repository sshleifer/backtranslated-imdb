I just watched this movie last night and I had to point out that someone else would be thinking about this movie. In a word - no. I feel that this is something the writer wrote in the Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy stage, ie, every other word was a curse. I have no problem with a deep curse, as in "voluntary hunting", provided it helps to penetrate more into the characters. In this case, it was just a hollow flaw with an attempt to draw occasional sobs or laughs from the audience. The three main characters are all their own unique stereotype, the crazy streak of the street, the cafe and the idiot "I'm-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side" of-a-jerk. You just do not like it anymore! They are all superficial, undeniable losers who want to see lost. For those who dare, this film has several fun moments, the very beginning and the end. The toilet / vibration scene is funny to the sick "Uh, yeah" way. I would really recommend this film to my worst enemies.
