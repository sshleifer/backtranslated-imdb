Die To For (1989) was just another dt.v. which appeared on cable and nas nasem in the early nineties. The only thing that was remarkable in this position was the last movie of Duane Jones, who appeared. Besides, there is no reason to watch this vampire movie if you do not like pseudo-feline flips that masquerade as a horror movie. The tired vampire longs for love and looks for the back street of L.A. and is looking for him. Will he succeed or will Vlad strike again as it did in the last century? This movie had to be great because several sequels soon appeared. They are so bad they look like a classic. I know it's a movie about vampires, but movie makers could be enlightened. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it because I did not like it.
