Stalker is right! The girl sees the guy, the girl wants a guy, the girl tries to get a mundane way to get in it, the girl does not leave him alone, the girl pretends to be a patient, the girl can not stop talking about him, the girl pretends to love another boy two) , she does not watch her because she's annoying, STILL girl does not leave him. She played on the right, Drake's character could be charming, but she was totally unbreakable in the pursuit of the character of Cary Grant, her girlfriend in the cavities was boring and sadly, Drake's attempt to play "disturbingly demented." Grant himself is what is usual for Cary all right, but it's so close to the phone call I've ever seen from him. The direction is dim and the dialogue is just dark. <br /> <br /> Stupid comedy is very difficult to do successfully, and when it fails, as in this crumpled ass, it just smells. Even worse, Drake spends the entire movie, which needs a lot of Valium and a limiting command. It destroys any humor that is in this dryer, rather than mummy dust remains.
