The Thumb idea is not such a winner in the second round. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for many reasons. First of all, I think Mr. Oedekerk had far less to do with the Titanic broadcast. Unlike star wars, the Titanic (yet?) Has not been a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to resonating with the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, holes are filled with one-time jokes that do not really seem to be related to anything. For example, a heroine suggests that the hero is not clean during the action "jumping off the end of the ship" - it's not funny. Rather just think of yourself: "Was it missing something in the original movie?". There were too many of these types of unjustified jokes (compare to spider). On the contrary, the shadowy designer's mission was meaningful and fun. It was also very fun to send a movie that wanted to go "faster" when the maniac ran around and demanded that "everything was" faster "including the sinking of the ship and the first to die, these jokes meant something in the context of the Titanic and gave Thumbtanic meaningful humor. "The Media," the faces and the voices are still entertaining, and the CG sets and animations are worthy of awards, and although ThumbTanic proves that the feature will not work, this movie still makes you fun and smiles up to the end.
