I was so disgusted with this film, I felt obliged to warn others. This movie does not have a story, a plot or a hint of purpose. The film begins with a standard "intrigue," which is now accustomed to every film observer. So we can completely ignore the beginning. Soon we will introduce ourselves to the main actress and from that moment on, it is clear that you have just earned your hard earned money and it would be better if you were static. (If you have not seen white noise - EEK) Efficiency is DISGRACE and everyone should return to the travel pantomime they came from. That said, even the best actors in the world would try to keep this film remotely monitored. Their bad performances only contribute to the disaster. Fruitless violence and what I assume is the only written word of another unnecessary "eccentric" writer who is probably considered an artist, he resulted in a film that will test your patience. Only when my colleague the observer turned to me and said, "We are watching it for 45 minutes," I realized that this film is so thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without tea. There was something missing and unfortunately it was not an audience. Rather than suggest what the movie is missing, let me tell you what: Petite blonde (surprise surprise), Casualties, bad monster-guy-thing, about 2 minutes going, which is drawn through the hours, days, weeks. .. and credits. <br /> <br /> You want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit slim in some scenes, but she expects she will want to see her face twisted for the rest of the movie!
