Five years after the original Creepshow, another worse sequel of horror is written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is truly original or distinguished. The first story is horror, a story about a wooden Indian statue that tries to avenge the murders of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it's too familiar to be so convincing. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play older shopkeepers. The second story, The Raft, is the story of Stephen King. It's about four teenagers who have spent an unconscious day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the kids scream for their lives, like a water blob with each of them for no apparent reason. However, instead of being tense, children are populated with poor dialogue and greedy behavior, which prevents us from really taking care of what's going to happen. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-Hiker", which is in fact a protest re-adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, Lucille Fletcher, was shot in 1953 as a film of noir thrilling film. It was then adapted for the famous Twilight Zone episode of Inger Stevens. "Hitch-hiker" works best from these three offers, but it's not a problem. Lois Chiles plays a cheating husband who finally runs through a hitchhike or thinks. But we do not know if she is compassionate or condemned. As with many average stories of this type, characters exist only to tell tales with their twists and turns. The short story of bullying seems a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears as "creep" in this installment. The good thing is that there is no further sequel. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
