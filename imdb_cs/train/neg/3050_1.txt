Just when I thought I was going to end all year without making a single movie about the "Bomb" rating, my friend brought me this notorious turd last night to my house. I was afraid that the worst of him knew his reputation, and it was as horrible as I expected. This is a Mexican made mess, nicknamed English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects, and it's rather a terrifying Santa who does not work on the North Pole but instead of a cloud in outer space and who does not have small elves to help him make a toy, but rather all different groups of kids from practically every country. The opening sequence where St. Nick laughed heartily, watching monitors that show that all of these kids work hard and sing scary holidays in different languages, seems to be forever and without a story. Obviously, this Santa Claus does not observe the laws on children's rights! Finally, we get the ugly and blind red clothes of a devil disciple who travels from hell on Earth, turn Santa's Christmas ball into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it's bound to frighten babies and turn them off Santa Claus and holidays forever. In particular, the name of Jesus Christ is often featured in this Christmas film, which is somewhat creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are happening. That makes my personal list of "The Worst Movie I've ever seen", but I'm sure it's nothing special.
