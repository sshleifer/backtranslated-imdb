WARNING! This review reveals the end of the movie "Scoop". If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think "Annie Hall" was a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Get one star because you see the naked chest of Hugh Jackman. That's the only thing, "Scoop" went for it. Woody Allen's misogyny and his fixation on women young enough at this time to be his granddaughter crippled any ability to make films as promising: the ghost, Ian McShane, drives a fluffy disciple, Scarlett Johansson, to find out whether English lord Hugh Jackman , is the renowned Tarot Card Prostitute Killer. Magician, Woody Allen, helps a girl. <br /> <br /> Despite the promising land, the film is completely lacking in charm, humor or atmosphere. It's an amazing lead, amateur effort for someone who has made another previous movie, no matter the dozen. Perhaps Allen suffered a stroke that was not lost in the press. <br /> <br /> Much is that unlike previous movies, Woody Allen, now septuagenarian, finally allowed the young man to lead a girl. <br /> <br /> In fact, the plot is built in such a way that nobody gets a girl. There is an early scene where Johansson, without any reason for the film, will be drunk and seduced by a strong older director. "Seduced" is the euphemism of what happens. It's "slam, bam, I have to go". It has no connection with this conspiracy, and makes Johansson cheaper in the eye of the viewer. Why did Allen add this unnecessary scene to the movie? Because he shows a strong director - like Allen - with sex with female leadership. Allen gets her cake and eats it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. He does not know how to talk the screen, except that he is wearing a fixed tip. It imitates Allen in several scenes and it looks strange and sad. It does not help her character be written as a doll that can not work without spirit or an older and less than awe-inspiring magician, telling her what to do at every turn. Is approximately half Jackman's age, and she encounters a very faulty image of presence in her scenes altogether. > <br /> The audience members who are not obsessed with their breasts deserve their heroes better and Jackman deserves better - a scenario that gives heroin some intelligence and an agency and actress who can explain these qualities. <br /> <Hugh Jackman is similarly deceived by a script. Allen apparently can not stand that Jackman is so stunning and young, so Jackman does not say or do anything. Just like Johansson is used only for its good looks. That's a shame because Jackman has shown himself in any number of productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men," he can act. Here's a big conspiracy plot - Jackman, a lovely English lord, he's really a murderer. So even if the film says it's all about letting someone other than Allen get a girl, it will not get anybody. Jackman, the man he loves is a man who murdered a prostitute. Nice, Woody. A nice way to punish your heroine for not having seen it. <br /> <br /> Passive aggressive touch Allen frees his heroine from his own presence by also killing his character, the magician, so Scarlett Johansson himself at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Concluding note: On my screening, no listener smiled at any moment during the movie. It is always a bad sign when the film is promoted as a comedy.
