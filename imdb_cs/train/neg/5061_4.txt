Anurag Basu, who has flown the flop KUCCH TO HAI, debuted in this film. The film was like that in the past, even though it has a story that is different and closer to HAWAS, which was released a week ago and fortunately it was better and done a better job. The film is starting well, Malika is well guided at the beginning despite the scene with Emraan - Malika is too rough / vulgar <br /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malik are well handled and twisted in the story where Ashmith confronts Emraana's brilliant <br /> <br /> The tempo moves fast and the viewer is held on but the second story of Emraan's story is not entirely convincing <br /> <br /> Also the cop seems to be half-baked <br /> <br /> The finale is too much too much <br /> <br /> The direction of Anurag Bush is good Music is the winner, all the songs were great The camera was stunning <br /> <br /> Emraan played very well his nasty strip, it was the role that gave him a star and although he played such roles and in this movie he was he was excellent Ashmith was also good in his role for once, he did a nice job and one of his only good performances and he looked good too Malika was brilliant in her esp role in the second half but her dialing was sometimes up to the mark Unfortunately unfortunately she showed such potential in other Raj Jhutsi movies is fine
