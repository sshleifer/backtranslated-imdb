I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had Commodore 64 and liked to play Rambo. So I was really excited when I bought this movie really cheap. I put it in my videorecorder and began: "This movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says 3 words throughout the movie (except a terrible sentimental speech at the end) and has the same expression on his face all the way. And the silly love in the middle, it's so incredibly predictable. I just finished finishing the whole thing and went to exchange the film for something else.
