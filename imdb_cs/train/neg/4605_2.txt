This movie was written by Charlie Higson, who previously made the "legendary" Fast Show and a show based on one of the Fast Show posts (Tony Car Dealer). He also wrote James Bond's books for children. Actually, I've seen just those Gordon movies that are based on Lovecraft's stories, and each one is amazing. Here Gordon is trying to do something different. The style is completely "modern", which means a restless camera, quick and weird cutting, cold chillout music in the background. It works well, I think, but it's still unnecessary and cheap. I often think of a cameraman who shakes two cameras in front of actors and actresses and tries to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping for something acceptable). Casting is good and there is the whole atmosphere that results from good routing. I think the main character, the "zero" young man, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". The fat kid is also good. And the one who looks like Alec Baldwin, but it's not him. But quite early on, the film turns out to be something not so interesting: In this case, I mean an endless series of scenes of sadism and illness. There is not much humanity in this movie / story: It's totally pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say, no humor. It's a 1'40 long vomit without any moment. Anyway, Gordon remains one of the most exciting filmmakers to be active today, and I think this film is an experiment and a failure. Everyone has to experience losing, only to learn and to find the way again. It may be Gordon's uninteresting and empty work.
