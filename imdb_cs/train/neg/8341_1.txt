I love horror films. I can even appreciate most of the cheeses (face to face, 9 of the 10 horror films are cheese today), but that was just ridiculous. Horrific acting, horrible songs, completely hollow and incredible characters (no Meisner actors here!) And a complete lack of sufficient number of bodies. I wish I could save the 79 minutes of my life that I lost. At least Crook brothers are appropriately appointed. The only good thing in the whole movie was watching Alicia Silverstone, who wanted to be hit in the face. How this EVER made Sundance is totally incomprehensible to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even according to the standard of slasher films. I think he will come! Who would hurry to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after the spooky stalker guy just left their threshold? Lame.
