I admit, I had to go through this misplaced DVD after this 30 minutes - nothing happened and everyone already described the "plot". But someone mentioned the introductory scene - the cutting knife is stabbed with a wig and is chopped on the grass in the front yard! I guess the little girl did it, and he never said that. Really trippy. <br /> <br /> I wish it was a better written or thoughtful film because what we have left is pretty nice and a movie that makes no sense is not a "smart" movie, it's just wrong made movie. I would like to see the cleaned version, and if there was a missing record, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, it's a special movie that's best when it's fast moving!
