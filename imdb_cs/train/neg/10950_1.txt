If I knew that this movie was shot in Dogmeho style 95, which made me exact and harsh, I would never borrow it. Still, I took the dramamine to the sea sickness and gave him the shot. I took very, very, very long forty minutes before I gave up. It's just boring, demanding wailing. The last French movie I saw was "Romance," and it was also a bit dark, but at least the camera was steady and did not breathe all the time around the neck of the character. I'm confused over the continued popularity of the Dogma 95 overseas - it will be in America at the same time as another major outbreak of leprosy. (This is called Dogme 95, because it's the average number of actors cast into the camera.) <br /> <br />
