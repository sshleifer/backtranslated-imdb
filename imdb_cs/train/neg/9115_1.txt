If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she is a real, malicious, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams that she is just a little fool hanging around. She is nothing! People do not! Secondly, Sebastian was cute and hot in the first film, now he's a "baby face". The story is not so good and I do not understand. Why not do it first, it's the beginning. Loose actors, nothing with a story. It's not cruel, it's playing. The first one has a better actor, a better story and its meaning. I think music is better in cruel intentions 1 and music is better in cruel intentions 3. It's not the worst movie I've seen but in compaer with the first one its big, big, big nothing.
