Beaudray Demerille (weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an aging player, wins young teenage Wanda "Nevada" (a pretty but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. An improbable pair (of course) went to search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there really is no need to look deeper meaning in it. It just is not there. The acting is also very weak, which was quite surprising given that Peter Fonda was at the forefront. If you're looking for something interesting in this movie, look at the pretty scenery and a good look of young Brooke Shields. But her character is so irritating (especially at the beginning) and stupid that she never looks completely sexy or attractive. It's bad, but due to the story, I doubt there might be more to it. I wonder why in this film director and director Peter Fonda. He even had to talk his father (Henry Fondu) into the (unnecessary) portal in this ridiculous disorder. Unfortunately, it was their only film together. Could Henry be, for example, in the EASY RIDER? 3/10
