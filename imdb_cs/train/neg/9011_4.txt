Pretty standard B-movie stuff. Seriously, anyone who watched Dean Cain watching "Dragon Fighter" and a lot of people doing their first film should know better than expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. B films exist for re-working patterns that are popular. If you even give them a token analysis, you end the destruction of the movie for yourself (and maybe even write some own important and insulting IMDb overview). I liked the feminine leader Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I thought it was very attractive. It was an unforgettable look of B-movie. Unfortunately, I can not see where she has made some movies since then. I look at her again.
