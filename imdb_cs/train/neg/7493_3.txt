I could not believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly, the background of the Nuremberg process is becoming a clear step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but then suddenly in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience will find the shocking, horrible shots I've ever seen. It is important for people to see such shots (although I do not quite agree with people who say there is no minimum age for children to be exposed to this kind of material), but it was ridiculous in this movie. It was purely to improve the impact of ordinary TV series. It was supposed to shock the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move us with well-performed scenes, inspiring dialogues or an interesting point of view, the audience is tortured by terrible images of skin and bone prisoners. It does not show any respect for Holocaust victims. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
