I was not sure how to rate this movie because it was so bad that it was really fun. I'm no fan of Gackt, though he's talented, despite the strange pseudonym, which sounds like a cat that coughs a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented, but Faith is an interesting album. But there are people here. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top and nonsense, it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. The film has almost no plot, except for vampires with gangster friends. Likewise, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with too many thoughts, which resulted in the lack of time to pay attention to one of them. The action scenes were ridiculous. Fast edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but it is the only such purchase of the film. I'm crazy about good action movies, but the action was terribly hot. Although the last shootout was fine and the peak of this otherwise depressing film. Still jumping between genres is not a good thing. It wants to be drama, action movie, horror or romance ... what the hell. If this review is angry, why? Is that because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not be angry, this movie is bad.
