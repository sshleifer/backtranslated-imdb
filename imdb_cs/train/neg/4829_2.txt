As an ordinary filmmaker I can not say I was looking forward to watching this. It's not too emotional for drama, not too much of a thriller, not too fast for action. Moreover, some moments of the film are hardly trusted. OK, understand, soldiers are a bit out of the way, but it's hard to believe that one would risk their lives, a carjack in the middle of a hostile city, and after being called out by a professor's wife without having to ask the question (in the right way). It would be terribly romantic if it were some animation, but it should be a SERIOUS movie about the war. There are several episodes like this one, so the whole picture makes it look like it's just a rough preview of the movie and it takes a lot of effort. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the filmmakers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This image left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the movie :)
