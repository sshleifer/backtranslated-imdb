This certainty is just one comedy I would not have forgotten for a while. <br /> <br /> Normally, he would not bother to comment on this movie: it's so tiny that no one is watching it, but as it happens, it's popular in P2P networking like Kazaa, so this saaad must be exposed for what it is. So what is it then? Well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it's meant to be a horror - it's a "key word." The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess, special effects are just strange, they are especially pathetic, and in terms of acting, let's say if it were my graduation game at elementary school, my teachers would of course realize that it was a film with a very low budget, and that in such cases, one should lower expectations as to special effects. Even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I'm aware that these movies are rarely places where you're looking for interesting scenarios and top acting. But still. <BR> <br /> B-movies often have some redeeming features to avoid a lack of funding such as humor. The only laughter in Cradle on Fear lies in an absurd performance. If you can find humor - and I could disappear in the first 20 minutes or so - then it will be the only thing the movie offers. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts. Woohoo, how exciting. As for the story, it's not even that they do not try to say anything: victims either use drugs and / or engage in serious crime. Lesson: Watch out for naughty boys and girls, because one day you have to pay for what you did. <br /> <br /> I am fixing my case. <br /> <br /> So, overall, a little bit of sex, quite a lot of drugs, but absolutely zero rock'n roll. <br /> <br /> I rate this one out of 10, but if it is. Or maybe I would not: he deserves 1 to correctly write the names of the actors in the titles. I mean, is that something inning?
