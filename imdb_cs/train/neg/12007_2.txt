It is amazing to see how Nikhil Advani is able to attract people to the theater until the very day of his release. I mean ... Look at the cast here, the promotion is excellent, enough good songs and the trailers are all right. It makes him full house the day before, but when people go and see the movie, they realize that their money is in no way reversible. The house full of the first day, the movie is out next week. <br /> <br /> This film inspired by real love is what they say, unable to handle the entire cast. They tried to get into the big stars, but ended up not even able to show the average performance of any of them. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can not connect with any of them. It is a great disappointment for all who like great stars, or Nikhil Advani after his great success "Kal Ho Na Ho".
