It's not a cast. A perfect group of actors you could not find. It's not set. The director is in love with New York and we're all at the end of the movie! Woody Allen has failed to improve what Bogdonovic has done. If you want to love or find love, it's where to go. No, the video problem is a script. Is none. The actors are at first sight in love, the words are useless. In Hollywood's own experience this is what happens when they go to work on a set. It's reality for him and his peers, but it's fantasy for most of us in the real world. So in the end, the film is hollow and shallow and without news.
