*** HORSE SPOILS *** <br /> <br /> Humpback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and first has sex for the first time. After surgery, she puts herself in bed and does not touch her. The next day he came to the conclusion that he did not like him very much and did not want to try it again for at least several years. This is a seemingly great introduction to teleplay that the boy has discovered his homosexuality, or maybe a health drama about post-adolescent teenagers with severe hormone deficiency. However, as the story unfolds, it is the story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his mother. At one point his mother tells his colleagues who are not as understanding as they might be: "Every step of the way in this, my son was amazing ... I was never proud of him ..." The older sister of the young father who is otherwise cold to his brother, he begins to show pride to his sibling: "You were fine this one" because he gives him a warm, warm embrace. A 15-year-old father wants to be a father. She wants to be a parent. Why not? We see a "new" baby a few minutes after birth - it seems to be a healthy, happy four-month-old child. Just as the children were born on television in the sixties and seventies. Once a young father is a parent, he finds happiness. He insists he will be the one who changes the dirty diaper. We see a 15 year old father frankly happy to hold a baby while a teen busy mother has a shoulder over his shoulder. Fade to black.
