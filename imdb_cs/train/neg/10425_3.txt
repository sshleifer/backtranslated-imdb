This movie is great, you think - but just as the story tells a very BAD. Stella is so gross and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small. They never learn better. Is it realistic? Somehow Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her hideous ways and dress, but can not understand that she just needs to tone it all up? I think yes. Stella is a good woman and a very good mother. Getting rid of herself so her daughter can be associated with a lot of bigotted snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see was normal for times of time - people with beer or two, enjoying playing piano, dancing - but it is some moral inferiority. "I can not have our baby like that!" Save me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me the one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class can never hope to seek higher levels. And that's just a burden.
