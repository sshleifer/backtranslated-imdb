With the title "borrowed" by Werner Herzog and the liberal aids of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay is considered a cut over the usual waste that our UK cinema will culminate. "Robert Carmichael" (in short) is a realistic study of juvenile alienation and apparently criticism of the Iraq war. The problem with realism lies in the fact that the characters are so unrealistic and atypical - unlike the false ideas of "extreme" directors, most teenagers are not a violent drug addict. As a critic of the Iraq war, the film about youth violence (a talented classical musician - an underworld corrupted by this sensitive person) is so infantile that we can hardly think. There are signs of technical abilities, but some reviewers have overestimated it. Like Kubrick and Noe, it shows that the desire to shock in connection with the assumed serious intention may be the worst film end of a recent film. People liked "Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible," because they liked rape and violence, but they loved cultural enthusiasm because they liked the things they hated most. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) here marks one of the most picturesque films in years. (I'm not against the violence in the movie, but it's really a bad trick - the people in the cinemas polled Alex in "Clockwork Orange," showing how Kubrick's planned intention was missing for miles, trouble-free violence is much easier and less offensive than many art directors .)
