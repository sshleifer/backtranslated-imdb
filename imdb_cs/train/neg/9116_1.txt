There is no decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The guy who plays Sebastian is also upset. He does not even look like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. Two other girls are terrible. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also bullshit. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (probably having three): If you can not beat them ... Virgin Girl: Who says you can not beat them? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The end is in contradiction with the original of the original. In the first film, it's clear that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One reason why Sebastian wanted Kathryn so badly, except that Sarah Michelle Gellar was playing, was that she was "the only girl she could not have, and it killed him." It was the teasing that she liked to play with him. The fact that she never gave it increased her taste. Then in this P.O.S. that means she can have it along with the girl on her side. What? And we do not even see the sex. This is implied, so it's not only stupid, useless and contradictory, but also worthless. And in the first, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love and lost him. Even though he won the bet, his chances fell apart. Then in this excrement, losing AND falls in love. So it does not jump "losers", just the complete losers? Another thing: it is stated that Sebastian was never in love, so what do you say about Virgin Girl? Then at the end, the doll is suddenly revealed to be Kathryn's evil lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they get into the chrome triple offscreen trio. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other contradictions. Writer even saw the first movie? 5 years old can show their stuff out. After three, Sebastian sex with the blond virgin, corrupt her innocent mind in the back of the limousine, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned the evil lesbians in Lame Twist Twist fits in front, listens and smiles badly into the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> When Sebastian becomes the ass that was in the first part, he could make an interesting movie. I think everything that little Sebastian had to do was a tricky one with two hot girls. Interesting.
