this film has definitely resolved me. it was a great concept that was destroyed by a terrible script. The story simply did not run and was in the best layout. To this story there were so many stories that were not explained or forced without any real thought. elements like a love story could be somewhat expanded, and cannons have to be written better. the whole main character that grew up needed more training and less. everyone likes the good "little boy overcomes" the story and it showed a promise, but the scripting failed. While there was some pyrotechnics in the final bit sequence, it was inadequate due to lack of choreography. it caused crazy boring watches <br /> <br /> It could be so good :(
