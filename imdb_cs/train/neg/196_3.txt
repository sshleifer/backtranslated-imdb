This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before, it shows more of the Alamo mythology than history. The production is bad, the overall impression of a welfare project for many actors who would otherwise have to work on Hollywood Squares. That was the biggest flaw for me - I know that the elders and general personalities of real protagonists Alama and the geriatric set of television actors who were chosen to portray them never let in any sign of credibility. Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about history. I can accept decent production from both sides (although I prefer historical accuracy), but it never allowed me to. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life than this bumpy mess, while they were just a little less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid this.
