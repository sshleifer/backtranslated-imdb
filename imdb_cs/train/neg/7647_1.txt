Bridges from Madison County are better versions of this story. I felt that the end of this film was not sensitized as it was in the original English film. This movie is very indianised if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when a hero dies at the end you will love this movie, on the other hand if you are a fighter in life and I mean crying them for wimps you can not as an end. it's a pretty good subject is well treated with Indian conditions. Tabu was good as a caregiver and mother. Everybody played well.
