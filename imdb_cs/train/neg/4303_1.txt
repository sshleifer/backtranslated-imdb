The previous comment made me write. It is said that Muslims are blond and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This remark simply says that this view can be racist. Beware, the race is nothing. I'm the color blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. So what can I say is that I'm not a 100% Serb, I have some Austrian and Croatian blood inside, but what's the point? Am I dark, half? Everyone who uses racial prejudices with such a bad intention as Lantos (producer and director is racist for me, Karadzic, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, Tudjman are all the monsters and blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yugoslavia, I am proud of being Serbian and proud of my cousins, Austrian, Croatian, Muslim, Hungarian, Arabic (yes, I am from Serbia and I have a multiethnic family), it does not show the suffering of the Serbs or the Croatian in Sarayev , terrible street gang terrorism, Muslim extremism, and I add: I humble and pray for all the innocent sisters and Muslim, Catholic or orthodox brothers who have been killed in this war, this film is the manipulation of our misery, a false humanitarian aid that does not help at all. fill your pockets with the lid, all right!
