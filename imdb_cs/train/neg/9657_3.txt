1) I'm not a gun expert, but I see the difference between US Army riffs in WWI and WWII. In the movie, we see private people armed with the "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not the authentic "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), which used until World War II. Difference - M1 can load 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires reloading after each shot. Little difference ?! 2) German military uniforms have borrowed since 1940 and a year. Especially - helmets. German helmets have a great pint at the end of the First World War, we can not see one in the movie. And if we do little in the archives - how true is this "true story"? I am surprised how many "true" film directors can be in the effort of cheap distribution.
