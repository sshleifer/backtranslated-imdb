This is the kind of movie that you regret having inserted your video recorder. It's a strange unsuccessful version of Stephen's Kings "Misery (1990)". I do not understand how this movie earned a score of 5.2 because it has no story of how it always was and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved. This movie was supposed to be released as a short film instead .. a lot of time spent on the same thing. And as in any bad movie, everything is happening at the end of the movie within 10-15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So before you decide to watch this movie, make sure you get new batteries in your remote control because you will do a lot of fast forwarding ... you do not have to worry, you will not miss anything important.
