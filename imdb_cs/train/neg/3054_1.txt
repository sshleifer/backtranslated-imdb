The NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the FSB, and all other snoop agencies in the world should watch this movie to get information on how to spy on people. (as mentioned in the MST3k commentary ... "Sanata has dirt on everyone!" Santa's Tentacles reach wide and noticeably!) From telescopes that can trace millions of miles into the ears that can hear everything. It's amazing that the CIA does not have Santa's payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is cheerful. Pitch ... is so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese's factor is huge. Very low budget, but fun watching. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 for even more laughter. <br /> <br /> You can even laugh at the misfortune of good kids. I give it 1 for quality production and 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
