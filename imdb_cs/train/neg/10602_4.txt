This film is mostly bullshit and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme stars in this movie. There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie. > <br /> The actress in this movie is so bad and the worst acting I've ever seen and two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not act on ALL.And this film by far has to be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes the worst movies that he did, and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies he should watch blood sports, KickBoxer or sudden death. This whole movie is crap / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
