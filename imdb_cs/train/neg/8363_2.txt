I gave her 2 place 1 because I think the "Wongo Wild Women" is worse. This is the exercise of patience. It's like a tooth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. Certainly there is no action (although the shark has some good dialogue). We do not waste anything. We do not know how people got where they got. I'm always amazed how things get this way. I agree with the previous writer that it is not funny either. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and it will fill up a lot of space on the DVD collection. It's like a tissue. Or the bad picture you bought for the sale of hungry artists. Includes a crack in the wall.
