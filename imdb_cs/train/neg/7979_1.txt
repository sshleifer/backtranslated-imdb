This film was slow but tedious, and acting often came to the ground of ham. Redgrave's character was uncomfortable because a 60-year-old woman is trying to compete with Thurman's 20-month-old for love of the character of Fox (why he's behind me). The title of the film was "Plenty of people on the lake". The actors played as they did on the exam. A terribly predictable end of booting. I can not believe it's like a comedy on this website!
