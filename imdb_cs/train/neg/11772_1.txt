I will be short ... This film is embarrassing for all but its cameraman. The fact that this is a critique of the sex tourism industry appears to be valid until we "treat" the persistent dance scene. This story is funny no one except the wildest fan of BAD horror gets some of it. And because of God's love, please stop saying that this movie is a story about losing innocence or even empowering women, because it's quite clear not (childish lesbians, what the hell?). it was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival (which I've seen so far), someone even collapsed in the middle of the movie, probably because he could not take more. it may seem like a too critical rant, but I really can not find the redeeming feature of this movie except maybe if you like it as a pure comedy. In short, this film is best watched on a cocktail of Class A drugs.
