Christopher Lambert is unpleasant and disappointed in his performance as GIDEON. This movie could be classic when Lambert played just like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Damn, the story is meaningful to us, Charlton Heston, Carl O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters have been outstanding. 3 out of 10.
