I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with a brain and joke, not to mention his face, pectorals and all others. Since I've seen him in "Thelma and Louise," someone has been thinking about what reminds me of? "Troy" did it to me. It's a new Brigitte Bardot. Differences, of course, are obvious. Man, American, etc. But Brigitte Bardot nevertheless comes to mind. He is so beautiful that he is most effective when he plays against him. "California" "12 Monkeys" "Snatch" Combat Club "His suicidal humor makes him a man, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon forget. Only static photos with Pitt, semi-naked in remarkable sprint positions are adorned with legions of salty fans. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen managing? Well, I suppose it would be hard to say not when working with the new Brigitte Bardot.
