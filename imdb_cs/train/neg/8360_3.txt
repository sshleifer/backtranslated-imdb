What do you like this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> It has an impressive underwater shooting! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well in time! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music is speeding up! Especially when the shark or the unfortunate people are moving! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it slows down! As if we were talking to the audience, it's time for compassion! <br /> <br /> Like other bits of dust! As if in "Spagetti Western" it has a lot of similarity! <br /> <br /> It's not like the Italians can not produce quality production! There were a number of television films titled "Octopus" numbered 1 to 7, screened in the SBS TV series in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-style conflicts! And they were great! But unfortunately, you will not find it here! <br /> <br /> I suppose it was made around the 1960s! Unfortunately, it was 20 years old, as the funeral scene is near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was a sharp shark of a fast shark that causes red dust to appear repeatedly in bluish waters! <br /> <br /> Whether it's in the shit in the bar or watching the latest demolition on the sea shore at an inexorably hungry shark, the hero's friend looks through the glasses that worry about her as if he's also boring in its inexorable role in the midst of lack of much evidence of plot or one's character of development! <br /> <br /> At least the hero suggests that his ex-wife is late. <br /> <br /> But of course, even if music can not awaken our realization, we have a sinister sound in the sounds of baddiens as if to force us to see another dark act! <br /> <br /> And at the end, someone thought twisting! Just when we thought it was all predictable! But stay tuned, people, because you can find another procedure! If you are watching closely! To more or less, warm up your heart! <br /> <br /> Watch the hero's advice and a couple of beers on the way! It will make your viewing "Night of the Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you will be ready for something similar to the movie "007", which will make your way back to reality when it ends!
