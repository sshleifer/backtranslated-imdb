I have always said that some games, by their very nature, simply can not be translated into the film, and this is an example. <br /> <br /> As a game, it's a very fun fake satire of a Catholic with a wart joke and a central character that is so incredibly unreal, we must root it even when it begins to murder its parishes (one of them made a fatal mistake when admitting , that he has not sinned since his last admission, so he feels he sends him straight to heaven). This is just one example of how far the game goes beyond reality, and it works in the trusting world of the theater. However, this kind of increased reality rarely works on the film, and certainly not here. Director Marshall Brickman has gathered a fine cast that does a great job, but by putting all that absurdity in a realistic fashion comedy becomes a tragedy and stays with an empty feeling in your stomach. <br /> <br /> Instead give off the production of the scenic game, you will not be disappointed.
