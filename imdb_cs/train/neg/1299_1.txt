This production has absolutely no story. The game is embarrassing. Promising Dutch TV star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this movie to her resume. Her behavior is far from flawless and personally I think it has crossed the boundaries of professional decency; which concerns the way in which this film is exposed. This movie contains too much nudity, vulgar sex scenes, and rough language. It also shows the bad picture of the Netherlands (as most movies do). Do not bother watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who proved to be better with her on the screen.
