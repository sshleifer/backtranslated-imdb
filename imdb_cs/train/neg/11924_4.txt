RUN ... do not leave this movie !!!!! Focused on very young children, this film will fill you with tears. If the Gamer trilogy of the 90's raises the bar, this film has just reduced it. It is a slow pace and the fight with monsters is good, but rarely. This film dried me in a box of cats. Just a very poor offer after the phenomenal 90th series. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the ten best reasons why Gamers fans from the 90th year FIND this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a drama that follows a child who tries to cope with the death of his mother and is afraid of losing a baby Gamer when he learns that his father saw that adult Gamer died . You see an adult Gamer about a minute at the beginning of the movie. Will his ass kicked a couple of Gyaos and self destructs ??? Looks old and lethargic. It does not look like any gamer you've ever seen. His suit looked cheap and hurried. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamer you see in the rest of the movie looks like a Pok√©mon. Big-eyed and cute ... it reminds you of Godzilla's Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamer is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This film has the pace of watching the NASCAR race during a 3-hour rain delay. I watched this movie with two other Gamers fans, and nobody was satisfied with the slow movement of the film. I saw a SUV full of fat people walking on a mountain road moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had very little time on the screen. The Final Wars had much more and better fighting, though they were short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children play a major role. A friend of all children's subjects and bad writing killed the original Gamer series in the 1970s and history is repeated in 2000. Gamer's most successful films left Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why return to an unsuccessful formula? It was a new trilogy and bad ticket sales killed every chance of continuing this story (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamer lost his iconic roar. Now it sounds like an elephant with a strep throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can bring a new Olympic event ... Imagine it is a transmission plant that involves sending very small children into danger. You must see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Yeah yeah .. you are sending your kids to the kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. Special effects were good, but sub-par for Gamer. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was to show an apple sized baby Gamer fly. It is not very impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is not just what adult kaiju fans expect. The director participated in the Power Rangers and shows it. Looks like a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on the third street and TMNT. Kudos, if you know all 3 references. <br /> <br /> Find the best or ever watch if you buy it to complete the DVD series.
