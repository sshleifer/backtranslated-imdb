I have long since promised that you NEVER NEVER KEEP the movie EVER, who was a regular member of the "Saturday Night Live" series. I did not have to rent "Corky Romano", but I had to watch for half an hour with my immaculate good behavior. Then my good behavior failed. Silly, not fun. Boring, not cheerful. Bad, not good. That's all I can say about this video.
