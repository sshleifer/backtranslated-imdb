I felt the movie was dry ... very disappointing no plot ... waiting for something to happen and nothing disappeared like bone ... losing money .. One of the worst films Robins Williams .. if you do not believe that I'm waiting for a couple of months, it's going to be on DVD because it looks like it's a model for movies that are not good at theaters because they're like rents a year ago ... This is the one you do not want to see or say why I spent your money on it! In addition, because it was such a new movie, there were only 8 people. It was Friday night at 9:50. I also felt that there was a need for some excitement or something that would keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the movie, the voices were also very low, you could not hear what they were saying.
