I've heard many stories about this movie being great ... Well, I took a chance when I saw it for a cheap price on Ebay last month.

But the two are ridiculously wrong ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this film (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, it looks nice in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is about ...
