I was unlucky to watch this waste on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror films, because most of them are just garbage. This is even worse: it's one of the stupidest bites I've ever seen in my life. Horror? Yes, things are terrible: acting, screenplay, and special effects - God, I laughed at this sad 90 minutes. Actually, it would be a comedy movie I'd give him 5. Do not you think you'd borrow it if you do not want to mock the manufacturers. Vote: 2 out of 10 - I did not vote because it always made me happy ;-)
