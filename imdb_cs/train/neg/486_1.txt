This movie was a blow to me. I think little girls should try to be nothing more than swimsuits, domestic creators or lovers, because that seems to be everything they will ever be portrayed. It is really indifferent to see the work and life of an artist who is so unfairly misinterpreted. Incomprehensibly (or perhaps expected), the whole character of Artemisia and everything she represents has been reduced to a standard Hollywood female figure; a deplorable, physically flawless, helpless little being who does not have any of the characteristic features that have truly earned her place in the history that has been mutilated here. Even more sad to see that much of the audience was too poorly educated in this area to understand the incredible gap between the message in film and reality. To interpret an artist as someone who is in love with her real violent person, someone she actually accused of rape, even if she is tortured, is simply angry with me. If the director had nothing more to say that he should not keep his story on a real person.
