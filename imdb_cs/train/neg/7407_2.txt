1. watched 18.6.2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): A strange psychotic film about a girl with autism being tested in the hospital, the power flashes and then the hell falls apart. I honestly did not know what the intentions of the filmmakers are. What we get in the next hour and a half (at least it was not longer) was a twisted horror / twilight zone / zombie / fantastic film that eventually did not make sense at the very end. Initially, after a power failure, everyone in the hospital is missing, except for a small group of mistakes, including the girl and his father. There is a typical annoying figure, a scary old man and a typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course, a young girl the main character gets attracted to. A random thing begins to be done at different times like monsters and monsters that indicate that time has stopped, and dead people when this small group tries to escape anything. Of course, the autistic girl is at the center of everything, and I really hate how they used this girl to suffer and suggest that it was the cause and place it in a hospital where people are carefully treated. We will never find the answer to what is happening, which is very strange, please avoid this dog. If you do not want to be exhausted and confused for one and a half hours, it's not for you or for any viewer. What a waste of time? Really!
