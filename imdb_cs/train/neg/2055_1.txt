There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this "film". The original said it all and still holds it. Either read a book or do some research on this story and find out that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could do a better job! After Holcimb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, the files and places have never seen them like Kansas. The original is riveting, from filming the site to using real participants, weapons and casualties. Unforgettable performance by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Quincy Jones Soundtrack and Conrad Hall ... The original is available on DVD in wide resolution. Let this turkey die by quick death.
