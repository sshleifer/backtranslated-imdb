Charles Bronson continued his 80-year fall with what might be his worst film decade, if not at all. There's a detective in it who makes a great effort to trace a pimp who kidnapped an Asian girl and is currently selling it to the highest bidders. It is a shameful attempt at action and is quite perhaps the most used movie ever shot. Many people see the continuation of Death Wish for the worst Bronson movies. Continuing Death Wish was not a great movie, but in most cases it was professionally created and very attentive. Kinjite, however, is a totally boring thriller that is interrupted by average racism and child harassment. In fact, it is a film that repeats itself, and it is all aggravated by the fact that it is trying to preach the "law and justice" mentality that is too revolutionary to really say anything. In fact, the film begins with Bronson being interrupted by sexual abuse and then abusing the pedophile with vibration. I watched the theater in Chicago, just wandering about the impassivity of the scene, just to get caught up in the misfortune of the pimp who raped the girl in this film. It makes no sense to abuse it, and indeed the film has not been written enough to get above the level of exploitation and to provide something that works. Bronson seems to be more into things, but obviously it's too nasty to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the best actor at all, but this endeavor is ultimately his worst. The action sequences are also bad. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4- (Awful)
