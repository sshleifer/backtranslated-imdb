The summary of the IMDb plot does not in any way describe the essence of this film. It was to read: "Be prepared to be ejected back to the third bench bench from the back of the family church at the age of 8, listen to the preacher for the will of God, while all you can think of is to bring your Lego home." The well- build an intrigue by putting on real and surrealistic footprints like Renny, how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast? moment. It then slowly transforms into a Christian jamboree that has completely killed its conspiracy to wash the evangelizing mist. I believe I count on using the word "pray" about 53 times in five minutes at the end. After 31 days, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym "prey". I am sad that this little thought game has brought the film for at least the last 20 minutes. Moreover, I was laughing if anyone would say "prayer" to me when it became completely embarrassed. Even my Catholic woman sank in a chair from boredom, almost to the point where she ended up on the floor. For all the salty Christians who have placed this movie at 8-10 stars, I propose your theological security standards like Circle Square, Ten Commandments, Something from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar, and so on. Stay away from more cerebrally demanding themes in movies like Jesus Kemp, God, who was not there, what Jesus would buy, or soon released religiously. A possible book by Robert Whitlow is better.
