Unsolicited direction leaves a decent cast, which is in a nice but inappropriate adaptation, in which the dialogue seems to be more sincere than heartfelt, and the scary spirits can not capture any sense of respect or spell; Edward Woodward, like the Gift of the Christmas Gift, stretches on stilts and seems to be impressed by Bernard Cribbins. Just like Scrooge, George C. Scott is too frantic and seems to never really believe, which makes his performance impossible. The scenes in which he has shown his past have as much influence as if he was in the mid-heart of the family album. Nobody else seems to be making any effort except Frank Finlay, who chronically exaggerated.
