Nowadays, incredible special movie effects have been disappointing. The actors looked tough and uninitiated as well as dialogue. Westerns are not a common prize in Hollywood, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone out there still knows how to do good. Since it's hard to imagine anyone going for some spending at release, and less so, he's making a weak film like this one. If you like and look for a good western, keep looking!
