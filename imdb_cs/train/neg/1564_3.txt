... so that I can, with a good conscience, tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I could hardly find it twenty minutes before I started thinking, "Wow, that's pretty bad." And to be honest, I'd give this movie one star if it was not for Esai Morale (although he had very little time on the screen). It's the only role of the movie, which is shame, because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. By watching this, I began to think about my parts in "Shawshank Redemption," and I realized it was not as good as I thought it was. The problem: his prison house / hard man seems to be just such an act; his dialogue sounded as if he had made a very bad impression. Has she ever met someone talking to her boyfriend? I doubt it, but maybe it should be. And to make it even worse, he managed to give him a small prison philosophy, and it turned out that it was nothing else than to think that the rhetoric was bound to a "rasta," an accent so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> Normally, I should not block the movie like this, but when I saw the movie had a fairly positive overview. I felt I was cheated and deceived, and I thought I should try to save somebody who had to watch this movie.
