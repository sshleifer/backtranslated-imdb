Plot = Melissa is a new girl in the city, she is fifteen, and her birthday is about a week away. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in the city wants to join her, but the couple who managed to attract her interest will mysteriously die. To be honest, the reason I wanted to watch this movie is Dana Kimmel on Friday 13th for 3 was in it, which is not the right reason to rush and see the movie. When I started watching her, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not very good, it's really boring and boring and just does not go anywhere. After more than one hour, only three murders occurred, and the story never really evolved. The film is beautifully shot with a pretty good photo and good direction, but like many other slick flicks since the 1980s, the movie sometimes gets too dark. The game is really good, and Meliss's character is easy to sympathize with, even if it's a fuckin 'fuck. The story line is not really garbage, but it's just too boring to be interested, the only thing that kept me interested was Melissa, it was stunning and Dana Kimmel, whose really nice and cute in this movie. Everything in all pretty boring swords moves that do not go anywhere, I certainly would recommend it to fans of Slasher.
