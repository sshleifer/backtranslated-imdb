This movie is worth watching if you enjoy special effects. There are some interesting visuals. <br /> <br /> In addition, Hollywood glare is no glare, typical of the 1990s. Real title. <br /> <br /> It is not worth the story to separate. It's like doing a brain surgery on a dinosaur. First, it is not too much. It's nothing original and not very strange. So it's not a story at all. Check out the effects. As mentioned before, it was a bit dazzling at the end, diluting the purity of the great treatment of FX invisible (and sometimes invisible) men. However, if you ignore "standard" pyrotechnics, it is a sight to see (or not). Overall, it's a decent FX movie that's worth seeing for that and that alone.
