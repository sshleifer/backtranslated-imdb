The script is so ridiculous ... it again makes the game lines stiff and unreal and do not believe. There is a repetition of the phrases - "my sweet little god's daughter" and the minor variants of this line that you are thinking ... and it's just a careless soapy work. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the music is so bad! In addition, the main blues theme is terribly quaint and totally wrong. And this feels exaggerated, especially because the instrumentation, structure and arrangement of the subject will never change, even when the emotional context of the scene occurs. Consequently, whenever it appears, it acts as a painful thumb as the main transition from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> Music is humming and it's as if the writer was writing music on soap or sitcom - the low budget of 80 Canadian sitcoms on it - and it makes us feel like we're always on the verge of throwing the ad. That's so miscast, there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters use only one type of NY accent - a rough Bronx accent. I do not know if it's a matter of limited actors' capacity by recognizing only one * NY accent - or whether it's a question of the ability of the director to record such a sharp anomaly. the end, it's an amateur script with its lead lines that make the whole "movie" ... a blow. When a base is unsettled and unstable, it is impossible to build on it without its shortcomings being exposed exponentially in more harmful and non-prescriptive ways.
