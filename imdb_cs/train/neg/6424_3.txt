The writer is broken and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self-service shop run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) who they believe to be a serial killer terrorizing the city, Killer Costume so named because after the injection of his victim with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). He convinces him that his life story will make a great film and will assemble a group of dirty filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and find out that the art of making films can be a murder. <br /> <br /> This movie is more, but unfortunately it stayed on the floor of the editorial room and it turns out (the reputation is that the studio required a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and actors who all do a good job and deserve better) because it has the premise of an exceptional black comedy, but only grows to the average cute. If you are a Ron Perlman fan it is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has a chance to make a really good impression (he did not feel ashamed when he told Hellboy's film he needed to hit when he got into the Jerry Lewis regime). It's just fun to watch in this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in two scenes (but a key) role.
