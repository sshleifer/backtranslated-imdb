This film is an abomination and its creation should be considered the main crime. One of the great secrets of the film is why no one has ever made a faithful film adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It's a story of truly grasping secrets, nice old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why did the creators have to change Richard Gordon from Scotland Yard to an amateur detective, imagine the idiot role and cartoon of his English servant, change the part of the main plot about the murder charge, and the circumstances of Gordon's fight to save the accused, etc., etc.? These producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write an original script themselves and not rape the product of another person.
