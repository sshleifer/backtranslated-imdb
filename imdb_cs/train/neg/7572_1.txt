It seemed to me that I watched this film a thousand times before. It was completely predictable. Every time the story tried to trick a little, every time I expected something interesting to happen, I saw nothing but expectations. Just as "the bread factory opened other facilities because there was not enough bread". In two words: A story that became a clich√©, a bad deal, bad special effects ... Just a silly Russian cop, Vlad, was a bit funny when he punished bad guys. The pile of muscles was incredibly terrible that I laughed at him for a moment. I wonder why I'm wasting my time spitting on the shame of the movie ... It does not get worse (because it's not possible): D
