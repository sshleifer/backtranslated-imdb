I saw this movie when I was really little. It's by far one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Now, I usually like strange movies, but that was just a little too much. <br /> <br /> The film is not too awesome. If anything happens, it begins as Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy continue adventure to save their new friend Babette. This is followed by craziness. There is Greedy, Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a lot of pirates who sang a melody, all of which made the movie more sad. I also can not help, but I feel that Babette is annoying and a bit of a whim. It certainly did not help the movie. Now, although I did not like this movie, there were a couple of cute parts. I liked the camel's song. Even though it was a song about being lonely, it had a friendly feeling. Then was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looney were simply nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the most entertaining. King Koo Koo was just a little dirty backpack, from which Doctor Evil looked like a serious villain. There was also Raggedy Andy's song No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for little boys who wanted to act hard. But honestly, even those things did not improve the movie. (But do not forget, it's just my perspective.) <br /> <br /> While I personally do not recommend this movie, I even have to admit it has its charming moments. Find out if you are interested, but only if you are in the mood for something "really" extraordinary.
