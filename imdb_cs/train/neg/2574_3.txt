I know movies do not necessarily have to mirror reality, but I got this nervous. Increases ignorance of stereotypes about "psychic trauma" and mental illness. The thing "psycho mom" is happening too many times before (and most of it is doing better) and much of the rest of the conspiracy is also terrified. The acting was not frightening, but nothing could be exhausted. One Peak: I have been a longtime fan of General Hospital and it was a trip where I saw one of the roles played by former regular GH, Jon Lindstrom. Anyway, if you can overlook his fake psychoanalytic part, in the same way you have to suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this film can be acceptable. If you have nothing better and a relatively low standard. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I spent my time watching.
