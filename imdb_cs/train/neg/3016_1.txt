I am, like many, a fan of Tony Scott movies. When this movie came out, I had the hope that it would be like "Man On Fire". To find out that the movie is the longest of it! The story went through the water of choice, and the selection of Mickey Rourke was not such a good idea. The whole arm's-ground was too inappropriate! <br /> <br /> The film focuses around Kira Kinghtla, and this film shows that it will never become a movie star! The film brought some of the worst performances ever. <br /> <br /> I love Tony Scott's direction, but this whole friggin cake lasts! Sorry ton, 1 of 10!
