This film is a fake incarnation, equal to 11/10 on a phoniness scale. The falsity of the accents and the tightness of the trouser pants trousers are just overwhelming. Although real Scotland can be as varied, if you ever go there, it is not expected to get much of a chance of "exhausting" disputes with locals. Also, do not try to influence local views through the different art of tapdancing. There are several infectious singing and dance scenes, but the plot is too crude and linear and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt if anyone would want to remain imprisoned in a 18th century Scottish village in boondocks rather than gay in New York. Perhaps it was not such a sacrifice that the priest left Brigadoon, perhaps he was just trying to get the hell out of the dump. Look at that good look at the alternative reality Christopher Streed's Daily Show in Scotland looks like LSD. Besides, I would only recommend Hollywood musicals.
