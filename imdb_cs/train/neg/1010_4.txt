I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman, so it looked promising. And that was until Justin Timberlake was born on the scene. He is a really bad actor and should not be able to make the movie ever again. I think he's one of the most boring, uninvited actors I've ever seen. He has absolutely no emotion on any of his lines. Why did he go to Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems to be a bad mix of his character in American beauty and John Doe in Se7en. Maybe it sounds good, but believe me, it's not. Now Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. This is one of the few good things about this movie. It's just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. But he really has cool lines. <br /> <br /> The story, though it was a bit obvious and exaggerated sometimes it was good. I was expecting a big turn when Lazer (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.
