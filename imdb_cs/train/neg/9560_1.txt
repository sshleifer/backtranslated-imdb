Thank God I watched with a friend and did not pay. The plot is terribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show. If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, beware. You will feel the feeling that the film is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> And the actress has transformed a lot of VJ music Amanda Walsh shows the worst acting I've ever seen, except for porn. He's lucky that Matt Lanter is really decent. The film bears. <br /> <br /> I hate losing almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a shame that they call it a sequel because I was a fan of the original, which was really good.
