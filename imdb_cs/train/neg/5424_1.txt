Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat film. Why did I watch such films when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one to punish watching one horrible movie after another. I do not know, I think I needed a hobby during my teen years. Adolescent (Rainbow Harvest) seeks comfort in the old mirror. He soon learns about the tremendous power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike against those who have hurt her. Movies like you, the energy donor, have ugly side effects. He turns her in and out if she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> A disorder of the movie, which for some reason was restored to the d.v. a few years back. I do not know why. They should leave it on the shelves and collect dust. People love this movie with an enemy for some reason. If you want to know why. Until then, I do not like this movie and I have no reason to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
