The "true" story of a late monster that appears when the American industrial plant starts polluting water. A funny, though not really good, monster movie has a lot of people trying to get a monster and find out what's going on, but not fully involved. Give it to us that they gave us a huge monster that is clearly built on a scale for some scenes but a little apart because it looks like a non-threatening puppy. An amusing exploitation film that is kindly stupid in the right spirit. (One of my complaints is that the print used for Elvira's release is so poor that it looks like a well-worn copy of a video cassette that was past 20 years ago.)
