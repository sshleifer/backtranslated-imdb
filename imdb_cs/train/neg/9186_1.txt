Do you know the feeling of cheerfulness when you look at a movie that is so hard to be a serious, thought-provoking cinema and unluckyly fails? If you can not help, but you laugh out of the terrible nature of the waste that is wasting your screen? "The House of the Dead" is also trying to reach this low level of cinemas. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, "The House of the Dead" can re-create the feeling you just woke up and found the cat put on your forehead when you slept for a curly shop.

"We all know that zombie movies will never be especially thought of as provocative or full of meaning, at best they are harmless for two hours of action, blood, and mass terror. "The House of the Dead" has gotten such bad reviews that no Danish cinema has bought a movie, but it is not a waste that will fly out of the bag when you drag it across the room and crush the shoes in sour milk boxes and decomposing banana skin. If we could have the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final Score: 1/10.
