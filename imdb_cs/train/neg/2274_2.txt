Well, I hate hollywood, but I love the cinema, so I have to watch these cruel movies in the theaters. And I hoped Vanilla Sky would be good. I was hoping either to keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same or to do it. Well, it was a bit of both, and it was soaked. It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish it was more. But we finally listen to the good vibes from the boys on the beach. Talk about a wide range of suction between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a few more, but why they had to fly GV during the trip. It was more unpleasant than confusing or obvious. Especially when it has nothing to do with the plot. At least we have some meaning for the song. Kid A = Primary. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> He also got to work on the club scene. It was great. Otherwise, the film was one big ball of arrogance. As if the audience got into the movie. Those who read the subtitles and the rest will not. It's so simple. Motivation came to everyone. I did not understand Diaz's motivation (did not do Chicken Soup before?) And some more. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can not act (especially on these types of movies [ie, the elevator, I understand it, anyway, they tried to improve the original with poor American rock sound and dirty angles and good film print and glossy processing and helped it if it was not ruined. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Great disappointment.
