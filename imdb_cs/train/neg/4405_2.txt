All I can say is that I had no idea before the film was who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was ... and I must admit that the film hardly helped to get this data .. and it was not even successful. He persuaded me to do some research by inputting a few words on google pages; but all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was great due to her silent expression on her face that really did play well and proved the mental state of deep depression because it is real. the film scenario took place in Turkey and Tehran as well as Afghanistan .. but believe me that I am familiar with the area, it was all about the Arab Desert in Morocco. Turkish people and Persians are completely different faces and cultures, just as in a language that is not Arabic. I suppose that when filming a movie like this - the documentary type - is a thorough investigation of all these tiny elements.
