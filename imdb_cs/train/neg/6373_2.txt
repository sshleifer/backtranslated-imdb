Oh, that was really a bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is all right, but I think she's frightening in the movie, not because her bodies are ragged at night by raven, but because she thinks she'll fire an agent to put her in that bite. Faye Dunaway behaves as if my mother was born the most expensive and the end is stupid. I can not even recommend this movie, although as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe I'm a little interested in his work (Ravens, a family curse like Usher and buried alive) would probably return to his grave if he knew about this movie.
