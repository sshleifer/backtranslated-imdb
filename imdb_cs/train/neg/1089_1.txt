What is going on with Robert "Pretentious" by Altman? Was he saving the lights? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a lawyer's office where everyone works with candles? Do not waste time. In fact, do not waste time with anything Altman does: It's all the wasteful film waste.
