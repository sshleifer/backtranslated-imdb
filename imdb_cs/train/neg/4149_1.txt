Jemine. Where should I start? Dad is not old enough to be the father of a girl. He is sorry for the first 5 minutes of the movie. The preferred scream in this movie is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid and little and far. The themes are totally incomprehensible and there is no narrative. People "hurry" to their destination in jeeps powered by 3 MPH. The world seems to continue as normal, yet it is supposed to be the final days. Breasts appear due to breasts. Usually, such an approach would give some redemption, but the rest of the film did not really care about breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog without reason and a thin, orange blood that changes the stomach. General and his phrase "Close f ** to up!" is the only redemption. As for the others, I sincerely hope to hear that they have done a decent thing and were killed.
