I would like people to really make funny while filming a comedy. It's a movie that you can sit, but nothing is special about it. After what you were watching, you said it was okay. It was not boring to watch, but it did not give the audience any jokes to laugh. Entertainment should mean that you really get something more than a. story. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie", but instead it failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 out of 10.
