Ok this movie was terrible. Be serious about the movie that has just undergone apocalyptic war but have the money to buy huge robots and put them against each other. Each country decides instead to invest in rebuilding its country, preferring to fight robots that no one could afford. Here's a better idea, let's rely on our most unpleasant resources, jocks, to fight our struggles. <br /> <br /> Everybody says what the director, what about him. Makes a good movie, makes a bad movie. Is there no reason to give this film some credit just for the director, maybe he is asleep? I was looking forward to this film because it was so noisy and ridiculous that I had to laugh. I had a really good time to watch, except for a cowboy teacher who turned out to be a killer (believe me no one would see him as a killer, so it's a surprise, though it's lame). What kind of exercise is the jungle anyway. I was sad that Mst3k did not do this. I give two stars, however, because nothing can be as bad as "manos of fate". The budget does not matter, I've seen plenty of sensible movies that have nothing for budgets like a cube. The story was not credible, and I saw better acting in school games. They could unexpectedly afford eleven-year-olds from each high school. <br /> <br /> Anyway, pick it up, it's a fun movie you can watch.
