The "true" story of three girls who go wild in Connecticut and finally end up being persecuted by a maniac in the woods. This is the movie that he'd played in the American Cup all over America thirty years ago to make his way. Not just what the movie works with low budget for mixed results. The film is observable, but it is not at all scary (blame, as some of the scene attacks). It's such a movie that you probably forget as soon as you finish it. The odds are that you will never think of someone giving it to someone else and saying, "Watch this here," which happened to me. If you were given a copy, return it back to the movie, it's not worth trying to see it, even if it's observable.
