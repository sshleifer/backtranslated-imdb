This film does not offer anything new to the genre that has traditionally shown the story of cross-cultural love that was backed by mid-20th century politics / India before the war, where the British and their modern ways are bad and primitive but honest and true Indians good. Surely, such a clich√© of displaying the British is rather passive. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama that drives the second part of the film, the story is predictable, it's pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the direction is obvious and impossible. The story really needed to be exhausted, and it would certainly benefit from the next half hour of the screening time to give the characters and the depth story and give the viewer something that would feel any investment into. <br /> <br /> Overall, rather dishonest. Oh and Linus Roache simply can not do a tragedy - going through the eyes with emotional pain just does not work for me!
