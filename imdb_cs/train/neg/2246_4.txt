I have never seen an original version of Judy Garland in 1954, so they have no way to compare. It was also several years, but I found this story, not grasping, nor did it attract its romance. The film tells the story of two lovers whose music career is heading in the opposite direction. John Norman Howard is a worn-out, disillusioned rock star on decline and comes out of romance with fresh, talented new vocal perception, Esther Hoffman. Its dramatic success serves only to emphasize its decline. Leading actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are in their roles adequate, but their chemistry or conspiracy does not leave much. The film is remarkable to me for only one aspect: Streisand's beautiful rendition of the Oscar winning "Evergreen". It has a really strong and magnificent voice.
