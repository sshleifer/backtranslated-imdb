For me, this is a story that begins with some funny jokes about Frank fans when traveling with a stairwell and sitting at business meetings ... The problem is that when you look at this movie for an hour, you'll see the same fantasy / fun situation again and over and over again. That's predictable. It's more like a television story, where you can go away and go back without having missed anything. I like Felix Herngren as Frank but it's not enough, even if it's a comedy, it must have more variations and some kind of message for its audience .... <br /> <br />
