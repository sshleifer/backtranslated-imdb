When jokes with anti-bang are really easy, such a show should make sure that it has something extra. If this is something extra, children's versions of political figures that make jokes about the future they do not have yet are simply nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are all right, but most of them are Dick Cheney. There is also Condoleeza Rice, who has for some reason desperate Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, who is not really like Donald Rumsfeld at all. Democratic figures rarely give names, so it's a mystery who might be who would be aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. Episodes have contiguous stories, but this is not nearly enough to prevent sinking.
