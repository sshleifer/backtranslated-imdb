I'm easy to enjoy. I liked "Hot Shots" and "Naked Gun" and their many sequels, although most people considered them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most of Pauly Shore movies. There's only one movie I've seen I can honestly say is bad ... and it was. It's a moment I've seen, but I remember sitting in the theater and thinking, "This is a silly movie, why did I see it?" This is frankly the only film I can not recommend.
