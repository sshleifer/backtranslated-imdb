As a graduate of film studios I would like to think that I have seen a diverse film, good and bad, but I have to say that "summer rain" is by far the worse film I have ever seen! I chose the movie in the hope that it is a great British classic such as 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Lockstock', but no, it was so bad that my apartment and I finally smile and mix in absurd acting Cheese scenario (reminded me of the bad "school production in the theater"). The main heroes Michelle and Gary have begun to bother us from the beginning. Michelle, the main character who lives with his two friends, has the type of face you'll never get tired of, and Gary was so wet (he's constantly crushing tears every 5 minutes) that he did not do either of them until the end of the movie. All I could think of was that I paid 3 pounds for this pile. I never wrote a review, but after watching this movie, I was encouraged to warn people of this catastrophic production. So avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
