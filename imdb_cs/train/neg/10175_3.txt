I could not go to bed at night. So I got up, I turned on the tube and this movie was turned on. Movie makers bit more than they could chew. Just as ambitious as "Forrest Gump". But Gump reads like a fairy tale where an extremely happy person keeps us all the time. TGMB relies only on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost as a musical on Broadway, where actors have to sit down. The goal of each character was to fill the silly archetype 60. <br /> <br /> Find out how we met Finnegan: Drag his blacks and get a framed MLK picture. Crimine, talk about heavy hands. Why not just give him a t-shirt called "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "It's not love, is not it?" Oh no, I did not have my time. <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not UCLA Square." Excuse me? In the sixties, LA was nothing new. Rather than realizing what makes Berkeley unique, we hear that this deceptive whining does not go away. She even does not forget the name of the black child. It was just the element used to show how other children are racially tolerant. <br /> <br /> The thing is that the pieces do not have to be this cheese. Take "Dazed & Confused". Look how we were introduced to the football hero Randall Floyd. We do not see him at the football field first. In fact, we never see him playing football. We put him in the class and invited his nerud poker friends to the party. In "Dazed" feminism is not a casual byproduct of a young one that would be destroyed. It's much more organic, more serious than that. The ladies room is in a refined discussion about Gilligan Island. Severe ideas can grow in the most up-to-date settings. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some warm notes here indicate that the topics in this movie are still relevant. I agree! That's why I'm so disappointed with this baby-boomer porodalgia.
