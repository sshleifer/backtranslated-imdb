Looking at other comments, I am amazed that potential audiences are not warning of what they will have to look forward to when they borrow this waste. First of all, I rented this thing with the fact that Indiana Jones was competently deleted. What I got was one of the most offensive films I can remember that I was trying to sit, and the more shocking because of the relatively high production value of the film. I do not think it's a spoiler, but if so, be warned ... If your idea of ​​fun watches as Bimbo glides from underneath the Fearsome Tribal Chief while she stares into the dead eyes of her significant other cut heads, film. If it is not, I recommend that you look elsewhere in the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Think about it, the scene so briefly summarizes the film that I really do not have to say anything about it.
