He just sent an email to a friend who is in the film school about this film. Something to avoid when shooting a movie - characters crazy, pointless, crowded, intricate monologues on the screen that are ultimately frustrating and unconvincing. When the film is an attempt at social realism, these word barrages are so overwhelming that they really attract attention to film-based films and effectively neutralize their intention. Is it an acting or script that is bad or both? The protagonist is also very unbelievable for social realism - stupid consumption of canonical English literature and bible while high or hungover and able to produce such deeply sophomoric soliloquies while drunk? And how is such an unattractive, immaculate and orally debilitating figure able to sleep most of the women she encounters in a few minutes when they meet them? (I had to applaud when one cat finally threw him out on the street, despite his wailing and self-denial). The viewer meets demanding references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. The coming humanity, in the form of barcodes printed on the foreheads or right hand in a ghostly biblical fashion, is shown to a person who is overwhelmingly exposed as a guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> This movie is exaggerated and over the top - a melodrama awkwardly filled with "philosophy" of pedestrians about the meaning of humanity, life, and so on. It's tough, exaggerated and lengthy. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies with content similar to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is an exciting, much more exciting excursion into the life of individuals in a similar social environment. Ditto for "In Warzone". And although the comparison is not even justified, look at something that Peter Greenaway, who is far more capable of dialogue, joke and absurd characters and situations.
