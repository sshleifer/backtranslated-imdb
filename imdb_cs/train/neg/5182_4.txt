Like most of the festival's contributions, Hamiltons does an interesting movie watching, which contains all the ideas and a small execution. Although it is probably a low budget, the film is getting worse in its last step and it is becoming terribly long during its exhaustion and the obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of murderous exiles who will try to survive after their parents have died. They carry people, throw blood out of them and feed something in their basement. There are some nice dark humorous performances from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are just so. The film never feels realistic or very worrying. But in the first half he turns into a strangely humorous and dark mixture that is a surprising success. The next half is not as successful as it gets into forgetting the film with unrealistic twists and turns, laughing with laughter, which transforms the whole movie into bullshit. It's a shame, though there is no doubt that there is some talent with this production, and although it is deeply flawed, it remains original and creative. bad that when it comes to delivery, it completely fails at every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
