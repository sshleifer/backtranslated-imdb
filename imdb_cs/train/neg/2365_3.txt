This movie is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I got out of the way, I feel better. This movie is bad from start to finish. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is the worst in his cartoon. Thank God they killed him. And who wants to see the stories of Roseanne and Tom Arnold? The only good thing in the movie is the little touch we got on Freddy. We see that he once had a family and we see his abusive alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). After all, it's all bad. There are some good actors (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto) and they do the best, but the end result is just so bad. The hour and a half I spent watching this film is an hour and a half I can never get back to.
