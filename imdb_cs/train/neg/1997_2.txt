This version is probably available at the local DVD dollar store. Print is not great, no sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and save 90 minutes, you get money for your money (which does not say terrible amount). Anna Neagle is extremely furious as Nanette. Regardless of what can be seen nowadays, they are obvious in this film. There are a lot of fine actors in this movie (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material fits remarkably for their talent. Still, it's interesting to see how these successful artists make the most of the weak writing. Music numbers (there are really only two) are pretty awful. Apparently, the studio did not feel forced to invest in the rich musicality of the original "no, no, Nanette". For what it is worth, the DVD can be $ 1.00. It's worth a lot to say you saw it.
