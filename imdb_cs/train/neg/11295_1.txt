I understand that this film is for children and as a parent I have been in a lot of films that have not particularly interested in my interests, but I can appreciate the constructive view taken by my children. Parents should eventually be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and watch the quality of entertainment they see, so there should be something that would appeal to adult audiences at a certain level even in children's films. Disney always understood, so it's so hard to understand how it can allow such a complete piece of hard work to bear their name. From the technical point of view, the sound adjustment is terrible and all dialogues are over-dubbed, dubbed and unnatural. I personally hate it, but it was twice horrible because the dialogue itself looked like it was a 12-year school project. "Playing" reminded me of the school play, and none of the children's actors had any emotion in their voice. Fortunately, it was a very short film. Now that I'm going to be a video-geek that measures a child's adult-witted movie, the only thing that can save even the worst child's movie is a positive message. It is far from me to determine how the message should be delivered if it is correct. Take a walk through this movie to find out what messages are given: <br /> <br /> If you've lost, do not worry, you'll need to find your way home. <br /> <br /> Access wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you 'know' that you can. <br /> <br /> And my favorite, last message in the movie: /> <br /> It's okay to disobey the authorities and do what you think is right.
