In this movie, it's hard to find any positive results. It seems as if the producer needed to make money without much effort and that's why we were treated to full Galaxy imagery, which is the saddest excuse for a film in history. Police girls looked extremely sexy in their uniforms. More action shots of both police officers and much less the Galaxy would be a way to go. Of course, it would add to the budget, so they decided to fill the space with an unfortunate repetition. Mrs. Albright is a great sexy and her acting is the first. Mrs Stabs, which I have heard of but did not see it before, seemed very desirable, but it seems to lack basic actor talent. Besides Mrs. Albright, it's real garbage.
