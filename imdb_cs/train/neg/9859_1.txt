This movie is just lame. Total loss of time and money. Jokes are predictable, characters are clich√©s, and the way they talk about RPG players is not funny either. The problem is that writers do not know how RPG plays and what is most important to make jokes about this game. Of course there are a lot of losers playing RPGs like singers and singers. But for me, it is not the most fun way to make jokes about this game. The story does not make sense at all. Who cares about how long the game plays? The biggest problem in this movie is that writers and actors have not even tried to know what the RPG is going to do jokes about. I felt shameful by watching this filthy film.
