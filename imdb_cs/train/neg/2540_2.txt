I thought I saw this movie twice in reality. Then I read all the other reviews and they did not quite answer. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study the alleged bigfoot sighting. I still feel pretty sure this is the movie I've seen, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. That's why I'll return to my review: If you like a casual movie "B" just like me, then go back to Boggy Creek's movie for you! Whether it's sleep timer setting and rocking your favorite movie bomb or just browsing with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button and you have a fun night of improvisation. Attention! Is the legend true? I think we could learn along with not-so-stellar occupation. Will there be any device failure at key moments in the movie? Does our blonde, masculine, young hero have some chest? Will the exceptionally high-tech Technicolor take the whole movie? You will have to look to find out for yourself.
