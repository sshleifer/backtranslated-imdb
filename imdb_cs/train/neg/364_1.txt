It's the blame, here. <br /> <br /> Adding to his ever growing pile of ingredients left behind by Oliver Stone's plot is "Down On Us" (Forget everything you think about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, "says Big Lar," because it is a real solution! You see that the three great names in the 1960s rock were killed by the government because they were subversive or counterproductive to truth, justice and the American way, or they liked it that way.

Yeah, that's true! Man, I can not believe I've been watching this movie. TV commercials as a high-lane, and if you honestly follow up to the end, you deserve a "twist". Really, really; I swear. Genius. But just as the man said, "Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll." <br /> <br /> Not like this. <br /> <br /> There are no stars for "Down on Us". And that's a movie audience describing the movie, by the way.
