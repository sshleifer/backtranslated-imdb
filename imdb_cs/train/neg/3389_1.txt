I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway God knows how many times and felt that passion, despair and joy came from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to rethink "Chorus" on the screen, but he could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came with the show hits - he should answer your question. There are some shows that can be easily seen live - with the audience. However, Richard Attenborough fresh from the musical work "Ghandi" and dances with animals in "Doctor Doolittle" ended up managing this film, which had nothing to do with the scene. Surprising! Surprising !, Great songs have been released or given to other characters (which did not make sense). Michael Douglas was misplaced. People who could not dance tried to act and there was a sexy "Landers" woman who could not sing, do or dance - I think she just ended up as a Ghandi woman. Dance by Jeffrey Hornaday looks like nothing more than a reflex reflection from "Flashdance" and nothing works. I was sitting there when I was surprised how something so boring and emotional could be exhausted. If you really love this show and come back to Broadway in 2006 - you'll see it, but do not think the long-running musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has anything to do with this movie.
