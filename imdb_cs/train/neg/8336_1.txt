How the hell got this ?! Imagined as a comedy cervid, badly inherited "$" is basically two hours of people mumping sentences. Usually, Warren Beatty seems drunk and, as a rule, cheerful Goldie Hawn behaves like a depression. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Even the guy with a bottle of champagne LSD can not save this litany of worthlessness. Do I compare this movie to Plan 9 from space? I would not do such a thing, even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was idiot but ended up cheerful; it was idiotic and caused you to feel as if your brain has just faded from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn took part in the "shampoo" together, but then played in the terrible "Town & Country". Maybe they should not play in movies in movies. All in all, I'd rather let her skin break away before she had to watch her again. Happy. Maybe she should remake her with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay for it.
