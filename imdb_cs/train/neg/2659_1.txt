I'm sorry, but it's terrible. I told people about this movie and about some bad dumbbells in it, and they hardly believe me. It's nothing wrong with the idea, modern Japanese soldiers will pull back in time to the days of Busid's fighters, and their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When the soldiers first realize that something strange is happening, every person on the back of the transport should say, "Hey my watch has stopped"? Imagine it as if it were 15 or more times before you say something else and you're in the film's lack of size.
