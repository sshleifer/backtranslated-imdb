My name is Modesty is a low-budget movie that tells the story of Modesta Blaise's origin. It's not like the movie is terrible, just not what I expected or hoped for. While I was aware of the character of Modesta Blaise for years, I'm not too familiar with comics or graphic novels, so I'm going into this movie as an outsider. This may be part of my disappointment. I've been waiting for more action and more comedies. The film is a dialogue. I suppose I'm looking for something with somewhat greater value in the camp. As it is, My name is Modesty is a deadly serious movie. There are very few, though "light" moments. The effect, at least from Alexander Staden, is acceptable, but nothing special. Just as others commented, it seems to be a little fragile to be completely credible in the title role. Which action scenes are in My name's Modesty are one of the weakest movies. I have never intervened in the idea that this woman can handle a group of trained murderers. I really hope that Quentin Tarantino goes on and says that this is a big budget film based on the character of Modesta Blaise. I am convinced that this concept has great potential and I would like to look forward to it.
