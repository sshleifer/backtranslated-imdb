This movie contains a wonderful brunette named Danielle Petty. It has stunning green eyes and is in the first scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this film that is not repellent. She does not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is a type of offensive disaster that kills a career. The film itself has absolutely nothing to recommend. It's not a good horror film, a good fake journalistic report, or a good work out of the distance. There are no skills in its production. It's like a bad student film. The scary elements of the story do not make you wrong, it's the fact that it's so badly done that it makes you worse. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.
