This Tim Burton remake of the original "planet of monkeys" since 1968 (and played by Charleton Heston) is far away from the quality and conspiracy of the original. Certainly, special effects have improved since 1968, but not writing. The characters were dull and the dialogue was terrible. I've had the whole movie with a friend (who fortunately just rented it), and he fully understood why all the toys of the "Planet of the Cat" in Target's lap were all before Christmas. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Do not put it on your resume. My advice to everyone else: Watch the original 1968 movie "Planet of the Map".
