This movie reminds me of the worst Mary Mary-Kate and Ashley. The very rich sisters believe something, even though Alysons's more actress, in this movie Amanda, the michael was ok but Alysons played well. I think they had to need something better after high school, and it certainly was not. The story line was not so great, and I think they should get two more people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not improve me like she did. I think they should definitely sing and watch this movie only if you have nothing better to do (which unfortunately did not do)
