I give it to the top of my list of films in the category of bad garbage! There are movies that are bad, but the worst are those that are undignified, but you suppose they like it because they should be good for you! The sex sequence, so shocking in its time, could not even wake the rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly college secondary amateur nightmarxism. The film is self-consciously artistic in the worst sense. The shooting is rough black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from a bad angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
