I thought I was quite melancholic, especially when I was looking at great touching and torn movies. But not for this one (which surprised me!) And it's also a surprise that I saw how many people praised this movie so high. Throughout the film, there are several disturbing facts: 1. Ben's sense of guilt is the real intention of saving seven lives to redeem his past. It seems disturbing to me that the film seems to be encouraging this type of suicidal behavior. Some people can see that this is a heroic action, and some others think they are cowardly, and it has been worrying for me in the end. <br /> <br /> 2. The story of the movie is overly dramatized, but the logic is too simplified. Medical intervention requires him to be an organ donor. By the end of the movie, we learned that Emily had a back blood group that limited the chance of getting a donor in a short time. Still, it seemed that Ben had a rare blood type, just as she had allowed him to be his donor and comfortable, despite the bane of Ben's blood, he donated not only his heart but also his kidney, the cornea, and his bone marrow, requires not only the same type of blood but also tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated despite the fact that it was the jellyfish crime he killed himself? Maybe I've reviewed the whole story, because after all, it's just a movie. However, some disturbing facts listed above hopefully will help you rethink your plan to go watch this movie. If you go to the movie type of soap opera, go ahead. But you are looking for smart entertainment, leave this mistake!
