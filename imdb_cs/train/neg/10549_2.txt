The film industry is a difficult business - because decisions need to be made and all parties have private life. This is a very original thesis of this poor attempt to create an "inspiring" film about the film. And indeed, there is no better proof of what an industrial trick is than to see Anouk Aimee and Maximilian Schellle imprisoned in this infertility. The view consists of talking heads that reflect bullshit as if "I should make a studio movie that would pay a lot, or should I do an indie object and stay true to my artistic self"? "Please do it." Or, "Our relationship is not just professional but also private. It's a rather complicated situation, is not it?" "Yes, that is, dear." Among the insipid dialogues, views of palm trees, the hotel lobby and American film posters appear (no signs of a non-American film presence on Croisette). Repeating sleep is inevitable, so 100 minutes of movie feel like age. Jenny Gabrielle is unbelievably unconvincing when she justifies her own presence within.
