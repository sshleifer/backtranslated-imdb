This film is an excellent example of wasting big resources in the film. You have future SNL and SCTV stars such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, who basically do 70 minutes of gross, unintentional furies and racist jokes. The network concept of the company's future podium could indeed be taken to some interesting extremes, but instead of the gate, it makes a chubby, youthful proctological joke and stays in that vein of humor all the way. a much more subversive and funny Groove Tube or later, merry Kentucky Fried movie. This film is intended only for those who want to see the time capsule of bad 70s comic films.
