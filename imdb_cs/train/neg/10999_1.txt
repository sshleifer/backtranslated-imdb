Imagine the worst songs of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90-minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in the wrong sketches is removed and replaced by stupidity. Now imagine something more than 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Do you have it? Okay, let's take a look at The Underground Comedy Movie. What you just saw will look like the funniest thing at all. UCM is the worst movie I've ever seen. A few cheap laughs ... just a little. But it was lame. Even if the intention of the film was misleading, it was too indifferent to be funny. The only reason why I'm not upset that I'm wasting my time watching this was someone I know he bought. He lost his money. The offer of Vince did not write or put anything else, and it is no surprise why.
