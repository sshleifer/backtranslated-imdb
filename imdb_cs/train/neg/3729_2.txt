I first saw this movie when I was seven years old at the Christian Scholel I visited. Needless to say, I was frightened by my mind. Not because it was scary, but because of the content. It was waiting ... I was 7. The cinema was pretty bad and the acting was tiny. This is very bad because I was only 7 years old and I remember it. The only thing that keeps appealing to me is the terrible song, "May we all be ready," where the choir ends "... you are left behind". I would not suggest this. I will probably, just for a nostalgic reason. Besides, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of the film, however, must be when everyone "vanishes"; empty cars crash, lawn mowers run on their own ... nice.
