The words "Swedish" and "action film" are not mixed. It becomes more and more obvious in every attempt at the genre. This is another attempt at failure. Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works on a military air base with state-of-the-art computer systems. One day, foreign criminals were threatened to hurt the family if they did not do what they were saying. They want a secret facility and do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has ups and downs. And usually there are no "ups" in Swedish action movies, just "downs". So I think something in this movie has shown a certain quality. Beginning with positive comments I can mention that the film is technically well done. Airplanes and helicopter shots are well shot and look very nice. The effects are very diverse in quality. Shanti Roney does a decent performance, while Maria Bonnevie is so stiff and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long the Swedish directors will use it even though she has a wooden boarding skill?). Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as a "cool" special man who comes to the base to investigate. And what about the action scenes? Well, as I said above the scenes of planes and helicopters, they are nice. But besides, there is nothing we should talk about. And that's a common problem with Swedish action movies. Not enough action is enough. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's a film culture. I do not know but it negatively affects the experience. Because frankly, the story and the acting are not good enough to rely on this film alone. <br /> <br /> Rate it 4/10 for the effort.
