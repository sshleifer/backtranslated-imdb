First of all, I would like to tell everyone who saw this film that an actor who played a "transvestite" is one of my friends, is Robert Dugdale, he is a wonderful actor, although he does not say much about his filmography, he was in several games and musicals. She currently lives on the B.C. this is the place I come from, coming to our house almost every Saturday * laughing * yeah, now about the movie, I would recommend it to anyone who did not see it, because it is not a movie that I am interested in, the main reason why I he considered it a bad movie, is that he never stays in his place, he's still going back in time, so it's hard to watch him, and secondly, his really boring laugh * Although the acting is great, the film just does not compare.
