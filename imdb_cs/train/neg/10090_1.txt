This movie is a joke. I mean witty joke "ha ha". Why? Since it was about redeeming, it was a good laugh when I got to the absolute absurdity of an absurd, sloppy conspiracy and a terrible deal. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions in this movie ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie "administrators" and what is their purpose? Since when did 6 people become a "nation" of zombies? And is the blurred black eye mascara "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even 2 years? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this film ever made? Why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> On the demand channel, they actually released this comment after reviewing the movie: LOL apologize for this movie in advance. "" At least they had the decency!
