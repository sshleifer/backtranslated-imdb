Steven Seagal's films have never been Oscar's material, but with each release they are getting worse and worse. This begins with the fact that Seagal got the FBI because he killed several people in his "own defense" that he was an active army, so he was rescued from prison to rescue a stealthy Stealth aircraft that would be used to clutch the "bad English villain" in Hollywood so obsessed even these days. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that the film is a terrible dialogue that is almost always supplied with a heavy cheese improvement and lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting and there are parts of it that do not make any sense and do not add anything to the story, the characters of the film as a whole, such as the "lesbian" interaction between the two main women in the cast that is there purely for the audience to get he does not even worry about confusing, because it does not make sense why it happened when he did not need it. In short, a horrible script with a poor dialogue delivered by subordinate actors, boring and sometimes badly choreographic action scenes, and irrelevant parts that only serve to achieve almost impossible and even worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and make this mistake even though you are Seagal's most fun fan.
