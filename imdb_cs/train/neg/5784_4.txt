I was not as close to that as with many other reviewers. Sure, she has a couple of beautiful girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two beautiful sirens with their teeth bellies that run out of the road to the cars on the road, attract their home (at dusk) and invite their prey ... sexually starving men to their buddy. What's going to happen ... Well, after they mostly polite and kiss, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has a flash with the camera. Some scenes are pretty scary and effectively shot, but sex itself does not have movies up (no toy is intended ... at least consciously). There's really no story. We have two girls. We will show some inexplicable and inexplicable beginnings where we can see that they are shot with a gun. Why? What does that mean: "Why do we have that guy who will stay for a few days to greet a man at a hotel that insists he knows it years ago, is it a purpose? Of course, I have even more general questions like a couple of beautiful girls who do like vampires in the English countryside and have a wine cellar full of wine from the Carpathians (quite literally) and then go to bed in the crypt, ending with some more juicy scenes, but it's counterclimatic ... There are, as I said, some effective scenes director ... I liked how girls dressed and filmed in the woods, looking for their prey. The house is also the most impressive set and both girls are, as I said, very nice.Marianne Morris especially excels - more than one older film fans , the veteran of the silent Bessie Love screen has a short attachment at the end of the movie.
