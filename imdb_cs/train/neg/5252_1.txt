I read some of the comments on the internet about this movie as "... heavier than Hostel ..." "the camera never shows when it's really brutal ..." But none of them are true. The camera will never appear because there is nothing on the screen. The same scene repeats a hundred and a hundred times again. Women are lying on the table, killing women several times, killing women to pieces (you never see this throughout the movie!). Police arrived and arrested him. Killer Fool Jury. Play the movie. In Germany we would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". Overall, it's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
