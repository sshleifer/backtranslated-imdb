Simply put, the film is boring. Cliché on the cliché is confirmed and the story line never meets. It seems that the director was not sure whether he was making a movie or a documentary. The main storyline is very thin (mediated by a CIA agent to kill an oil prince, grab him and then warn the prince (why?)). And so some elements were added to make the film more interesting. So a child dies, which leads to a "natural" father's response: free counseling to a person indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunk friend and holds him around why nobody knows. Some children become suicidal terrorists and throw a boat. Overall, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I did not even have fun, nor was it intellectually attacked. I did not want to laugh or cry, I did not understand, nor did I have to learn more or accept anything. It was nothing for me, which is the worst in my eyes what can be said about the film.
