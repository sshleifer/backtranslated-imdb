Foolishness is so stupid, in this totally uninteresting, supposed black comedy. Basically what begins when Chris Klein tries to keep a low profile, eventually morphs into the ungraded version of "The Three Amigos", just laughing. In order for the black comedy to work, it must be horrible, which is not "Play Dead". For black comedy to work, it can not be what "horror" is. What is "Play Dead" is a city full of nuts. Fred Dunst, however, makes quite a fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "The Simple Plan," while Jake Busey makes quite a nice imitation, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
