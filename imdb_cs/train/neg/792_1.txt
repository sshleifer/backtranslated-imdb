Thanks to the BBC for this show. I suffered a inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people, and having a great feeling that people hated me. However, after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes, my luck started to change. After episode 2, I started to apply for new jobs, wear fashionable clothes, and really feel gifted. When the series ended, I ran a sales department at work, banged a lot of women and often won a karaoke contest for my local. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and you do not know where to turn, then go on a journey to Poundland and pick up the DVD it's only 99p.
