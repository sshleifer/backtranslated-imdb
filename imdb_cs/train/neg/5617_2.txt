This documentary is based on incomplete reflections on evidence in which Brian Flemming may not intentionally mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most serious mistake is one of the first: His claim to Paul's invalidation of the testimony of Jesus Christ does not take into account key facts such as: * Existence of some formulated confession in Paul's letters. These sentences suggest that most central claims about Jesus have already been formulated into a statement of faith perhaps within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. The testimony of the first Christians can not be simply imagined. In fact, there were many people who claimed to be the Messiah at that time, but only one of them remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would be absurd if someone really believed that Christ is a messiah, and they are going to die for these beliefs if they knew he was not resurrected. ** Even though the Gospels are later, we are still talking about Jesus' records written in the life of other eyewitnesses who would point to inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospel was written much earlier. What I say is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-service piece of work that follows the various arguments and evidence that serve its anti-Christian view. Do not be fooled by a bad investigation.
