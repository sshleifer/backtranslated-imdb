This film is one of the reasons why the IMDB allows voting 0/10. The game is terrible, even what some have praised here, a Carpathian character! The script looks like it's written hurriedly. In one scene, the black preacher who left when Buck asked what "dan7" means in computer graphics said: "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24." It probably meant VERSE 24, but filmmakers skipped this slip. Perhaps the worst thing is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically wrong. While many Christians have reportedly interpreted the events of the end time, such an interpretation is, in my view, flawed. To understand these shortcomings, read "Christians Going Through Trouble" by Jim McKeever and "The Blessed Hope, Bible Study of Second Advent and Seizure" by George E. Ladd.
