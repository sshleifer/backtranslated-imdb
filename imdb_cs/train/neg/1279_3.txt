The film tells three stories that seemed to have been shot without the knowledge that it was a combined motion picture film. The creators are related to the three culprits by being all connected to diminish Martin Kove, even if you never see some of the leaders with Kove. The first vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman afraid of everything under the sun (she makes Adrian Monka look bold), with paranoia strapped in the evening at home alone. You'll literally shout at Viviana that you're doing some ridiculous things. She spends most of her time at night, showing her amazing features. But her film is the worst, if not the most biting. <br /> <br /> The second mark is owned by Bill Paxton when he draws roommates from hell. His captivating roommate allows him to take full advantage of his benefits, and Bill does so whenever possible. The last vignette was funny because you're afraid that death will take him at any time, just like his friend who choked on olives. <br /> <br /> It's not very interesting because the film as a whole seems to be chopped along with very little idea. It must be for fans of Bill Paxton.
