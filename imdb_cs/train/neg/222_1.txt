As a woman aged over 40, I considered this film to be extremely insulting and humiliating for women over 40, not to mention every other woman of any age. It was the sad, pathetic attempt of a man to write and drive a "chick" and unluckyly failed. Andy McDowell is not a great actress for starters, but due to the non-existent "conspiracy" (I hate to refer to it as a conspiracy), this was not a chance. There was no character development, no reason for feeling sympathy / empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the movie realistic or credible in some way. And then there is a forced man's fantasy about an attractive straight woman who suddenly decides to put lesbianism on the exam - PLEASE. Not only would I wish I could get the money back for renting a DVD, I also want you back 112 minutes of my life. What a ripoff.
