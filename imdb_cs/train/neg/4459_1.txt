I do not say it because the production values ​​were so low, but because they were shot horribly. That shot of a girl who washed her hair in a brook? Do we really need to sit there for a long time and watch her do it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the illumination was simply bad. You could hardly see anything and when the characters spoke, you barely heard what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course, I've skipped most of the time, and I do not want to hear that someone says I need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. This movie was so badly executed and executed that even independent and low budgets are just terrible. An amazing movie ... do not waste your time if you do not want to laugh, but it's not because of the "entertaining" lines of the actors, it's because it's so bad a production.
