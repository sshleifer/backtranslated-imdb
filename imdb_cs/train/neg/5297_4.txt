It's really crazy my opinion when someone hits the movie like this and claims to be one of the worst movies slasher there. This is by far the worst, it's not a good movie, but nothing worse. Go look at something like a sister of death or a blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think Night Charges Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is much more than I can say for many other extremely dark slasher films. The film is not recommended on the death screen, there is one death you see that its pruning machine extends into the throat, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean it's not a movie slasher, it's just a bad one. The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film appeared at the end of the second cycle of slashers, so it was surely a reflection of the traditional slasher elements that were tongue-faced. For example, after the killings, Charlie goes to the city's "greeting" sign and marks the population down one less. This is something you can just laugh at. <br /> <br /> If you are in slasher movies, you will definitely give this movie a watch. It's slightly different from your usual iris movie with the possibility of two murderers, but not too much. The comedy of the film is to a large extent telling the audience to relax and not take the film so god really seriously. You can forget about the movie, maybe you remember it. I remember it because I like the name.
