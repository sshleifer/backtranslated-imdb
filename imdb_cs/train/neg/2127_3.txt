Why? Because for one reason she never had a more adventurous scene than Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" at the beginning. It is repeated again at the end (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and you will see it. Even if it's all you're watching. You agree, I'm sure. Everything about the original was so great he just did not need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave a commendable performance, like Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all actors and singers in this new version gave their "everything", but it's like trying to improve "Casablanca" - it just can not be done! It's even uncomfortable to find out that you are comparing both mentally when trying to appreciate the remake, and it simply can not, without the guilt of the actors.
