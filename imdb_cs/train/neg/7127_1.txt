This movie was bad to say at least! A lot of great cars are concerned about being presented in this LAME movie. It starts with a race from LA to Las Vegas, which will be completed in 1HR 45min ... at the Ferrari F430. I did it in 1HR 50min in a small 4-cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie does not provide justice to these cars. Obviously, these writers are just that and probably drive below the speed limit with their hands in 10 and 2 hours. I remember seeing the news as Eddie Griffin crashed $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enz who walks 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> A .. THE DIRECTOR OF ANDY CHENG IS THE HIGHEST SALE !!! It brings the shame of its own race. I wonder how many people he orally pleased to break into Hollywood. He participated in a film that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and False way. Asian women >> cheap money sucks the whores. Asian men >> lose compulsive players and burglars who are still struggling. What the hell is the fear of the Asians? Why should they always appear in such a negative connotation? I'm so bad how Hollywood ALWAYS portrays the Asian in such a negative and false pretense.
