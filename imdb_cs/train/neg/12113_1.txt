Townies is the finest movie I've ever seen and I've seen Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). She seems confused with what she wants to be. It's not comical enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough, not enough bleeding for horror, and it's not good enough to be tracked. He has scenes of a man who makes a "slapstick / bloody" karate, so I think this movie will be in the spirit of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then, without warning, she jumps into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicapped) woman, and a confident mother. Then, into a movie that seems to be created as a sitcom without laughter tracks, it gets to a good part. The part I'm talking about is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely that he finds comfort in a rotten corpse. That was just part of the movie that made me feel. The rest was the passage of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is, he is at the end of Wayne (a director) some sort of DOCUMENTARY who liked Toby in the public. I was sick. Though Killer Nerd and the bride Killer Nerd (two other Wayne movies) are not the best, they are at least thought so much that you can have fun till the end. I do not even like Killer Nerd, it has great lines I still use. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like overground movies and if you want to watch your legs when you rest, there will be no city! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (z ****) <br /> <br />
