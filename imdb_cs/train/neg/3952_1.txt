The return of boogyman is a terrible film that does not play as a movie, plays as an episode of a television series when it recovers older episodes. Return Boogyman is just a clip show. Mutch from the film is a constant and annoying memories from the first film. Again and again the same record. How bored is it. <br /> <br /> The film is really about a psychic woman who has the vision of the first film. I saw the first film I do not want to see the same scenes over and over and I do not know who would. The whole movie looks as if it was done quickly to make a pair of pairs and it is.
