I really wanted to like this movie. He has a nice prison, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly insidious 80s touch, and the directorial effort of actor John Saxon, who also plays bad guessing that he is a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror. But the direction is very wooden and there is no scary / frightening moment. It just goes on and on, and then (logically) it has to end. More flashes and courageous visuals and their fate as cult classic would be closed.
