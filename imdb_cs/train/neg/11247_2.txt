This movie was exaggerated. Many viewers who thought it was "awesome" had to be in old movie movies because the whole movie is in the past. At first I thought the film just shows something of the past, so I expected that faded dreams like lighting on the characters would pass, but it just goes. In essence, it was a film that tried to mix the future with the past, and 2 were not too mixed in this film, not even with special effects. You could see the blue screen with which the actors played. There are too many movies that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason why critics will speak this step when it says, "It's the biggest movie ever made." It's just a crap on a stick. It also did not help the story get so dirty. I do not understand why Hollywood has agreed that this movie will be produced, and I also do not understand how the actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this one. It's almost as if everyone read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "Everything will be done on the computer". It was the movie that was supposed to be in the movie because nothing of this film was revolutionary. I'm very upset that I paid the money to see it. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
