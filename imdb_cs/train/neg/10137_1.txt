First of all, f117 is no longer state-of-the-art and is not a fighter. <br /> <br /> Secondly, f14 and f18 can not change their appearance; they are not transformers. <br /> <br /> Third, f16 has only one m61 cannon, not two. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, at the end of the movie, Seagle's selected sidewinder racket. But as soon as she triggered the trigger, she fired the real rocket and looked like she was alone. Because I have experience when I see that F18 and F14 are mysteriously transformed into f16, this little transformation of rockets is not a great surprise to me. But there is one more question I have to ask: How did you use the rocket to land to shoot flying f16 ... When students give up really bad work, 0.
