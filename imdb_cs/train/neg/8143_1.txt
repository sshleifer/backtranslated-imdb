I was clearly reluctant to see this movie at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2006. I have been participating in this festival for over 5 years and have certainly seen some poor films. "First Bite", however, achieved a completely new film. Despite the fact that I was shot in magnificent locations, with an occasional, wonderful closing of a fabulous meal, the film transforms an overwhelming amount of plot and character when I prayed for it to end. <br /> <br /> Leading actor David La Haye has not completely noticed the character's evolution throughout the film, rendering a pompous chef from start to finish. Other partial drawings, such as eating disorders, were developed so badly and did not entirely match the context that the film has shown up to this point. The theme of mysticism was used as a bad attempt to hide a movie that does not reach anything, it goes nowhere and completely disappoints.
