... not that all Disney movies are garbage. Anyway, I saw the "Legend of Boggy Creek" first and he absolutely loved the movie. When I heard he had 2 sequels, I was ecstatic. Finally, I found a copy and watched her one night. I do not see how they can do the horror movie. Original is a movie / documentary about Fauke Monster and can scare everyone. "Return" is for children and should not be watched by anyone. I remember the story too well because it's been some time since I watched him and I will not watch it anymore but ... It's about those hunters who come to town and they're trying to kill Bigfoot. Three young children run out of the house to stop them. Big monsoon is coming. Hunters are injured, they are saved. Then they all hide on a ship with a large piece of sail upstairs and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly Bigfoot will come and do something really bad. I do not want to ruin the end for some of you, but that's not scary. Good....
