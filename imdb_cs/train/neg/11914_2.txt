Shiri Appleby is the cutest little incarnation of evil who proved to be a good girl demon-dig Buffy clone, Elle. But I am in front of you, you see that Lilith was the first woman God created as a companion to Adam. But she got all the foolish evil of the feminist, so God drove her out of Eden. The secret line, known as The Fath, captures her, but does not kill her, so now with amnesia (which does not really explain well), Lilith (now Elle) can become Buffy's clone to fight a mad scientist who has injected Lilith's blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph is ominously complicated, it is because it is. The film is also boring, generic, and does not seem to lick about the film with a plot of conspiracy in theology. This extraordinary subterranean film CGIed was clearly an unsuccessful pilot series. Everything I can say is not lifted is clearly Amen. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Comment Writer / Director Bill Platt and co-writer Chris Regina; Galerie Gallery; video previews: before and after (also has a "also available" selection that you think would lead you to some trailers, but nope on DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br / > Extra DVD-ROM: Final scenario for taking pictures and transcribing deletions of scenes both in PDF format
