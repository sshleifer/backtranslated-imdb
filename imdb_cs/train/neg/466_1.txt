How can I best express my feelings about this movie: Hateful? headache? lack of coherent writing? simple stupidity? Try everything that is mentioned above for this travesti.

They are confused as "the world has renounced the killer" (sarcasm) and are "hired" by two "mobsters". One thinks that "getting him out" means a date, and the other gets the smaller actor he's dreaming of. And of course, the turtle reserves for farting the turtle that builds with the casino gaming. Does that all seem funny? Guess again. He's trying to make it funny, but not. Movie sequences are not well done. I've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies. The visuals are average for the late 80's film. But the problem is in that 2007 movie. <br /> <br /> It's not worth it to ever look again.
