Even worse than the worst David "Lynch" Confusathon, "Brain Dead" has no meaning at all. Shameless talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) will bounce off as if they were in the "Tom and Jerry cartoon" on acid. There is a negligible development of the character. It simply starts climbing "strange scale" until it culminates in total chaos. Do not get bored with the aforementioned gentle actors. They have nothing to do with them, and you'll be interested in what's going on all the time, unbearable for 85 minutes. I strongly recommend avoiding the "brain of the dead" at all costs unless you are scattered in your brain into total nonsense. - MERK
