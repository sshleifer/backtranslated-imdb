I do not want to criticize the movie. There's not much to talk about. It has good animal action that was quite surprising at the time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a matinee idol. It's a bit mild and not particularly good looking. But that's fine. He's a man in that lion cage. We know that if he can not take the time from his lions to lean toward his girlfriend, he ends up on the island with her and has to save the day. Someone previously said it was a history lesson. The scenes in the circus are from another day, especially the children hanging around. I did not realize that when they were in the thirties they sailed to three meat skunks. It looked like something from 1860. I think it's the movie they had. No wonder something was destroyed. He always talks about repairing it. It is even dirigible. It tells us a bit about male relationships at that time, a kind of giggle. But if you do not notice it too seriously, you can enjoy watching.
