This is a strange hacked movie, you feel that the bond company had to come to this, I'm not surprised that there is no credit to it, who wants to be connected with this movie. The action of all those involved is terribly confused and the plot of the jump around the world, it all makes little sense. As I said before, it looks like the bond must come because there seems to be a lot of shots that were not shot and that all the music was very bad book music (cheap, I think). Very, very strange. Maybe I could buy a DVD if I could afford what the hell is going on, and what happened to this movie.
