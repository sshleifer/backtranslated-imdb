This is a sad movie for sad people. I sat in the theaters and ripped my hair apart, wanting to break the chair in front of me because the film spit out one scene-inducing seizure. And there were people laughing at me, which made me wonder what movies these people must watch to really enjoy this horse. Nikkhil Advani has six stories without a fence and no interesting characters. The script is boring, he was probably drunk when he was writing this movie. None of these stories is strong. Nothing new, nothing to hold audiences and full of dialogues that you would hear a million times before. One of the stories is that this couple can not have sex because of a series of disasters that occur every time they want to do it. I mean, is this story really necessary? It's not fun, not creative, but it only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy. Another of the stories (which was probably the only story I was interested in) is based on man's unbelief, and it also ends in the lame of the ancient sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap. I have no idea what Salmaan-Priyanka is about. There was no business in the conspiracy to make a conspiracy. Can not take Karan Johar because he has to marry Salmaan? Why can not he marry him and still get a movie? or are Advani and Priyanaka just trying to prove to the world that it is truly true that female actors are not successful if they are married or do not act in the movie once they are married? With six actors in the movie, Advani can not shoot the film alone. So he makes full use of sponsors such as the Times, carefreely promoting his Filmfare magazines. And some jewelery brands that women really love in the movie! I came to IMDb to give him the worst ratings and I'm shocked to see the posts coming from the movie. Just show the sad state of bollywood and how the star hit the fans. With such fans, films such as Salaam E Ishq will continue to be produced and worse will probably hit.
