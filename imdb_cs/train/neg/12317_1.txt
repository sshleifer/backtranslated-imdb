I apologize to the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, poorly occupied, and misbehaving, it's a movie that's trying to escape from dead rome-men of recent years and failure! McDonald and Parker seem to be unable to convey real emotions and are lifeless. They seem to be in this for any salary control they receive and not because they thought it was a good idea. The story is DULL !! I love great feline movies just like another girl, and that does not matter! If we avoid one movie this year ... let it be
