Americans have a span of fruit fly, and if something does not happen in typical advertising, we tend to lose interest really fast. From this movie I found an exciting fact: someone has to paint high-voltage poles and do it on a timetable! And guess what, they really would like to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). When I was bored when I watched later night's infomercials and decided to really watch this movie, I found surprisingly the characters to be interesting and very engaging. I just do not usually watch a lot of nightclub so I can not recommend this movie unless the sighting of the painting is dry is your idea of ​​an exciting two hours of your life.
