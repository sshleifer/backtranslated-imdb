The basic formula for the original series was; take someone, get viewers to like them, and then put them in a deadly danger. This formula worked for 32 episodes created in 1964-68. <br /> <br /> We are now skipping up to 40 years until 2004. We are acquainted with Alan Tracy, somewhat less than a careful undergraduate, with my friend Fermate, a young conscious. Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird takes to the island paradise where the Tracy family lives for school holidays. Almost immediately they are left in the care of Kyran and his daughters, Tin-Tina, while the adults go to the rescue of John of Thunderbird 5, who was damaged by a random accident. </ P> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Dialogue is banal, effects more wooden than puppets (glass fibers), effects, nothing but odd and score Hans Zimmer ??? What little Barry Gray's famous theme was that Zimmer's loud orchestra encountered. The rest of the score was remarkably forgotten. In fact, part of the broadcast was broadcast on the radio the following week and did not recognize it! I did not bother to stay to witness Busted's average effort with final titles To be fair, Ron Cook worked quite well because Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed unnecessary. With the appropriate material, the plugs could be shown. The work of CGI was what I would call the front edge - 5 years ago. The dynamics of the main craft was simply bad; The original series of models have at least shifted as if they had a bigger number. Another problem is that the whole production looked like one long set of product placement, from every vehicle that Ford built to the entire contents of the Tracy freezer is produced by Ben & Jerry to. My son (9) liked the movie, but this cross between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers', focused directly on his age group, added nothing to the Thunderbirds legend. When Star Trek star hit a big screen in 1979 with The Motion Picture, a new lease of life was leased into rent, which then continued for another 20 years. With this film, Frakes missed the golden opportunity to do the same with Thunderbirds franchising. I predict that this movie, like "The Avengers" and "Saint" before him, sinks into the unknown within 6 months, leaving the original series to a "classic" state.
