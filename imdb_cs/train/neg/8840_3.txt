Here's a perfect example of what you do not have to do when you have a great idea. This is not the problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and its implementation lack the true essence. It should grab you from the beginning and pull a bit of your emotions, interest you and invest in characters. This movie does not have what it takes to take off and keep the flight, and here's the reason. First you do not care about the characters because they are not presented so people can relate to them. I mean, it's not Superman or Mission Impossible, it's likely that normal people get into a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and act. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a policeman over chewing is chewing gum, frowning and looking intense all the time is no way to do it. I mean what is it? Looks like he's in the toilet or something. I loved him in a re-animator, and the way he played an intense / neurotic, unexpected medical genius was right on the money. But because of that, he's trying too hard to make it look so intense and on the edge, but still in a gentle neurotic way, it's not natural. I'm surprised he did not finish his jaw while shooting. The film is essentially life-support, barely pulse, and let me wait for something that never would come.
