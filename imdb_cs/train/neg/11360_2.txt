Well, someone some years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie that some flies would be put on board Apollo 11 and would go to the moon. So yes. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. I want to give artists the requisites for doing homework on hardware. If I can say, the missiles and triggering hardware flashes have flown. The graphics were pretty good overall - rocket launching made me feverish, as if a good rocket start was always done (my popular junction mechanics are still running heavily) and 3D was quite effective. CG was not Pixar-quality, but it was generally good. The flies were somewhat media anthropomorphics, with some semi-assed post-60s characters cast in color (hippie flies, African-American flies with giant afros and black shades, etc.) And worms looked more like shrubs with human baby heads (though they did reasonably noisy sound noise). Scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework, relying on insulting and obsolete clich√©s (60s gender policies including mostly-useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, fatty flys that just want to eat, grade-two levels of humor). In the film for IMAX, they dropped a great opportunity to slip into some educational content about physics and the space way - they could not properly adapt their physics (zero-g in the Lunar Module during firing aboard?). nor do you have the right to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the cosmonauts that are all publicly owned; instead they wrote their own dialogue that sounds like bullshit. <br /> <br /> But we liked the worms. So they get a point and a half for rockets and worms. Uh, yeah. 1.5 / 5.
