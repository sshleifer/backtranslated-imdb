I hate to be a procession parade (even a small one), but from the first scene you could say that this film will be an absolute asshole. It's really shame because I like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was impressed how they would mix together in the film, but because of my horror they did not even have a common scene! I think I have to repeat it - the two main actors (who stand side by side on the posters and DVD packaging) did not have one scene together !!!! They never talked to each other and never ever appeared on the screen. It just summarizes this bad justification for the film. Fake advertising. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every figure in the movie was unrealistic and non-human. The scenarios were fairly drawn, the plot was frightening, the jokes were weak, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played poor mans Tim from the office), no one was sympathetic and the worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that he almost drove me, to shut down because I could not bear to watch or listen to them. This low-budget arson was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer could not have put some humor and magic into it, but he blessed, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How could one judge this movie as "ten stars" is outside of me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on ... I'm not going to make dozens of the biggest stars, because the ten stars suggest that the movie was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which meant it was almost totally terrible. <br /> <br /> See if you want to, but if you've seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
