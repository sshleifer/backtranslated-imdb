That must be the worst and I mean the worst biker movie ever made! And that says a lot, because a lot of stinkers is long and smelly! And now we know what happened to Ginger after being rescued from Gilligan Island! The terrified face of Tina Louise (he was probably afraid someone would see this mess!) He is a stranded motorist who is hurt by the most repulsive gang of motorcycles in the movie. But, do not worry about the fans! Batman, I think Adam West as a hospital doctor comes to rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Saint Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points of this "bomb" are some cute women, some ridiculous fighting scenes and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
