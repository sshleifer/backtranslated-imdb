I have seen this film for many reasons, including Mira Sorvino. It could not have been so bad with her. And it seemed to have some secrets, and Olivier Martinez was her friend at the time, and she was pretty good at "Unbelievable". The story takes place in Spain, so it can be an exotic fun movie with one of my favorite actresses. If you think about the same thing, let me warn: it's really a terrible, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective you think is pathetic. The story is created using partial charts that find nothing to tell. They are trying to build a slasher / thriller with a view of fascism in Spain, but they are terribly unsuccessful. The twists and turns have no credibility and the so-called Investigation leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper! I did not care for anyone. More than irritating and quite hateful people. Mire, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are the Oscar winner! Have some dignity! Her character was weak, but that is not the justification for such a terrible performance. It seems that the whole movie is in sleep for a long time. Think about it, in fact, I think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I thought the woman was sexy. Well she is not here. If you want to look at some skin, try Romi and Michelle, because there is nothing to see here. And that accent? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is still the worst. It's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. I'm sorry, but I can not. I've suffered enough with this garbage. This whole movie is depressing! It's so bad that it's wonder how it was even made. A miserable team that produces a miserable scenario and makes some money over the actor's name. Do not forget about it. <br /> <br /> Avoid! <br /> <br />
