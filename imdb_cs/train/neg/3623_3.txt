The murders began for the first time at a time when Earl Yanos's elder brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was terribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. Then Ivan (Erna Schuer), whom Igor hired before his death to help his attempts to appear. Yanos agrees to hired her in place of her brother and they are looking for patterns for dead cell regeneration. Yanos wants to bring Igor's tanned body back to life. Igor, however, is still alive (though he burns terribly) and persecuting and killing women in the village. We see his films appearing in different places in the movie, so we know he's still alive, so the whole thing seems a little obvious. Igor encounters another fire end, a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, burning candles falling on the same bed that Igor pulled on and encountering another end-char-burned end. The DVD Retromedia is taken from the VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. In addition to a better scratch trailer, no extras are included. Although it has a nice, spooky Spanish castle and a good atmosphere, I found it to be quite boring and predictable, without any excitement or secrecy. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
