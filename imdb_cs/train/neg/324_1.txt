The worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler, I can get some cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the movie, all three of my friends slept and I still suffered. The worst plot, The worst script, The worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted an hour to move my head to the wall, then I stopped and you know why? Because it was damn good. After hitting my head, I stuck the damn movie in the microwave and watched burning it ... and it feels better than anything else I've ever done. It was an American psycho, the Army of Darkness and Kill Bill, just to get through the bullshit. I hate your SANDLER for I really walked this way and I enjoyed my whole life all day !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
