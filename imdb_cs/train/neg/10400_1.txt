Enough is enough ... Sometimes it's enough to stop making movies based on a concept that's long dead. The first Tremors movie was great. The other was ridiculous. The third was nausea. The television series was depressingly terrible. And this film just hassle the depth. <br /> <br /> Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, we now have a set of sets in the Wild West in the eighteenth century and fight against graboids. Just like the first rehash, they have to learn how to beat them again. Slightly fun, I think. Otherwise, this issue will be, as well as Tremors 2 and 3, too far away. Oh and I kept wondering how there was never any record of these events ... just simply forgot to record this unprecedented event? I think something like that will make history, so our friends in the first movie will not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Such movies that destroy the original make me crazy. Avoid this waste.
