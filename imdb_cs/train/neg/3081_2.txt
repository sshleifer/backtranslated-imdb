For God's sake! While I still maintain that Manos: Hands of fate are the worst part of mental torture, the Hobgoblins have come very close. This ... this ... insults the spectators at every occasion. At least movies such as Space Mutiny and the future war you can enjoy on mst3k, this was a fight to go through. I was literally twirling on the couch in anxiety. I was struggling with this thing - alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you are a fan of MST3K, you have made your mission to see every experiment, think about it twice. <br /> <br /> It's bad.
