This movie based on books is really terrible and is a great disappointment. We were waiting for this step after a month. Many film reviewers were promising. Also in newspapers and television it made a lot of sense. When it comes to April 29, many people have regretted that the movie is really horrible. Why? Above all, the story was so monotonous. It was a lot of vague scenes, sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on. Actresses from Hulya Avsar were not tuned to their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She works better in comedy films, in this film, what kind of drama she could not get rid of her previous roles. And finally the movie is too short, just 66 minutes.
