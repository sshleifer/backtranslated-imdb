I begin to see the pattern in the movies I give 1. It's almost all the movies my wife has watched me. Maybe I should stop believing in her taste in movies. Anyway, it's a typical hunter aimed at girls in front of teens, but it does even worse than usual. Again the writer violated the basic rule of any film. He / she has made the main character incompetent. It begins by being a complete friend to a friend at first, and then discovers when she becomes 30 years old that she is essentially a woman (matters, etc.). Why would F feel for this person? OK, let's say we can overcome it. Jennifer Garner is about as attractive as you can without any deformity. I do not know if she is the writer's fault, but her character goes far beyond my harassment threshold. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are NOT fun, they're annoying. The far and deepest moment in the movie came when they danced to the "Thriller". Holy crap that was painful. She showed her that she was practicing the dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but the whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly he is totally incompetent and has no idea how to do his job and nobody will notice? At least, the figure of Tom Hanks at "Big" had a job that made sense to the child. These points-switching / childhood become adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand, and it is by far the worst one yet.
