OK, movie slasher. very, very stupid movie slasher. <br /> <br /> We have your stereotypical teenagers in the house. We have an FBI agent who has seen too much of Dirty Harry. "So what's the secret ... punks?" We have about 4 different shots and a scene that makes no sense at all. "Hey man, I fix the sprayer" ((that boy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies kills. <br /> <br /> Watch the murderer in the middle of nothing, without cops. suddenly she is in the church and has a wedding dress. I swear it's the stupidest movie I've ever seen.
