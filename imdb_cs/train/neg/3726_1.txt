I was forced to watch this whole series of films as a small child and I was told they were real! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less frightened than Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only suitable for people who believe in this ridicule and who want to blame their children for believing in the same. In addition to obvious questions related to brainwashing and indoctrination, it is also bad behavior, bad writing and BAD "special effects". They're all around terrible, terrible movies. Yes, believable (and terrifying) children, but I can not imagine adult buying into this shuck. Although I have to say that I would like to see them today as an adult. They might feel like a certain midnight / cult movie.
