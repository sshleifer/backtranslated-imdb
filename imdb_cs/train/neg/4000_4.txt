I enjoyed "American film," so I borrowed the first film Chris Smith, which I thought was a documentary film. In the first minute I saw it was not, but I gave it to her. Being true-to-life barely serves if you only study fatigue, esp. which we are already familar. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it comes as a devotion to somebody that 1) a lot of work suits and 2) most of them are miserable, minimum wages work in the service sector ??? I knew it before I saw the movie. But that does not really matter, because while the movie is trying to feel "real" (pocket camera, no music, etc.), What is happening is played just as if it were in the "real world". </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> Will the employer like Randy as he picks up his check after Randy has gone to him after three days when that guy says he expects to stay for 6 months? Or the day after he left his job (and twisted the machine he worked on), everyone would be so easy on him? The big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. The guy's defeated. Not because he got stuck in these jobs, or he has a crazy apartment or looks like one. It's a drug. He does not pay attention, nor does he really try to do this work. He has a zero personality. If I had to hire someone, it would not do it after the interview. I look forward to what Chris Smith is doing, but the boys have discarded "this is an important movie". "American work" does not work.
