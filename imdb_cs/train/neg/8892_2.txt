You have to admit that this version defames Shakespeare in advance! Nobody can act except a nurse who was my friend! Julie had good abilities as a teenager, but she can not give her emotional depth, and she can never really connect with her. Even worse is making a scene when he thinks of drinking a sleeping potion ... God stops whining! I would pour it into my mouth to close it! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Due to his other great movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), this is very shocking. And do not start me on Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you're on a hunt to see all Romeo and Julie ever made in the history of the film. Olivia and Leonard's versions are still the best, followed by Leslie Howard and current Leo and Clare!
