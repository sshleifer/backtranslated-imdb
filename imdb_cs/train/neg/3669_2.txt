I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie ... not only. The script is a nightmare. The writer blurs the boundary between chemical and biological traits, and it does not seem to understand the difference. Do you think they would at least get a technical adviser. The show was a bad majority of cast ... even though I really do not blame .. the material really smells. The cut was just as bad .. I'll stop now ... it's all bad 2/10
