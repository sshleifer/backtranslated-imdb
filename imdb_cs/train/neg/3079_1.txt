My favorite quote from Crow was when the car was off the cliff, "The movie is so bad, and the car wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> It must have been the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was really there to scare you, which is even more fun! If it was not for the Mystery Science Theater, I would not be here today! :-P
