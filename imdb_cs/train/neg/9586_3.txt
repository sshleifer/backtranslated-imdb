After the catastrophic revolution, this film was almost the last nail in the Goldcrest coffin and therefore the British film industry. The film is an absolute pants, full of music from an attempt to revive jazz in the mid-1980s and comes from a book and author who was shortly popular at the time and deservedly sank back into the unknown. The temple was looking for age and trying to find Suzet and came with 8. Wonders Patsy Kensett by another person who was shortly popular at the time. At the time the movie came out of post-production, there was jazz revival, just like Kensett's career, and the film met with a totally unfriendly film audience. Mediocre would be overestimation for some of the worst / campest / cheesiest acting to the grace of the British silver screen watching it for nearly 20 years and the film is really cringeworthy.
