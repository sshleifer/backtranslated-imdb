This movie was terrible. Throughout the movie, I was confused and did not see any sense. I had to go to this page and read the review to finally understand what it was about. This film is worthless. Not only is it bad and rebellious but completely INCLUDED! Please do not look if you are not one of those who love to watch bad movies. If this film asks Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then it is a country I would like to visit or not bother to know. This is a totally ill movie !!!!!!!! I did not want it because it did not make sense. My friend and I sat there and waited if it was horrible, because that's what it was said. It was a total disappointment.
