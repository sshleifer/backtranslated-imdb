With this name, it is above my understanding how this film simply did not. Sure, there are a few good moments and a little gore, but the way the film was shot and the whole story just hit me like an idiot and a lazy attempt at a rich "shock" tactic ... An inconsistent plot begins with a guy who raped and murdered a woman, stranded at the side of the road. He and his suspected brother are trapped until the brother goes away and arranges to meet his girlfriend in the woods. Eventually, she takes her to the house where she cries, and later shows her underground a collection of kidnapped guys. Strongly drugged prisoners consist of her old friend who raped her, a "blind" neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss. She explains that she is killing them all. She ends and kills HIM and then concentrates on the men (or the pigs) that torture and kill herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with eating and destroying the genitals - which are far from disturbing and basically mild. The best scene is masturbation with a handle and another painful rape of men ... Sure, "I'm sleeping on your body, IP! Ss on your grave" was intended as an unofficial sequel "I Spit on Your Grave" based mainly on the title and link, which gives the main character - suggesting that her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider this to be a pointless argument! This movie is a boring, amateur mess that tries to shock, but has failed unhappily ...
