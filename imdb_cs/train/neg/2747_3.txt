I knew it was going to be, but I gave her the rent for some laughter and maybe some soulless fun. Anyone who reads some of my reviews can see that I like it. I really did not think I would end up with a negative feeling about it. The plot is about an ancient kite army led by a huge snake that destroys the world if some selected heroes who inherited responsibility can? become one? good dragon? or something ?? I do not know. It was so silly that I did not bother to make a great deal of effort to keep it. It's a really stupid story full of ridiculous moments and fucking concepts. So many events felt totally random and sudden. I suppose it was a studio disturbance or something, because the biggest problem I have with the film is the fact that the story seems to be trying to be so spectacular and epic, but everything is happening so fast and going so fast. I feel like I just hit a million points and action sequences in one big ball. The film is like a blow to the face. It does not take long to create characters or drama. Imagine the Lord of the Rings trilogy in 90 minutes? You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be no accumulation at all, and you would hardly be interested in the outcome of these battles. Was that the case with Dragon Wars? I do not blame for 90 minutes and I'm waiting for it to end. Fantastic CGI with some good direction, but horrible acting, quick pacing, and a stupid story for this reason were very difficult to enjoy. I would probably like it when I was 6 years old.
