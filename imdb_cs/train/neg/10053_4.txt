A small girl's body is deprived of all possible means of identification. When one leg is found to be longer than the other, it is assumed to be the body of a missing daughter. After this trauma, the couple are separated and the mother becomes addicted to the sedative and leads to a miserable existence. It all changes when one day, many years later, gets a phone call from her daughter! With the help of a former cop and reporter, she went on a journey to find out if her daughter was really alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess of plot, moves painfully at a slow pace and is totally insignificant. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an excellent job as a desperate mother. The best part of the film is over, but I'm not sure it's worth the rest of the movie. Watch out for English subtitles about the recent release of R1 - not too accurate.
