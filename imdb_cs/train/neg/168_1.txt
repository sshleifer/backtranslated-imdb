Despite the good first season, this series never came close to realizing its potential. As the predecessor of the original Star Trek series, he was condemned from the start by executive producer Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and restrict the definition of what the Star Trek series might be, the futuristic show is increasingly anachronistic. The showr himself, Brannon Braga, has not helped things up by his uninformed and tired rehashing of the previous episodes of Trek and the careless ignorance of the internal mythology of the franchise (it was painfully obvious early that he was in it for pay only). I've never seen a series, "which has been doing so badly for the talented actors (except Jolene Blaylock) for so long, as if this whole series had been created in a bubble that exists outside the current TV scene where the audience (even the audience Trekker), more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic desires and desires, but Berman and Braga seem to have succeeded in persuading the higher ups in Paramount that "Enterprise" suffers from "franchise fatigue" and that his main audience was not a departure but was ruled out. a quality offer that meets the high expectations and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come in. Simply put, in the TeeVee universe, where we have received shows such as "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield," they must have the powers that must be the audience Star Trek, which measures and is dramatically competitive. It's simple and easy.
