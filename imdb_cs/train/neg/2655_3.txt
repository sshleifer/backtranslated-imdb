** 1/2 for this fake Diane Keaton. Someone should tell Mrs. Keaton, Annie Hall's philosophy and hats. <br /> <br /> This movie is just too big Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives. Keaton, who had not telephoned himself first because he was in a bag with his friend and pulled the phone plug, was grieving in a new way for the dungeons. <br /> <br /> She has gone into a summer environment where all Sara friends are. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days, and then begins to uncover things that should not be revealed. Sweet Sarah seems to have slept with her girlfriend and the guy who eventually married the other. Besides, she had an abortion thanks to this boy. We are all guilty of this path. Her only hope is to find the elusive diary Sarah kept. She also hopes that a friend, Adam, who is a playwright, will not include everything in a different game. <br /> <br /> When the diary was found, it was written in Japanese. Sara had a doctorate in this language. It's not great news for mom when the excerpt from the diary is translated by a Japanese chef at a Japanese restaurant. Of course, it seems that everything is ultimately right at last. <br /> <br /> The name of this smalt is from The Wizard of Oz. Mother and Sara would talk, they would both have Dorothy come forward. As if this is not enough, during this bizarre extravagance of mourning, Keaton tells Adam that there is no more Woody Allen in his film Interiors, where he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Mrs. Keaton and the group are also trying drugs. Come on, people, can we realistically believe someone in his real mind could laugh like that? <br /> <br /> The righteous average best sums up this film.
