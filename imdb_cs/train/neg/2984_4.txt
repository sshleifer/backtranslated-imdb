I admit that most of this movie was uninitiated, but I still enjoyed it. It has a great sense of frenetic energy, above-average music, and women in the film have strongly defended themselves, there are no prisons. I can think of dozens of other movies that are much worse, at least that has an interesting plot line along with some social commentary. They will notice how the army deals with viral epidemics, destroying everything in sight, although it means it should be rescue. Also, how dangerous can be martial law since democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to be trying to combine his earlier work (zombies, beyond the gates, the gates of hell) in an effort to improve on them. Unsuccessfully, but certainly not miserably, as if many people thought. for zombie movies, so I admit I'm somewhat concerned about their revision. All I'm saying is that this movie is good once, if there was not so much downfall in that movie (fulci quit and bruno (I can move with the best of them), it was much better and more focused. It's going to be in my collection like singing singles from my teeth. Surprisingly, there is a scene in zombie 3 that the cemetery was actually ripped, I could not believe it myself, check it out, you will be surprised.
