The first look at the cover of this image looks like a good rock n roll movie. But do not let your cover crap or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The story is just terrible, and so is acting. Simple and Simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a road movie, it's just a thin love story, so terrible that you see it exactly. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs and that's why I gave 2 out of 10. If it was not for music, it would be 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a terrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and a girl who plays a groupie is not even good-looking! This film was a great disappointment for me because she does a lot of good promises.
