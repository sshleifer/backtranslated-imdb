I think it's a heavily produced and directing film. Benicio Del Toro should not work on the production of films, he should emphasize his acting and that's it. Steven Soderbergh skipped the whole idea of ​​the revolution, of his ideals and the most important of Che Guevara's life, and so on. The camera is terrible, like someone with 2 days of working experience filming with it, the music is ... I do not know .. is there some music in the movie ???? I do not intend to recommend this piece to anyone. It's just a waste of about 4 hours before the TV or whatever ... I can not see how anyone can rate this movie more than 3 stars. DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER You do not want to watch, please. Save yourself from this misery of "film"
