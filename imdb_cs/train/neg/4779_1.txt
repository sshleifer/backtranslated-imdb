I liked it in 2004. Then he became very stupid. This suggests that children are helpless. It offends children. Cartoon Network was great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. In approaching children's programming, he managed to be interesting and imaginative. The show (Foster's House for imaginary friends) is like inserting 20 tablespoons of sugar into your Sprite. It seems that today's television producers are only interested in making money rather than looking at children's ideas and earning money! Recently, my children are trying to tune in the old shows (the 60s) to find something interesting. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, television should look into its past and recycle child programming from the earliest days.
