The most misogynistic film of all time? Not to mention the '68 should not move the white people on the brown face playing the Indians? My favorite parts must be when the girls are giggling and blushing when the cyclists pull away to rape them. Rape is fun! Who knows? Let's look at it, then there are the careless ruptures of "The Hustler" (a fat boss figure actually plays a pool while trying to destroy the Indians with a leading insurgency jerk), horrific acting, so-on-the-nos-could-well -Me-just-said-you-what-to-think musical cues, lack of ANI Who is ACTUALLY Indian in this movie. And why should we be founded? I have to say that Quentin Tarantino loves this film. Although his films tend to champion strong women, I have heard from at least one source that in real life is a misogynistic idiot. Why did I watch it, you ask? Do not ask.
