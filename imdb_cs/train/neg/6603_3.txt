"Jason Priestly plays like a" breakfast, "a psychological jeweler's villain, whose hand on reality is frighteningly confused by the DVD case:" With his comedy "Pandem" (Bernie Coulson) duo sets off with a lot of money, which is the result of a tip from the beautiful Ziggy box office Laura Harris). Her reward: to hurry with the couple out of control to meet her long-lost father, Francis (Stephen McHattie). But he is suicidal training even with a score with his former boss (Louis Gossett, Jr.) and has a hot cop on his path. Zombies, murder and vengeance are about to collapse! "Stay out of the way!" *** The Highwayman (4/28/00) Keoni Waxman ~ Jason Priestly, Laura Harris, Stephen McHattie
