The book is so good that at least the opening of this creative film will move, but then, as it grows more and more from the book, pulls out all religion and love and mathematics and puts candies in cotton, it's boring. Yet, from the comments I've heard, people who did not read the book like it and if she even leads a child to read Wrinkle in Time, she will serve her purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Medium a clone to my uncle Alberto Mary Poppins (I love laughter). There is nothing such that the screen is encouraged as characters on the screen and cheerful laughter on things that are totally inoperative.
