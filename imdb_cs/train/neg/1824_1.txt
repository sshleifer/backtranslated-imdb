I do not have the envy of Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this movie. It does not matter, boring. Maybe it's too predictable, more than the exploited role of Ben Stiller or the lost scene, make this film something to forget. Even the look of Christopher Walken is furious. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's acting. I loved it in most movies, the last I saw before it was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it was not that bad. About Jack Black ... Well, except for the High Fidelity, I've never seen him do anything good. What School Rock? Ooops, scary.
