This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another artistic film with a violent and radical approach of human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's odd. It also reminds me of "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where there are a lot of low-qualified people living in a seaside camp in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their will, and with all confrontations of characters who do not agree together. I also thought of the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was the writer of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it. Everyone seems so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One could wonder why they live, it seems that everyone on this planet is a member of a great farce, forced to live against its will. Or you can say: hell is in this world.
