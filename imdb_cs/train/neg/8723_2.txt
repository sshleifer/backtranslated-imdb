Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but it's not worth noting. This loss of Italian jaws has little meaning for most of the time, and the rest is meaningless. "Alligator" is not at all convincing, and many sub-parcels are nowhere. If it's in the local video store, you might want to watch if you're a fan of monstrous movies, but it's not worth it.
