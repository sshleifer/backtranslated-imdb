In fact, I went to see this movie in the theater, but what completely waste time and money! Badly acting, I'm sorry it did not help me to enjoy this rather sticky scenario. Some friends told me to go and see this movie since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very much involved in the script. The book really enjoyed it, so the movie was supposed to be perfect. Well, maybe I had my hopes a little too high, but I hated that movie! It was predictable, too sweet to the point that I actually left, I had to vomit, and the worst of all would be a sequel! Bring the world a favor and stop this crushing crusade.
