I can not believe that such an oblique, jingoistic material is transmitted to the Americans as an art house. In the beginning, from such eloquent lines as "we want to make sure they play the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Delivid shows that it's true. The worst way that Irish Catholics are portrayed as hegemonic, Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, is just as bad a representation of history as the early American Westerns, showing the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truthfulness of the story is distorted by the stereotypes and the complete desecration of the Irish Catholics in the story; the corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think they can win through moral swing so that the film so easily recognizes it because it is an obvious intention, so far away from the attempt on art. This movie has no business anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library.
