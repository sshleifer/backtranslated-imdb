Oh, I've heard so good about this movie. I came to see my best friend (she's a woman, I'm a man). Now please allow me a different opinion from the mainstream. After the first few dozen "take off clothes", we both felt a very special combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (on this, not with), we settled down (and it would be better if we stayed in bed), we were convinced that we had spent money in vain. And we had it. The conspiracy was inconsistent, and the characters were a group of people they did not have to worry about. Loss of money, wasting celluloid. This film does not deserve one of ten voices, but it is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has the reputation of being excellent; I do not answer to anyone who even has a taste or intelligence.
