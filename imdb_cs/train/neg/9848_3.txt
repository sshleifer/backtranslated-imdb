This film has some great noir / neo-realistic visuals and tells a story that is refreshing without Hollywood sugar coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. Some scenes, however, take too long (especially the wedding) and I found out that an exaggerated actor and unrealistic dialogue is more suitable for the scene than for the silver screen. The dialogue was particularly disturbing, and it seemed to get worse as the film continued. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the 1920s and 1930s, but their dialogue sounded as if they were training lines for Shakespeare's play as they mixed cement and laid bricks. I laughed at the end and not because the filmmakers wanted it. I think foolish poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would speak Italian and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they really would speak. But that did not work for me. Another dialogue line laughed me for another reason: the main character son, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly picked up a beautiful lilting British accent. I think it has something to do with the fact that the film was made in England. I give this film "A" for effort and intent but it is considerably lower for execution.
