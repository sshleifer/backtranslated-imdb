The only scary thing about this movie is the idea that anyone who did it could go on. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, "The Tooth Fairy" was just terrible. It seemed to be a badly acting child that was confused, Witch of Oz Witch Witch and a happy child ending up with some bad gorons and an oath. Half of the cast seems to be totally useless, except that it is comfortably there to be murdered in some way. The sister of two brothers Cherise Aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have no meaning at all in the movie - they could include them in the main plot for some interesting side stories, but apparently could not be bothered. People who watch the movie know that the characters are for some bloody death scene, but they come, at least TRY and have a light conspiracy for them. The story is generally weak, with the irregular behavior of the characters that drives you to get the witches all. <br /> <br /> Add a weak conspiracy and weakly acting together (the children are especially wooden) and the movie ends with a complete failure. If only MST3K could go to this ...
