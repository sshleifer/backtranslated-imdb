OK, forget about any technical discrepancies or the physical impossibility of a shuttle that was accidentally run by a strange gold-robot robot. Forget the horrible special effects and poorly built one-dimensional characters. Just look at the story premise. The very reason why the movie exists and see how bad the film has been. I know 9-year-olds who look at the insult to intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is terrible. The game is comic and the message it tries to show is incomprehensible. What's worse is that cable channels KEEP SHOWING IT! His twice daily every two or three days! Why does anyone in the right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid several times, much less to see it at all? My recommendation is not to bother spending energy watching the thing. It's just not worth it.
