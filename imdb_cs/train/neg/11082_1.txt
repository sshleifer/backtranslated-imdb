I know it's a Power-Rangers trick and it's been 7 years, but why did they really take this movie seriously? If they write a plot of crayons, at least they have the decency to make it stupid. It's a little funny when you watch it. We have a typical family that is full of character clich√©s (a veteran war veteran who has lost his wife and accused himself of LOLOL), children with an airhead try to fill the stereotype hard but fail with a terrible acting performance and a sadly scary helper who has no purpose into the movie, but to fill the camera's space. Funny stuff! But the real good moment is coming to an end when a warrior and a bad-looking villain try to fight with a sword but then realize that none of them know how (probably because no budget for choreographers) so they came up with this kind of American gladiator type to run in. LOL. 1/10 ratings because he's trying to treat it seriously.
