It's really such a bad movie. My friend rented it because he's an idiot. But then I must be an idiot again because I was watching the whole damn thing! The actors were in the same place with dramatic geeks from colleges who think they are going. The only place to go is back to the waiting tables at Luby. All I thought was when I watched what "gem" was, as it really did. I mean, some "screenwriter" actually thought this assumption was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to have a purse with a naive misconception that he would return to it. Actors were cast, places were explored, makeup artists were hired, computer animators fresh from Al Collins Graphic Design School were brought and this turd began to take shape. There, of course, was a ton of stuff I hated in this move, but the only thing I was most crazy about was the overuse of music. Every minute of this strike was recorded. There was no single break in the music. And sometimes it was mixed above dialogue, not that you wanted to omit some vital point of conspiracy or anything. At the end we decided to watch the Mystic River. It was like driving the 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit and switching to the BMW 740il. You could not get two other quality counterparts.
