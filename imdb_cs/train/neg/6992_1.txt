The task is to have a female nurse, named Anna, caught in the midst of global chaos when the zombies that nourish the flesh are starting to pick up and take over the world and attack the livelihood. They run into the streets and are rescued by a black policeman. So far so good! Usually I like horror movies, but this film does not deserve to be termed horror. It's not even thrilling, but ridiculous. Even "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" give you more excitement. It's like watching a lot of bloodthirsty drunkards who can not get to the wine shopping mall. The heroes who blocked themselves inside the shopping mall in order not to be able to treat the mugs outside are also no better. Although they do not seem to be drunk, they give the impression that they are mentally handicapped. Save your money instead of spending it!
