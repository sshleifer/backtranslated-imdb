Despite being a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, it was not six years ago when I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'. I knew all the songs from the old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but nothing knows about the plot. Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and Ginger Rogers is sweet and funny, I just can not like Bake Baker. While trying to cope with his long-time partner, he is constantly sabotaging his career. His character does not have the usual humor and encouragement of other Astaire films. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the songs and the great solo knocking routines from Ginger Rogers.
