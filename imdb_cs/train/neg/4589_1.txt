Do you remember that fans of chain smoking were exposed 60 minutes ago 60 years ago? That's her. Many people have watched this film without checking the bona fides of the creators. Producers successfully used fake promotions without publishing financial and philosophical data for this marketing market. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age punch and day-old baloney, this movie is for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you give her a lot of money. If you can play on the Ramtha web site without believing it, you may think that the money you have assigned to this infomercial for madness has been well exhausted. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
