He is a classical arsonist with a large named occupation, mostly seniors who were very good at this time and before bedtime. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty depressing film when you think about it. Stay on the ground and you will face illness and eventually your death. Gwen Verndon showed she could still dance. It's a shame that the film did not focus on it. Maureen Stapleton, who looks like a haggard, still shows these steps from the "queen of the stardust dust dance hall", much more on the ground 10 years ago. I just hope that this film does not support seniors to mass suicide at Jim Jones level. How can someone be so stupid that you like it and say it thinks you? Why did Don Ameche win Oscar for this nonsense? If the seniors did a beautiful thing at the end, why was the young man encouraged to step out of the boat? Why Steve Guttenberg jumped the boat? After all, he found his love. <br /> <br /> It would be a nice movie if the seniors managed to find their youth fountain on the ground and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, in this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and the lord know who else is gone. Writers should take the script and place it in this group as well.
