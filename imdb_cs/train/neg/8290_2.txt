Alan Rudolph is so director, without this special touch. For example, there was one shot in the Secret Life of Dentists in the Dental Office, which could express the whole relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph destroyed it. The camera is in the corridor and looks at the doors of both dental surgeries, while Dana and Dave are each in their room. You get an idea of ​​their devastation and isolation, but nothing more. Illumination, color, body language, facial expressions could greatly improve. If I drove, I would spend the whole day if it was necessary to get it right. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express it so much, all its life in a matter of seconds <br /> <br /> The shot with the toddler who entered the puddle of the rifle could improve. The child should be more interested in the pool, she should rise and shake her legs, her head should be downward to look into the puddle with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He plays a noncommunicative man, but instead of conveying his inner confusion in voice, gesture and body movements, the film relies on voice talk and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ee played by Denis Leary.
