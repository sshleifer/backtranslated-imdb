God, I had to see it when I was only 11 or twelve, (do not ask how), maybe I was young, but I was not stupid. Anyone who sees it as a bad film, ugly, crude, insignificant and very stupid. I've seen more impressive effects on Disneyland, I have seen better performances in the school game, and I've seen more compelling crocodiles in the zoo where they do nothing but just sit in the water, they ignore the children who knock on the glass. The story is based in northern Australia. Several ambitious young people are testing new water sports, surfing in shark-filled waters. Soon it will appear that there is something more dangerous in the water. After learning what they are, they will be helped by a grizzly middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the beast to avenge his family's meals. I think I've seen every step-by-step step that has been made in the last fifteen years, of which Lake Placid is the best and worse is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst step of stepping I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing just behind me. Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures there, resulting in more than one hundred injuries or deaths each year. Films like Blood Surf, however, destroy not only the wild picture of such a creature, but the good hour and half of the audience's life. If you really do not want to see, avoid Blood Surf.
