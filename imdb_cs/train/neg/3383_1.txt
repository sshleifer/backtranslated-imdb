For the first time I played live instruments at the Denver Center for Performing Arts and it was absolutely wise, stunning and had such a fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked much more than most of the musicals I've seen on the stage. Interestingly, you should never have seen Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was strong and led the direction of the whole production. When I heard that they were making films, I stuffed my breath, but when I watched the movie version, I was so disappointed I was cheated. The film does not contain a captivating mood set in live creation and never lets you get in touch with each character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and, if it should ever be revived, I would strongly recommend that you avoid your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will love.
