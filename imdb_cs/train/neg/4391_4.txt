The young scientist, Harry Harrison, continues with late-stage scientific research on the regeneration of limbs with flying colors, but his interfering control of mother and her doctor want to sell serum. When he finds out, there's an accident when Harry lost his arm. Try serum and what events is a genetically disturbed shoulder that has its own mind. Oh, we've seen it so many times before, but what drives this very camping and quite rubbery junk junk is the performance of the film icons by Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, it is not a bad film Fangoria; only there are better ones that are similar in the veins. "Servered Ties" simply lacks its own distinctive style. Oddball nature and unpleasant drmolit reminded "Re-animator" and even the touch of a threatening shield, which was thrown out like something from "Evil Dead 2". The comic story is really exhausted by black humor, but it can get melodramatic and a bit dry in a fun factor. The surprise emerges, especially the end result of the film. Which is well accepted because I thought it could deal with something more accessible. For low-budget production, make-up FX can be strict and very hideous, but there are some grotesque moments to smile before they actually touch. Even a bit of sexual tension simplifies the story thanks to the strictly succulent performance of Elke Sommer as a mother. Oliver Reed is humorously humorous and pulls it extraordinarily well. Both were immensely diverted as a couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is gorgeous in an unfair performance like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano sharply filming and orchestrating some stylish scenes of affection and horror. Yeah, it's a juvenile, and basically stupid nonsense, but you have to give him some undemanding fun.
