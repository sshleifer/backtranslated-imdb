For two of the funniest comedians, the film was terrible. They quickly handed it over and never improved! Losing time and wasting money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought she would be so great in comedy. The previews were so great, but they showed only the best parts of the film. My husband even thought cats, it was bloody. What's wrong with that. The film was very slow and boring. At this moment I do not recommend anyone. I would like to return this money! They will be here in Arizona. Thanks, but not thanks. Who's doing such stupid things so people think you're pregnant. I thought it would be so funny that I had my own children and helped others have children. It could have been more in line with reality.
