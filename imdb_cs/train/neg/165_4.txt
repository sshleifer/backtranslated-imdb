Although it is soon to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought it would be. But there is potential for the series. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought it had the potential - but he was very disappointed. My gut tells me the business is not as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> As far as the pilot's impressions ... The pilot had some good ideas and good themes. I really enjoyed the introduction. Successful opening shows were an interesting survey and a theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent as a captain. Wherever I did, it was to a large extent that the story lacked the "feeling" that she was doing a great adventure. The episode itself was just a "generic" story of Trek with "exploration" and "first step to the universe" just subplot and subtext. By editing references to this first mission in the deep space, it would be difficult to distinguish between Enterprise, TOS or TNG periods. The central conspiracy does not reflect or match the big theme of the series. The conspiracy to launch the first mission would be big enough without "action". Instead of singular references to the novelty of the survey, they could be a story. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that would make you think again). Make us feel the excitement of the "wind" and be on the "sea" instead of distracting us with rescue and lots of weapons. It was a lot of blows. <br /> <br /> We felt like people were 'fresh' in the designated school. New kids on the block, unlike they find themselves in a very unknown universe. We are sorry that the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of finding them. This meeting could have been much more historic and far more sociological. How do two such different societies interact? Do not just say SHOW it! <br /> <br /> I had to think more about this as 'Trek with Crew Accumulation and Restricted Technology', unlike 'first brave steps to the unknown'. I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept, but I have not seen this new, great concept yet. I will end with a repetition of sentiment that the series has the potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is beautiful. Blalock has the potential. The overall theme is most interesting since we first saw Kirk in the world before Apollon 11. If only future episodes can fairly do this great and amazing topic, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot the arrow in the air ... Good luck Capt. Archer. <br /> <br /> Producers: ADDING MORE RISKS AND MAKE US * THINK *! :-)
