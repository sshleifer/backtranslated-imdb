This film does not show us anything original. Every idea or action scene can be found in many previously released movies. Wonderful Nick is completely plain here. Even Will Patton is calm and evil, not even good. Mr Duvall is fine, but he has a very small role. So, Angelina, how can we identify her newly recognized star? Overall, there are too many characters, so nobody and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes it easy to forget the movie. Damn it, do not you think?
