From being an indescribable title to flat acting performances, Curdled is a very intriguing film. The film has won several fans, including the name of Quentin Tarantina and a silly and helpless nod at the Rodriguez / Tarantino film "From Soul to Dawn". These things, however, do not make a great movie, and it is more than obvious the whole journey through "ending". The film suffers from too obvious lack of ideas and tries to mask it with the murders to be stylish and the events to be disturbing. The Mexican musical score that accompanies many sequences in the movie is, of course, understood to be cool but very fast poisoning; especially unlike the fact that the main character is Mexican, does not match the tone of the film. The filming of the film is typically extraordinary, followed by a gorehound who, because of his obsession with cruel murder, is working with a company that cleans murderous scenes. It sounds boring and it is. William Baldwin is the only 'name' on the list and does not even impress. He had nothing in the movie to do in the film, and besides talking to his victims and standing around and trying to look threatening, he was largely unnecessary. Angela Jones, or rather; a Pulp Fiction taxi driver, takes the lead role as a murdered young woman, and it is always clear that it's her involvement with Pulp Fiction that has won her role, not her acting ability. Perhaps she was good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she does not have the talent to lead the film. It looks lost and out of place for most of the film, and if it was not for her Latin accent; she would convince the audience that she is strange at every level. Deadly is a 100% piece of forgotten waste. Such films often receive praise for inventions or black comedy films; but this will fail at all levels. Whether you are a fan of Tarantino, a fan of William Baldwin, a horror fan or just a movie fan; it does not matter what is missing.
