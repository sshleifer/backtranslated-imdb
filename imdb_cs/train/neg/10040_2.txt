But that's where I would like to ask the director: Sir, what did you smoke?

Vishal-Shekhar came up with some extremely humble melodies. <br /> <br /> I would like the director to spend money on creating other eye candies .... <br /> <br /> When I log off, I really want to know how the Akshay bullet wound disappears behind microsecond ... what are you doing editors? Tashan, maybe ...
