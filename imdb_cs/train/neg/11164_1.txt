What a disappointment! This film seemed to be trying to copy a "top-of-the-line" comedy, but the direction and the script were sloppy, sick and sentimental in the worst film tradition. Jack Black's role / role role was self-confident and confident ... and the other characters were as masked and uninteresting. The soundtrack was boring. We are Black fans but none of us has done more than just a forced caption for the duration. Why did he think he needed to make this mistake? We will not watch another of his films without reading the review much more carefully! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read the script before you sign up for this drive?
