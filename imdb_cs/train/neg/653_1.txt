If I could give this movie a real rating, it would probably be in a minuscule number. While I respect the fact that someone has to do these terrible "horror" movies, seriously, people buying a ticket for this movie is a waste of money that you could spend on something much more that would cost you your time. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> While it is a horror film, there is nothing scary about it, unless it scares you to see how many horrible clich√©s fit into one movie. If the rating was higher, it would probably improve in the long run. <br /> <br /> Who would make this version of "Prom Night", so you tried it. Participants would probably have a decent job if it was not for questionable scripting. It was a terrible waste of a movie trip. I would have seen "One Missed Call" before, at least it had a conspiracy.
