This movie was, as Homer Simpson said, "boring than a church." Perhaps I do not get it well enough, and I thought it started well, but after Hermann Braun was sent to prison and Maria started working / sleeping with her boss, she started to pull and I struggled to keep up. Again maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end looked very forcefully and in place. (END OF SPOILER). Finally, I do not realize why others think it's so great, because I thought it was extremely boring. By the way, I did not watch this movie with my free will because I had to see it as a movie class.
