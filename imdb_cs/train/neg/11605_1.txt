At first glance at the plot, I thought it might be a decent movie. Could I ever be wrong yet? At the beginning of the movie, it looks like a lot of freaks who have gathered and decided to make a cheap film. During the first 10 minutes you will not notice cheese acting, terrible sound and painful special effects, but then it will get worse. Just about 20 minutes later, I asked myself, "What was the conspiracy again?" I could ask this question only if I was not emptied of laughter from the utter cruelty of this film. The main actor has one environment for emotions, and he keeps on watching him for the whole movie, even though he has to go through love and hate and everything in between. The flash scene almost reversed me because it was another minute of my record in the movie. Now we are in the middle of the movie where he obviously tries to get Morpheus out of "The Matrix," though he's doing a terrible job. Actors talk about the "Star Wars" phrases, and Fortune cookies are almost unbearable. Now, at the end of the movie, you do not realize it's the end of the movie because you actually think the fence is developing. "Morpheus" character dies, the only good thing about the movie. He writes a few words and the credits are rolling. What is it? No plot, bad acting, everything sweet, could not get worse. Please, if you appreciate human decency, DO NOT FOLLOW THIS FILM!
