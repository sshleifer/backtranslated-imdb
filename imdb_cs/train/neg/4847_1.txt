As usual, I'm making crazy dashes to see movies I have not seen before in anticipation of the Oscars. I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seems to be right in my alley. I can not understand why my life understood why this movie got the sound it has. There is no story !! A group of people around Iraq is moving around. One day they are expanding the bomb. Tomorrow they will work in the countryside, less in themselves and start to take off the fire. Wait here for being back in Baghdad. There is no coherent story at all. The three main characters are so characterized that they are just cartoons. So I think we have a sweet baby who is afraid of dying. We have a hardened soldier who is practical and wants to go back to safety. And then we have a cowardly cowboy who does not follow the rules but has a weak spot for an early little Iraqi boy trying to sell DVD soldiers. What do you think will happen? Well, do you think a cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules is getting ready for a sweet guy wounded with his renegade? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi boy who has a cowboy soldier has a soft spot will be killed and cause him to go crazy? Why yes! There is no story. Script is youthful and predictable! The camera is very shaken to look "artistically". And for all those who think it's such a great picture of war, they will rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
