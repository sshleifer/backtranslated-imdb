The chemical spill transforms humans into zombies. Two doctors will survive the epidemic. It's the film Andreas Schnaas, so you know what the course for this course will be. Bad actions, terribly terrible special effects and no budget to talk about. Dabing is ridiculous with R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write one word about this excrement, less than ten lines that are mandatory due to the guidelines that IMDb gives me. My original reviews of only one word: Kecy should not fly, so I have to revisit and go more on how bad it is. But I do not know if I can, so ... wait, I think I can have enough words or lines rather to pass this survey. What's fine, I think. So in summary: This movie sucks the balls, do not look at it. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
