I voted for this movie 3 because it looks great, just like all Greenaways outputs. But it was his usual mix of "artistic" sex and demanding crap. I know a lot of people like this movie, but I'm very tired of it. It's definitely not for everyone. Versatile McGregor apparently took the role of credibility, I think, but he really should not waste time. I hate to send someone to the pseudo corner, but please ..... !!! On the plus side it is visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music, but I could not see it until the end and I can not say it for many films. I usually look at the whole thing, but it is unbearable!
