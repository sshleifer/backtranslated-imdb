What was the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in a hat?" "Gigli?" Mais non! I suggest that it was that horrible little movie from the beginning of the year. Badly written, poorly adapted and (if I can be so daring) badly acting, "Order" is the black hole of the film - a film so dense that even the smallest experience could not get out of its horizon. It's not even funny, like (Showgirls). You know the producers assume that their viewers will not be too smart. They renamed the movie, originally called "The Eating Eaters", because they thought Americans were too stupid to understand what the sinner ate, though they go to a great extent to explain what the sinner eater is in the movie. Instead, they feature an absolutely generic title and the image of Heath Ledger looks softening are more than enough to keep you there. And hey, you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw a picture of Heis and pulled me in. Congratulations, manufacturers, you met your target market. She also liked "Lubricant II," so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back to the theme, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a particular (you think) order that tries to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has questions about celibacy, perhaps because nobody in the true mind believed he knew about the slightest thing about religion, much less a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy. Just as I wanted to see the return of humorous alcohol on the big screen, his humorous attempts reminded me of all the jokes in my high school, who imitated Monty Python and thought that if they said Pythons would be automatically fun. You know what the people I'm talking about. If I was still telling you, I would be in danger of creating spoilers. Frankly, the thing that caused this film was the fact that it was created.
