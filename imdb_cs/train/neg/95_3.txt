You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you do not want it, a man who is screaming for budget terror after budget terror to less than enthusiastic receptionists. But it still does the same. Even the harsh praise surrounding his Blood camp movies is reluctant and I am as guilty as anyone. Brad will normally be able to mix something interesting, pure idea, coconut characters, anything but without funds to go beyond the basic level, rely on the audience to make a little relax and appreciate it for what it is and what it is may be. Joe Haggerty gives a full and very funny performance like Ebenezer Jackson and his credit to Sykes that he can afford to make this gorgeous affair work within the movie. Prepare for a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe somewhere.
