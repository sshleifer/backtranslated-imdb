All I can say when I was watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you do not have an understanding of what you're doing. If you insist on shooting gangster movies, I urge you to do research. It's funny to watch movies with absurd gangbangers, which even sound far absurd when they talk. I laughed at the part where Mr. Cahill went to school with only three students and continued digging his ass in kung fu fashion. This movie was hard as a special after school. Who had the idea of ​​having worn hats that say where the gangbanger comes from? I suspect that real gangbangers do not have hats claiming to have a gang there. This would be stupid due to new laws that add lengths of imprisonment if a person is related to gangs. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the BEST Gangbanger movie ever made.
