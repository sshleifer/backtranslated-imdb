I checked this movie when he had 6 more votes and said it like 7.2 or something, but it's really a terrible movie. It allows you to divide it. The first thing you'll notice in this movie is that it was filmed on a handheld digital camera that is owned by the first high school teacher. another thing you'll notice is that the actors are all known to the first guy (they probably met with them in the pub the night before). Thirdly, you'll find out that the music is awful and is trying to make many songs into this movie in 30-second intervals ... also all digital editing is done on the home PC of the first person ... probably using the film maker film ... This movie was terrible ... demanding, undoubtedly bad scenario and played it I would not recommend this movie to someone, who I know, but I make a sentence for the writer and the director to watch this film in hell for eternity.
