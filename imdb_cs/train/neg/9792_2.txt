It should be said for the first time that I read MANGA, so my argument is based on differences. This anime disappointed me very much because it removed the comedy and high quality action of manga and OVA. What was left was just a fool of what might be. Many characters lacked the depth the manga sees. Alucard is not a sympathetic character who secretly wishes to die. Walter's story lacks treason. And the Nazi villains who are about to kill the world in the war are totally absent. Instead, the anime gives Gary Stu the villain incognito who is defeated against what seems to be all odds. My main complaint is not that the anime deviates from the manga, but it does such a bad job.
