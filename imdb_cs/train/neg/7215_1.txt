This movie was a stupid piece of crap. Everything wrong. Why is it that those of us who love Western movies are nine times more than ten in renting Western. It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck attached to the envelope, it is not worth it. Most of Shiloh Falls' main events took place in 1892, but revolvers used models from the eighties. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene, the marshal fired six shotguns nine times and could not hit any of the three great men who were only about twenty feet away. After about 15 minutes of this infertility, I had to turn it off. Perhaps those who participated in this film could have a few hours at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
