I started watching this movie with my friend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I managed to stay up to the end. It was a painful experience. I liked jean hugues anglade, but I think he needed to eat like us, so he accepted to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters and the rest could be called "art" or something I could not express but that I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've ever seen was a crash, but now I'm sure I have enough experience to be able to follow her successfully. <br /> <br /> Good luck !! ;O)
