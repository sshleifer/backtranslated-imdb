It was filmed back-after-back with the re-make of 1992's famous Conan Doyle's 'The Lost World' novel. And that shows. The film starts promising enough, with a ruthless organization that wants to take advantage of the lost world, and Challenger et al., Who are returning to defend the prehistoric platform, but then things get down. They are all stuck on the plateau and we are left with a faint, dull, overcrowded overturning of the first film. Dinosaurs (which are hardly seen) are just ridiculous. Would we like to take that plush toy that should be ankylosaur seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems to be rooted in place. Make a favor and get the 1925 silent version of the lost world. Incredibly at this age of CGI and other advanced effects is the twentieth version best and will remain until someone finally decides to make a decent re-make.
