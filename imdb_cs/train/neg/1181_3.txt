this film has been permanently shrouded in scandal for so long that it has become a very sought-after subject ... with indignation, secrecy, etc., all of which should have been a great part of the film, but eventually failed in every scale. it's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror film, a lame erotic film. The DVD with two discs contains a wonderful brochure of photos, interviews, animal essays, etc., as well as an extensive interview with a more convincing director. For those who have heard about it but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic until it really sees the movie. Disc 1 includes a modified movie, poorly translated into English but with good visual quality. Disc 2 contains a director's cut in a terrible transmission in French. What can I say about the current animal? the Kermit frog hand puppet would be more effective and shocking.
