This movie is painfully slow and has no plot. It mediates the lives of the group of dismissed shipyards. One of the elders is honest in trying to get a job. There may be some social commentary, but it is confused because no one is painted in a very sympathetic light. I do not understand why it was 7.8 when I decided to watch it. I looked at the boring thing and built the expectations for a huge revenue. No luck. The value of IMDb has always been so good to my taste. Something above 6.5 was very attentive. And my wife says Javier Barem does not look good in this movie either. It's not my type, so my consent does not mean much. <br /> <br /> I give it 1.
