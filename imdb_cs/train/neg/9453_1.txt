Holy cow, what part of this movie is. I do not understand how these filmmakers could take a 250-word book and turn it into a movie. I do not think they even knew! I do not recall the fact that some farting or ringing appeared in the book, right? That's how it all took a child's classics, added some farting, pain and sexual inuindo and prostituted her into the joke Kaka. This should give a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood manufacturers want to think. I have to say visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that is funny) I do not want the kids I know to think. > <br /> Do not take your children to see, do not rent a DVD. I hope the Duke spirit of Duchess Suess comes and persecutes the people who made the film.
