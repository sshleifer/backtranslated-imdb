It's a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who loved so much was probably dead, but really his father scientist just cast a spell on him to turn to this really cute shark. Some kind of beauty and animal. Probably she could use the ballroom dance hall and maybe sing the candlesticks, but instead there are some pretty rough plants. They make a girl really itchy, so she lets eat a shark instead of scratching around the movie. A scientific boy is a good dad trying to combine his fish shark with the woman he's engaged with, and even giving them private time for sex, but the woman in this is really a shallow snob and thinks the guy is ugly, a frantic monster and he does not want nothing to do with him. He gave up love! Just because it was a shark! I thought it was sad that all he had to do was kiss him and he would return to normal and happy to live all the time, but it's not such a movie.
