Understand that I'm viewing a movie I've seen. I realize that practically all nudity and gore have been cut out of this film, and so completely castrated. When I saw names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew I could not get a horror classic, but at least I expected them not to give up bloodshed and bloodshed. But no, it must be the most crippled modern horror film, I think it's easy to say that there is much more for some scenes, but they suddenly cut off, or the scene ends quite right. How are cannibals and porn stars? I think it's a winning formula, but I wonder if the director slept with a manager wife or something, because it's literally amazing how many of it was cut. When I read about him a few years back at Fangoria, I was excited, it looked like a fun movie, but unfortunately the real movie is somewhere blocked in the vault, and we have to stand this piece of excrement called Evil Breed. Hopefully, some uncut cut will be released sometime, because I think there is a good movie in this mess, but until then it is best to take the Bud Bud Package, because that's the only way you can do it through this movie.
