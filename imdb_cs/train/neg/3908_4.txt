In the HOUSE there is enough starry power to create another galaxy, but the end product is quite questionable. The film and his message are very lofty and I think they probably agree with them. (Liberal democracy good, violent fascist regime bad, open sense of good, bad racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are suppressed from head to toe and we use as much detail as I described them. <br /> <br /> Finally, we are watching the very noble people without any shortcomings that would be distributed among ugly predators who do not have redeemed qualities. It radiates all the strain of a badly orchestrated match for. Jeremy Irons plays a patron, a man with many opposites. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close as her sister. When the camera stays with these people, the film tends to move around and is quite nice. Unfortunately, CONFIDENCE OF SPIRIT takes just too many subplots, and the characters stand out from the image as the goal of the shooting gallery. We do not recognize them, so we can not take care of them. The result is boring. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende) either prolonged the movie or cast a few characters, this movie could work completely. At the stage it was a handsome test, with good news and constant staring. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
