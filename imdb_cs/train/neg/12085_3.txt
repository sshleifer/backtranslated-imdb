In fact, there is not much need to start with this little review of the conspiracy synopsis. I think it's Shakespeare's Hamlet for good? probably one of the most famous songs ever written. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet that most people have on IMDb? through the Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the show does not have to be the best place to judge the movie, in this case I can not imagine a comedy-free tracking attempt. This German version of Hamlet made for television seems terrible. 152 minutes? In any case! It's too dark and depressing to spend almost three hours. I've said it many times, but fun is the thing for me. And this wrist is not too funny. But I'll give him a few points for what I felt was some good acting actor. And 3/10 sounds right for me. <br /> <br /> Just like I like MST3K, their comments do not help Hamlet become more appetizing. There and there are some good riffs, but Hamlet is a bad movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is too nasty to allow a comedy to have some rhythm or flow. Just as it hurt me, I have to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K scale.
