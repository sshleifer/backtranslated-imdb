Sergio Leone is spinning in his grave ... If there was a movie that would be a man's life, that's how it is. The main character is the "lone wolf" bravado's uninspiring and lame, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight degree of education. Whoever thinks, the horse should be whipped. The only reason I spend time is that it's at least 10 rows. The Sergio Leone family should sue, not because it's crap, but because it is now immortalized as the MST 3000 bullshit. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey does crap that is used to hurt anyone except cocaine users and weapons experts ... this movie is pure banging.
