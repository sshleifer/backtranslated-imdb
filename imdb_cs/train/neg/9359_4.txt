This film is probably pro-muslim. <br /> <br /> Why do I write this? The main figure is a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives the first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he is seemingly Muslim because of his wear and tear that he kept his amulet and his general outfit. He has a six-year-old child who wears the same clothes on his head, and is therefore probably a Muslim, even though his mother is a Christian. The main figure thus decides to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other male main characters, Christians, seem to behave like a child. In the world of this film there are more Muslims in the world, so it seems.
