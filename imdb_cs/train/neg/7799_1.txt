What happened in God's name? How do you succeed in creating what is a cheap knocker of Redneck Zombies? Zombie '90 has ever had someone to live ... someone, or even profit from the dollar? But especially what happened? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a fool named Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in land-broken gore films, such as the Gore Cup, and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of them contain name shame. In gore, this difference does not differ from others. Though the level of impudence ... well, ground breaking. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is just as bad as Dead-Alive Peter Jackson is cruel, think about it. <br /> <br /> Too much of the story would be a waste of time. An accident involving chemicals causes the dead to return and live. This concept has never been treated in such a way. Gore effects are all, new low. Only a nightmare in grade Z. I can not say if this was originally meaningful, I doubt that the English dubbing is very true to the original script, but things became noticeable. The whole thing reminds me of the introduction to the movie Throma, except that it takes much longer. I saw only one film that was worse than this movie, The Chooper. To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards in what you are looking for in a bad movie, do Extreme Pestilence, but you were warned. It took the steel nerve to get through it. But if the gore is everything, why are you here, then you could have this problem stomach. Besides, no atmosphere, no, and I think no budget, no value of entertainment, but no pride. Show me pride, Schnaise. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated May 7, 2009: After several more shows of Zombie '90 I changed my heart or I think I'll get it now. Zombie '90 is cheerful, so never make a hard word. Although Extreme Pestilence deserves only one star.
