I rented it for one reason, Tom Savini, I respected his work, but it was a real mutilation, I had a terrible clich√©, half of the movie were naked women so-called "fallen angels" running around trying to make scary, and then there were casual "Blair Witches "black and white motion sicken camera scene. Tom's character was really terrible, a horrible script. And you have to love the lines they use. "There's someone out there that's not funny." No, but your acting was. I wish I could give this move 0! Names of Names. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but Anthony dropped out, The Breakfast Club reunited in the forest of unconditional acting.
