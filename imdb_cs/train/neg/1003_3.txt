Okay, I'm not Japanese. I know very little about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Besides, I'm Spanish, I'm paella and I like black humor. Okay, with that point, I can comment on the film: I have no idea how nice the Japanese audience is, Mamoru Oshii is a pretty good director - despite the overly pedantic Talking Head postmodern stuff, and that was also curious and somewhat interesting - Surprised that it came. It can be just one of those cases lost in translation, I'm afraid, but as a European spectator watching a movie with an overtonous overloaded English subtitle, I thought it was terrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was bitter - I mean to give the audience a break and a bit of a damn narrator to knock - to the extent that my head explodes because of the exaggerated fast talking and absurd behavior. br /> <br /> I thought the animation was really great. The idea is great and is well utilized in those animated scenes. However, the eye-candy ends when the characters are left aside to begin with the infinite, not fun, mumbo-jumbo speech over static images at all. They just want to move you to the next scene with hysterical characters. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshi really plans to continue. The idea was good but badly abused. Perhaps the second part will bring good parts of this first piece and in fact makes an interesting movie, or perhaps more and more talked about scenes. But damn if you thought the Talking Head was dense, the amazing lives of fast food gifters would cause you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, this whole comment is based on the experience of someone who is European. It's probably unnecessary for Japanese people, maybe it was a really fun movie lost in cultural boundaries and translation. Maybe.
