SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten minutes more, and, "extreme" shots) here in the UK back in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a cup when it allegedly inspired copcat the murder case. Wonderfully, the papers were captured in an ultraviolet film beneath the carpet to get into relatively harmless drinks, such as FROZEN SCREW and NIGHT OF THE DEMON, and the movie was finally forgotten. I jumped on the opportunity to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie lasting with my jaws on the floor. Is not it as politically wrong, as totally demented, a triple X on Michael WINHER'S DEATH WISH (made a title of that kind far in terms of inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some really ugly violence throwing into a bubble cooking mix of the seventies. If you do not consider suicide, it can force you to think again. Until SEX WISH ends, you'll want to clean your eyeballs with a clean disinfectant and take a long hot shower to clean up. If a movie truly deserves "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie" tag-line, this is it. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or lowlights) - a violent victim using a vibrator in a victim as she overcame her, Harry Reems's biting mustache, a helpless young black couple who is forced to strike against a sword killer (they would have won the Oscars for their full credible performances if the academy went mad) before a man is castrated because of his difficulties and some jarringly oblique direction that threatens to raise control of their apparent grindhouse origin. Do not say I warned you. If you think the world is an innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will show you very, very badly.
