This one probably does not fit into the bottom of the barrel of average Slasher films, but it's really a damn bad movie. The holiday remodeling was interesting, but after the first scenes, the film shows that it is a poor production value and a stupid conspiracy. I think the sub-genre was at this time an invisible maniac who knocked the teenager for no apparent reason, but he took it too far. In events there is absolutely no coherence or anything else you should add. <br /> <br /> The clich√© are more than boring, the gore is minimal, as well as the secrets. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty bad thing that should not be transformed, even if it has a video. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed with this overstated piece of waste.
