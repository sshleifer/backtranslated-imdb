I've seen this movie for the first time and never heard of it, probably because of the bad news. <br /> <br /> First, the direction itself is pretty good, the actors played well and CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is wonderful. But it does not make a movie in itself. No story, no news for beautifully exploited talents. Or, I have to remember that the art of the director is not only your vision but also how to tell the story. And that's what's missing for 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is for a simple 4 ratings.
