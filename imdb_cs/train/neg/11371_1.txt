"Documentary," and we use this term freely, summarizes that Muslims are trying to take the world violently. Then he says that every Muslim who does not admit it is either unconscious of his own faith or lies on his face! Also, every person who was in the interview movie found the market for his ridiculous acceptance of reality by selling a claptrap to conservatives willing to let others think about them. What West needs to know is nothing more than propaganda focused on mental matters. If you are looking for a real documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I'm looking elsewhere. Try something that provides more insights from qualified sources.
