I think this movie should be shocking. But the only way it really is shocking is how bad it was shocking ... and it's just. It's one and a half hours of torture. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (five girls). <br /> <br /> Certainly the main heroes will get their bloody piece in the wrong way, which is basically fine because it's a horror movie. And I (usually) like horror films. I have no problem with violence in these types of films in my own right. However, all the violence in this film has no end. It is no other spectacle than it is simply grotesque. It's so fragile that it's even bored and really fast. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the above was not bad for you) is that they tried to copy Blair whitch Project, shooting with cheap handheld cameras. But (again it too) has no end. In "Blair Which", of course, there is an explanation, and that is their camera that is looking for blair witches. There is no other explanation in this movie than: "Hey, we want it to look like Blair Whitch!" The sound in the movie is also something to get into depression. The girls yell so hysterically that many times you can not find out what they are saying. Also, no effort has been made to improve anything, sound or other wise. Finally, there is a soundtrack that is just as bad as the rest, and it differs from a cheap Euro-house to the worst hard-rock grunge ... <br /> <br /> I have to advise: Do not look at it under any circumstances.
