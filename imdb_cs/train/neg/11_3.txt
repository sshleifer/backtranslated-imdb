If you look at information about Corey Large here on IMDb, it is probably in the film "Reload" (since June '08), in which a character named Sebastian Cole plays. how does such a filthy movie ever pay to continue ... and second, was not Sebastian killed at the end of "Loaded"? I was looking at it in the morning when I was fighting insomnia, and so I floated and stood up when it was. I'm sure I missed some points but overall it looked really weak. The great performance was (for me) one of the most powerful parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised when all the people commented on beautiful girls because I thought the actress who plays Brooke was pretty but not exceptional.
