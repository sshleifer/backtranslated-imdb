While watching this movie, I tried to find out why it bothered me. Although the film's main film is potentially good, there are all kinds of unrelated / unnecessary subplots. Marketing people in Hollywood had to dictate multiple villains, constant double crosses, and men and women who got too close and had sex. It is strange that we see that more of them have sex than we of the president and his mistress. Many drawings and subplots cause the movie to be too wide, and none of the characters are properly developed - I really did not feel like I knew any character, except that everyone was spoiled and evil. The end is totally incomplete - he left me more than just wanted what could be, but what was to be. Finally, there is no explanation as to why someone is doing what they are doing except to serve as other corrupt characters who commit a double cross. I am surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie. It seemed like a movie from college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time if you're in the movie and you want an example of what you do not have to do when filming a movie.
