It was a loss of 75 minutes of my life. It was horror and the conspiracy was ridiculous. It revolves around an evil lesbian who has sex with grown-up married men and then blackmails them for money. One victim is a DA candidate, causing problems with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, who also married, and an evil lesbian, also bring a woman out of this woman! Meanwhile, a girlfriend of an evil lesbian does not really like to sleep. It ends with a happy end, where everything is forgiven. Women are also naked, mostly in situations that extend reality. bad bad.
