I came to this film with high expectations. I was aware of the work of Greenaway and "The Tempest" and I was interested in the adaptation. First I wanted to turn off after ten minutes but felt it would be unfair. It was a storm, but where do you think you imagined a little boy who was staring at the toy? It's symbolic, is not it? I went on for another ten minutes when I turned my finger off the button, somewhat interested in my interest. It's not Shakespeare, it's not a cinema. It's time and a place for it, but I do not waste time and it's not a place to study my Shakespeare. After twenty-five minutes I gave up and it was over. After that, I read all the comments on this website and the doubts of the film are just those who accused him. "It's a painting ... and then put it in the gallery," "it's ballet ... keep it on stage." Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and games have been massively published and accessible, and this version helps put a wedge between Shakespeare and the broader population - and I do not think Bard would be happy with it.
