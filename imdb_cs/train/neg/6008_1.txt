If you've made a mistake seeing the movie before reading the book, do not give up on the series. I bought my first book in May this year and I'm almost done with Book 10. I'm trying to say that the film is a piece of waste that does not even make a justification of the series. While "Left Behind: the movie" just vaguely follows the story of "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are not exactly accurate. <br /> <br /> A few examples: Rayford never gets his feelings for Hattie (he is about to be informed about disappearing); Buck Williams is a blonde, a journalist, not a television reporter; Chloe is in Stanford and many books of detail Rayford wondered if she "survived"; Buck and Chloe will not be able to meet later in the meeting in New York founded by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book," but rather in Rayford's memories; the paths are so jam-packed wrecks after the rapture that Rayford and Hattie have the helicopter back in the suburbs ... etc, etc., etc. ... And that's just from the first movie; they are about to release the third one. Please, even if you do not like movies, give a series of books a chance.
