Usually, a movie with Sylvester Stallon usually sucks. Rambo: The first part of Blood II was no exception. The only films that Sylvester Stallone had in what was good were Rocky and First Blood. This film is extremely unrealistic and boring. It has actions, but not very good action. I did not like to watch it and I would never have met it. No wonder why she won the Razzie Award for the worst image. I give it 3/10, the only reason he got 3 was because he had a somewhat good action, but he was not good enough.
