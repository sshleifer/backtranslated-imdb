I remember loved this show when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the best I could see. It was a great techno. It could bounce off enemy fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and take away almost anything. Now I come back and look at him and I am surprised how this show is really bad. Cast members are hardly convincing, there are many cheese moments, and battle scenes are incredibly fake. And almost every end has the same chopper helicopter with obvious repeated use of a grain image of low quality stock. Many records appear at the time of the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has essentially the same theme as the Knight Rider, except that the choice for crimes is to choose a helicopter instead of a car. After watching several episodes, he found himself totally bored. But I like thematic music.
