This is the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It barely made sense. It was not frightening at all (if you do not get scared like a loud sound and scream?), Sarah-Michelle Gellar must stop with these frightful movies. I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits unfolded. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst movies ever made, it's as good as it will: <br /> <br /> 1. Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The reason why I made Silent Hill third is that some scary scenes appeared, but the rest was absolute cr4p. As with the crash, it did not make sense, but the return leaned the list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever
