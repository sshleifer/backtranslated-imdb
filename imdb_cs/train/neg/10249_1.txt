What can I say about this movie other than "you do not see it". I waited and I waited and WAITED for something to happen (and whatever) and it simply did not work. Watch amazing how two people walk around and set the record for most screen fills in one movie. What they do? Will solve the mystery? Are traces collected? Maybe it's hard to say. At the end of the film, after the decoding of many radio signals (unreadable on a PET monitor) and this guy delivers some lectures, the plot is eventually revealed and thrown out as quickly as possible. Some foreigners want to return to their homeland utopia and are so happy they want to blow the land (I do not think they like to share wealth). I think they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art (garbage!) And they decided to let the editing crew turn into a 88-minute feature film. Watch at your own risk, it's not funny, because it's so bad, it's just bad.
