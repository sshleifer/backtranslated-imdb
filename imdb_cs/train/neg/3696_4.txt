Under normal circumstances, I would make this film 6. This is a very important topic and it does quite well - despite Katie Wright, which is a success in itself. I have no idea if she was really instructed to play that character or she was naturally irritating, but she did a terrific job of making Lexi care for me. There is no other dimension than confused, powerless and insignificant, and how good it is to whimper. I understand how a young girl accused of losing her friend and whose eating disorder slipped out of control would be upset, frightened, and painful. However, the whole performance of Wright is based on constant lamentation and adoration, the rest is wailing. I could not help but feel that this problem of the girl was not caused by the demon that is Bulimia but by not having the spine. I very much doubt that that's why he's supposed to do the movie.
