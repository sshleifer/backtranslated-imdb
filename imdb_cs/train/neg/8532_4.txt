Composer Robert Taylor (like Terry) is "dizzy, slap-happy" and does not see directly through another secular Norma Shearer (like Consuelo). "The sun shines even when it's raining," explains Mr. Taylor. But Mr. Taylor gets a bang in his throat whenever he gets to Mrs. Shearer. Finally, at Shearer Tea Room in Palm Beach, Taylor reports, "I love you!" Shearer rejects him because she is engaged to George Sanders (like Tony). However, to settle the game debt, Shearer hires Taylor to pose as "her cardboard lover" to make Mr. Sanders jealous. The title of this film invites an obvious and appropriate three-word review: "I Cartoon Film". It's the most remarkable, like the latest film appearance for Shearer, one of the greatest stars of the world in 1924, "The Who Gets Slapped" (1924, starring Consuelo) on "The Women" (1939). To be fair, it was likely that the film Shearer MGM believed the audience wanted to look. Taylor and Shearer were better off in "The Escape" (1940). If Shearer went on, she might become a better actress than a "lady"; she obviously did not care anymore and definitely did not need the money. Taylor has a great scene and recits Christina Rossetti's "When I'm Dead, my dearest" and at the same time threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, following George Cukor's instructions. **** Her Cardboard Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
