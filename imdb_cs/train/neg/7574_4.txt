But it has some good action and a conspiracy that is a little interesting. Nevsky behaves like a body builder and is not as attractive as the IMO is really UGLY. (his acting skills lack everything!) Sascha plays Joanna Pacula very well but needed more rows than she was given, her character needed to develop. There are too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much work and too stupid ending. It is very violent. But I liked scenery, this movie takes you around the world and that's a bonus. She also liked having something about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to grab attention. The actors had to be more beautiful ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was too normal, not quite sexy. I think that for most of the boys Sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies who are fans of the action, it just does not cut Nevsky. Overall, this movie was fine, I did not like to hate him, I just found out that it was another normal action move.
