Judy Holliday hit gold in 1950 with a film version of George Cukor, "Born yesterday," and since then her career has been in trying to find enough good material to allow her to hit gold again. <br /> <br /> It has never happened. In "It Should Become" (Holaniday still does not think of any miserable title), he makes another option for a blonde blonde who may not be so stupid, but all about this film feels warm and half heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe is his first film role, can not get enough energy to revive this recycled comedy. Audiences know how the film will end from the beginning, so most of the time it just sits around waiting for the movie to get. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're enchanted by Holliday, otherwise I would not bother. <br /> <br /> Grade: C
