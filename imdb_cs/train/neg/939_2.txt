I loved the television series Batman and I really look forward to it. But they tried to do so much. Why they had a story about Adam West and Burt Ward, who was trying to recover from the batmobile, he was behind me. I do not want to knock Burt or Adam on what they look like ... It was 35 years since they appeared at Batman and Robin, but they saw them dressed in suits and fighting the "bad" was kind of sad. I'd rather see former stars with commentary. Batman's story was stupid. As far as flashbacks are concerned, I think it was too short and too much. It was just a brief overview in my opinion. I would like more background. They showed Penguin and Joker for about one minute just to tell the same things I already knew. Joker had a mustache under the make-up, and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated him and was a former smoker. It was on the 2nd. <br /> <br /> I would like to read a book. I'm sure it has more that it turned out. Just as why were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut etc. The list goes on. Just as I said, even those who were in this were hardly in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really thin.
