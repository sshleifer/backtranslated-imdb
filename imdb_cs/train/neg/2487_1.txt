Take "Rambo," mix in some "Miami Vice," divide a budget of about 80%, and you have something to come up with a couple of ten-year-old boys if they have a large yard and too much access to the Penthouse. Policeman and former Commander McBain (Busey and McBain, you know he's as frantic as they) are recruited to get an American supertank that was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Capture with the tank was hard Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and McBain's former love Devon (Fluegel), commanding officer and now meat for spoiled terrorists / spies / drug dealers who do not have a sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For a action-packed sex movie is a lack of action and not too much sex. The running joke lies in the fact that McBain is still shot and survived, holding the balls as souvenirs. Apparently, the writers did not see "The Magnificent Seven", nor did he think he would give McBain even a pretentious intelligence. Even for a budget shareholder, production values ​​are poor, distant images during dialogue and very little movement. The main tank, the tank, is stupid enough to produce Ed Wood. Fluegel, who might have been blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much larger role in "The Story of Crime than Julia!") She must have been desperately afraid to kick and recover again. Jones, who was in an amazing series of movies, pretty hits down below. Both and Busey were probably just for some money and a few laughs. See the talented and future acting actor Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotyped, threatening bit. It's too boring for vain pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still quite noisy when playing when you leave your house, but you want people to think someone is home.
