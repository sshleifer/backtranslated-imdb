They saw it yesterday at the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before I came, I saw how it was rated and at that time it was 7.4, pretty nice speed ... After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did) but it felt embarrassed when he was the filmmaker in the screening. <br /> <br /> I do not like it at all, the dialogues are shallow and do not go anywhere, the characters are shallower than the dialogues, nothing to go anywhere and the worst and the worst: a lot of commercials for Siemens and Organics. Despite the fact that I have already paid to go to the film and have fun, I still have to be bombed by the main character chatting on the internet and Siemens's cell phone still appears on her lap; or another person who has a stove or cuts his hair just to make Organics shampoo look great on the screen! Everything would be tolerable if the conspiracy, characters, romance, something was good, but it was bad, really bad! "I do not know how to do" sex in town. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money.
