About the time they released this movie on DVD. I know some say that WB is rushing to release this movie due to The Dreamgirls. But how can you hurry after the release of the movie that has been in your catalog since 1976. I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special features, no 5.1 DD sound. come to the WB, you can do it much better. The sound and picture quality of this movie needs some serious help. It seems that WB did not spend so much time and attention on this movie because it's a black film and I have good sales. They could keep CDs, which by the way do not contain all the songs that have the original CD. <br /> <br /> I recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB must go to add additional special features. Take notes from other group movies, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, if you could only see performance, and the sound on both is much, much, much better than this DVD.
