Schizophrenic escaped from a psychiatric hospital in NYC and early teachers began to receive St. Louis. Trinity University. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with a mess of red herring. Despite the 78-minute run, this left slasher goes on and on until it arrives where the person you think is a escape killer. Director Richard Haines barely breaks the pot with a lame stalk-n-slash, but brings the enormous beginning of the early-1980s publications likely to be a desire. All of our amateur anthropologists were filmed in New Yawk in the early 1980s to see the whole culture, beliefs and practices of living people from this remote location. The film has some merit in releasing the "Final Girl". You rarely see it. It is also always nice to see a horror movie where the killer is a killer. Do not you believe in the spiritual, beloved film industry? Fortunately, this is just a false priest and he is captured. Still working on the moral high angle of the terrain.
