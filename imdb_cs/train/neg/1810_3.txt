Think about this movie as a live-action program on Saturday morning. Even small turtles find it hard to please because they run like molasses! I can not quite understand how terribly horrible it is to do something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the cosmetics department! Too many movies with warrior-witches have used the same old fence many times, but it's a huge amount when he contemplates his appeal to little pets. And who would have the topless mermaid climb in the world first? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here is another fine gem for TV season 1999!
