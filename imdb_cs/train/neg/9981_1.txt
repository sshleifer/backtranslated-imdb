This movie was billed as comedy and mystery. That's wrong with both. The only secret is why someone would shoot such a badly built film. The only comedy is the laughter I got when I found out how high the readers rank. Could there be two movies with the same name? The movie I saw played a girl with nice blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /> <br />
