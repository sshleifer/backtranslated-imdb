I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to make a bad movie. It's not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent. <br /> <br /> I'm LAZY. Usually I see a bad movie and a curse. It was so bad, I really made a review to try to save others from the totally boring mess that I was the victim of. <br /> <br /> I smash a copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's too disgusting, even if it uses a clean room. So boring. Watch 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for absolute bulls that have some merit as entertainment. This sludge looks terrible, it's terrible, and whoever does it should feel terrible.
