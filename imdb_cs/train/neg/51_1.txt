this film was a great disappointment. the level of inexorable cruelty and violence in this film was very worrying. some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and dirty. the main characters could not be identified or even sympathetic. the main character of the protagonist was as slim as they came. the hospital / greenhouse atmosphere has lent itself to above-average theaters. the film did not know about the Spanish Civil War. Fortunately, I was in Spain and I realized it was not realistic! In addition, the use of love of the same sex as "horror" was also very insulting and ill-treated, while the DVD is packed and advertised to attract gay viewers. actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if trying to break away from this mess. I think that if you want to watch the children brutally killed, you could especially appeal to this film.
