I lay on the bed with a really bad flu or flu or anything. I think I could kill some of the horror movies some mommy bought my mom ago. I wish I never chose this movie! After watching, I felt even worse and wanted to avoid. Afterwords (when I naturally felt better) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that Dennis in the movie is nothing like the right one. I hope this movie will never shoot, but if they have not ever, or you will feel the way I felt when I first watched it. I think you'd better watch The Santa Claus 3. At least the movie had better reviews on this site.
