With this line begins a silly, boring British scifi movie. Big Vorelli from Devil Doll builds a teleportation machine just to separate Blanchard, a bearded man who has a tattoo thing and a man with large eyebrows. When his experiment fails, a good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for several days. She tries to project into the Blanchard House with the help of his handsome lab assistant, Sheila. Needless to say, something went wrong and he seems like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to a good orange hairy doctor who walks around shocking people in London with his mutated hand and wears diapers on his face. There are several other murders, some modest paper work, and eventually the doctor disappears where some doctors have met. Fortunately, no one has decided to continue.
