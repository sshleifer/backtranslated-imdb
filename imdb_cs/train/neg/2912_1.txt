"Meatball Machine" must be one of the most complex, funny, terrible and exaggerated sci-fi horror I've ever encountered. It's about good against evil and the story of the next ages in order to entertain with a bloody, cunning and humorous context. For this reason, violence is not particularly horrible and does not cause you to flip, but free bloodshed and nudity run freely. The performance of Isaiah Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst I've seen, if that's not enough, it's also ruled by an unheard-of director Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has everything, it's bad bones! It must be seen for every b-movie freak! ... Simply: a joyous and precious gem.
