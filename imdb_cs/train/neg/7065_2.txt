OK and I found this movie in my dad an old pile of movies and it looked pretty good out of the cover but the film really soaked! OK the first story with the swimmer was pretty good, but it took a while before he got in, then the boy was slowed down! That was not frightening! His dream sounds like a little bedtime story. Then the girl's news was completely slow. I'm sure someone will call a journalist and ask him to go with you. But this ended up fine where she was stabbing and she was in the hospital and she saw him at t.v and he said, Another was the nice gay story about the guy who brought the dead people. OMG is so stupid I'm not going to say that anymore. The last one was the best. It was not frightening, but the thought of the story was pretty pretty .. yeah, the girl is obsessed and kills all my classmates or something. Then, when they are all told, they communicate their dreams, they fall into the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people of their dreams on the bus (Ha). End.
