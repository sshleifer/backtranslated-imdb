A stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par (the smallest) dialogue affects this television production that could hardly be interesting even with a billion dollar production budget. Characters are not credible, in their motivations, activities or occupations. The plot reads as bad Dungeons and Dragons (TM) hack, but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are serious problems with continuity and the degree of meaningless interaction between characters is at least a victory for this author. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as a plague. Watch each Dark Angel episode and get better acting, dialogue, and plot. Fuj.
