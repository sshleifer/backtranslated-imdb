What a terrible movie! The idea of ​​robots struggling with each other is fine, but the plot is ridiculous, real human intentional laughter, nonexistence and special effects (on which this type of film must depend) are archaic. I thought it had to be done around 80.-84. years and was stunned when he saw that it had been since 1990. It's 5 years after strangers! Okay, a lot of people said it was good because of the low budget, but I think "what's the point?" it looks absolutely unbelievable. I would not want to see a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story, because I still like the idea that the huge robots are pushing away bullshit.
