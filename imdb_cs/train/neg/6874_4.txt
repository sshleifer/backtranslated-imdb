Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) introduced and interpreted this strange film, which is the second installment of a trilogy. Maybe I'm wrong, but I do not think this movie is part of the Dogma '95, though it really does. I do not know what you think about this movie. All actors are good. They bring quite good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somewhat interesting. But I do not know, it's about a movie I do not like. Sexual scenes are too long. Based on an interesting piece of art in an erotic piece of crap, I do not know exactly where it stands. Sure, it's not a bad movie, but I'm not suggesting people seeing it, or telling them not to watch. Just do as you like. If you feel curious and have an open mind, try to try.
