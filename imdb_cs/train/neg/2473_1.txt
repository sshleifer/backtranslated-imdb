if my grandmother shot movies, they would probably make a much better figure than this ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, dad and son) are all right. In particular, her mother is a pretty actress, and the baby also appears to be pretty, especially on scenes where she is supposed to be frightening. However, the director knows the meaning of the words "Plot Point", "Triller" and "Good Script". the script has no evolving atmosphere that would become a thrilling thing. If you want to be persecuted by the trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise stay at home and sleep. oh ... Actually, it was funny: the movie is from 2001 but we could not realize it because the picture is as bad as the mini-dv and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80).
