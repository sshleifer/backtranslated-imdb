Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for an amazing horror film directed at addicts. What I got was a bullshit with a focus on drug addicts. I wonder if there is another movie called "Stoves" that these people will review? There are only 3 main characters and none of them have done me as well written or well. Basically, the whole movie I just spent shook my head and looked at the stupidity of these drug addicts. Make a favor. Do not write this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or some other decent horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are more terrifying and more convincing than anything you find in "Cookies".
