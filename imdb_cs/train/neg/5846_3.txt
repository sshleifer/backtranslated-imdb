Yes, this is one of the movies, so terrible, so stupid, so trite that you can not laugh. I watched comedy, good comedy and I laughed less than my wife and I laughed in this movie. Other comments give this idea well enough. Those characters are so uncomfortable that you're going to spit on rats, the effects are so badly done that you think that their basic art class is in charge of acting - about acting - talking about tired dialogue and embarrassing breaks. <br /> <But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why did not we see the rat until the end that surprised me. Often "big" is not displayed until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew so much money. I suppose however, in this case, the big rat was hidden until the end, because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best thing they had was the guy running around him, dressed as a wooden trunk with third world dentistry. <br /> <br /> The lightest part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After finding out that the rats can not become heavy noise (migraines from bad acting?), The Main Dude outbreaks a fire alarm to send rats to madness. If you ever wanted to see a few wart rats, while out of their heads they bleed like a geyser, this movie is for you. You really need to rent it and you will see it yourself. <br /> <br /> But not at more than 99 Â¢, OK?
