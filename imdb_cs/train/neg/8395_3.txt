- The film crew shoots a horror film in an old, allegedly cursed house where seven people have mysteriously died in the last seven years. One crew member finds an old book of spells and seems to be perfect for use in some ritual scenes in his movie. It is justified that the spells in the book are better written than the script they use. But as the book is read, the cemetery is suddenly revived. Now cast and crew are facing real dangers. <br /> <br /> - IMDb shows the course of 90 minutes. In the first 60 minutes nothing will happen. She spends too much time on the movie. Are we afraid of a horror film that shoots? We already know that their film is not "real". These fears just do not work. <br /> <br /> - There are very few things you can enjoy in the House of Seven Bodies. The effect is unfortunate. Most of these "actors" would have difficulty preparing for elementary school. The score is terrible. It is a very reminiscent of the 70's television series and does not provide the atmosphere. When we talk about the atmosphere, at the end of the movie for a few moments, we do not speak. Character logic is completely non-existent. Even in the movie, you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here I do not think I remember one scene where the character did not choose the most illogical path they have at their disposal. And finally, there's the first 60 minutes of the movie I've mentioned. Can you call BORING? <br /> <br /> - I did not evaluate the House of the Seven Corpses, as the case (when the movie is probably happening) really works. My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The opening title sequence is the death of the seven previous owners and may be the pinnacle of the movie. And the final scenes on the massive staircase, as zombies threaten the film crew, are somewhat effective (which is ringing). Overall, however, these moments are not enough to make it a good movie.
