I just realized that by watching this movie I lost valuable precious moments in my life that I would never come back. The film is not just bad. It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom I've ever done. I'm sorry to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia counts with her race, it seems that "white" people do not like it because she does not have white actors. Mate, I guess you'll find a reason why no one liked it, because watching the paint is much more fun and fun than that pile of grooms.
