First I'd like to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other films, but this movie is just like my summary. The biggest bag of crap at all. In the beginning, Chris Rock is an ambitious comedian who is called Apollo in a theater building. On his way home from a concert, while riding a bike, he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck. A moment later he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. He then dresses as an Outkast musical band while trying to overturn the scene from the original where he plays as a jockey. Secondly, he returns to Apollo and tries to be a comedian he has tried in his previous body, and begins to drive the white population and tries to be black. Are you getting my drift? This movie is terrible, trying too hard to be the original and looks like a bag of crap during the process. Just take your advice, you do not even have to watch this movie.
