That's what I found out from time to time in the remarkably awkward 3rd edition of this apologetic justification for the film. First of all, computer effects are totally awful! Those computer spells really deserve the heels on their backs. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters are realistically out of the way, especially in the above-mentioned, contempt for the 3rd Law (I promise not to let it go, but believe me, it is not worth keeping secrets!). A lot of laughter in the movie came inadvertently as if trying to explain that the lids of the invisible man did not work. Get more credits for viewers than this one! <br /> <br /> Some sexual aspects of the movie were interesting. What would you do if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These questions were dealt with much more intelligently in The Classical The Invisible Man of 1933. There is one scene of violence that is so incredibly ambiguous and not mentioned later. If more attention was paid, the crazy Kevin bacon scientist might have a little more sense. <br /> <br /> The film would be much more successful as porn, as this could actually happen in a unique and interesting way. But this job ... go see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
