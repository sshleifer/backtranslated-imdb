1. who was watching 11/07/2004 - 1 of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of 70 supposed horror movies as Friday, 13th (version 1 through anything?). Can not I think of so much redemption except (or can I think of something?)? The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people who listen to the radio program a year after some children were killed in the woods as a "tribute" to it, allegedly. But, behold, one of those stupid people has a connection with a real event because her sister was one of those who were murdered (again, how stupid it is that it would even be part of). Guess what? The killer is on it again, and we are reluctant to say who he is (so it's any secret). And besides where "cops" are and why they are not told. I can not believe that this film was funded by someone and made. You should think that the American people would now be considered a bit taller, at least in their film experience, but not as a filmmaker.
