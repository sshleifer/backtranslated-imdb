This is one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen, because it's a terrible God, John Carradine has a very limited time on the screen. All the characters are boring and the story is terrible, and I also saw how two twists and turns are passing by! A great environment and a creepy house would definitely help if it were not so damn boring, and neither character has roots, and I hope it does so to bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally appears, it's a pretty good scene, but it's too late and the only time he had on the screen was in flashbacks and the only really horrible scene in the movie is when his face gets messed up by Bee because it was somewhat cruel. I got it in the Horror DVD called Back From the Grave and they all really surprise in my opinion, and it's lucky it was included in the set that I bought otherwise that I would chucked out the window! This is one of the most important horror films I've ever seen, because it's a terrible God, John Carradine has a very limited time on the screen, and I say I avoid him like a blow !, You do not want to go through torture. Direction is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson does absolutely terrible! work on the ground, so every thing looks cheap, loses its potential in creating a ghostly atmosphere and just keeps the movie incredibly boring. The act is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but other than that he is in a movie other than a flash scene. (Carradine ruled !!). Merry Anders does take on Laura, because she did not convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is all right, and somewhat spooky, but too exaggerated, but at the end she had a creepy smile. The rest of the cast did not pay enough attention because I had plenty of trouble to get through it, but they were all really bad. Overall, please avoid it, no matter what aggression! BOMB of 5
