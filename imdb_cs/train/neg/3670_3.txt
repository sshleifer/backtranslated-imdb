For the scientific fear of the film works well, it must either be genuine or very good retelling. This film is not one. Surely there is a pseudo-original procedure in that a guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease, but that is a very small procedure. There is a government conspiracy angle, a crusader protagonist who has personal experience ... And one real drawback of this film is that the contaminated person has no pathos. Although the character is written as a person who should be honest, it is not. Without regret, the film is useless. The other characters are such a cookie cutter that they are ridiculous. Subplots are complex and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the movie is too flat to even enjoy it as a fake material. Take a movie in 45 minutes for a short time and maybe you can watch it.
