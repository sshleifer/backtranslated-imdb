I can see why Robin Hood quickly ran. The first episode is probably the worst thing the BBC was broadcasting. The opening scenes were as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkey battles, Robin Hood had no character, and the fight of the sword was just ridiculous. The worst part of this episode was Robin Hood, who at the beginning of the episode hid a cow dressed in makeup - how many people wore eye line in the 12th century? Nobody. The series has since drastically improved, but this first episode has quickly put human hopes down and is basically a stack of cr * p. The great hero of England has been disgusted. <br /> <br /> "Will you tolerate it?" I will not, that's for sure if the BBC does not understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
