It's a bit true that most great reviews of the IMDb movie come from people who have reviewed only one movie in their entire IMDb career and yes, you've already realized that the movie is "Parasomnie". I have often suspected suspicious good reviews of IMDb for what turned out to be something other than good movies like underhand marketing, but in this case it looks quite transparent. This does not mean that Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well being good or great movie it has the potential to be. On the plus side, it has a great Baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job showing horrible and evil, I could easily see that he has what it takes to play a really unforgettable Baddie on the same level as Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful visuals in watching dreams, in fact, if the film decided to explore the terrain, it could be better. The actual concept of hypnosis abuse is also very large. Though I understand that the suspension of distrust is necessary for immersing yourself in some good story, it is a sign of a good story that you will succeed. . If you find yourself angry at what you think is illogical or just stupid, then the story is losing and that's what happened to this movie. Other reviewers mentioned it here and I do not want to get into the spoiler, but I say that setting in the end is especially absurd and disappointing, not too much to mention the different mental age of the character that is supposed to be a few years of life. Overall, there are bouts of great idea in diabolically abused hypnotism, but unfortunately this film does not realize anything special.
