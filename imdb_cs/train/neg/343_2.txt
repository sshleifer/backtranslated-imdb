Indeed, a really terrible Canadian-German co-production, the still beautiful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "troubled child" - a few hours before the "action" the child murdered her father and her mum fell for the offspring. She now moved to the Northwest US to start her life again, but her baby still has a problem with her mother. In fact, she did devote herself to killing someone who might be considered a threat to their bondage. Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (as a daughter) murders more than people - it adds such terrible performance that she also wipes the film, though a disjointed scenario, unnecessary direction and horrifying music (check out the saxophone for the first time when a bikini dressed point shows her) do not help; we should find her sexy and frightening, but she fails on both counts. Almost completely carefree and not even bad to be entertaining (not to mention that Arquette and Schaeffer really do not believe as a mother and daughter), all sympathy for Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both worships much more than this, and both Rosanna) are the only reason why anyone could sit in this farrago. One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not a three-hour "Love," Lies and Murder, "there is such a" fun ".
