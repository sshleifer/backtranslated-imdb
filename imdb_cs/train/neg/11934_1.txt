I was sitting through one episode of this series and it just could not last. It seemed like I was watching dozens of episodes, and then it hit me ..... There's nothing new! I heard the joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone falling for my friends, the Happy Days episode has almost the same story, etc. Not one of the actors is interesting either here! Some were good at other exhibitions (not here) and others were new to a profession they should never have entered. Avoid this arsonist!
