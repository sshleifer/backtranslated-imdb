There are just two movies I'd give 1/10, this arsonist and "The Man Who Fallen On Earth." I remember seeing a protocol at the theater in the early 1980s when I was in high school. The script is offensive to any intelligence (including a high school student). He completely lost me with a "hillarious" gag someone shot in the ass. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming, but it's like a blemish and sadness. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabic, followed by Goldie, who wins over all by exploding populist dribbling. The game was terrible, including Goldie Hawn. I could not stand to see another film she was in before she got redeemed in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you do if you do not try to write a script. Worst.
