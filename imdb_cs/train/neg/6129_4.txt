According to this film and THE STRONGLY CHILD, which took place in the same year, I would not make Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent comedians. There simply is not enough. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style, but sabotaged himself by making his first great achievements too serious. In any case, all his tricks are more funny men, but he lacks Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's immense inventiveness. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking as Chaplin is a trampled figure. His trademarks are childish innocence, a spooky approach, and a tendency to respond in disgust to the disaster by looking confused, meeting his eyes, or touching his stingy lips with his forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's films is the result of fates that throw away various obstacles on his journey that he tries to overcome in horrific or naive ways or with minimal physics, such as throwing rocks on the approaching tornado to drive him away, and leaning against the collapsed building two Four or dodging boulders by lifting their legs so that they are below it. In this story about a shoe's son who joins a cross-country pedigree to promote the shoes of a competing company, he will be lucky to win. There is nothing that the Big Three would be far better.
