No one would love this movie for their merits, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy movies with in-camera movies for your MST3 quality, then it's for you. It ranks there with "Road House" for its absurd characters, sets and story line. Bad writing really cracked: "I want you to emptied these boys" instead of "the boys' dust." F-14 takes off from the carrier, but when they get into the formation, they are F-16! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal returned to work for the general who had watched secret Seagal a few days ago. Segal exhausts the bullets and resorts to the knife to kill the guards. So naturally the guards are all knitting weapons and fighting with knives too! A hand grenade is a bagpipe, but it also explodes. The small fighter fighter can fly all the way from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then Segal will fly back to California - a long way, across Europe - even though there is a 20-year-long airline in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black computers, 2 flat-screen TVs and galley images and maps on the walls. What a horn!
