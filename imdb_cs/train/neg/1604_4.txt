Remember a movie that seemed to you to be enjoying the past in the past that does not quite match the same feelings as an adult? It happened to me when I returned to school ... National meeting of puppeteers. The film has the perfect laughing opportunity, but surprisingly it passes aimlessly when we see a bizarre collection of characters like a woman who sells the soul of a devil and can blow fire from the mouth, a man who looks like a vampire, and a crazy killer dressed as a woman wearing sacks overhead. You have a presidential class that believes that it is the best of the sliced ​​bread (but as we can see in the movie, it is a coward and joke), a few smokers who do not even know that they are in their class meeting and a person named Gary, that one even knew he existed (and no one can remember his name ... that's the one that I enjoyed). There is an opponent who likes to catch women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who, when called to her dog, screaming screaming and chefing (you know her from "goons" and "throwing mother out of the train") who loves to place food on human plates hands! The film is essentially a briefcase that is (or at least attempts) to avenge their classmates for the gag who took it (prepared him to sleep with his own twin sister!). The film watches characters as they look for a killer who portrays the dark, broken corridors of an old high school. The psychologist told them about their murders, which looks a little weird. The film has several good gags that work (to a great extent early), but the film is slowly getting worse every minute. The real problem with the film is that he really does not know where to go. The film is, to a great extent, a clear premise that he has an unsatisfied direction if he has any direction at all. Cast is so excited, but the material to make funny does not really have a good interest. It's a curiosity for fans of gorgeous comedies from the early 1980s who are forgotten (this is right so).
