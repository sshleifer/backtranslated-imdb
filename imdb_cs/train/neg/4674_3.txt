I do not know who is guilty, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance like Catherine is almost impossible to watch. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, is doing a great job - against everything about me. His character is absolutely charming and attractive. but it was certainly not so greedy to face Leigh's sinfulness. Chaplin seems to be confused with what can not be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but rather her orthopedic instability. There must be some element of credibility for his interest, but how he played is incomprehensible. They are not interested in performances. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, amazing despite all the efforts to derail them. Support for cast is also a pleasure to watch. And what a shame that the wires do not work together because production is beautiful to look at.
