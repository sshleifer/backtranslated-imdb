Indeed, everyone in this movie looks like they want to be somewhere else! No wonder casting is not done with the left hand, but rather not at all. I did not see anything worse than Natascha McElhone, who was acting as an agent and carrying a gun. In such a role you do not use a blurred look at the city. The only worse thing I can imagine is to take Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is just as awful, maybe with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you see him trying but suffering. Oh, did I mention that this is a really crazy story? Is it threatening the lives of many people because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German? 2/10 because the photo could be worse.
