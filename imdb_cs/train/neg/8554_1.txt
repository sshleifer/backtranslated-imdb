The film was most likely created in 1930 and released in 1931. I suppose the talking films had great obstacles in the transition from a quiet era. However, this particular Zane Gray conspiracy seems to be very weak. Also, Gary Cooper probably only learned to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable under today's standards. For 1931 maybe. It is not acceptable for 2004. Some of the actors got along well. It is sad that the Indians will always get a short end in these early westerlands. They lived on the ground before a white man came, but according to the twisted history they had no right to defend themselves.
