This movie filter sets a new standard for bad movie productions. Jared Rushton gives adequate performance to a very poorly crafted character in an unfortunate film, creating the pure effect of a very bad film. The main motive of the film is how a boy on a temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving an airplane crash will allow a dissatisfied teenager to cope with the desire to discover his mother's extramarital relationship. Unfortunately, it will become a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two especially hockey scenes involving a bear fight) and strange hallucinations that lift you up if this boy is not just sitting in the alley somewhere on the pot that dreams about this movie is a nightmare!). In addition, despite the marks of some reviewers of the film's family visibility, there are several scenes that are not suitable for very young children or family watching, including a dead scene pilot's scenario underwater with one of his eyes apparently erupting. > <br /> Overall, a terrible movie that no one should be exposed to, much less innocent children.
