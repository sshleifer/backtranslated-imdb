Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is the boss of the crowd, leaving the mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. How can the director be cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very beautiful), Gabriel Byrn, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and such a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not funny and has a constellation of cast. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ("Joy in killing you!") <br /> <br />
