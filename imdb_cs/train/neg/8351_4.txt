Even according to Monogram standards, this mystery (remake of Sfinches) has a oddball conspiracy that is not scattered to the big effect - you will see it after about ten minutes. Two scientists have some fun dialogue at the beginning, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring because the villain (the perfectly occupied Lionel Atwill has played a role) and Warwick Hymer's nitwit shtick is quite uncomfortable. However, it is considered that the incomparable Mantan Moreland appears as a five-minute appearance as Nicodemus, a porter who gets a better lawyer during an exciting session in the courtroom. You must pass it on to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not too much a director, but he would always fall into a routine programmer with some fucking vaudeville.
