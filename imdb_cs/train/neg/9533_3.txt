A textual prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house, but I think the more appropriate is the word "entropy". (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his office in San Francisco and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and child are in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on the door and ask for instructions. Well, it rains and shakes like two frozen kittens and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and what with one thing and the other, George calls them to come and take part in his pizza by the fire. All three of them finished in the George bath, and after five minutes the most undifferentiated nudes after the double exposure, the triple exposure, the quadruple exposure, and the dodecakuple exposure. They spent the night three times, and the next morning the girls prepared breakfast for him. But something hummed slightly, because Georgie's guests had all fingered their fingers and poured ketchup and syrup over clothes and - "You eat like ANIMALS!" George shouts and tells them to get out. In your dreams. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blonde with cobalt blue eyes and Colleen Camp jumps around like a superbal. You have to say there are powerful cute breeds in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they're also having serious bouts, because after the first five or ten minutes we can not help. /> <br /> But when the girls go berserk, they do the movie. The film is then bathed in bright green light. Pairs are giving up on malicious makeup and doing gargoyles in the mirror. They give the brain a boy and then drown him to make sure. They pull a storm and break windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table, licking food and then bouncing their bones. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? First of all, Georgie will make you unconscious with his thumb (which does not contain anything you can not find in that little red McIlheny Tabasco bottle of sauce in your kitchen cabinet), bet him, pour flour and milk on him, undergo a psychotic process, give him one of the half- type Tolstoy, dressed him, dressed in extraordinary costumes, then he and his practically destroyed house in the upper middle class received and were sent by a van of ex machina. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's like someone saying to Georgia: "First, give these girls polite accent and then panic when you're bound." And to the girls: "First of all, it's shy, it's not going to save anyone, then it's going crazy." And that's all. <br /> <br /> Photography and work on the spot are directly from the 70's porn video. I'm not sure that this suggests an absolute lack of skills. It requires effort and talent to make San Francisco ugly. Score gives us two Leitmotives. Georgie is some pop melody with lyrics about "being free" and "giving in." Jackson and Donna's are catchy things called "My Good Old Dad". <br /> <br /> However, I approve the moral lesson behind the story. Some things you should not give up, although they would seem like a lot of fun at first. All very well educated.
