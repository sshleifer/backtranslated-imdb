This is definitely one of over 70 movies and it is most remarkable that he kicks a 10-year-old Bigfoot hyster. It is also remarkable for the little touches of madness in the whole movie, especially when the dark, moody first half is replaced by MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user has pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to the character, Travis Crabtree, who falls for a moment on a canoe, then ... leaves, never seen). Although it's painfully dated, it's still a funny scary movie that turned out to children, and anyone who likes either Bigfoot tradition or 70 hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of it. My favorite part: man is so afraid he will jump his head through the door (!?) And the narrator explains that he went unconscious of "shock". Uh, I'd say I broke the door with my head, it's more likely why she got unconscious, but anything. 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you love bad America.
