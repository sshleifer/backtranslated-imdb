Wow, I'm a huge fan of Henry VIII / Tudor era and it was interesting. The only one I looked at was Katherine Aragon. A wow ... just wow. I have seen bad acting before, but it has reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine wept? yelling and screaming and I have to admit that I have overturned many times ... many, many times ... fun, fun things. The only person who even showed a slight talent was an actress who plays Anne Boleyn (maybe I would have some prejudices, I have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was really face to face, she read it, it's worth it! ) I also read a lot about Tudor's time period and I think the characters were not very accurately displayed, they were all very stereotypical. You can see this film only if you are ready to see a very important time, and the important lives of those who have taken part in it have changed their laughter.
