1st Place 8/3/2003 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about meat-eating zombies in 3 stories in Chronicle Movie. And yes, we see the zombies that eat the human body in 3D! Wow, no! It happens again and again in 2D in a zombie movie, but what usually makes the zombie movie better is a basic story, not real meat-eating. This is what made the original classic zombies good. Meat-food was just like extra. In most of these three-part chronics, we were actually bored due to the poor and slightly distinct and deliciously revealed final. The last story is actually the story that started the film (with a reporter who explored the so-called Ghost Town), and of course we also see that zombies are also eating in this person. I think I said enough. Check out the classic, not the 3D festivity.
