I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a small child. I went down really early in the morning, started watching HBO and The Raft (Segment 2) terrified me well. This time I was still enjoying The Raft, though I did not know if it was for nostalgic reasons or when it was really good. The other two segments were complete garbage. I can not believe the producer who paid somewhere for it to happen. All I was watching was to destroy another child's memory. Creepshow 2 now becomes Radem among my list of classified children's classics. 4/10
