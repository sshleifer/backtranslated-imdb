Meteoral hit is the crater lake (hence our title), the awakening of Plesiosaur, which continues with refreshment on the hick population (in California, this hick capital of the world.) There are bad movies, and then there is the "Monster Lake Crater" which managed to escape from MST3K. Featuring acting acting, a decent stop-motion beast and more, this is a terrible piece of 1970s with a low budget of exploitation / monster movie punch. While the film is guilty of many crimes, the greatest is Arnie and Mitch, two unpleasant wrinkles that serve us as a comic relief. They wander around, struggling to stock up a "banjo of music," a ugly woman, and behave like humiliating apologies to humanity. Characters are so bad, they should be considered a crime against humanity.
