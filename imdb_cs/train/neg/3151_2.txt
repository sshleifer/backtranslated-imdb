"It must have been you" is another sign that Hollywood is filled with ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer. When Charlie's fiance goes out of town, he gets stuck with all his wedding plans. She spends a week in a luxury hotel and meets Anne Penn's teacher, who also happens to marry. The two will quickly become friends and decide to plan their weddings together. That's when bore, Charlie falls in love with Anna and has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie removes any romantic comedy he has ever done and just waiting for the end of the movie to do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give a truly average performance that only makes the film even more so.
