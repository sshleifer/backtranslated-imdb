The attacking timeless action adventure FIRST BLOOD PART II seemed to have attracted the mood of the US at the time of its release in the mid-eighties, right-wing Reaganism and murderous anti-red feelings that have not yet been completed, although the emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of "Evil Empire" in Moscow would soon make these types of movies superfluous, even Reagan himself finally admitted this truism. In this sense, we can be most grateful to the "Gorby", not to our disarmament treaties with the United States, nor to the policy of "glasnost" or even to its support for democracy, which is restored to East European countries in the garden of the former Soviet Union. the destruction of the stupid, jingoistic, inflated adventures of this Cold War. The first RAMBO movie was barely perfect, although it was at least a slightly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad story. In this sequel, any sense of the farthest conviction is immediately expelled for a stupid, sensual esp rendering and an incident in which Rambo unilaterally accepts dozens of mercilessly stereotypical Vietnamese and Russian troops to save the American prisoner ten years after the conflict, with the Americans on the lossy side . Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge success in boxing was to let many Americans get into fantasy, maybe the war lost but still unfinished business and absurd comic heroes with a hero like a robot killing virtually every red on the lookout with the most comprehensive hardware possible, has fulfilled such fabulous ideals. <br /> <br /> It could have been fun at the SUPERMAN / SPIDERMAN level, but sadly everything is totally equal. But that's not to say there's no humor in the movie, unfortunately it's practically any unintentional kind. The action scenes, although technically reasonable, have never brought a bit of conviction or persuasiveness because they are always placed in the most beautiful. It's incredible contexts, that our hero Rambo is always intact (except for some cuts and bruises here and there) despite tons of explosives, grenades , shots etc. around you. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , as little to say in comprehensible English, and only stands out with crazy carrots, almost as if he invented his own patois brand that is understandable to himself. Perhaps his colleague Cameron once again thought of The Terminator, the lead figure! In this sense, Rambo seems to be even less human than the Terminator! The rest of the cast gets a little better with good actors such as Charles Napier and Richard Crenna, who are doing their admirably the best of the interviews they have given them, and Steven Berkoff has furiously accompanied by other Russian KGB / Red Army parents. Berkoff's over-gaming is slightly pleasant, but not remotely threatening. How come Sly managed to survive Berkoff's electric shock to kill even those redundant Red Commie? But credibility is never a strong point of this film. It's a fantastic piece comparable to THE WIZARD OF OZ. At least it was supposed to be fantasy and the immortal classic turned out to be. It's just the most powerful and really insulting, kind of classic. And as for Sly's supreme speech ... rather hypocritical after the defeat of all these people, right? By the way, in the same year, he also made ROCKY IV .......... <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: 3 of 10.
