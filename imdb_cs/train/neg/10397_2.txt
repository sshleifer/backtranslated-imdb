Just not the quality I expected from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very similar to a not so bad student film. As far as I'm concerned, in all of this, why did you get BAFTA ??? Morris, in much of her work (Nathan Barley), talks about "rooted mediocrity" (Ayn Rand), yet with this work urinates a gentle back of talented and tells us it's raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope he chose a topic I'd like to address (human terrorism - four lions) that it's not a cock, losing the opportunity to make a statement about the mainstream jump over ignorance and opinion on these emotional and heavily rotating phenomena.
