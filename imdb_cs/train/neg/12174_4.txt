This is a big step down after a surprisingly nice original. This sequel is not as fun as the first, and instead spends too much time developing the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best in this series but his argument is tinted in this item. Performance is reasonable, but this time the script stops us. The action is just routine and the plot is only slightly interesting, so I need a lot of stupid laughter to have fun during the movie "Trancers." Unfortunately, he laughs a little and far away, so this movie is the best way to watch.
