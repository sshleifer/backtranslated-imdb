I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is one of the greatest novels ever written. It is so close to the perfection of every mortal creation. Jane Austen reaches the top of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it's best palimpsest. <br /> <br /> Comparing with Gwyneth Paltrow's version is inevitable - that the version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and more fun watching. There are some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (formerly played by Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, apparently Emma's smarter spiritual twins) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes a suitably ornate Frank Churchill. Production is beautiful, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> There are several major issues. The first is Mark Strong - it does not look good for Mr. Knightley first. It's because he plays a role as a Victorian pastor. It is bad. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of the length. Simply put, the movie is too short - to get the right feeling, it would have to be twice as long. Finally, and most strikingly, there is the quality of adaptation. Austen is the dream of an adapter - the whole dialogue already exists. It must only be cut and arranged correctly. It seems that Andrew Davies thinks differently. First, it's a rather grim movie, and the last thing Emma has to be is grim. More importantly, Davies considered it appropriate to rewrite the end as a sort of Bukolic feast. Which planet or small work from Thomas Hardy comes from? This is completely beyond the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe she is extremely enthusiastic about trying to improve - perfection. Look at the Paltrow version or Kate in the Cool Comfort Farm.
