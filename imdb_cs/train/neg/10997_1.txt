First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why the world is trying to sell a low-budget piece of crap on late night TV with the promise of disturbing, insulting sick garbage that no normal real human being can see with the soul. What the hell is bullshit when the dog is injured, the grandmother gets her head betrayed ... the guy who got his hand on the bits and the two girls go to the bathroom? the world is hearing this world that people find comedy in something so totally ill. Anyone who thinks this type of material is fun should not even be allowed to walk the earth. But from what I hear, it's not even insulting ... so ... they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage ... and they can not even do it.
