I was looking at this movie. Even. And that was not easy. It's so dull, badly played and almost every detail stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe the creators are serious about it. Even harder to believe is how this "product" came to VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a horror movie, just watch "Scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, watch some kids walk through the woods and yell at each other and show their incompetence, watch the dark region.
