Do you know how sometimes you can watch a dirty movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well, that was it. I bought a DVD at Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard that this is a movie you can laugh at. It's really nothing pathetic. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started to ask me to turn it off. I asked for about 45 minutes. After an hour, we made a compromise to move forward quickly to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we watched for Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not look at this movie. This is out of pain.
