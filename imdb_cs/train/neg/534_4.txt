This bullshit is like watching a dry color. I'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it. <br /> <br /> This movie simply does not make sense. If it had never been, no one would have noticed it. He is reticent because of all the great names in him, but if "no one is", no one would give this film any love. I was really in a place where I was in the middle of the movie I was looking at Vanessa Redgrave and thinking, "Hurry up now!" It's like a "happy happiness club," without it being from the joy of the dead. It's "Oceans is 13" (nothing but big-name cast) mothers and daughters movies and totally anti-climatic ... oh, until it finally ended. I'm sure everyone is nominated for an Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Four stars for cinematography and the ability to convince big actresses to commit to this junk.
