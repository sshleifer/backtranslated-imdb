I am sad that the Christians (and I am one) believe we have to make films like "Left Behind". We have much better stories so we can say that it does not have to be so a sermon. I was very disappointed with this film. As an aspirant filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example of what I will not do with my career in the film.
