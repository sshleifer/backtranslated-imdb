Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie, the funny 'metal' he chose. When his favorite "metal" singer, Sammi Curr dies, throws his whip and tears all the posters on the wall of his bedroom. But when he later gets a relentless record that holds the spirit of his dead "metal" idol. First, he sucks on revenge ideas, but he does not want to take Sammy. Which is not as far as it seems that his main victims go to the hospital. This movie is totally ridiculous and has to do with real metal, as they say: "Rock Star". Okay, maybe more than that piece of junk mail, but you got it. And how can anyone spice up for the guy Skippy plays from "Family Ties" I have no idea. The reception of Gene Simmons is all right and Ozzy Osbourne will achieve coherence, but I'm gonna miss it. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, and topless addition to the pool
