After the funny live action of George in the jungle, Disney had great hopes for this film. The main disappointment. Thread recorded fence, bad behavior, bad visual effects. This film relied on one-off blades, idiotic (and unnecessary) product placement, and the deadliest most unpleasant side kicking of that vehicle. I took two little kids to see it, and they were bored of them. The only laugh received from this movie was a bad alert when you need a laugh to show a guy getting it to the weak!
