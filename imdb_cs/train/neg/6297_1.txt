I am a great fan of Martin Amis, whose book is based on this film. Unfortunately, the director could not translate the book to the screen. The novel is thoroughly postmodern and highly artificial in its wildly bloated practices and the disintegration of the traditional drawing line and the character of development. It is a merry exploration of human greed, surplus and emptiness by one of the most moral contemporary British writers. The director of the film completely missed the point of the novel. In his hands, the film shouts at a speed that is reflected in all known trick shots and possible camera angles. It's like Ken Russel on acid, and she's suffering from the fact that the older director's own favor has gone up to a hundred. Even a short glimpse of the wonderful Christian actress Solimen's penis was not enough to save this miserable film. Abysmal!
