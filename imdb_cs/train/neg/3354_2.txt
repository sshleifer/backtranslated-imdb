I think that if you decide to recreate a very good film, you should try to do better than the original; or at least give a new look. Now 1963 Robert Wise talks about Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is worth accessing today. Now fast to 1999 and re-make. I shook my head and asked why? The game is wooden, the story is unrecognizable, and it seems that the whole point replaces the gentle horror of the original with so many special effects that computers can create. I have heard that this update is bad; but he could not believe it was so bad with regard to the source material. I was wrong. After watching and telling my wife how terrible she was, she said; "They got the money!" He's right, do not get yours. If they have no profit in creating dirty re-tags, they may no longer produce or come to a higher standard that will not harm their audience
