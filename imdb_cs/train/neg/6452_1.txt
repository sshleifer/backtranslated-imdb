You know the story ... Tiny kids alone in the woods when BAM! Something starts to cut them. Well, that crap is no different. Many children are returning to the cabin where a man leads twins his brother disappeared a year ago. Conscientiously "UNKOWN CREATION" stars shoot them and their only help is a doctor / cyclist. Say this movie was bad is underestimation, it's sad! The game was terrible. Creation looked very raw. And like all the movies these days try to get you with the end of a twist, which they do not have! <br /> <br /> There is one clear place for this movie - LOST star Maggie Grace as female lead.
