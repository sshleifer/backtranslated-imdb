This film is based on John Fenton's novel. Could anyone tell me why? I do not see absolutely no reason why this beautiful book should be so altered. If you want to make Hollywood's romantic melodramatic production with Colin Farrell and Selma Hayek, how could you create a link to Ask the Dust? -And if you wanted to make this film story, why would you like to do it in a romantic melodramatic production in Hollywood with Colin Farrell and Selma Hayek? I do not get it. <br /> <br /> Personalizing the story is wrong and if you read the book and liked it, I'm pretty sure you do not like what Towne did with it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you might find casting weird, bad acting and cinematography just a little exaggerated. But you're hoping for the best. I really had a lot of hope during this film. Actually, I wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse and it's so simple: Whether you read the film Fantes or not, it's not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with poor acting, lack of structure and, of course, lots of Colin Farells' naked asses. I could complain much more about this movie, but why forget my time. I have seen it. OK. I had to see it because the book I liked so much and was curious. And I'm very disappointed. 1/10 is for Colin's sweet mustache at the end of the film. So sweet ... If he wore it all the time, I gave her 2/10.
