If you've ever seen the 1980s slasher, there's not much reason to see this. Originality is often not one of the strongest piano movies, and it is something that the film really is missing. The Pranks can not say much, so I'll do it quickly. The film was one of the 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list and that was the only reason I saw it. The breakdown follows a few children who stay in the dorm at Christmas time. Since they are in slasher, someone decides to start collecting them and it leads to one of the saddest secrets ever to be seen in the movie slasher. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because, despite some horrific scenes, this movie is hardly trying to corrupt or get rid of anyone, and it is never forbidden (eg Friday 13) to be banned. But again, movies are forbidden, which are far less cruel than this (for example, the Witch who came from the sea). Anyway, the end of the movie is the best, because even if the audience really could not care less, who is the attacker at this point; this is quite done. Overall, it is a haunted and unfortunate slasher that even slasher fans will be missing well.
