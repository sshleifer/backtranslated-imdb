There are movies that are terrible and there are movies that are so terrible that they are considered long forgotten and impregnable. Also, lots of violence and bad things (not just cheese, you know what I mean) add to the mix too. What is the result of bad movies with so much brown content? Why, of course! <br /> <br /> Remember, "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this film, and it was riffed by Joel and Bots at "Mystery Science Theater 3000." Now this time, when Mike takes Joel's place on Satellite Love (but with the same shoes), this trio has to talk about Joe Don Baker's "Final Justice" movie, Joe Don Baker from MST3K. Of course, most of the naughty things I mentioned have been removed for television, but I still want to watch this episode (and also "Mitchell") because what Joe Don "hates" the most? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> If you have large quarries near you, make sure that the storage for the strip is empty! LOL It happened to another user!
