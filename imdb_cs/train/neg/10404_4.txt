This Tremors, a deadly Curve Curve, contains sixty inspired seconds (a song you know when you see it) and more effort and refills than you can shake your wand. Tremors 4 was apparently shot at a crippling low budget. It means that they only have enough special effects on my mom for three to four minutes of precious violence on humans, on the vertices. Bold fonts and hackneyed fonts ensure that the remaining hour and half of the Tremors 4 experience feels for at least fifteen thousand years. Only tremors fans who have a hard movie will be able to sit and much less enjoy the film. If you are not among them - do not bother.
