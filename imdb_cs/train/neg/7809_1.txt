Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life falls apart all over him. Cecil grabs the phone book, looks for the name of the preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the house of a preacher and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecila to respect the word of God and to have Jesus in his heart. Everything is all better. Oh ... if everything was so easy in life. The fact that this "movie" looks as though it was made with about $ 500 certainly will not help. 1/10
