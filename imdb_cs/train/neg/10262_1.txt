Now I looked at it curiously and I had to watch - just like watching a car accident ... I think it's a spoof, but that should not stop me from criticizing the goddess-horrible direction, play and dialogue. Seriously, this was considered one of the poorest movies I've seen - it looked more like an episode of Cryptkeeper Stories and bad about it ... Okay - Several critics (1) when the doctor had a heart a monster attack (we never see the monster attacking him, so we suppose his heart attack), the army then launched the shells, rockets, monster bullets - which were steps from the doctor - but the doctor does not touch a rocket and is still alive ) an army attack of about 100 yards and we see that a flame thrower is used - geez, these things have a range of up to 30 meters! (3) When the monster tries to take a professor, the soldiers run to the classroom and shoot at the ceiling; Monster Drops a Child and Soldiers Do Not Try to Shoot a Monster ??? come on! (4) Monster looks like something from Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where the five "good boys" (priest, girl, doctor, reporter and boy) look all shocked and we get responses (hand to mouth) in succession - so natural! (6) generally just runs away from time to time (7) general refuses to try electricity and will not listen (8) that acting is terrible (9) I mentioned a monster rubber suit ???? (10) that God-awful music, non-stop!
