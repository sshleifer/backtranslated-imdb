Amateur, no budget movies can not be surprisingly good ... but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Aha, another Brad Sykes atrocities. The game is embarrassing, with the exception of Emmy Smith, who has a vow. The "direction" camera needs a serious overhaul. And no more "hold camera and run" tricks either; it just does not work. Special effects are non-imaginary, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real-time. If you are going to tear your ear, do not realize that the actor is a real ear under the blood. The scene is boring and boring (just like other Sykes companies) and music is the cross between the cheap motel porn and the really bad guitar drive (see scenery commentary). the lack of any real conspiracy or character development? It does not seem like the screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Who finances this guy ... please stop. I have seen some of his other "home movies" (which are not involved) and are just as bad. Under normal circumstances, the "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. One thing is to be an amateur filmmaker, but someone can be hack. Certainly not a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels will be less painful than this effort. /> <br /> Awards: The worst military push-up in the movie.
