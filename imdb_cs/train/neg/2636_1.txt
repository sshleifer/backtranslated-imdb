I saw the movie this evening on a free preview and despite the fact that I did not pay a dime to see this movie, I still felt ruffled. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money, and if you see this movie, you leave Benjamin in your seat. Efficiency is at best uncertain; Kiefer Sutherland calls Jack Bauer in his worst personification, and Michael Douglas seems to realize he has made the wrong choice to leave Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration of the shooting of this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; seems to be reading her series from the teleprompter. And if you can not find "mole" within the first 20 minutes, then you just land on this planet from a world without television and recycled stories. If you really want to see a good thriller secret service, rent it in the fire. If you see and buy it, you'll start worrying about President Security because the secret service looks and acts as an adult version of the 90210 species. No matter what your feelings about W, we hope that these "art" does not mimic life.
