Have I ever seen a movie that was more shocking? I can think about how much this is the same, but nobody who can overcome it. Cast are all terrible stereotypes bound by a flat conversation. I am ashamed of all the people who have been involved. Everyone carries the expression of fear that was not created by conspiracy, but by saying that this project could easily divide his career. Even many of Mrs. Diaz's spells do not give you enough reason to do it. Avoid it, of course, it's a movie style that Americans do not really understand. Look at the end result if you have to, and you see what I'm talking about, but do not say I warned you ...
