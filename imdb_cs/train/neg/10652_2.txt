You know Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Prepare for: Security Pins Killer! Right, in Killer Workout, a silly movie slasher, if I've ever seen one, an invisible killer broadcasts her (or her?) Victims with an excessive new security pin. It's a strange decision to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves explanation. Of course, the movie has never tried to make clear where the killer got such a thing. As the name implies, the aerobics gym is besieged by a mad killer and they are all suspects. In fact, the film gives so little footprint that it's a murderer's identity, just about everyone in the movie is a potential killer until they are killed. And since everyone, but the killer's wind is dead, it's really just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Special, while the whole song is killed, the aerobics class continues seriously. In fact, nothing can stop dancing. While the three men are murdered in the next room, the training continues. Death is not a factor; one character dies but is still visible in later exercises. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he was named Killer Workout, not Logical Exercise. Police, explosive solariums and hundreds of footage of women are exposed to meat. Just like a woman caught on a sunbath, I felt very uncomfortable until the end of Killer Workout. Finally, fortunately, KONTAKT appeared on the screen. What happened afterwards? You have it, shots of women working. Even the end of the movie can not stop them! <br /> <br />
