"Rambo: The First Blood Part II" George P. Cosmatos is a pure fulfillment of wishes. The United States apparently did not win the Vietnam War. They have caused damage to this country beyond imaginary boundaries and this film continues in a narrative about the fire - so innocent soldiers. The only bad people were the leaders of the nation who did this war. The Rambo character is perfect to notice. He is extremely patriotic, honors that American Americans have not rated and celebrated the achievements of a single soldier, but have nothing but distrust of senior officers and politicians. Just like any film that defends the war (for example, "We were soldiers"), it also avoids the need to provide a clear reason for joining South Asia. And the reason for every American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo will avenge the injury of the entire nation. It would be better to work on how to deal with these memories than to suppress them. "Will we win this time?" Yes Yes.
