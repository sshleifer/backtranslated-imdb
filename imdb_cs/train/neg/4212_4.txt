The beginning of this movie is superb with great sound and humor, but once the movie changes into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. One reason why it was, at least for me, was that the colors in much of the animation are too dull, with too little contrast. It does not look good, at least on VHS. From time to time it collapses and looks great, but often too. The characters come and go too fast. For example, I would like to see more "Moby Dick". When the movie starts to drag, however, it rises again with the dragon entrance and then the movie ends strongly. <br /> <br /> You simply do not forget or you are able to compete with the big animated films of the last decade.
