This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite Western critic. The script is ridiculous, acting is over the top and looks like it's nice. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the pendant appeal of legendary Meena Kumari. Watching an actress who was sick during filming and who was slain to death at the age of 40 shortly after shooting the film has the same fascination as tracking the train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and drove but lacks the skills to do well with each of the tasks. Bollywood produced much better movies.
