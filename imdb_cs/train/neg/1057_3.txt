I'm sorry, I had great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately it was too long, too thin and too weak to attract attention. When I realized that the whole movie was really just an older guy that revived my dream, I felt cheated. Surely it could be a device that will bring us deeper into something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So do not buy a big drink or run into a rest room. My children did not like it either. Good.
