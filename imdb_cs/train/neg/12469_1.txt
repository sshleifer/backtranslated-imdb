I rarely give up the movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I rent it on DVD. Syriana was the one I gave up. In the middle of the road, I turned it off with a bored disgust. The film is discontinuous, boring, confusing and insignificant. The game was dry and without credible imagery. The whole plot was good, but it evolved in such an awkward and boring way that I could not understand my interest or interest. Multiple blocks often did not connect with each other and resembled random stories rather than a real piece of land. It is a shame that such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop. I can not imagine that this film would receive nominations much less.
