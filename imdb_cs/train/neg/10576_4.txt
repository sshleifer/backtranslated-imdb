I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and appealing: Each episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by the famous, notable Horror director. When I finally watched them, it was a little fool. Some good episodes have emerged since the first season, but overall it was a mixed bag. I have attributed this to the learning curve and I have found that Season 2 will be much better. Boy, I was in shock. At least one season had some good stories. Season 2 (except "The Black Cat" with excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and complete loss for me. The "Sounds like" episode can be a very bad thing I've watched on TV for the past 10 years, and most other episodes are not much better. I really hope Season 3 will change next year, but I do not hold my breath.
