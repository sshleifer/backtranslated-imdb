The dog found in the local kennel is associated with Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family who has just lost his previous dog on a hit & run. The puppy does not have any work like Donald Trump and shoots a Mexican housekeeper as festive. Only the father suspects that this dog is more than he appears, the rest of the family loves demonic poohs. So it's a daddy who says the day. This late seventies for television horror has little interest in it except the lost feeling of nostalgia. When I saw it as a child, I found it to be a nail tightening, but as I thought it was an adult, I realized that it was only fragile, boring and not at all involved. <br /> <br /> My rating: D
