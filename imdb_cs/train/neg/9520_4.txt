[*** POSSIBLE SPOILS ***] The reputation of this movie is a precursor, so I pretended to sit down to watch him in the TCM mailbox. What is the main disappointment. The cast is excellent and the production values ​​are first class, but the characters are without depth, the conspiracy is thin and the whole thing takes too long. For a film that deals with alcoholism, family division, unfaithfulness, gambling, and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless, and cliché. One example is the portrait of the Franciscan Hirsch infinity: his rather difficult request for his wife to "go up and rest a little," followed by a predictable headache request, led - even more predictably - to his evening conversation with his secretary ("hey Nancy , today I have blues, we are going on a journey "), all according to a well-worn formula. We do not feel they're real people, but cardboard cutouts in puppet play. Also, the source of obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Dave's shame with Gwen again / again is inexplicable because of her unbearable inability to quench the pot. His subsequent marriage of despair with Shirley MacLaine / Ginny's character is, of course, condemned to failure, and it was clear - according to the conventions of this type of soap opera - to solve only someone who was killed. The moment the jealous lover started running around with a gun, I started to bet with who - Dave or Ginny - would be killed. The whole thing was fake with the capital "P". <br /> <br /> As he says, Maclaine's performance and Dean Martin are standouts here. But overall, it seems to me that the interest of the film is purely what is part of Hollywood history.
