Marie Dressler bears a playable gig for a kind banking owner who recently broadcast on TCM during the lunatic comedy of April. If you come with the anticipation of great laughter with the courtesy of Dressler-Polly Moran, you will be disappointed because it's really a very inaccurate movie. It's also very badly done, surprisingly because it was from MGM. Leonard Smith's bare bones cinematography is strictly from "set up camera and do not move" school, often at the expense of cast who finds that they supply off-line lines (it's like pan and scan the print before it existed!) Or with cut heads . The film does not even have a prominent director who is the basis of the apparent flying nightly nature of production. Overall, this is an unsatisfactory mess, with Dressler being often overly emotional and only the bizarre, final role on the bathroom to separate her.
