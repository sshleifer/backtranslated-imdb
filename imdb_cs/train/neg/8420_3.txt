In spite of the excellent cast, it is a film that is extraordinary, especially from aviation perspective. It may be somewhat better than the bravado von Richthofen and Brown, but not much. "Blue Max" remains the best of the small market for 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if it is not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM can do with Zeppelins and Gothas in the new high-quality WW I aero film.
