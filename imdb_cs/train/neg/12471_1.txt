Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was thrilled to buy a ticket to Syria. When I saw a trailer and a thriller lover, I was expecting to see a film moving fast, breathing, wisely hiding in global policy making and the relationship between oil, power and corruption. Well, I almost left the film in the middle. The tempo was painfully slow, almost all characters were stereotyped, interlaced editing made understanding of logic very difficult, but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you do not care. Save money, save time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
