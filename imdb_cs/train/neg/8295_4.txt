I tend to like nature-motivated films. I also think Hope Davis is turning into a constantly good job, so I had a great deal of hope for this movie. These hopes were soon interrupted. The main flaw in this film is the direction. There are lots of scenes that are watching dreams. The film often uses the character of Denis Leary as an alter ego character by Campbell Scott. It does not work for me at all. It would work better as a game than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also plotting problems. It is important that the characters in the movie go on a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. I did not feel that the characters grew in the experiences depicted in the film. And finally, editing was not done well. During the movie, there was a big bend, which was extremely boring. In addition to the acting I felt was still strong, this film failed in almost every aspect of the film.
