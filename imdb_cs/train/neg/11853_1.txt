Let's say romantic comedies are considered lightweight compared to dramatic films (you can just watch an Oscar nomination every year). Yet, the good ones are really artistic forms. See "When Harry Meets Sally," "Sleepless in Seattle," and classics like "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night." I like the good feeling that I see two lucky people. <br /> <br /> This movie is trying to build something that reminds of a romantic comedy. But no one knows what the novel is among the main characters, and there is no laugh to solve the main shortcoming. Modine is so long ago that he is the leading man - especially romantic leadership. I am sure that as a powerful producer, he had the means-but not the good sense-to cast himself. And Gershon ... I see the potential of some comedic talent, but she did not have a script and a poorly developed figure. And whose thought was English accent? Unimportant. <br /> <br /> Others said, but I want to repeat it: this story is poorly conceived, wrongly executed; actors are terribly wrong; and characters, well, just do not give them up. <br /> <br /> It is not an art form. Load "Moonstruck" again.
