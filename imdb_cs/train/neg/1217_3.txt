His Christmas Eve, and lazy and cozy housekeeper Della (Kim Basinger), will receive some terrible threats from her rogue and abusive husband. Leaving his twins in bed will dare into the night for the last shopping at the local shopping mall. Her busyness and finding a parking spot is almost impossible, Della becomes the face of a motorist who parked in two spaces, leaving a note that says so much. After returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted with some dogs, the car owner has left her a note, they are very angry and want some fun with her, a kind security guard goes to her aid but things get out of hand and the shooter is shot, Della escapes with the murderous strawberries in hot pursuit, shoots on her, she loses control of her car and crashes, quickly grabs her set of tools from the trunk, hides herself in an abandoned building site, but soon gets ready, just before attempting to rape kill her, her magic toolkit produces a key, the wounding of her Chuckie leader, can escape again to the nearby forest, in phrases, it's just the black guy Here the night worsens for all involved as a deadly game of cats and mice. A similar phrase on Eden Lake attracted me, but that's where the comparison ends. It is a powerless and stupid film that was a shocking scenario and scary performers of all the actors, Disney-twin girls are scary, but his Lukas Haas as Chuckie, who must take good fortune in a bad acting department, even if he gets them for his money the same terrible husband. As a film his line is completely telegraphed all the way, even in setting up early on Della's cell phone goes dead and then in stores her credit card has been canceled her babes and she has no money and his Christmas day now where they could go with this I wonder ??? The only surprising part of this hit is that when he kills all the guys with magical instruments, Chuckie asks her to do it if my jaws on the floor do not care about this movie horror would surely fall and break on the floor. even the end is confused, all grandmother's feminists who want their pound of meat will remain totally disappointed. I did not think I could be disappointed, but then I saw that Guillermo del Toro produced this blow
