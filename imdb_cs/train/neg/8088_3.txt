To make a good movie, you need a great actor or an excellent director. You need at least one of two. We do not have a needle in this eye. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the name of the director. He did not do too much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he definitely can not be the main actor in the movie. It is not. Sutherland is great in the movie when it appears in less than 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that Sutherland was excellent at JFK Oliver Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without a breath, without breathing. Great. But Sutherland, who is the main actor in the movie, is not good. Kate Nelligan? It's probably good for TV series. The DVD is awful. Terrible colors. Terrible light. I could not even appreciate the scenery of Storm Island, how nasty the photographer was. <br /> <br /> This Ken Follett story was good, but it's a shame they turned it into an unimportant movie.
