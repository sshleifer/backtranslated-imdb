Well, what's going on with this show, the Power Rangers anyway? I have always felt that the show, which was originally transferred from Japan in a better form, took what was great in Japan and turned into one of the most crazy and useless excuses in the history of toy trading! This scenario makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Bad hairstyles, bad costumes, earrings, etc. Shows what was ridiculous in the 1990s From two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the duhs of the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: Bring it to me! Saban brought it from Japan, and then Disney bought the rights to this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the public has to endure the repetition of this show on the Disney channel and the like. <br /> <br /> I can say once again to give me a break!
