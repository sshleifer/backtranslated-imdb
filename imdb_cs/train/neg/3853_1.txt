I think Jason Lee has a tremendous potential, but it was a bad vehicle in which they try to set off as a star. The plot is terrible, the comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I think I was relieved, because in a retrospective perspective, there were quite innate jokes. I found out that I was afraid of Fletch's future, and I had to make sure it was the movie that was faulty, not Lee. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend the photos on this website to solve this instead of this movie. Save time. 1 star.
