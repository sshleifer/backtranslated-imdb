I would probably give this propaganda film 6 or 7 as it shows when and how the propaganda film becomes successful. If there are some people who look at this piece and think that "well, Jews had to do something to treat them in the way they were treated in World War II," then the film is very cleverly reassured why and how and false remarks about how people live. What next propaganda film is going on? The part in which the American film about the Rothschild family is included is, for example, very cleverly used here. The question of why a Jew keeps his wealth from an officer never asks. No one mentions the tax system within specific social strata. In addition, the level of excitement (or level of disgust) in the movie slowly increases, and the end of the movie suit resembles the target solution and the need for propaganda. Viewers have gone with joy and gratitude to the times that are coming ... well done. There is some simplicity in the film that deals with the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The film is today in today's history, so you do not have much to talk about. However, in this simplicity of the words of ethnic degradation, an attentive observer can find meaning for today's cultural hatred, violence, decision and integration. Overall, fine baskets.
