I'm sure there is an IMDB culture that likes movies that make MST3K entertained. After seeing this as well as the "Werewolf" and reading dozens of remarks about how they are betrayed, I am convinced that there is some conspiracy. Many people say that people who hate him "are afraid of gore," "I do not know good horror," or the like. Well, I really do not care about the gore, but I want something in the movie to happen! Most of them are just a woman sitting and looking around! Or walk around the house / garden! The film requires something that gives it an atmosphere, you do not want to get it just because you do not have unnecessary scenes when someone is going through and staring. Oh, and "Do you think you think"? Yeah, I thought "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever shot! <br /> <br /> To record, I'm a big fan of the old horror style, Dracula, Frankenstein, such things.
