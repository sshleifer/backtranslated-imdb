Derek's films created several decent offers during the 1980s to win the title "The Worst of All Time," which is probably their major success in these bets. In fact, this movie may be considered part of the "So bad, it's good" category, just with products like Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman. This explains the IMDb electoral pattern for this film, with some people passing top marks. Anthony Quinn made a strange strange movie at his time, but this performance as a rand spirit is so incredibly bad to be seen to be believed.
