A good country builds on the life of a slave and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated having decided to cast the English in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is ridiculous as a farmer's father. She has such a heavy American accent, like most of the main actors I could not bear when I listen to him, talking. It's a shame that Hollywood could not overcome his racist beliefs in the lead roles. For Anglos to look like Chinese, it is similar to Anglos putting on his face a shoe shine to play Afro-Americans.
