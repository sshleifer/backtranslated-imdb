there are those movies that are bad, they are funny, then there are those where you scream "I want to give me and half an hour of my life back" ... that's quite what it is. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain tries to be an actor but fails. sfx are really bad (repeat scenes and rocks that look like trapping paper) and fake plastic guns that have flashlights on them ... the split-screen effect of displaying a few things happening at once is terrible. <br /> <br /> This film can even be used as one of those simple nightly entertainment, it's so bad <br /> <br /> if I could go for a negative rating,
