R Balki will try to tell you the story previously mentioned by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabda. This time it mixes with mature humor. Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and has Indian cuisine in London. He is very controlled and arrogant and respects his work just like any other work. According to him, cooking is art. Still, Hyderabadi Biryani can not. Enter the Tabu who sends her the correct Hyderabadi Biryani and they soon start to meet and finally fall in love with each other? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 ?. Seamlessly! But one Hitch! Tabu's father, Paresh Rawal! Couples decide to meet their father to approve their marriage. But Amitab realizes that Tabu's father is much younger. And do complications begin? The performance of all three actors is brilliant. The screenplay is very tight and interesting. Movie dialogs are catchy. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. The comedy is sometimes misunderstood. The film also tries to go on some parts of the lengthy one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is good. Director R Balki could have done much better than this scenario. But in the second half he looks confused. The father's satyagrah scene looked irritable. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during this scene are very good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Cheeni Kum needed more sugar!
