All I could remember when watching this movie was the B-grade slop. Many have spoken that it is the redeeming of the quality of this film showing such realistic depictions of the effects of drugs and individuals and their subsequent spirals on the state of self-treatment of unfortunate events. In fact, the techniques (as already mentioned many times) have been exaggerated and therefore unconvincing and insignificant for the film as a whole. As for the conspiracy, it was insignificant, unthinkable, unlikely, and complicated. You can read most of the other news about this movie and they will say pretty much the same as me. <br /> <br /> He gave some actors and actresses attractive, but when confronted with such a boring action ... it looks can only wear the movie so far. The action is bad and intermittent: a few strokes that run out here and there, and the final prosecution towards the end. Nobody really had to write home. <br /> <br /> As the others say, "BAD" movies are great when you look at being "bad". However, this film is empty. It's nothing. Moreover, if one really needs an educational film that would scare people out of drugs, then I would seriously recommend any number of other films that will have such a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and contempt in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Though they should also look for some other light films on the same theme as "Go" (overall, both serious and fun) and "Halfbaked". <br /> <br /> The final remark, one possible redemption of the movie, was delivered by Vinnie Jones from Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels. To think that a bit of this great movie was damaged by "Loaded," it's ugly. Overall I strongly recommend that you save your money and your time by not inviting this movie.
