There was nothing I liked on the film. It was an apparently low budget with poor lighting and a camera (almost like the Blair Witch Project, it just was not supposed to be that). The conspiracy was not too much and the film is just a drug on and on. Actually, I quickly went through the last third of the films, but it did not help much. It looked like it could be good from the box, but I have to say again: nothing in this movie looked like good. No good actors, special effects were so fake, working with the camera was terrible, and the dialogue was painfully terrible. On my personal scale I give this movie 0 out of 10. Yikes!
