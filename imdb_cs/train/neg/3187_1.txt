From the star "MITCHELL", from the director "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are tags that I would not normally see. And the worst thing is that all the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker gets another five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake "Coogan's Bluff"
