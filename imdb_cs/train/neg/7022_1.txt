In more than 70 years of watching movies, it must be one of the worst comedies ever shot. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have done some very bad comedies, but that's the absolute bottom of the barrel. It's unfortunate from the opening itself up to the pinned on stage during credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, who I normally like, needed her pay wrong. She desperately needs to learn her craft again. Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is) needs a better director to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also not in her role. <br /> <br /> Mike White needs to find a different character, doing the same thing a few times. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard, who began years back as a first-level actor, was also not as good as he had been. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent about what I can say about this movie comedy experiment. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
