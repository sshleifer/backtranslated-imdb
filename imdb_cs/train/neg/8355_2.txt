Wanda Nevada is an adventurous fanciful film that uses around 1979 the concept of what constitutes illegal romance for 13-year-old girls. Scenario, stimulation, and direction are equally horrible. The action sequences refute the vortex. Characters speak with a simplified diction, which we usually find in films that are less than 10 years old, but also includes many sexual links including Shield character and graphical death. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be at some level of comedy, but it's never a funny, adventurous picture, but the plot and the action are insignificant and childlike, but it introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. He also wants to be a friend, an image of the coming age, a film of ghosts, an Indian spiritual film, a travelogue, and a Western film. The overall effect is massive stupidity with ugly twists. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time if you do not want to see lots of amazing Grand Canyon shots. That he does well.
