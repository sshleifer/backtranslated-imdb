Last night he was watching TV. Yeah, I hear what you say about this. It is likely to be categorized as stereotypical television dishes. In all righteousness, the story line is about to twist, and you can nod to say, "Well, that's not what I expected." But as a movie, it is not easy to bring the redeemed element. Casting, acting, cinematographic work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, nothing to congratulate. Rated R ?? Oh, that scene. Did we need it? This is a movie you can watch and then forget that you even watched. And what was the title again?
