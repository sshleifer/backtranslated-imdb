I love Clash music and I love music by Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this film and hoped to learn about the man for most of it. But I left the theater did not know about Joe much more than I did after reading the record on Wikipedia. The film is never a person, his thoughts and feelings can not get. What they did was gather the little stuff they had, shaky blurred videos, and an interview with some people about Joe Strummer in a campfire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all, and that the director just wanted the movie to make some other celebrities say, "Oh, he was such an inspiration to all of us." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who have been far from trying to keep their pirate costume to use their current success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not even wait for the body to get cold before entering into the sale of his "greatest punk rocker and hippie heart" that he ever lived, a sanctified person without even knowing it. > <br /> Sure, when I was a fan, I was pleased to watch the band's pictures, to hear the anecdotes of songs and such, but in the end I felt like what was left, because the portrait of Joe Strummer could easily be said in 60 years. -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the movie if you are a fan, otherwise better listen to some Clash music or even better unsigned Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, melted all his rich influences together one amazing sound.
