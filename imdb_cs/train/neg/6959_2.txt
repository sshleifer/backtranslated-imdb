A few days ago I saw it and it's hard to forget the movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie should be funny, it's not just a laugh in the theater (perhaps for José Garcia and Gérard Depardieu) and it's boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it was hard to understand what they were saying. They just talk and quickly do not open enough to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself singing along the line that was supposed to be funny "what he said" and I'm French. I hate to say that because I think that good films are being produced here, but I apologize in advance for all the foreigners who are involved in the film (if they sometimes appear outside of France).
