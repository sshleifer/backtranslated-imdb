A set of uninteresting and intriguing characters turns around and turns their way through a thin, fictitious plot that might be interesting if you could just get into the care. This "rotation and rotation" I'm talking about does not relate to the story (which contains all the tensions about the tuna recipe), but to the director's inability to preserve the faces of the character even remotely centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear. The only real surprise in the film is the big names they have convinced. When you think that this movie has never been released in theaters despite the versatile star, you may be inclined to think of something stinking. And really yes.
