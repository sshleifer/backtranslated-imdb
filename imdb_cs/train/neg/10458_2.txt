I came to this film with anticipation, from the hype that it would be really noticeable and uplifting. Certainly more than a cheap promotional material for the Wilco group. Instead, we have a lot of moping and wailing about the "process," the dishonest and undoubtedly one-sided display of one band member who was kicked out by the main singer / songwriter of the first donna, a conspiratorial confession of a friend of the fallen member for another 18 years - saying that " , and this whimsical, uncompromising story about how one record label "hurt their feelings" by driving them out just to get the band instantly to get 50 offers from other labels (oh, tension ... no!). They tried to make it look like it was tension, but I suspect it's all the smoke and mirrors that caused a tragedy that did not exist. It does not even take into account the long stretches that we have had many of their latest tracks without any story, insight or even decent work on cinematography. Strenuous attempts at emotional honesty or a reasonable view of life have made me understand. From the movie, this group sounds like a bunch of lousy little kids who are moving around to find a voice they do not have and think they are a guardian for the art of music that they are definitely not. And I thought sucking music, and I could not even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the singer. I give it 2/10.
