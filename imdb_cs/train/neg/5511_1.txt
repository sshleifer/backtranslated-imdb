I have to agree with the first comment: this film is upset very, very hard. Despite the very large cast of the B list, coverage of this film (for those who do not see it at the comedy center within a day, which is probably the only exposure that this movie ever gets) tries to blame Dangerfield, but it's actually just a paycheck for everyone - was a comedian of the 1980s. Randy Quaid? Control. Ed Begley, Jr? Control. Lisa Simpson's voice? Now she can say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only terrible shock: double control. And so many, many others. The saddest thing about this movie is that it was so lazy with the jokes that have already been said. Nothing out of this film is fun. You prefer to look at dry colors. This is definitely direct to the scratch-the-bottom-of-the-barrel stuff that still believes in the old video march: throwing an old star on the envelope and you will get some money back from the rental. Since the rental time of video clips changes, consider one of the last examples of garbage disposal. <br /> <br /> Use this movie only if you have difficulty falling asleep. He'll get there.
