Some could say something like "Baby Geniuses" with giant robots or "Dumbo" with their psychedelic nightmare drug sequence that would be awarded the most disturbing film ever made for children. You could also say, but you would be wrong. Yeah, and see, because I'm bringing you: Santa Claus, the most helplessly frustrated family film since ... well, never. <br /> <br /> From the introductory scenes that show children from different parts of the world sing their insipid motives (seriously, this segment is almost 20 minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the exciting conclusion in which Merlin discovers everywhere and saves the day (he does not mind it, it's from Barcelona), it's a childhood trauma at his best. And no matter how much I try, no matter how many different therapists I attend, just ... I can not ... get ... you ... reindeer ... laughter ... outside .... .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this thoughtful piece of rubbish as if you were avoiding whales that were expelled during sexual intercourse during mating. Still, if there are flamboyant demons with a serious case of excessive flu, I think you should try. But really this film is not worth your time and mental health.
