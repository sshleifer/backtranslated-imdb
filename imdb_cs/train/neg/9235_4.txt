This woman never stops talking throughout the movie. She remembered each line and added everything without a little natural emotion. She also has the most important lisp and the tone of her voice sounds like nails on the blackboard. This film has too many Betsy Drake, and the lack of Cary Grant, who carried so much of the film he was all alone.
