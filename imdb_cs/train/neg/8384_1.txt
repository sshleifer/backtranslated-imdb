When I saw that IMDb users rated this film at the bottom of 250 movies, I thought it was too rough, but I knew little that the low rating was absolutely correct. I'm a big fan of Wayans' brothers. I loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed the white cats. The little man, however, had little laughter and the jokes were obsolete. Apparently this joke will be around Marlon Wayans, who plays an adult tiny guy who was recently released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal the diamond for the gangster. Things are going wrong and tiny must place a diamond with the unsuspecting pair played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To get the diamond back, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned child abandoned to a unsuspecting couple. Of course, he is admitted and the drama is starting to look for a diamond. The film features several Saturday Night Live actors and actresses like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider from In Living Color. All of these talents can not help bad scripts and jokes that were simply not fun. The special effects that Marlon Wayans would look like a pacifier were all right. I think it was not 100% believable, but it was okay ... nothing great. I just want Wayans brothers to make more effort to develop a script with good jokes than to try to save their bad scenario with cameras from their famous comedic actors and actresses. Wait for it on a cable or television. They really do not want any money.
