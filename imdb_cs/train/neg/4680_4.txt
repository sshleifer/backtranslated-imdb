If I asked how I would define the word "shallow," I would answer "Watch the production of Jerry Bruckheimer." If I asked how I would define the phrase "unnecessary potential," I would answer "Watch the production of Jerry Bruckheimer." Bruckheimer's production is almost always certain that fires occur at the box office, but critics almost always receive critical criticism. From the top of my head I only think that it's the Officer and the Gentleman and the Black Hawk DOWN, who get a lot of critical response. CRIMSON TIDE has also received some unwavering recognition from critics, one of Bruckheimer's best films, which, unfortunately, does not say much. The problem I have is a scenario that sets the story: The Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spreads across Russia, leading to the ultranationalist Russian taking over the nuclear rocket base and endangering the West if they intervene. Perhaps the end of the Cold War had everything to do with it, but I found it very unconvincing. Does it help with some mistakes in geography, such as the French carrier Foch, who is in Honey (will not Foch be better placed in the Black Sea?), Or that exposure reporting is composed of familar shots representing Balkan conflicts, the first Gulf War and even Vietnam. Again, the proverb "Very unconvincing" has come to my mind. The story improves somewhat when the story is right - Battle of wills regarding orders between the Navy Commander and his second number. Director Tony Scott does the best, as well as cast, but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario. The worst thing is that if it were done in the mid-eighties, when WW3 was a real chance - Nay probability - this movie would scare me, but after the end of the Cold War there was a danger of nuclear war, which means that CRIMSON TIDE has little impact.
