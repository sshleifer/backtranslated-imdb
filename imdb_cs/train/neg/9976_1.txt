The first scene in "The Child's Problem" has a child in a nursing face. It's funny for this movie. A hateful, horrifying "comedy," it's awkward on so many levels that it makes it harder for faith. John Ritter is a kind father who adopts a child from hell, and to whom he retains his dignity in the onslaught of unambiguous, unpleasant performances and humor. What the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and unpleasant in trying to turn on sentimentality when it is done with humility, the film is so bad that it's a pretty bizarre experience. But it does not matter. The worst thing is Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unbeatable young actor ever to hit the screen? Believe me, you'll want to bring it straight to your mouth.
