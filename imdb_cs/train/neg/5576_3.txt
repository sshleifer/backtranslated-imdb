Until today, when you talk about Japanese film, most people will not talk about Rashomon, Seven Ronin, or Wound. For the masses, the Japanese cinema means all the monsters we have used to love and destroy the Japanese cities over and over, many times in battles with each other. The first and largest of these is Godzilla, who returns a dozen or more times, and in several films facing a triad of gray stars like hydra as a universe of space, Guiderah. <br /> <br /> Perfectly in line with the times, special effects have improved slightly. But part of the magic of those old movies saw that the paper machetic sets were destroyed, they looked so fake, maybe three feet above Ed Wood. Some visitors from the future have time to travel to Japan to insist that Godzilla be destroyed since it was first discovered. In fact, it was first discovered as a survivor of the dinosaur during the Second World War by protecting the Japanese crew on the Pacific Island from those American soldiers. But later with atomic testing on Bikinis, Godzilla, a friendly dinosaur, like Barney, became the middle machine we used to know in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Of course, you are excluding Godzilla from destroying Japan, so it will not become the economic colossus that was in 1991 when the movie was released. I do not say anymore, but we all know that Japan does as well as in 2010. <br /> <br /> Just like all the other Japanese monster films, just sit back and enjoy the chaos.
