Okay, I've heard little about this movie, so when I came to the TV channels on TV, I wanted to watch it because it's a horror fan. I think I can do a collective "huh"? for anyone who watched it. I decided to continue life, but at a party with our closest friends we saw that it was coming and some of us had already seen that we decided we could laugh our way through it, both of us claim, "this is the deepest a thing I've ever seen. " It was not frightening; I'll give it to Roth (which I think is a young hack); characters change throughout the movie, but "Cube". <br /> <br /> But despite the typical scenario of "rat cages" - who turns on, who, etc., it was a fairly average horror. > <br /> Several points: 1.) What was with the boy? I'm not even talking about being weird and biting people. I'm talking about the whole "slow karate kicking," what was it? 2.) I know that Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman I was horrified that he just went ahead and slowed her sleep. Uh, that's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie, so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about insignificant writing of yourself! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So she was immediately detached from the dog? And there was little blood left? Just a scrap of jeans? Anyway, we say goodbye and I like laughing in horror films (The Return of Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I do not know if we should laugh here ...
