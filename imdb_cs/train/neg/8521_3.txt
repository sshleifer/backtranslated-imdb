By the way, it delivers some of the plot, by the way. Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that will teach you the value of Christmas and just enjoy your holiday. This is not the case. He tries to capture Charlie Brown's emotions, there's even another Christmas game, but he fails with faint and easy jokes. Charlie Brown no longer remembers Christmas, but instead wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying figure in the movie. Here is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but she does not know how to write Charlie (for some reason she must be in her letter), so instead she decides to name Sam because she knows how Sam's spell. Sally also plays an angel in the game in one word a day: "Hark!" Instead, he says the har har. If Sally says twelve times (all strangely sounding the same thing) will not kill you, nothing will happen. Pepper Patty and Marcy are a great focus, but it barely makes it better. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. It sounds like a boy (who does not get rid of the reputation) and crazy when the sheep must be in the game (terrible baas and everything). Apparently she is a sheep every year and is concerned that she will forget her lines (lines she does not have). He is so concerned that he will mention it twice, one after the other, and he will get the same answer. I suppose it must have a short-term loss of memory or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has unpleasant advice), but they barely have much to do. I'm sure Schroeder is not even here. Overall, he tries to be a parasite to the original, but threatens the message for a few short laughs.
