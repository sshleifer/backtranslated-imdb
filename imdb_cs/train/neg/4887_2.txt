The first movie is pretty good. That's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Recycle a lot of records (including opening titles and titles) from Criminally Insane. New videos shot on video really sound like bad videos. The scenes do not contain proper lighting, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are also video faults such as a photo and so on. Like any bad follow-up, it essentially repeats the story of the first one. Ethel kills everyone who shares their living space, often because of the reasons they share with preventing food. <br /> <br /> At least it's just the DVD in the first place, which also includes the film of the same director Satan's Black Wedding. It's a shame not to include Death Nurse.
