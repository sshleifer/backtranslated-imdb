Vulpine Massacre should make this movie a real title. And the brand should read "Guaranteed your children CRY!" This is a natural drama that tells the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote area.

He seems to be getting pretty good and is a beautiful, merry musical score that accompanies him ... And then he dies ... We still have one of the sibling adventures. And then he will die ... One of the sisters gets a screen ... and then he dies ... And it's like a horrible movie of slasher when another fox is killed out of nature, in traps, just up and disappears, and even lots of snowmobiles! By the end of the film, almost all the foxes were massacred. Even though there is no death on the screen. (Not only in the version we saw.) Unlike "Tarka Otter," the deaths in this movie are almost insignificant and bordering on the sadistic in the direction that hopes are built and then thrown out. One or two losses would be acceptable. It's finally a natural movie. But not nearly the whole family. Do not stand to see this movie cheated with a cheerful box to think it's safe for kids. Look at it with some preliminary knowledge that things * will not * go well and that you or your children may feel very bad depending on how you are or are sensitive. You may like it. Or you do not have to ...
