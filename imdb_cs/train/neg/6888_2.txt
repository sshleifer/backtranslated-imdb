This movie is badly conceived, badly acting, and poorly written. Jon Heder is terribly annoying and can not escape the same ritual of Napoleonic dynamite. Self-esteemed and ignorant. Besides, Diane Keaton plays the same monster, an over-obsessed mother who cares too much, and yet it's not enough about the lives of her children (see I've said that). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, even though she likes her in general, also plays a bad idiot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is acceptable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to keep the soul.
