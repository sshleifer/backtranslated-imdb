Well, I honestly do not know why everyone thinks it's so great. It's really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie. 1. Jack's performance was very good, I can cover his hat for him. 2. Danny's performance was good. None other than that he is stupid enough. What about Stanley Kubrick thinking he was preparing Shelly like Wendy? It was so bad. She looked the same every time she feared. The problem with this movie was over. I would have been more respectful if Kubrick had finished otherwise. And the whole movie was just stupid. The problem with the film is that the book was much better. So you can not see the movie read the book and you'll be much better. 3/10.
