I'm going to a lot of movies, I often bring my five-year-old son, I'm so glad I did not bring him to this. There are many references to sex and skin scamping scene, however, this is not the main reason why I would not get to it. Trailers lead you to the belief that it's a cheerful comedy; however, virtually all fun moments are in thumbnails. I still wondered when it was interesting, fun or anything but serious; but I almost fell asleep as the story unfolded without a conspiracy. I understand that dogs can be a great company, that is to say, the whole story focused on a badly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train. If one caused so much damage and confusion that would be forbidden. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson is the loss of their talent. The best way to summarize this movie is to get a couple in the wrong dog, a couple fall in love with a dog, a dog dies, a couple sad. End.
