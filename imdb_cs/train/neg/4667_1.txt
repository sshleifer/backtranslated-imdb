Visually overcrowded, plot less, incredibly stinking waste. Not close to Greenaway's better work. Avoid at all costs! Overlapping "split screen" effects will be nothing more than confusion, the film is very dark for many years, and "artistic" painting is under extreme conditions. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; even nudity is incredibly unwise, which sees that it fills a large part of the film, soon becomes very boring. Moreover, as somebody can say Ewen MacGregor's acting is brilliant, he is outside of me. He showed more abilities in the Star Wars series, and he says something. <br /> <br /> Since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and Little People', I was not so overcome by the movie!
