"Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in Peruvian Amazon in 1955, a year later he left the jungle ... naked." It took him 45 years before he returned. "Probably" keep the river on the right "is a" modern story of cannibals. "In fact, anyone looking for a view of cannibalism will be sadly disappointed, the first half of the film is more like the New Ginuea travel journal, half of it relies on static photographs of the Peruvian tribe of cannibals, but it really is about it.Of course, if you are interested in domestic movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum will introduce his ex-lovers, I will give in. Great disappointment and not really a "modern cannibal story.
