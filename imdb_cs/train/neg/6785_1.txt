> You are warned that this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. The best direction was that the images were well thought out. actors were very good especially Richard pryor tho I would like to see him more about him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classical. Dudley God bless him better. John Ritter again would like to see more about him. In my opinion, this lack is entirely due to the failure of the writer. Maybe the manufacturer could pull the plug once he found out what he was doing. It's simply bad that so much money went into this boiler when it was a little change here and there, in my opinion, fix it. They had to pay the writers a standard rate. Create one taste.
