I was expecting this film to play in great anticipation. Assuming it was more accurately portrayed as a "Christmas Box" based on Richard Paul Evans' book. I sent many emails to my friends and family and asked them to watch this show and hoped they would better understand the small amount of my "new" life. After seeing this movie I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003, and she really knew how the pain was happening, I was hoping that this film will illuminate parents who "think" that they understand the sadness that the parent is going through by the one who lost the child. This movie was a film with a very light heart, and the stupidity of Diana Keaton was faint in the face of parents who buried a child. It was very unrealistic from start to finish. I had a few calls after the film, each of them calling the same: "It was so out of the mark and it turned out that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to the songs on the radio and life is back" What a bunch! Obviously, director and Keaton never lost a child because he would NOT have the film so badly out of the mark. I think it's Hollywood.
