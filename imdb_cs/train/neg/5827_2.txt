Do not give the impression of other reviewers that they smell this film because it's ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which morally is not worse than American meat trade or Scottish haggis), smells because it's a demanding tosh, the kind of its rise that gets the modern art bad name. That means there are some amazing pictures, but in average bus rides are stunning pictures if you use your imagination so there is no reason to go and see this nonsense. What's happening in the movie is very slow and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a gutted cat, and then, when you think it's done, it starts again. I saw it in a porno cinema in Rome, which was hired for a Barney movie show at a weekend, an admirable and clever way of getting what was once a local fleece of dirty old men in the mask of a brigade, but if fashionable young men and mildly older birch fans Bjork should be honest, everyone could have much more fun if they just showed one of the porn!
