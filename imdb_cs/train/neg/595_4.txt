Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, that's all for this movie. No real plot, no plot. No fabulous characters, well, "characters" are wrong because you have no idea who is really real. I mean, they're being chased by some strange search "thing" in the canals (who is this thing? Why is it there?) That's pretty scary, I think, but I really do not care? No no. Why not? Because I have no idea who those people are, and I do not know if I want them to live or die. It's one dimensional and relies on gore and sound effects that scare you, which is seldom happening. This film lacks any sense, no purpose. I feel I fell asleep and missed 45min. They jump right into the action. Basically, some women and her friends get locked in London's metro, haunted by a strange creature, and eventually get out of it. Creep has its moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is great and the sounds are fine, but that's not what makes a decent horror film so unfortunately it's all going to waste. It's nothing new. Another predictable modern "horror," where Kate (the leading figure) is always making a stupid "hey, I know you're sitting a lot at home, you think I should do a reasonable thing in this situation, but no. I do not want to do it, it's so many times, it's boring and predictable, I'm really angry that a silly woman was not stabbed, erm, a gray alien creature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> want something original and clever, avoid.
