It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's (I think) the story of a rebel basketball player, his dwarf, his girlfriend and colleague (played by Michael Margotta) who has permanent nervous disorders. The story goes nowhere, there is zero character development, nobody cares about it, and the performance, with the exception of Bruce Dern as a coach, is terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent such as Jack Nicholson could drive such a terrible movie. Avoid this turkey.
