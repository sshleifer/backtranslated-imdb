First let me say that I am faithful to Fanpro. I see this as a way to continue the good show long after its cancellation. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of dignified efforts. So I have a fake place for fan-pro stuff, which means I'm going to overlook things that I would have badly stuck. <br /> <br /> So on ST: HF. Well, good things first. Enthusiasm is a big part of every show being believable and, in large part, it seems that the crew of different ships have their time with their roles. Furthermore, the effects are not bad for home-beer efforts, with nothing that really frightened you. Stories are not too bad. Nothing extraordinarily innovative, but strong enough and at least there are storylines. <br /> <br /> But it has a lot of mistakes. <br /> <br /> First, though obvious, downloading Star Trek shots, setting backdrops, music, and effects, I see no reason why they decided to get rid of virtually all other science fiction songs that have ever been done. Everything from aliens to starboard soldiers is at one or the other point of the orchestral head. Just as much of a shot comes from other movies, CGI listened to it so different. For example, the gray warships, even though they are camouflaged, are Star Wars wars clearly. The station is also apparently the Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. Similarly, in the space fights between fighters, sound effects from different star films as well as animated shots appear. In one scene in the first or second season, I think you even see two TIE fighters in the fight that hardly cause your suspension of mistrust to have any advantage. The actions differ from reasonable to terribly painful. Everybody improves as they advance in the season, but they expect a lot of pop-ups on the screen, especially in early seasons. They have also made some interesting decisions. Let's say the food replicators on this show seem to be permanently set to "pie" and leave them on it. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are generally quite effective as a whole. But they really should not ruthlessly feed on the death of a man who has decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for something other than for background or "walk" use. They are just beyond realism. Each time I saw one of them (except I was not trying to make a big mistake), I kept expecting that the unfortunate soul was wearing a gun and announcing that "it's coming!" In one scene, "Cardassian" actually speaks when one of them is wearing. Not only does her lips move, but the mask does not have a hole where the mouth should be. Someone has to be hard for that. They could not take a craft knife, for good! There are also some well done but inadvertently funny make-up work, such as Herman Munster look similar. Writing, though coherent, is nothing new. Instead, the script runs as a continuation of the DS9, with ships coming out of the DS12 on various missions. The new enemy, "Gray," is not too threatening, and the plot of conspiracy that involves them is really a reworking of Borg threads. the Starfleet meets the Gray, the Grays are immensely powerful, the Starfleet is barely escaping with its life, then by technology it starts to find ways to fight the enemy, etc., etc. All before with Borgo. The cost of the dispute is dialogue. Star Trek writers have long been able to write "insert technobablu here" into the script. Usually, this means interpreting the latest plan to fight the enemy using "quantum phases of discrimination" or "isolytic accusations", etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you that the case and solution is at hand. > <br /> The words are really insignificant. I have no problem with it, but where ST: HF is messing up, it's a place where they contain comments from the real world into this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice like "We have to regroup" sounds good but not when the trio penetrates the group already. Similarly, the question of what is the situation is a tactical officer who replied: "We count three battleships." Does it really have to count them? Come on! I expected the questionnaire to ask, "Are you sure?" or "You can double check". But my favorite comment is as follows: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we create two-way communication?" Comms Officer: "No, we can only send and receive .." <br /> <br /> Well, rainbow! ..... <br /> <br /> After all the aforementioned events, the show improves when it goes on. Seasons 1 and 2 are bad, 3 shows improvement, but 4 and 5 are where they are getting better. Season 6 seems quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with selecting media for shows though. Quicktime is annoying, honestly and the sooner they move to the divx / avi format, the better. Some of us really want to take our downloaded shows and watch them on a decent size screen, not a peer in a small QT window on the computer monitor. Not only does Quicktime make it harder, but the 320x180 resolution that's in the show is fine, it's not a benchmark at all. In fact, it makes the shows quite incoherent, as if they were the tenth generation of VHS tape tapes. The smallest thing they could do was include the hi-res download. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show promises and I even start to like some of the characters. But that's 40 episodes on, so I'm not sure it says much about character development at all. But what can you say is free .... <br /> <br /> PS: Out of 28 votes 19 people were rated 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... did we watch the same show? Or are you 19 all three years old?
