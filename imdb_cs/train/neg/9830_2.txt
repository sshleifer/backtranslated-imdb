I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who rated this film as 10 are highly Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian film, I recommend this movie. If you are looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you will have to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I was angry with the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that learning morality without teaching that it was Jesus, which is the foundation of morality, is in itself bad. One scene shows that the main character tells the boy that he is wrong to steal, and then continues the figure that it is Jesus who taught us. I have found an insult: do we believe that you will not "come" from Jesus? I suppose he wrote ten commandments? And before that the theft was acceptable? I rented a movie from Netflix. I had to realize the nature of the movie from the comments. Oh, okay.
