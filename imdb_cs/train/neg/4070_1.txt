Imagine fugly unpleasant Goth children from high school in a scattering movie, throw at the top of the story and a lot of scary acting and you're still not even close to how bad this movie is. bad, bad effects, worse acting. An attempted attempt at shocking horror. Everyone who has shown this looks a little depressing. Sexual scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they are just something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sexual scene is bad, even before she got to the boy. I'm one of those people who love watching movies that people hate and that's why I chose this. But for yourself, save time and avoid this resistance. It is bad. I literally threw them into rubbish.
