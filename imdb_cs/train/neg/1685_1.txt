All children aged 14-16 want to see this movie (although it is only allowed for 18 years). They heard it was a haunting movie, and when they look they're so cool. I feel very sad kids do not see what a good movie is and what a bad movie it is. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it's impossible for a stupid story to come decent. This movie just frightens you, and if you're a bit clever and familiar with music, you know exactly when you're scared. When the film ended, I turned to my friend and said (a little loud) that it was a complete waste of money, some stupid child looked strange to me. Today I could make an Oscar with my goldfish home video if I'm just using the right marketing.
