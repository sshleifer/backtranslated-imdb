This movie was like "Disney Channel after Dark". Remove the language and motifs "We're not angry," and you stay in the dialogue and plot devices that offend anyone who does not describe Saved the Bell as good-quality television. Dialogue was so ridiculously misleading and deliberately dirty, he might have thought the script was the product of blocking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhy in a room with the command to make amalgams of all the bad scenarios everyone had a hand in creating. If it was Roger Kumble's intention, the mission was over.
