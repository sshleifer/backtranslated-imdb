I'm watching the video rental shop still in shock as Steven Seagal with his record of bad action movies can still have three movies hit the shelves in less than a year. Attack power is 3 or less promised for the first time in the Sci Fi genre for our ever expanding Seagal. I see bad movie fun glowing in front of my courageous eyes. For example, this is not the case of a bit of fun without a movie as bad as it comes. Seagal rebounded a bit with Trashy - but the last of Shadow Man we saw him.However, Attack's power must be his absolute worst film at all! Do not shove for Kill, Ticker, or even Black Dawn folks.This is the bottom of the septic tank. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says it's a return to the Steven Seagal form should be forced to write the word "Taste" for 100 pages. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent / I'm the worst bad ass named Lawson, revenge revenge for killing his team, leading him to a shameful conspiracy to split a really bad drug to unsuspecting public. , that dealers are not out of here. All production from directing to acting is bad. This movie was shot in the dark? It has to be the most ill-lighted movie from Howling 2. The action is terrible and very bad. Producers have also not decided to do what fans hate the most: throwing stunning double blues and heavily dubbed Steven Seagal. it is that Attack Force was not the movie to which Stevie had logged in (originally the Harvester) and certainly must be better than Attack force. The post-production manipulation did not make it more consistent and made Seagal look worse. I feel bad about Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal Pin because they will be considered forever for poorly counseling production. <br /> <br /> So now it leaves Seagal in an impossible position to come up with something that would tempt for this problem. bad Attack Force turned out to really want us to shoot another movie?
