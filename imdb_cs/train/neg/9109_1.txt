The first harsh intentions, the original, is my favorite film of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth they can do the sequel so totally wrong. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first film. This is Amy Adams upset. She's terrible. And they could not find a cat that actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I think, come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is terribly terrible compared to Ryan Phillippe. Sebastian in the first film is negligible, fraudulent and much more ominous than Sebastian in the previous one. And what's going on with the story. It's basically going ... <br /> <br /> 1 - Sebastian has a bad crowd at the first school so the film says even if his biography did not mention him and how he was with the girls 2 - Sebastian moves to New York and suddenly decides to turn. "Loves" with Danielle (maybe I would remind you that in the original Sarah Michelle giller says quotes "you fell apart with the FIRST PERSON you ever loved because I said how he could be in love in the prequel And it's all nice and charming and all the "good person" when he rejects sex from a cat made by his dad. <br /> <br /> 3. He makes a total of 180 and ends up in the trio at the end of the movie and then dodges Cherry. terrible, and I was the first to love so much, I have not seen the third one yet, I hope God is better than his predecessor.
