Wow, I love and respect almost everything David Lynch did. However, this film is similar to the first filmmaking attempt to create a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, but it has little visual artistic content (empty walls, up shot with background ceilings). David Lynch usually takes pride in the sound, but you can even hear the sound of the camcorders. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's very hard to swallow the idea of ​​having something in common with the movie. if ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke on David's side to force fans to search on their website (for hours) just to find this disgust. I hope so, because at least the idea is fun.
