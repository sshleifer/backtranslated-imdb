I think Al Pacino is a guilty pleasure. He was a great actor until it occurred to him that he was seemingly overcrowded. I was hoping that this movie, about which I heard almost nothing to grow up, would be a nice jewel. An overlooked, premature, intelligent and engaging urban political thriller. It's not. City Hall is a movie that surrounds your plot with so many characters, names and "realistic" nationwide problems that you think for a while is a conspiracy so broad and implying that once you find out the truth, it blows up your mind. In fact, however, these subplots and deviations eventually result in relatively terse and well-known street stories, such as Power Corruption, Two-Face Policies, Mafia with Police Connections, etc. And theoretically, this setting allows exciting tension, do not worry that The characters are not safe and something can happen! But again it is not. Unfortunately, the only thing that happens is quite predictable, and we have a few "monologues" of beliefs, which as a whole are perceived as modern of any kind, lessons of the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. the missing messages, and the web of lies and the cover of the audience is usually treated with a somewhat satisfying revelation. I do not think we have stayed with it in the City Hall and, while it's a complete movie, I do not find it very rich.
