I think I've destroyed movies that sound entertaining in one line and eventually equal to what you find at the bottom of the compost. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchery" may sound interesting when it comes to a studio studio, even a "big name cast" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - Blink and Swing) and sparkling hints of Hildegard Knef I do not know, a woman ...). But on the film, it collapses faster than the paper-mache statue in the storm. It seems these unfortunate people are trapped in an island mansion on the East Coast and one of them (a woman I think) is focused on Satan's cult to bear the child of hell while others are in grotesque ways. <br /> <br /> Okay, there's a cross-section of parcels from "Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and several other smaller films in the satanic-worshiping-amok line. None of them is very entertaining, and for the most part you will deviate from scene to scene to the end. <br /> <br /> No, neither Linda Blair nor David Hasselhoff will help. They only have to choose a paycheck, and they do not seem to want to give it to "everyone". Hasselhoff probably wishes to go back to Pam Anderson's backpack (and who can blame him?) And Linda ... well, who knows; celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is today. <br /> <br /> And scenes of torture! Ecchhhh. You see how people are running behind, capturing themselves inside rotating fireplaces, alternating trees with stormy storms, flaming throat, etc. Sheesh and I thought that "Mark of the Devil" is the most sadistic movie I've ever seen. ... <br /> <br /> Do not bother. It is not worth your time. I can not believe I told you the same way I did. If you look at it, you will see if you can count the clich√©s. And yes, Blair is obsessed, as if you did not see that they would be on the main street that the marching band would follow. No stars. "Witchcraft" - These witches will bring you itching.
