Do you like it? Then keep from that ... <br /> <br /> In the early rounds are really good comics, but if they do not have any cute features, they get a chance on the snowballs. Any controversial material and you are OUT! ... and I think I've hurt the same way as the departed comedians when I see who the crooked judge allows. 1 of my best 4 made it beyond the preliminary. Half + finalists laughed at me. Some of them picked up their material elsewhere, something the judges seem to have no problems. It's more fun than a lot of what's still on TV but incredibly hard to watch without considering what it might be like. If the producers changed their name to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticism would be invalidated. Possible idea?
