I went to watching this movie knowing it would not be great. but what I witnessed was terrible for words. I do not mean to be rough, his movie was terrible. overall it was bad, I mean AWFUL special effects, acting was not too bad, but it was not good, and the sasquatch itself was like ... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion, Harry's and Henderson's best film sasquatch. it's not violent or horrible but it has the best sasquatch view. at least his suit and not some semi-rib cgi rip-off. only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate someone in the movie. or watch Boondock saints watches, it's much better.
