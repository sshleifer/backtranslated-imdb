When I saw that this movie was on TV, I really look forward to it. I grew up in the '80s and, like everyone else who had grown up at that time, saw a teenage and summer camp movie every 80s. So I could not wait to see the movie that totally condemns the film genre. What a disappointment !! The film was nothing but a lot of bad jokes and gags again and again, with almost no plot and no substance. And the makers of dark humor attempts failed completely - some of the so-called jokes did not look like anything but cruel and insulting. The only good things about this film were wardrobe, music and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgic trip and see all the summer styles since the 80s, and the same goes for music. And the acting was excellent: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians were present. It is a shame they have no better material with them.
