That's the biggest burden I've seen long ago. When I last hated the movie, I watched "28 days later" and "Magnolia". This movie makes no sense, except that she sees some really bad and twisted sexual / raped scenes, Gillian Anderson is relieved from the side of the road, and every sentence of dialogue has to use the word "F" at least several times in it. It has exceptionally cheap acting and is a very low budget. My friend and I eventually turned off the movie in about half an hour. We tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save him. DO NOT USE!
