Generally, I love horror movies, but unfortunately it fell out of one pound of bargaining basket into the hands of my friends. We sat down to look at them, ready to fear and end up spraying food everywhere we laughed so much. The concept is not that bad, but why it was decided that the number ten in the series would be lucky I do not know. The worst in the movie is the actors. Working with the camera was bad, the special effects are not really bad when I'm generous, but the whole story has failed to connect to any level since the actors were just as effective as a small pile of badly burned elm. It was a wooden mask, especially a young actor who was fifteen years old too young to be seriously defended as any government agent. He looked more like a boy in a public school. There was a really fun sex scene where he looked as if he was talking about apples when his breasts were thrown at him, and later her pants were hysterical, but then I remembered it was not a comedy. I shook my brain desperately to find something positive to say about this film, except for occasional flashing of the breast, but it just is not. Hopefully ten were a happy number and they did not do another, I do not know if my ribs can take it.
