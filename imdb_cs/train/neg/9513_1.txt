I tried to watch this movie three times. I rented it at night. It took about 20 minutes, I hope it would be better if I had a rest at night. I watched for another 15 days, almost vomited as stupid as it was ... It was not even funny stupid, sometimes fun movie watching, but this movie was just a bullshit with S (if you know what I mean censored world in we live). Finally, on the third day I watched more than an hour of stupidity and I did not have a single moment! Neither. How this script got the green color. Oh boy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> </ span>
