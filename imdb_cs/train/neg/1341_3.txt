Following the success of Gilligan's island TV rerun in a TV series, several TV films from classic shows were re-launched in the 1980s. Most of these films completely skipped the ship until it recovered the humor that made the show so strange. MUNSTERS REVENGE is one of the most disappointed because it is the comedy Laurel and Hardy, which really was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, an amazing comedy and series-critical, is totally unnecessary - he has less time in this 90-minute film than every 30-minute episode. And because the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this movie are nothing more than cameras, what is the reason to make them younger and redesign them? With a very small transcript, they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although he saw some of the Munster's spooky relatives, it was a nice touch, I did not like Sid Caesar as a crazy mad scientist, mainly because there are too many of him and not enough undernourished Munsters (ironically that year, 1981, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in much of the RETURN OF BEVERLY HILLBILLIES television show. Another special unexplainable piece at the beginning of the film is the Munster family, represented as wax figures in the local museum of horror waxes. Why would they be there when they should be a "typical" (if strange) American family, not the famous monsters? It was the latest Munsters project in which they played their original roles, and in the late 1980s a terrible revival of the 1990's full-length television series and television film starring DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick's family dining appeared.
