OK, so Chuck Norris has somehow found a way to get this sequel. I have one question - why? Who read this script and said: "Sound is great! Original!" This movie is a regurgitated bull that I would not scratch my toilet with. Of course it is another story that follows in the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so on, in which Chuck Norris is, of course, the only man to can have the same America from some bad people. He does not need a gun. It's a stupid patriotic jargon that builds the mind. The big surprise that the only one who will run this film Norris is Chuck's son Eric. Eric Norris worked primarily on all his fathers of films and television shows. Does not anyone start like a sign that he has no talent for the director? They still manage the same people as before in the same stories as before ... Just a difference in character names. If I had to become a patriotic and a fan of the US, our country is in a much worse form than I ever imagined. Hopefully this will be a nail in a Chuck Norris coffin.
