I thought the main character, an astronaut with a bad case of runs (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) He could always get more film work after being reduced to puddles. All he has to do is get a job like Blob. The premise of this movie is pretty. The astronaut is exposed to sunlight (I think), and so begins to act as an ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only is it a puzzle, but apparently it has to kill people and consume their body to keep some cell integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that whenever a radiation accident or an experiment occurs, does a human being immediately become a killing machine? Why is that so? <br /> <br /> The astronaut goes out of the night from a "secret facility" (who has no security) and sheds some of it when he goes. He seems to have enough memory to lead him to the starter, perhaps because he wanted to go back to space. <br /> <br /> So part of the movie is getting full, with a doctor who wanders around Geiger's counter and tries to find a loud man by going out. Kills a silly fisherman from Bill Gates, scares a little girl from Frankenstein's monster and finishes an old elderly couple (karmically punishes them for stealing some lemons). Then there is a short scene where he takes the former general and a very long scene where he kills a young mug and chases his girlfriend. You would think that when he pulls his hand out and escapes, the scene moves. But no ... we and the woman who slipped into the corner took about ten minutes and screamed furiously, even though the monster was gone. All I could think of was ... the director's friend, anybody? The end of the film is even more relaxed than its rest. The melting man ends up transforming the pile and then ... nothing. And it is done. That's the end of the movie. Well, at least it meant there was no room for the sequel.
