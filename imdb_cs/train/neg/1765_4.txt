OK - helicopter shots are fantastic, and the director has made good use of some of Barcelona's best sights. Otherwise ... in the first few minutes the production value was produced and the rest of the film felt like a film of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun, Abel Folk had the highest depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He must use his martial arts training skills for good use and be a bouncing, bouncing and serious action figure. The rest of the cast was best of wood, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a postcard with action twist and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip.
