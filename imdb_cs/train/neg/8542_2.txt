I work for the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack and THE WITCHES 'MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las brujas) is something like the 17th movie in the set. The film had nothing to keep my attention at all. The plot was disjointed. The dialogue looked improvised. The game was bad. The characters were unmistakable. The best scene is the beginning, with an agitated woman being driven by the burning of her seemingly dirty daughter. However, the only connection that this scene has with the rest of the film is the main character, Mario, who has the most beautiful mustache at all. But that's it. The film was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It is hardly observable - what else can I say?
