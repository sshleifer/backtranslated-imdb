It was a disappointed film for me. He came to me through a box set called "Classic Noir," which was a gift from someone who knows I usually enjoy films made in this style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre). I do not think it's a movie noir. It seems that these days there is a tendency to mark and mark on the market any black-and-white B film made from 1947 to 1955 as a noir and a label is not always appropriate. There is a persecuted male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the movie action takes place inside. These are only the only new elements I've seen. There is no pronounced paranoia or any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was exaggerated and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to devalue this movie for potential viewers. But I would like to hear what other filmmakers noir talk about.
