The author goes on to "discover his" roots "in the southern tobacco industry because he thinks that the" Bright Leaf "is about his ancestor (completely and deservedly forgotten). It is not, and in fact, there is not even a modest interest in this totally stupid and self-proclaimed homemade film, suitable for screening in director-drunk family meetings, but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial issues. A good reminder of why most independent films are not occupied by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant, and are of no concern to anyone but the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
