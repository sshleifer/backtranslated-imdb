I did not like the movie at all. For one I just found it raw and vulgar, for no reason. I felt it was also misogynist (against women). The film also seems to be nothing and I did not find any of the characters to characterize. It does not seem to make sense at all. I have something to look at, but for me this film is somewhat a waste of time when I could do something much more productive and fun. Like my face like a pin. The James Assembly is in this matter just like C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell .all are unnecessary and I'm sure this was a low point in each of their careers. Jennilee Harrison (from the later years of Three's Company) is also in the movie and it's nice to see her in a different role. But besides, it can 't above the average script.for me, Tank is 3/10
