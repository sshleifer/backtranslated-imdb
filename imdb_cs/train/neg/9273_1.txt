The first question that reminds me of tracking this waste is who gave the idiots the right to use the name of Omen on this film? It is a Shambolic, embarrassing, pathetic attempt to continue the permission of the Omen. When the movie starts, the underlying music sounds like it's been raised directly from Bugs Bunny Cartoon, and since then, the movie is getting worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got E - for it when they took him back to show their teacher! After a while, it's hard to say if it's a comedy, because what's happening is so funny and not true to the original Omen that it's beginning to believe. Arranging is ridiculous, especially from front lady Faye Grant. she still holds silly faces, or is it hard to laugh? It is hard to say. The worst sequel I've ever had the misfortune of being a witness. 1 out of 10.
