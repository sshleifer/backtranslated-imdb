this film is designed for the Asian / Chinese market, especially for fans of Jay Chou, one of Asia's largest stars. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a very talented writer / singer. He is average as an actor, although he appeared in several big-budget productions ("The Curse of the Golden Flower"). Amazingly he won both the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and the Hong Kong Film Awards for the "Initial D". Supportive casts are very well chosen, which appeals essentially to all of China. Cast including many famous film and television actors, singers and even sports commentators (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents. The biggest mistake is that Chu assumed both direction and writer. He has the reputation of creating seamless and helpless films based on disjointed scripts. With his bad directorial and lame story, the talented actor, fantastic visual effects and tons of productive money were useless. The horror film, however, has earned more than $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asian countries, making it one of Asia's biggest boxing achievements. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are unnecessary or if you just accompany your kids who are fans of Jay Chou.
