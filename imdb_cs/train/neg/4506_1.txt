American filmmakers have decided to shoot a film that they think is Japanese. The characters are all badly represented, the actors are not Japanese, and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely does not represent Kyoto in the early twenties and thirties. Whoever reads a book understood that the script authors added no more value to resolving the movie from the script. Even worse, they even changed the original fence line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall uses for his two main characters two well-known Chinese actors who joined before when the creeping secret dragon tiger. Marshall probably saw one Chinese film and represented a Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together again makes movies more ridiculous. Quentine Tarantino's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than the movie of this film.
