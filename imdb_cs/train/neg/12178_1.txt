Annie's wig does not look good. she's not cute and pretty good to play Annie. Annie pulls out in the movie because her clothes look like Halloween costumes. terrible and terrible lands. This movie is a change from the 1982 version. I think the younger and younger girl should have a major role. Ashley Johnson shows a very boyish Annie. It is not tempting at all. At least the cast director did it right with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also a miscastast. Camilla Belle played Molly all right. Please note: This movie could offend your IQ, so you just want to show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some plots are too fictitious, and they can hardly take place in the real world.
