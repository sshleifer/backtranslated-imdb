Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to find the courageous one-time film star Greta Garbo and introduce her before Estelle is forever checked. It could be claimed "Bancroft Talks" because the actress is attacking this insecure comic / dramatic / sentimental material for the duration. Hot-or-cold director Sidney Lumet can not get a consistent rhythm, and Bancroft's constant overtaking does not even match the director-he keeps it alright: cute, tearful eyes and horror. Estelle becomes desirous in this scenario (not that this thin concept has a lot more). Silver and Shadow Star Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks ended up with very little work but supported the star and they are all trampled by her hammam. * 1/2 from ****
