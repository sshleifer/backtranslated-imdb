The script was very weak without enough arcs to take care of the characters or what happens to them. The script is too nasty and inadequate gore or actions that even called a slow path. The story goes to the point that you want everyone to close and die as quickly as possible, so you do not have to listen to them and talk about a very quiet and tough dialogue. The technical note is that the musical mix is ​​at a high level and it's hard to understand what most of the time is saying. Then it could be called a blessing. Overall, this story could be better solved in a short movie with a run time of less than 30 minutes. The apparent tribute to Sam Raimi and Evil Dead would be good if it was much softer, but it seemed to look more like bald bald. C'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and that's the best thing to do? Cinematography, lighting design and shots were, however, very well done.
