Unknowingly, I remember Ben from my sci-fi fiancades of the 1960s, doing several interviews and bios of walled actors / actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961, The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people on Chicago's Sci-Fi scene, around 1970 when I had a nice interview with him and his "career" and life. Everything has been published in some long-forgotten fanzine of the day. I wish I could still make copies of those interviews, but the time was marching, and one of those people would have remembered so many years later. Ben was a really nice guy who made a living (The fights of those days did not pay for a guest, unless they were big stars, of course, and even then a maximum of two hundred dollars was paid!) It is good to know that Ben is still alive and kicking! How about a remake of creation, but about 50 years older!
