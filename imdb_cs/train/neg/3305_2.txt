In this movie I can not see what's funny. Humor seems to be destined for corpses. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. Characters do not add much sympathy, a few side characters. There is nothing surprising. What do the writers of this script mean? "Oooo funny, we'll make some old lady tall on the pot, we'll make them ... giggle, we'll make them ... act like little kids!" Oooo, yes, it is totally brilliant and original! "<br /> <This movie made me most irritated by all the movies I've seen in the last five years.
