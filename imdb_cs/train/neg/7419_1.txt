This movie was terrible and offended the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom. In the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is always shown as bad. A Communist sympathizer in Hollywood, most of them as stupid as a box of rocks, loves to take Eugene McCarthy alone and introduce him as the leader of a huge movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered a marginal figure who used the legitimate interest in the Soviet Communists for political gain. Oh yes and the USA brought all the bad Nazis. Just like Werner VonBraun, without which we would not have a space program. He really loved being an American and he was a great contributor to the country. Yet it is ironic that the Hollywood fools, ignorant of many who live fantasy of existence, still believe that the government should run ALL and give us everything we want. Yet it is the same government that has always been a bad evil in such films.
