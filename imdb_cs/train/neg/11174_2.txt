Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watering. Everything I dropped to watch this movie on the cable. I had trouble staying up for 30 minutes. 60 minutes and I pressed the record button and fell asleep. I finished watching the next morning. She should not be bothered. What a waste of great cast and idea that could have been an interesting story about "Day in Life ..." Avoid insomnia if you have a look at this movie. I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of your sleep. Dialogue is terrible. Continuity does not exist. Working with the camera could be done with the Super 8 handheld and looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a complete disaster.
