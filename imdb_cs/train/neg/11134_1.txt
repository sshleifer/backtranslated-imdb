This is a very cheaply executed werewolf. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and badly recorded and mixed. The script is a clich√© driven out of junk with ordinary characters like a tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver weapon! [of course filled with silver balls]. It's played as a wooden character. FX does not exist, lots of extreme jaws and bite jaws. the only thing that is shown is a lot of soft-core T & A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this tripe, we'll look at a really great werewolf: "Dog soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
