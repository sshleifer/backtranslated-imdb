The only redeemed quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comic. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry. In fact, I've seen better work in low-budget porno. Even though I really hired some gay porn on this classical scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: Look at your (together): I'm going to get you behind! The first action sequence shows how terrible the production is, but it's really funny: Good guys have transforming weapons! In one scene, there are all fake subgroups HK MP5. Another scene, AK-47 replicas! And then on top of everything, they do some weapon that alternates between scenes with several M-16s! I think they had a budget shortage for weapons, it's not enough to go between good guys and bad guys. Battle scenes are poorly coordinated and fake like hell. You need to remove the pin / spoon from the grenade to explode alone. You can not fire a rocket triggered by any type of rocket while driving inside the helicopter. The weapons you throw will suddenly not reappear. When the gun is off the bullets, throw it away is still stupid. If you have no idea how to reload them. Large slow trucks that drive around the first gear make annoying action scenes. I really can not believe that such films are really made. This film would be cheerful on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
