A disappointing, predictable movie in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from the state to the state because she can not maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre, "Wherever, But Here" starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better view of the mother / daughter relationship. With better dealings.
