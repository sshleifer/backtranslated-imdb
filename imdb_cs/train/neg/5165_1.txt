I was looking forward to this ride and I was terribly disappointed. And I am very glad to have fun at the riding hall and riding in the amusement park. Part of the roller coaster was fine - and it was about 30 seconds after 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> It was visually boring and badly done. <br /> <br /> Desperately trying to be like a mix of sharper Indiana Jones and Space Mountain and Disneyland rides and failed in every respect. It was not exciting or exciting in the slightest.
