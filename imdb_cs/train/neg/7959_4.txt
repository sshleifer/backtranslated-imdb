Andy Lau plays the next story of police. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for police and is also near the top of the drug gang (Lau). The film starts when we look at the police trying to make a drug bust just to see that it's falling apart. Then we met a young drug addict and her daughter, who lives near Nick and his buddies and cops, and for 45 minutes I turned off the film and gave a message. I look good and great to look at it, it's like I'm an unbiased film, as I've seen a long time ago. It's not so bad that it really does not matter. I think I really did not care. In fact, I started doing something else that I completely forgot to have a movie with subtitles, that's what I did not care about. I wish I could hate the film, but the film is such that it has almost no impression on me (it's not something I could sleep to ignore). Come on a box called Chinese scarface what after being dead? This is one thing to avoid.
