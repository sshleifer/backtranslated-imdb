Seriously. I just wrapped my first view of the Demonicus and the words disappointed me. I remember the time when I saw the name of Karl Bande in the movie and my heart will look. It was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. It was a bastion of hope for a little man. A boy whose videos came to a video rental instead of a multiplex, but they were still rocking more than most fashionable unsolicited ads that we would otherwise have to endure. And now ... this. <br /> <br /> The painfully clear Californian hiking trail doubles for the "Alps" and the abandoned train tunnel is allegedly an "ancient cave". I do not think they even tried to dress things with moss or film to indicate it was something other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a spooky demon gladiator, as the cover suggests, we were treated to a friend wearing the latest Wal-Mart Halloween outfit. There's a nice-looking corpse that occasionally comes alive to slam and swing her fingers, but she does not even learn to stand in the last five minutes. Why can not he be a thief? Instead, we have a Joe brother with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such shakes. I love films that are so bad they are good. Damn, sometimes I enjoy such a bad movie, it's just bad. But this is just inconsistent. A perfect example of how to make money rather than create a high quality movie.
