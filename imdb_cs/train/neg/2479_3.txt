For the first time, I learned about Wendig in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Haunted Stories": according to the story, Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - pulls you, then pulls you to the sky and crushes you. While it sounds like a pretty bizarre idea, Schwartz's story changed it into a relatively coherent idea. "Wendigo" does not. It basically consists of every clich√© of horror: the family moves into a new house and some special things start to do, everyone who damages them is asking for it and everyone should better listen to the old Indian guy. I've seen this as many times as I did not have to count. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm on Wednesday") have done much better than this.
