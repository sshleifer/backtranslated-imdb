Let me start by saying that it does not seem like or feels like a movie. It seems to be just another TV show about popular girls and boys who have no real movie language to support it. <br /> <br /> The angles of the camera are so deep that the story is narrated in the simplest way with it. This film brings us to a place where I have never seen a movie before: to an area where film theater becomes a warm medium that gives the public every interpretation. That's obvious. The big screen is used only as an enlarged television, where we see each attribute of these women in a larger than life form. Recently, young directors seem to be threatening the art of film production. This is very scary. Industry damages art in movies. We have to educate ourselves and our children about what really is about cinematography and its language. Not just sales and fun, but a way of communicating feelings, passions and even cultures. Not as a launch platform for young wonders and jockeys.
