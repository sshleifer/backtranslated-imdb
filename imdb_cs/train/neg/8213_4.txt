I can not believe it, IMDb really has all of the TV shows known to men! I have not seen this show in more than 20 years. I only remember two episodes and I hardly remember them. I remember that Tony might not be from the beginning because one episode I remember is the one in which everyone tries to get Tony to join but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the show he becomes a member of Power House, with every joke. <br /> <br /> The second one I remember is the one from which Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead (with burial and mourning). I do not remember why he is playing dead or how the concert ends. This is one of those ideas that I have convinced myself that I had to dream because no one else heard about it.
