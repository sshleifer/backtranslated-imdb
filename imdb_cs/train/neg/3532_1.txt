It's as if you've taken the general motifs of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, removed all of their style and class and mixed them with the many challenging new waves "I'm an intellectual so my film has to be hard to understand" a garbage creator baked in several extra styles for good measure, cut from the end, you have a revolver. Yes, I thought about it a little after observation, and yes, it made sense to me, but it does not stop it as garbage. <br /> <br /> The waste of money. Waste of time. Right there as the worst movie I've ever seen without being a bad movie news to redeem it a little.
