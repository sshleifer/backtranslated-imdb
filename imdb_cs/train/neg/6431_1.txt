This movie is a terrible distortion of lies and exaggerated words that have put together the most hateful haters to ever work on a television movie. The story is a bad and complete lie. There's nothing in this movie that would exactly depict Senator McCarthy. It's just a terrible scam, and it amazes me that somebody associated with this production sometimes has another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this garbage have done so to attack the man who has been freed from history and the fear that someone would dare to destroy Communism. Unfortunately, for these Communist walnuts, Ronald Reagan took over the place where McCarthy left and could not stop him, the end of the Soviet Union and its "cohorts." You are looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's "Treason," so you can better examine the truth about Senator McCarthy. It will also help you when you read what happened to Senator McCarthy when you read http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
