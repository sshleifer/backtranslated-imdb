I have to say that I was a huge fan of the series. The first three were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a pity because it was a great series that is getting worse. I know they are made for DVD movies, but it would be a bit nice. <br /> <br /> There are no laughs, just a few good unicorns that will bring a smile. It's pretty nudity and very hot chickens. But even sexy things or jokes really do not work. <br /> <br /> To add anything that's RACIST too, or as a film racist, you can do it without asking to be called racists. I'm not one of those people who think that everything should be politically correct. But displaying minorities is very insulting. <br /> <br /> I would not waste any time on this garbage. Check out the previous versions that they will not laugh at you.
