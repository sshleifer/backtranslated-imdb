The standard procedure for Swedish films today begins by throwing sensitivity out of the window and continuing this way for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a movie that makes little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are enchanted by a highly effective "military" gang of robbers. Two police officers will begin investigating a case that will soon become more complicated than it seems at the beginning. <br /> <br /> As usual in the Swedish film, the cast is mostly made up of the same people you've seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt has to be in every Swedish film in the last few years! But that's fine, because Persbrandt is one of the few who works solidly (as usual). Problems with this film mostly revolve around the story itself. First, the robbery feels mostly as a background. It's about a young cop who struggles to make it through the male world (similarly not a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helina). There is also a totally unbelievable conspiracy plot that seems likely to be landing aliens. Still, I thought it was a pretty nice touch because I was half asleep. It's a bit spiced (and really saved the rating before the next step). Finally, the main problem is the same as most other Swedish films of this kind. Simply that actions and tensions do not meet the standards we are accustomed to other films of this kind (mostly Hollywood). It is considered cheap and rather weak compared. I think Swedish artists should try to concentrate more on plotting and acting and forget the "Hollywood action light" attempts, as they are doing now. Because this will become another forgotten effort of the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
