I do not know why, but after all that NPR thought it was a new movie ..... all the best shots were used for the BBC and NatGeo projects you've seen if you're interested in natural programs ... it was overwrapped with playful narration and exaggerated music for Disney to use Earth Day - there are great times and it's always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, .. ......... James Earl Jones talks, but I was hoping that for the film that is the first in terms of the new camera technology used in making this movie ...... was disinfected for a child audience so you can see better shots for free on youtube .... I feel that we are for something like ground breaking like Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is definitely not
