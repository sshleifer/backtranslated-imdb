It was 1974 and played by Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> It says what to expect from this movie. And it was a movie. According to the film, he reformed the word, won a good wife and did not want to fight. In real life, the Word could be naive innocent, or perhaps just want to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Who was or was not Slovo, it's about history, but it was a movie that dealt with desertion at a time when the country doubted why she was fighting and the film the pages. Regardless of the soldiers who were in Vietnam either in 1974 (as Willie Nelson says, let's say the truth is that the Vietnam War, not the Second World War), EoES was propagandistic as Gung Ho was in the 1940s. According to this film, Slovko expressed his position simple and simple. He had a nervous problem. Damn, I have a clinical nervous state, and believe me, if I had a military duty, it would not be a problem for me to just let my nerves go and fail to do my chores and get down to KP's duty or no problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe the phone call, Word did not have this possibility, no doubt because of its criminal history. Whether the viewer wants to believe them on a viewer. I have learned that films from this decade or decade dealing with service or military duty will have the same attitude over and over again. <br /> <br /> 1940s and 1950s serve your country. /> <br /> The 1960s and 1970s, laughing at your country. <br /> <br /> This is history. The entire movie seemed to me to be a predictable Hollywood. He refused to serve, and only when he was forced to execution, he showed emotions. Such an emotional explosion could easily benefit in his statement about his nervous state, but of course the film wanted to show him as a human being, and only when he is about to die, he becomes grieved. I'm not a Catholic, but I thought the hail of Mary Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end, with the Lord's prayer, was funny when it sounded as if they were trying to see who could say it faster. I do not see how this film could be watched without realizing that it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. I hope it was for the Word and everyone who chose to follow his example.
