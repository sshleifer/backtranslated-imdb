While I was never a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to his terrible production values), it looks like Shakespeare compared to the heck of the crap that Hanna-Barber has brought us! Undoubtedly, Scrappy-Doo is the worst and worst figure for children (including both Teletubbies and Tommy Tapeworm). What was the idea to create a short mutant dog and let him talk and then sit down with Scooby-Doo characters? Whoever deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is more appropriate). The result is that the little dog is simply dysfunctional, annoying and nervous about nerves - and that's only in volunteer episodes! After many years, it would be better to stop franchising than create this mess! I see why the Scrappy-Doo Scrappy-Doo in the Scooby-Doo movie that was playing in the live event - because virtually everybody hates it!
