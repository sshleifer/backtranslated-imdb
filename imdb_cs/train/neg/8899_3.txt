Where is it said that the sequel must continue? Scream 2 did not! Others did not! But this one ... problems include horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could act in the whole movie), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on and even have done research on the Nephilim idea before) and just terrible possibilities for casting. Eric Roberts makes the most stupid archangel Michael I've ever seen in my life! Avoid him as a plague if you do not desperately see Christopher Walken. In that case, just fast forward to the part where it is in the movie, and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
