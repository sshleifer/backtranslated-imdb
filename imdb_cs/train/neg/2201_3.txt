Horror / Sci-Fi, which is interesting because it's ridiculous. F / X pretty good ... for what you can see. Made for a television thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant, albeit misleading scientist who tries to overcome stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with a hammer shark. The terrible results gave birth to one hell of a killing machine. A team of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tyl are invited to the remote island to look at a great new experiment. Of course, when you laugh and joke in astonishment ... Coombs's creature, by the way, is his son connected with a hammer, letting himself relax to one after another his father's blade. Revenge is not always a reward. Also in cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
