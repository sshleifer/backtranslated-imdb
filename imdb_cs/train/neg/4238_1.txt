This movie is terrible. At the end, you realize that you have stolen for a few hours from your life that you can not go back. "Twist" is very conceived. The evolution of the character that led to this end is not in line with their final steps to the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the premise that Rob Lowe dies on Christmas Eve - is explained away in just ninety seconds. "No, we just fooled you." Then Rob Lowe is not even angry! "I'll forgive you if you can forgive me," he's as disturbed as he gets. If someone took several weeks to convince me I was supposed to die and then he said, "No, I'm sorry, I just let you down." I would raise serious hell. I do not feel bad when I gave up spoiler because I could save some of you not to watch. Please save and DO NOT USE THIS FILM.
