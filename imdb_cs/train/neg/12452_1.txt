This movie is so bad I can not even describe it. What's wrong with a burning hole with writers, producers and a director? How did they manage to fund this abomination? The story is ridiculous, acting is bad at best, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is fine, but then it is repeated until you want to shut it down. I think I am the biggest voter because I did not turn this stupid film after the first minute. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 in 10, because it is the lowest grade offered by IMDb. <br /> <br /> Make a favor: instead of seeing Uwe Boll ... twice ... it's a lot of your time.
