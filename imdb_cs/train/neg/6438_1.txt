I did not know what this movie was like when I went to the theater to see it (hype about Satanism, etc.) Because the stories in the last movie I saw looked quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Dear Roman Catholic Mythology? It's not my thought of a good fear and sincerely, I just felt like looking at a really good, scary film, not some freely drawn religious farce trying to make cheap excitement by getting a young one bloody every few minutes! /> I try to keep away from spoilers (!) But I was very curious that an atheist who gets a chain of pink beads from a dead priest could suddenly end up with Christ's wounds (are not they stigmatized to be deeply religious?) I mean, that she hangs with the bereaved, lost things, acts like a typical rebelka et al, and here she shows the wounds of Jesus Christ? Lets go! The scenes of her crucified, his head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, after seeing it a dozen times, became rather lengthy. It was not frightening or scary, just nasty. But it was very painful to watch - those flicking scenes were very unpleasant ... CONCLUSION: If your Catholic does not see it. If you are not, you still can not see it.
