This is by far the BEST film I've ever watched. I've seen some terrible movies in my time, but these cake, no, wait, I mean a damn bakery. It's so bad that I believe that the word that will describe the way you feel after watching this atrocity has not yet been created. Please do a favor if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that unpleasant purple dinosaur Barney, then you will multiply it thirty times and you will have only a small part of the horror that you should save for. In summary, I think you can really call it a horror film, but only if you are willing to be scared by the absurd worst businessmen and a totally absurd story. Real Rating, -10 Disappointing
