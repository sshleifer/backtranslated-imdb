This is much worse than the terrible Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 1960s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple rips from the resurrection of Stan and Ollie. The new audience re-discovered comic genius, and cartoons were useless to avoid children's interests. It was possible. But how does one even try to rationalize this work ... I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the creators hoped it would somehow encourage the next Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can not inspire interest in the past with the shallow and unfortunate cartoon of what made the original so appealing. Impressionists (to be called their actors) do the thing vegas and that is where they belong. The plot is even flimsier than those that were used in the old days, trying to decompose the two-reel ideas for the feature. If this movie was the first contribution of REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the audience would reject the reputation of the original duo as senility. The only film I hate worse than this is that I was moving to your grace. And you know, these filmmakers basically did the same thing, Stanovi and Ollie.
