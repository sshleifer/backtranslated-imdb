I got a "low-score" low score, not because it was a bad movie, but because it does nothing worth praising. I have never seen any work of Hsiao-hsien Hou before, but for the uninitiated (including me) "Khih Yik√¥" is advertised as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (Japanese director whose last film was a way in 1962) The film is an extremely thin work ... with very little dialogue, story, music or emotion. Yo Hitoto plays "Yoko" an unemployed, wandering figure who spends his time in his local coffee shop or freely investigates the Taiwanese composer he likes. Tadanobu Asano plays a friend who works in a cd shop and occasionally takes an interest in trains. And that's all. We're watching Yoko drinking the coffee ... walking around ... waiting for the train ... grabbing the train ... asleep on the train. Such a worldly reality that anyone sees in Japan every day. Hou captures these common moments of life of these characters, but without any meaning of these vignettes, it is a totally insignificant film to be made or watched.
