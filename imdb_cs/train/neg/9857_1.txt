I just watched this movie and found it was not fun at all. I'm an RPG player (computer type, no DnD desktop stuff), but I did not find any joke in this funny thing at all. Some of the scenes seemed to stretch a lot (tilt and zoom could be shortened to 5 seconds, rather than a minute) and it looks as if the director was just trying to fill the time. I think I mixed up all the time 2-3 times in the whole movie. The acting itself was not that bad around a standard that should have film B. I suggest that you do not bother with this movie unless you're a huge fan of DnD, and it might even be best to rule out it.
