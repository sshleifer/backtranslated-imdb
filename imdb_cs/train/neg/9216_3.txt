Hoo boy, this was a real test. The DVD Case is wearing Tom Hanks' paint, and that's the only reason anyone would buy it. He looks about forty on the box, however, the film was made in 1982, so he still has his Bosom Buddy 'and make it about forty pounds lighter. The plot concerns Dungeons and Dragons as a game that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks finally thinks the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is a guy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the film is that he wears a series of fun hats. Ooh, look, she has a yellow blanket with a tuxedo! He is now dressed as a WWI pilot! It was a terrible movie, but the wrong way. Lots of vets usually appear as children's parents. There's Anne (I'm Honey West, damit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who look really hot. Murray Hamilton, the Mayor of Jaws, is grateful to be a cop. Wendy Crewson, is a love affair for Hank and some blonde guy I have never seen before. There and there is some syrupy music and absolutely no tension or feeling of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because it is, you know, nuts. Monster plays later, spectacular Kevin Peter Hall, who has the glory of Predator. My friend got it out of the shopping mall at MallWart and advised me not to put him in the basket without looking at it, so naturally I had to see if it was as bad as it was all. It was. I've been watching Apollo 13 before, so this movie was a bit of a shock. Make a favor and leave it in the basket. Yeah, after Hanks almost jumps out of one of the World Trade Center towers because of his delusions, he goes home to recover and his friends visit him. Hanks' mother, drunk, Vera Miles, says they're getting close now, but when they go down to the lake and visit him in tennis, he's more crazy than ever before. End
