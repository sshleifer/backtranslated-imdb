The story behind this movie is very interesting and generally not so bad ... but details: writing, directing, continuity, stimulation, action sequences, stunt games and the use of CG make everything cheaper and spoil the movie. br /> <br /> First, action sequences. Everyone is quite hateful. Most consist of someone who stands and is shot without trying to run, fight, avoid, or anything, even though they have all the time in the world. Sequences are insignificant for someone who was made in 2004. CG contains very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they look cheap because of how they are used. <br /> <br /> Stimulation: everything is happening too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a few hours, and can backflips from the beginning, etc. Why is it so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the movie. Like Lilith might not be able to come back - maybe she could not because she had wings. We also have the sequence as a woman who got into the car, getting up and just walking into a deserted room with a washbasin and a mirror, and then slamming her throat without any obvious reason and without the viewers actually taking care of it the car hit (and then felt the side effects of another, exploding car) ... "Are you all right?" asks the driver "yes, I'm fine," she says, bloody and upset. I watched the whole thing because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, the bad execution forced me to something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even the vampire movie where Jackie Chan was a comic relief because they managed to stop my distrust, but that only wanted me to give the writer a good interview.
