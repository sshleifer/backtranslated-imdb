This film is not worth a few minutes to criticize, but I know that many people like me rely on IMDb.com to help make decisions about movies. That's why I'm writing it myself. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like the 1976 Asian version of "The Incredible Torture Show" (http://www.imdb.co.uk/title/tt0077247/). Torture, disintegration, murder, cannibalism ... it's definitely the case with the third-degree scenario, the pathetic behavior and the perverse failure of the black comedy attempt. The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There are lots of girls in the movie who are terrified by the massacre of dogs on the market but are sexually enthusiastic about going to porn. One girl who is disgusted with dirt in the toilet, moments later is still there with her boyfriend friend (as he even got inside it could be the only eye-catching thing about this movie.) The film is absolutely terrible, even for B-film . Even if you downloaded it for free, it would be an insult to the hard drive.
