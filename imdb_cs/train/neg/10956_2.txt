I bought this movie from the Gamestop discount, which was used in the movie basket, and the cover caused me to laugh at me uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is slowed down and used as ten different monkeys throughout the movie, which barely looks similar. Not to mention that they use a stunt couple who is just a short costume boy who is trying to make a monkey in a desperate way. The director more than likely committed murder-suicide with a chimpanzee after the film debuted in a preview for some of the other low-rent Warner Bros. film and he ended up owed money to the studio. It also does not help that he was not infamous because of the terrifying work he did, nor was he known to produce films with a bumpy. Why was the film shot at all?
