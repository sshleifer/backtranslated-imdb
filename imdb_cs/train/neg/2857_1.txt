I've seen a lot of Sci-Fi Channel Original films since I started watching them in 2002 (My first one was Sabretooth - which is, in my opinion, one of the most entertaining Sci-Fi channels). Their quality differs. Some of them are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry, Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously bad and some are really terrible. Planet Raptor lies in the second. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a free follow-up to the sci-fi Channel Original Raptor Island in 2004, is a barely observable disorder of the film with truly horrific acting and lazy scenarios. The effects that bring dinosaurs to life (a combination of puppetry and animatronics, as well as CGI and Raptor Planet series footage) are some of the worst effects I've seen in a low-budget movie. Gore effects are even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot includes a bunch of comandos who for some reason (I forgot why) travel to the planet of alien dinosaurs. These are real people, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in the Universe. What's up, sharks in the universe?!? The rest of the land is simple. The human cast is selected and eaten. Now we are waiting for it in the many dinosaur films and novels that are released, but this is the first dinosaur movie I've ever seen, where I really bored all the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> There are a few laughs. There is one scene that excels in having a brown Carnotaur (brought to life in the footsteps of a movie from the original film), who will become a giant rapper in a few seconds. Also a little trivia, this is the scene where Steven Baur shoots on his own death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie, it's his masterpiece compared to his sequel. Trust me when I say it's maybe the worst movie Syfy ever broadcast. It's unfortunate.
