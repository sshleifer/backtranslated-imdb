A young professor of genetics, who plays basketball, conducts research on genetic sequences using human fetuses. He hopes he will be able to find the cure for all diseases and aging. He exerts pressure to close his research because he did not publish, so the university has difficulty in justifying funding (I think). He's doing a trial injection of a monkey who dies quickly. He's trying it on himself. The relationship with a free mother of a very annoying little boy begins; she was the one who demanded the results of the research. <br /> <br /> It seems that initially no injections have any effect, except for some new forces. He then realizes that he has some memory loss and begins to remember what has happened. In addition, it begins to appear very unhealthy. Since the film is called a metamorphosis, it will eventually turn into something else. You will not believe your eyes - whether it's happened or an absolutely miserable costume that the actor wears to tell what he has changed. There is an incredible change in the store - the end of the movie is really, really absurd. The only thing this movie is about is that Laura Gemser is in it, but it has a very small part. <br /> <br /> I once saw a box with a camcorder with carved plastic on the box. Perhaps it could even have some electronics in it at once, maybe the eyes that light up (the eyes of the main characters sometimes green in the movie). The copy I tracked had a box that showed only tear marks, where the adhesive held plastic that had been removed. A box of news, if it still had, would be the only reason I would stick to this film; I'm sure I'll get rid of him.
