I went to this movie and expected it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, the plot is misspelled (with animated CG cells and boot peptides). However, the real focus of the film is "expert" talking heads, which result in a new age, as they are well spent among land segments. Of course, they are guilty of innocence. At first there is a bit of real quantum physics. It states, for example, that electrons exist as particles and waves, and that the atom is mostly empty space. However, the film has a huge (and unscientific) leap, stating that sub-atomic quantum effects also take place in large scale. Talking heads are still there. <br /> <br /> When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see their ships because their minds were not able to perceive anything so different. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. - With positive thinking, you can walk around the water. -Your thoughts can change the formation of ice crystals in bottles of water. And hey, it's only in the first 40 minutes! Watching the movie was torture. This movie felt like a movie that would show you to connect with the cult. After I did my homework, I realized that it was basically just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be seen as a camping comedy (even if it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Save time and money: this movie is not displayed.
