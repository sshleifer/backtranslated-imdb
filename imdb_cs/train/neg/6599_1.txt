Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a respected actor. Virtually every film he was about is the better. Now George has nothing to do with this movie ... but once he said something that describes the movie to T. I do not remember his exact words but basically said that great writing can save bad acting but great acting can not save bad writing. This little observation has never been more true than in "All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy: For Love or Mom". The casting of two wires was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look at the work but excel in a good job of imitating a real deal (mana and everything). This film should stand as a permanent proof of their talent. This means that this movie falls on your face when it comes to it (you think it). WRITTEN. In addition to the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (who was very "in character") and a brief gag with a taxi, this film is an absolute job to sit down. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I do not want her to know why the mummy wants to kidnap a nice British lady. I wanted to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their stand-ings). Too much time on the screen has been devoted to explaining conspiracies or not-very fun secondary characters who are plotting around. However, even if this movie is all jokes, we are ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: Most jokes are what I would call "watering" down. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watering"? <br /> <br /> In the slapstick, the character gets injured in an exaggerated way for a comedy effect (a Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ... or what about Laurel & Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In the "licked" lump (as I have defined it), the character is slightly wounded or uncomfortable, and the creators play it for a comic effect. <br /> <br /> Maybe it would help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd. His account drops, and he inserts it again. This is a classic ghost. <br /> <br /> In this "gem" Ollie accidentally encounters some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful and continue his merry journey. It's not a ghost. It's not funny either. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of these jokes. It's like this bread and butter of this movie. Writers and directors just take these tedious moments and behave as if they should be funny. I give an example that I have just given, this is the most extreme case, but I can only reduce it for so long. <br /> <br /> Long Story Short: The film simply does not work because the script can not make money for Pinchot and Sartain's ability to pretend to be Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script capitalizes the interpretation of the drawing and funny jokes. Watching this movie is basically a follow up of two great impersonators who have not been given any real material to work with. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie but an incredible sleep aid. one you miss and hold real dealings (just as long as you avoid "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
