I watched this movie last night after many good reviews from many sources. I would like to emphasize that if you are not ready to try to constantly develop who he is and what it means, you will hate this film. I'm still trying to understand the role of the actors in this movie jumping film from different stories and does not really allow you to empathize with any role. For the political enthusiasts and those interested in corruption in other world governments, this movie is probably quite good, but the average film observer is embarrassing, very boring in places and you let the cinema bewildered and angry that you have paid the entry fee. <br /> <br /> 100% for every minute of detail or politics you are interested in. you do not see if you like watching movies.
