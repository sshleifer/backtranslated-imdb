The team of husband and wife Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley presented giant stars in vaudeville, but made very few films. As well as some other artists of their time (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible piece of film recording for Fields and Seeley biopic ABOUT US, in which they are portrayed by other actors: "Someone Loves Me", plays Betty Hutton and the inimitable singer and singer Ralph Meeker. During their flowering, Fields and Seeley were so immensely popular that another marriage and female actress - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - had almost the same success when playing an almost identical act and effectively becoming the "second team" of Fields and Seeley. However, behind the scenes, there was a great difference in the spouse's way of life. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying for room service for every meal they ate and eventually exhausted. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their wages wisely and ended up in a comfortable retirement. The first 30 seconds of this short Vitapon is occupied by two pianists, and these two men seem to have somewhat of a value in 1930, though I have never heard of them. Eventually Fields and Seely hurry and start playing. Both have plenty of peppers and are quite attractive. I was disturbed that the two artists are still making moves as if they wanted to break into dance, but they never did so until the third of the three songs they performed in this short play. When the hoof finally starts, the results are not impressive. I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major artists doing their job. Now that I saw it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this: just 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and Sully.
