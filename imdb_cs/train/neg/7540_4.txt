The wicked man who plays Nicolas Cage is by no means a good film, but I really can not say he does not care that he regrets me. I could continue the negative aspects of the movie, such as horrible actresses and lengthy scenes in which Cage seeks a girl, has hallucinations, followed by hallucinations, followed by a dream sequence - with hallucination, etc., but simply does not want to deal with it it's such a movie. Instead there are five reasons why you should watch The Wicker Man, although it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny he has some really scary ideas, the only problem is in his cheese, unintentionally funny executions. If nothing else, it's a movie that can inspire you to see an original 1973 movie or even read the story on which it's based. <br /> <br /> 4. It's really aesthetically pleasing for cheese / thriller. It is quite obvious that it was shot on the spot instead of using a green screen or complicated sets so we could see some great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It's a very good looking movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not an actor because he is a natural force. Whether you are a fan or not, it looks like it's impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". There is always some eccentricity or dullness that brings to the characters she's playing, and personally, I'm always fascinated by watching him in every movie he's doing. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into the game and is never boring to watch. He is terrible in the Prut, but in the most beautiful species. <br /> <br /> 2. The student would probably have written hell for this film because it seems to be the strongest antifeminist film ever made. "See?" you could write, "that's what happens when women are allowed to run a company!" Similarities between this "Summersisle" and the honeybee are quite interesting and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 1. If you read it, you were probably right that you may have seen a very popular YouTube video: a collection of "the most striking" films, including Cage running in a bear suit and, of course, the infamous "AAGHH! BEES! MY EYES !!! " line. These scenes are merry from the context and are still quite funny when they are watched throughout the movie. I bought the used DVD in Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you work, it's about a dollar to reason. It's a pretty good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The unrated version of the movie is best watched, and it is better to watch the theatrical version just for its little added epilogue that includes a portrait of James Franco.
