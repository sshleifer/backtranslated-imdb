In spite of the sterling work of supporting actors and the intelligent script from Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal mistake - lacking the spell of the central character / actor. One of the characters characterizes the character of Richard Evan Grant as "the whining of a small turd" and unfortunately it sums it up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance to make it trustworthy that his girlfriend and publisher / friend of a higher class would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is crude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly annoyed. Part of it has called for an actor who can love you, even if he's nice - like Ewan McGregor. All funny satire on the class system, etc. It was useless, thanks to this irritating and totally dissimilar performance. All I wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself.
