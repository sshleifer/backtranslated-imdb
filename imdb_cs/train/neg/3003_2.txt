We all know that countless crazy hobbies are famous for the genre of the 80's slasher, and often deserve only the deepest disgust. Maybe it's a bit hurry but damn if "Slaughter High" was not terribly non-original, even for a shorter movie. It is quite a matter of being a child who has experienced a shower of hunger in high school like Carrie, and returns to a disturbed building to avenge a group of former bullies who have all appeared. As you expected, April 1 is constantly killing a masked madman with electric current, burning, hanging and chemically altered beer. I have a lot of trouble with the details and settings of this movie, but because it's over, I feel the need to get rid of my complaints and just say it's a complete waste of time. Ignore any idea to view this movie ...
