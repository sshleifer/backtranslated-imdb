Watching Marlene Brando on the screen is like watching a carpenter's master who has made complicated mahogany details. Brando's acting is the only thing that makes this movie traceable. The plot is sad and ridiculous (not comical). The second big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give figures that portray some modicum of mankind ... these figures have humankind wet board. Everything about the technical side of this movie is either average or just terrible. The director deliberately throws shots of frost and slow motion. Random music is caricature and destroys all signs of a dramatic effect. It's not something I really seek in the movie, but even the closet was so far away. Reverend Brando could not concentrate away from the gruesome rags that had set him off. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "disrespectfully funny" ... it's not one. David Lynch's films carry bad creativity - this film was not at all creative. And do not confuse unbelief with stupidity.
