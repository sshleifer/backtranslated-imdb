How cynical writers are, it's a panda. Maybe I am an American citizen, but I do not need to see other Americans throwing and throwing an hour and a half to get a chance to enjoy the film. I am amazed that few people have spoken about how truly dialogue is absolutely jingoistic, sentimental, and frustrating in this film. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as crude and insulting as the "U-571" (which converts British submarines into the US), but you are still leaving a bit slimy. Indeed, the Germans in this film have nothing but admiring the Americans between the battle scenes! How sad, useless! I would like to say to the writers: For many of us, it is obvious that you can not capture real people, real problems, under real pressure and that you have taken some very well-tested shortcuts. Luckily for you, it will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar coat.
