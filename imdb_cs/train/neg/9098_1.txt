There is a reason why some movies point directly to the video, and obviously the obvious reason is that if it is too strange for theatrical viewers, then it goes directly to the video. Of course it will not really be fair for movies that are good and yet they are also released directly to the video. This is no exception, although the film has good actors or at least actors with the potential: Amy Adams (nominated and talented actress from Oscar), Robin Dunne, who deserves a better or better agent, and Sarah Thompson deserving a role, leaving the teen melodramas. The film is also flawed: this movie takes place in front of cruel intentions, and that's why this film is really prequel and rather stupid. It was a waste and indeed a movie that is on the same level as fine core movies and masturbation with pay-per-view. Fortunately, for the actors, hopefully they will be able to erase it from their biographies. So if you're looking for something dirty, but you do not have the courage to buy porn, then arrange this movie as a starter.
