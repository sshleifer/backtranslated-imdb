The man will bring his new wife to his home, where his former wife died of an "accident". His new wife has just been released from the institution and is also very rich! Suddenly the sounds begin to sound and the skulls are seen everywhere. Are they crazy again, or does the first woman return from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed the end, so I will not say it. I have seen it many times on Saturday afternoon television as a child. At that time I liked it, but I was young. I see it now, I realize how bad it is. It's terribly eleventh, poorly written, very boring (even in an hour) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (one is a director)! It still has some good things. <br /> <br /> The music is a bit scary and the setting itself with a huge empty house and a nearby pond is pretty atmospheric. There are also a few scary moments (I jumped a bit when she saw the first skull) and a bit of an effective end. Overall, this is certainly not a good movie ... but not a complete disaster. It has a small cult. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the release of Elite DVD Drive - in its release (it's paired with "Attack of the Giants Leeches"). It's a TERRIBLE shape with jumps and scratches everywhere. It did not look so bad on TV!
