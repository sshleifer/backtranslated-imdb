My title should be enough. This precludes a culture so rich in literary perfection (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) culminating in such horror as the "new vague" film movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic clarity and clever philosophy. But when you pass them on to your camcorder, they start to behave like WOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKING CONSPIRACY? TOPIC? BODEJŤ! YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FILM, PARKING LANGUAGES ARE INTERESTED AND WHOLE! At least it's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the back of the heads of people. Oh-la-la, quel artiste.) No, Truffaut maintains some visual clarity. Likewise, the security camera speeds up. Two are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, as well as the side of all dweeby film school dirty: I bet the veil just jumps from the side of her neck. But do not leave without reading the final sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you will hate it. People who like this movie probably never read any books other than Jack Kerouac sparks or perhaps a "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Or maybe they read the lyrics of The Doors and think they are moving deeply. Whether it sails on a ship. It seems ironic to me that this film raises some (weak) cues on Balzák, one of the best and most important writers who have ever lived. Nice try, truffles. But you are nowhere near the pitch. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film as a syringe infected with aids. <br /> <br /> If you are a type of person who likes to think of Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you are an idiot, Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for pee, push the vein back into your neck. You look like cabbage.
