There's something frustrating watching a movie like 'Murder by Numers' because somewhere inside the Hollywood formula is a good movie that's going to come out. However, there is no savings at the time the credits are being opened up. The whole thing is largely blown off by the "side of the police" story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's murderous detective figure turns into a clumsy sexual matter that is getting slower, the longer the movie continues. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it is not enough to save a large screenplay and lazy stimulation. Ben Chaplin's earnings are lost in a forgotten role (in an undervalued "birthday girl" it did much better earlier), just like Chris Penn, who plays a role so enormously small that you like a talent like himself. Anyway, this story is not even a factor in this movie at all. The two juvenile killers who played Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work quite well and play very well. It's bad they were not in a much better film. Barbet Schr√∂der is a safe place for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom Line: You are a lender if you are a fan of genre, but everyone else will live a life without ever seeing it, with the exception of network television with comfortable advertising breaks.
