Hello from Denmark and one day I had a movie night with friends. One brought this film with him "Russian Terminator" and it was terribly awful. After watching less than half a minute we decided to move forward just to stop some laughs "alert" or I should call "lowlights" in the movie. I was actually mostly surprised to find that this film was made here in my country Denmark ... it had to be the biggest mistake that this country had ever done.
