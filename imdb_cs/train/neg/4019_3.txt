Dakota (1988) was another early Lou Diamond Phillips to play the vehicle. This film is similar to the later Harley movie. There are several differences, but both are the same. I do not know which one came first. I think it will remain one of the secrets of life. But both are the troublesome "children" who turn there, living around. Instead of bicycles, it is a horse. They're basically the same movie, and they're both hell like hell. If you are serious L.D.P. then I recommend the fan to watch them both. You get some extreme assault and pose from L.D.P. if you are a game, go for it. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended, except L.D.P. fans !!!
