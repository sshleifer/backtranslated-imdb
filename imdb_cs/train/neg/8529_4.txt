What boob in MGM thought it would be good to put Clark Gable's cold into the Salvation Army's job? It is ironic that another handsome future star, Cary Grant, also played the salvation army just two years later in a highly overrated SHE HONE WRONG. I think it's fairly easy to see the foolishness of these roles, but I still wonder who thought the men of the Salvation Army were "HOT" and who could look at these temperamental men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. I have been working for the sister organization of the Salvation Army (volunteers of America) for a long time, and I have never seen how some guys work there (and unfortunately I too). Maybe I should work at the Salvation Army instead! <br /> <br /> So, because of the extreme curiosity, it's a good movie to watch, but for everyone else it's bad writing, careless dialogue and annoying moralizing makes a very slow film.
