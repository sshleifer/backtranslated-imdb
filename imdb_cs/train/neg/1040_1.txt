I can not believe that this film has managed to get a relatively high rating of 6! It's hardly observable and incredibly boring, surely it's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> In no budget I reminded Star Wars Episodes I and II for the complete impression that you are looking at a total creative wreck. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those "festival films" that just pleases pseudo intellectuals because they are so badly made by these people that it makes it "different", so good. Bad film is not "different", it's just a bad movie.
