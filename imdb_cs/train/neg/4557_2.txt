OK, it's very rare to complain about what I have for FREE. So I think this movie is overtaking me. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery FREE and left very disappointed. One question of a member of the audience about the director about using Native American links as "bookends" instead of getting better immersed in the film basically says that everything that made this film. <br /> <br /> NATIVE American Literature --- Native Americans' References felt right and thought out. It is clear that this director and writer tried to deal with an arena he had never played before. They should stick to the old word "Write something you know". If, in fact, the scientists are in this, they definitely did not show up on the film, or the beauty of this unique culture was not properly managed. <br /> <br /> Cliché and NA NOSE --- I agreed to see this movie on the basis that it was indie. So I kept it up to higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was India and saw it before it became so popular. Before even getting to the broader release, I was already trying to get a hit. I HAZARDALLY could not say the same about "Expiration Date". "Sunshine" has led us to clich, but the filmmakers were so smart that the result would lead us in a different direction to avoid the cliché trap. This film, on the other hand, had no way of falling into trap because it was already STOPPED from the beginning. Mature psycho mom, Hendrix's couple etc. I hate to say this, but the best movie I saw this year was both indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the film makers for being so good at their cemetery.
