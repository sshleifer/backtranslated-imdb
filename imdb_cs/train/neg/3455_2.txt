God! This is one of those movies you think you've reviewed before, but you did not do it. I mean, you did not talk about it, but somehow you did. To be honest and brief; it is one of the worst, boring and stupid slashers ever made. I can not say anything good about this bite because there are barely decent sequences that might say they are made by professional filmmakers. Death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The story is a good one to consider copying "Popcorn" since 1991. To make it even worse, it's not such a bad movie that it's good. It's just bad. Molly Ringwald tried to do the best, but it was not enough.
