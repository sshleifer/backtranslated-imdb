A man with a scythe slaughters in a dorm room. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later, he is out, has a new friend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is preparing for a spring break with Hank and four other blond friends in BIG, a beautiful apartment in Florida. Naturally the killer will appear (no reason) and will start killing again. Lousy Slasher Thriller - A textbook of how NOT to make a low-budget horror movie. For starters, big parts of this ENDLESS movie are filming these six idiots who upload themselves, have "fun" (more fun than the audience), they are drunk, they are stupid, etc. There is also no nudity at all. I'm not saying horror film needs nudity, but nothing that would feed it would help. None of these deaths really show up (you hear them), they're just a little bloody and there's no gore. There's one REAL terrible - but it's not over. With a few exceptions, they behave. Dorie Barton is terrible as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is miserable as Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good - handsome and adorable, and gives him all the crap. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role that does a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> Logic goes away - after realizing that a friend has killed two of the girls, talks about sex; Baston's reaction to seeing someone kill is a bit funny and what happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Boring, stupid, no gore, no nudity - omit this.
