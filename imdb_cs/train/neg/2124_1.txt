This film relates to the story of Eddy, as featured in the title, and his return home to old friends in the seaside community. The plot includes a group of friends when it appears in the light that Eddy has gone as a means to resolve a friend's death in which he feels responsible in some way. But that is insignificant, as the decisions in production are extremely poor and are not fully realized. Scenarios may not always be "chatting", but at least they should help develop the story. Here is a series of attempts, such as "Just Going Out" or "I Know You Do not Have Love in Your Heart," but just whip up something worth visiting. Also, whenever a writer feels lost, where to go further, he goes to the music ensemble of the protagonist, who goes through the fields to some indie moody music. Talk about how hard you try. If you are interested in a good film, the type that gives quality and essence over style, then it is not the movie for you.
