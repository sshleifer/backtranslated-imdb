I do not have to be a critic, but here's what I think about this movie. I was looking at a cinematic film and first I have to say how much I hate the story I think it will come to what the snowman scare next to the little children, secondly it's pretty cruel but I bet because the movie is so low budget Probably used ketchup, so my critical voice is BOMB !!! a nice attempt and sequel will suck twice as much.
