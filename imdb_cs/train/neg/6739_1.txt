One wonders why anyone is trying to revive successful films that have already been seen, as is the case with this film. "Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why you do not even have to try to do something under your new story. If such a project goes with the approval of a studio hound, then everyone goes out with big stars and shiny production values ​​so people will come to the stars. Unfortunately, this is not what happens in this wrong attempt on comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screenwriters moved the story to London when it basically appears to be a typical American situation that neither the situation will be able to repair. Then there's a problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have so much chemistry as oil and vinegar! Because Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer does not get into the movie as the creators thought. It is obvious that Kat for Nikka falls and vice versa, in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best contributor to Junebug, is like a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie and does not come to the person who loves her and will marry her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For anyone interested, credits at the end of the movie are running almost seven minutes!
