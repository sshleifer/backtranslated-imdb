I really enjoyed seeing the planet of monkeys, but it was a huge dissapointment. Settings and masks are great, but that's the only good aspect of the movie. All the other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not act, he's in the movie, looks stupid. Other actors are also not very good. But the worst of all is the story. It's totally absurd! For example, the apes are lying on the ground blameless, but people do not attack them, no, they are waiting for them again! This is just one example of a stupid story, but it would take too long to say everything.
