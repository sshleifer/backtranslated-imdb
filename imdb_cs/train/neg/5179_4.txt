Without the effective departure of supernatural or poetic motivational nuances of mankind, this creative team has to hope for the efficient use of its medium, non-original elements. The "Party of Five," which has become manic and genetically inevitable, is a little entrenched because the unique non-murder element is the Wes Bentley mopester. In fact, all acting is deep skin. Even though dark-haired women are reluctant, they are kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also missing sufficient blood buckets. All feelings are kept on a tease, safe distance ... the unfortunate fact, when we consider the name of the directors, is the "butcher." Only the soundtrack, the overwhelming horror alter, and the tense fluctuating scores provide any tangible tension. Sometimes static storyboard compositions bring attractive low angles that increase nausea ... but for a movie called horror I have never been able to zoom in. Maybe more emphasis on rejuvenating social life through blood intake, scenes focused on diverse geometric shapes outside of the square, and a permanent focus on playfulness through family malice or passage of sympathetic characters that must escape to escape the dilemma would improve my opinion but it was not a good start my excursion through the horrorfest.
