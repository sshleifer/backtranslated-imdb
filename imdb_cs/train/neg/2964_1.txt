He laughed a lot - because he's so incredibly bad - I apologize to the people, but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...

I very much appreciate that people gather and shoot cheap films, but at least some quality should be completed. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were quietly interesting and looked good - and the score really is worth listening to. The DVD packaging promised a lot, but it is by far the best film that offers ...
