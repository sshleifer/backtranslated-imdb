It's still hard for me to understand the film as bad as it was in Hollywood. The game and story is simply pathetic and the direction is terrible. I do not see any logic behind this trash except that the director did not do anything good. I took ten minutes to realize that I had lost my precious thirty rupees. I was overwhelmed by the horror of losing more of my life on the crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I do not know the category. Please avoid this movie at any price, just do anything, even bang your head against the walls, but you do not go to this movie.
