I was absolutely familiar with the fantastic book Goodnight Mister Tom, and only recently did I have the opportunity to watch this adaptation. I have heard many positive comments, so I had great hopes. When this movie ended, I was terrified. The film is not a good movie at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was an extremely poor adaptation and virtually 4.5 / 10 books were not omitted. Especially I found out that there were not many characters in this book and some great scenes. There was not much dialogue, it was fast and too fast, but I was really upset by the fact that you never saw the connection and love between William Beech and Tom in this film, which was really dark. Casting was not that good. I thought it could be really good, but it was so different from the book! Extremely bad adaptation, one of the worst I've ever seen. It deserves a decent remake that should be better 1000 times better than a pile of rubbish.
