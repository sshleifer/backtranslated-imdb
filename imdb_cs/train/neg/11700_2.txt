I'm looking forward to this movie, but after watching it I was really disappointed. It was best when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk can not act to save his life, and none of the others. Several shows even laughed out loud! The film was not as I imagined when I read a book that was amazing, I imagined it was darker and much more scary. If I were Stephen, I would be angry! I do not know why they changed the end, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you find out that the pie killed your daughter, you will not feed it to anyone else! <br /> <br /> The book was much better!
