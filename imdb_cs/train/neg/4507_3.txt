In spite of the overall conspicuous plot and expensive production, one is surprised that the director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where was the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? It's probably not on wages. My Japanese friend laughed loudly about some of the cultural absurdities she was watching. In a later interview, she said, "Imagine that the Finnish director shot a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War, using blond Swedish actors as trade union armies and French as a confederation. Imagine faintly dressing the female fate of Scarlet O'Hara in the skirt of a missing hoop and a sporty hairstyle in 1950. Maybe some people in Finland may not realize that the hoop hoops "are missing hoops" or recognize the bizarre hair of Jane Mansfield, but they would not believe in Atlanta's eyes and ears .... and be laughing in the aisles ... a great story and shooting are damn, so ... watching Memoirs of Geisha was painful for anyone who was familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, real geisha, or Japanese dress, and that was the movie theme! Hollywood is amazing in his short- film. They often get big money things right, while leaving kids aily that really polish the film upgrading awkwardly. I thought "The Last Samurai" was crowning the achievement of how bad would otherwise be a good film about Japan. The memories of geisha are both awfully better and worse.
