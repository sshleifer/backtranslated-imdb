This installment of Masters of Horror was terrible. It seems that Mr Carpenter has to learn something or two about steps and a decent and credible dialogue. There were times when I literally screamed on TV for something to happen. Perhaps he thinks he's building up tension, but Carpenter needs to adorn his exaggerated, too simplified musical score of his (or his son) and move a bit differently. How many times did the girl say, "Oh no, I can not have this baby!" and "Oh, no, here it comes"? Carpenter takes elements of much better movies (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them here as if we should recognize and appreciate his business style. What is missing is true tension and energy. It's like he's been helpful in the filmmaking process. <br /> <br /> For better carpentry movies, stick to the tried and true classics - The Case, Halloween and they live. For better masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer, and Dreams in the Witch House.
