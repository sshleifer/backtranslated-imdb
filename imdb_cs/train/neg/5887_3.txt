Jane Russell has turned out to be a nice musical comedy artist called "Gentlemen prefer blondes"? but sadly this film is playing with these skills. There is a budget and a beautiful Parisian photo, but the film simply does not work. It seems that Mrs. Russell plays Marilyn Monroe. Nobody leaves it to Jane Russell to play properly. Some of the other players are out of their feature. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; It is most important to warn that there is a musical number where aphrodisiac cannibals "cook" brunettes in a pot when Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit. This is interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen take brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
