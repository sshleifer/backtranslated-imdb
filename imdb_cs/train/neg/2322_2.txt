I was looking for a video rental everywhere to find this movie because I'm a huge elvis fan I was, and I found it a big disappointment. kurt russel had most of the "elvis moves" down and the imitation of the voice was great, but dubbed in singing a voice elvis just didnt work for me. the voice was not always with my mouth, and it was hard to lose my conspiracy because it bothered me that it was obvious. Also, there were so many gross inconsistencies in the movie, people who do not know about Elvis would probably consider them to be real. chants are singing before he recorded them in real life, the time when he got his first guitar is bad, I'm sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave, not with a huge gravestone that read JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a television movie, but they skipped over important events like coming back and dragged some scenes too long. if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his main rental it's the way he is or another elvis concert. Hearing and seeing real Elvis preforms is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant testimony I know but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic.)
