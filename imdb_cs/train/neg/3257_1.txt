After I saw the film, the first question that appeared in my mind was: Would it be ironic or not? After reading a few comments about the character of Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not going to be ironic. So the story tells us about the American-American Superdoka who saved the South American Republic from evil. It sounds like a typical story. But this is so unrealistic that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory final fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I've ever seen. The film could be interesting for small film designers as a bad example.
