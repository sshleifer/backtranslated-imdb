All for Love (as it was titled when it was broadcast on the weekend) is a romantic period of drama with Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon's army captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young girl who visits prison . It's also a story about murder. I will be honest and admit that I was not filmed because I am not a fan of period drama and the script feels somewhat episodic, but I say that everyone is involved and it is a good cast that includes Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Granta, Michael Gough and Jason Isaac. The costume design you can expect is also great <br /> <br /> I will be very surprised if this film will not have any complaints after it was broadcast on the BBC2 on teatime. Captain Saint Ives is lying in bed with a prostitute where the nipple is fully exposed, and there is a scene of French bathing inmates that includes a complete front male nudity, not to mention the murderous scene where the blood is clearly visible. You really have to worry if the BBC planners have some kind of trace of what they're doing
