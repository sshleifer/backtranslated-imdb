<br /> <br /> I recently saw this atrocities in my movie program, and I thought it was terrible, as I said in my slogan, it was demanding, sad, tiny and phenomenally self-important. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a fan of the film and all that the movie offers. If I want to look at the documentary at the Cannes festival, I will look at A & E .... and they would probably be all the more objective. <br /> <br /> I do not answer, the season. <br /> <br />
