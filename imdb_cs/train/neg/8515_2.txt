I was so disappointed with this show. After I heard and read all the hoop about how it was a "broken show" and all sorts of wild promises in terms of quality, I tried to watch her. The game was forced and exaggerated. The story made little sense. As with any hint of resurrected "look into the life of adolescents," I could only see a miserable attempt that had as much reality as a real estate show. Some wonder why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it really is not all good and drum drums over the quality at this show just serve to attract attention to how bad it was.
