There is nothing to hate more than self-congratulations. Kevin Smith deserves to hang him on his legs to inspire every white middle-size T-shirt to make a film about why they can not lay down. I'm not really interested in inexperience and low-budget production, but when this font is obvious and weak, my potatoes really burn. The money embedded in this article could go into a truly fighting filmmaker who really has a chance like John Gulager. If you're looking at the Greenlight Project, you'll immediately meet a talented visionary who is fighting the system. Someone could capture the camera and make a nice picture that does not say anything. When are we saved from Smithonites and Whedonets of the world? The revolution can not arrive soon. Watch the real first effort by buying Desperado or looking for friends with benefits. Thank you and a good day.
