The whole world has said that Tashan will be a good film with great pleasure, but it is not. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake as actress Kareen Kapoor. It was unbearable during the movie. Her mother looks really good. Even the film story of the movie makes no sense at all. Everyone said that Quetin Taratino in India is Vijay, but it's not Quetin at all. In this stupid film was the talent of Anil Kapoor. Anil is an actor of great caliber and this film is not. Akshay Kumar was also a victim of this film because everything is Saif. Style and Phoroloma are not really good in this movie, I was disappointed
