Trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What loss of talent and money. I wish I waited for this movie to come to DVD, because at least I would not be out of $ 9. The film lacks a mark. What could have been a great movie for all actors, it turned out to be B-film at best. The film moved very slowly, and just as I thought it was going somewhere, it almost did, but then it did not work. Nowadays, we need unpredictable filming and filming in the film, and none of this film has been offered. The whole thing about every suspect is good, but it's not sure if it was the way it was directed, lighting, line delivery, writing or what, but none of that was. Lots of hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in this movie, and I tell everyone they can not see it. Musical saxophone music has made the film worse. And the end had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
