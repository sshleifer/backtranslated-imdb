At first I was happy to know about the new Superman movie, although it would be great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> It's a bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain who does nothing more, even played by Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same as Donner's first film just a little forced. the script is predictable and simple (all things Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). The story is a bad thing, it must be Kevin Smith's script and it may be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope the sequel without Brian Singer and the new talent director to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> Everybody will read you later
