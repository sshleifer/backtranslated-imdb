I have read more about this movie and I usually try not to be harsh in my criticism because I am trying to be a nice person. But this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and that's a lot of bad nights at USA Network plus Cinemax.) Who would think this film must be prevented from becoming EVER another. This movie disgusted me for no other movie at all. I really think these people are crazy. You just save time and do not look at this fllm. Please - I wish I had it. The game is terrible, conspiracy (what plot) is STUPID and humiliating and mad. I really do not think it should become a movie. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from the waste of time.
