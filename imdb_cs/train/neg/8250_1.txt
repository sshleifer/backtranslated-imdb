I ordered a movie from Korea, because I was in it, and I was wondering how it would happen. When I watched him, I can say he was ashamed to have some of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself but also for everyone else involved in this ridicule of the British "comedy". From the beginning to the end, the film is predictable, dull, boring, monotonous, and once it happened I turned away from the screen in disbelief on several occasions. Until you really see a movie, it's hard to imagine how romantic and uncompromised romantic comedies can be. It's not just a bad story but a badly created movie. In one scene, you can actually see a runner or an assistant director who shows how to escape. This will be explained in more detail in the Goofs section. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was filled with emotions (disappointment, fury, embarrassment)
