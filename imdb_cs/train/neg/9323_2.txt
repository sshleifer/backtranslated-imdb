What did I just watch? I spent 90 minutes of my rare life watching one of the deepest movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite frightening to see that there are lots of people who are afraid of clowns .... but it's got to be 300 pounds of kid's rhyme reciting clown killer makes the mockery of the genre. I'm still interested in how Mark did not get out of the clown ... she's 300 pounds, she must get tired. He finally picked me up and said aloud, "What did I just watch?" Brandon seems to be Denise's cousin .... and they got close to the middle of the movie, which meant he had sex with his cousin ..... yeah, that's something people want to see * shakes *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found cheerful stupidity was the opening scene where a clown shames a woman and says, "What did you do?" Well, what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second when the main character slapped the truck and called her, and then five minutes later she said that violence did nothing to help ... did the writer write a line on a bad guy? None of these films makes any sense. The movie was more or less misleading low-budget porn I got into the purchase (all 3.99) and it did not make any sense except for sexual scenes. I was surprised that the fat clown did not join the orgies to get inside. I had hoped that the film would have some value for entertainment like other B movies, but I was wrong. This is a dirty piece of rubbish that can not even be traced. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
