If you hate red accents, you will hate this movie. And to make it even worse, you will see Patrick Swayze, trying to be desperate. I really can not stand the emphasis. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was uncomfortable in this movie. And what is the name Lonnie Earl? How much more hubish can this movie get? The story was stupid. Usually I'm not a film judge, but I could not stand this movie. If you want a good movie by Billy Bob Thornton, check out Slingblade. My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... numbers ... I think I'll wrap it and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It could just be that I can not stand it or I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if it was not Patrick Swayze. Once I was in the movie. I laugh at something stupid usually. If they showed some fingers broken, I could laugh. human fingers are randomly splitting always laughs at me.
