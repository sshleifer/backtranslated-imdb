I have never heard of this movie until he played in Robert Mitchum's retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Almost 60 years on the cast list looked delicious, at least with seven names - in addition to top-charged Mitchum - in a public house; Charles McGraw recently killed The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas, and probably even better known as Set Designer Norman's daughter daughter, Walter Brennan, who had no role, Frank Faylen, a sadistic sister at The Lost Weekend, and a much nicer little urban mensch It's A Wonderful Life, Robert Preston for ten years from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter making numbers. Unfortunately, most of them lost time. I was looking in vain at any "signature" scene, since it was Robert Wise on the bullhorn. This time he made about half a dozen films and still had to find style. The story is our old friend in the fight for the range and Mitchum probably thought it was barely cut over the Hopalong Cassidy oaters on which he tore his teeth. There are no new steps - unless you count the incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to get information about his father's plans to move his cattle. That's quite true, but how does Mitchum know? We have seen or heard anything about how he found it. There is not much in the equilibrium.
