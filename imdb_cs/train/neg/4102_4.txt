"Dead Letter Office" is a low-budget film about a few Australian postal workers who are trying to recover their damaged life. Unfortunately, acting is bad and the connection between past misfortunes and contemporary characters' thoughts is clumsily and overly represented. Most disappointing, however, is that the portrait is life in the film's office: no mechanization exists, and it is absolutely impossible to find out what some employees actually do to live. It is likely that the office is threatened with closure, but this type of office was definitely closed in the 1930s if it actually existed. It's a shame because the overall tone of the movie is sad and greedy, and there's some promise in the script, but it convinces little detail. Overall, it feels the work of someone who has not really experienced a lot of real life; student film, with concept and outline, but sadly little.
