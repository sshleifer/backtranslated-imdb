The film attempts to be a mercantile - filmed in a documentary but with many clearly scripted parts - but fails to give the audience any character that would create the illusion of the mercenary. The film also claims that it's about finding real love in Los Angeles, but it's nothing but an unattractive look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first "big movie".
