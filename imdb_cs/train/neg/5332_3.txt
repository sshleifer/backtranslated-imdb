Ok, showing stereotypical "Indians" in this story is simply wrong. I agree that Elvis looks good, but yes, his skin color changes during the movie. I was thinking, okay ... he was never the one who would tan in real life. These are some of the best-known brown "Indian" makeup I've ever seen. It's as bad as 'Indians' to 'F-Soldiers' and Old Hollywood Westerns played by Jewish and Italian American actors and not real Native Americans! The film is fine but typically lame stories and average songs as well as all Elvis later films. He just did it because Colonel Parker had brought him to long film contacts to push as much money out of Elvis! I always think "thank God" that Elvis stopped filming forever long after the movie came out. It's great to see actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this film. <br /> <br /> The Indian makeup of Burgess Meredith is utterly insignificant. It's the worst for me. What do the filmmakers think? Was Mr. Meredith the money or what? But I love some Elvis movies. For example: "Love Me Tender", "Jailhouse Rock", "Viva Las Vegas". I'm even able to watch his movie with the future TV stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, "Change of Habit," in which Elvis plays a doctor in the city. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Elvis has created a lot of good movies, but the average and the bad ones overcome decent and good. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you very much!
