Oh, Bait. How do I hate you? Allow me to calculate ways. 1. You are trying to be funny but are furious and unhappy; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, it does not give up laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You are trying to be dramatic but incredible; The woman survives a terrible state and "the bad guy" looks like Bill Gates and he's as creepy as ... well, Bill Bates. (Just try to imagine that Bill Gates is trying to intimidate someone with a gun, it does not work, he does not work, lawyer, maybe, but not a gun.) It does not seem to suit him.) As for Jamie Foxx, sincere dialogue is ridiculous and it makes me want to hurl. 3. You are trying to be careful, but they are boring and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the camera tripod must be lost because the scenes are more than you in the Blair witchcraft project and I think I'm angry and I want to go again. 4. You are trying to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you could not! I'd rather go barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sun-tanning cream, and only Meryl Streep for the company. This hell would be much nicer than the one minute we spent watching how everyone in Bait cross the path with an idiotic story with Bill Gates about a bad guy and we're not talking about a massive bomb that in the car looks like the character of Jamie Foxx has just begun calm, but somehow he managed to escape ... just kill me or do the right thing and promise me that in some way it will not have to watch a movie that is so bad never again.
