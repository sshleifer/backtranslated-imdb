You've seen that before when Harry met sally, then avoid this. It will not just cause you to bang your head on the table, because why Bollywood should not even be perfectly edited; but they also bother you with so-called fun moments in it. The magic of the film is missing. Ranee looks terrible. Saif tries to act as if he were a hell actor. Land that has been highlighted from the original does not look efficient. The part in which they both bring their friends and hit a note just does not like it. What can be disastrous? you want to empty some money, that's what you can get. Otherwise, add more money and watch the original. Its too good a mistake ..
