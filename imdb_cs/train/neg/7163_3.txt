<br /> <br /> After finishing my view of "Trance" or "The Eternal," or what the producers call this film, I thought, "Of all the bad movies I could see, I could not at least see the one who was it fun? "Even if the film is not good in terms of acting, directing, writing or what you have, it can be fun, and that's why it's worth it. Not only is this film badly of artistic value, it is incredibly boring. For such a thin plot, it moves extremely slowly, with little dramatic tension. At least in an attempt at low eyebrow entertainment, the character's death may have been cold and / or cruel, but the creators of the strike also failed. does this movie do it for? Nothing, unless you have fun out of watching Christopher Walken, who is capable of being brilliant, has made so little effort in his acting that he falls into a self-confessional mode (Why did he decide to make this film anyway?). br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because God helped us, there were worse movies before.
