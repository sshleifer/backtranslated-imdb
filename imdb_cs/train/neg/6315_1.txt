This elegant, sexy movie is a must. Only in multiple views can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film. I personally like the narrator for his intelligent, no subject remains untouched, the style of narration. The show instantly grabs you and holds you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the movie. It provides a gorgeous view of the world of training and allows viewers to really "connect" to the inner horror of this film. The script itself keeps the movie great. Not only for children, but also older people will gain a better understanding of the training and modern grip they have on sexual experience. Before time and pioneering in cinematography, he definitely defines the word "masterpiece".
