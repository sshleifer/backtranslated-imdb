There are some great philosophical questions. What is the meaning of life? What happens when we die? AND WHY I WANT FILMS SO WITHOUT ??? The premise is absurd. Shaping is one-dimensional. Special effects are exaggerated. And the movie is one permanent gun battle among some of the most deadly Hollywood films ever produced. But then, if there were good shots, everyone would be dead in the first five minutes, and the movie would not be. It is a shame that it did not happen. I tried to turn it off several times, and I pressed against him to see how badly it could be. I like to do it because (SPOILER?) The last line is the coronation stupidity of the whole bagpiper, a modest scenario. He is not even worthy of a second in the third off-season. In addition to the general horror of the film, I deeply worry about its impact on the young audience. Americans scream like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happened. This is really a banal cinema at the Brobdingnagian scale!
