(NOTE: I thought I was the only one who would write what I did below, but I see that others agree, I think it was quite obvious - it was an exaggerated bit of bait. a vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - left the cat (Sylvester) completely alone and locked in the house. This means that no milk, but the cat, on his relief, finds plenty of canned tuna. But to his horror, he can not find an opener. It turned out that the little mouse in the house had it ... and bait with a cat. He is the average rodent who constantly teases Sylvester with the opener and then pulls him out for the last second. Sylvester is trying to open up a can of tuna, but he can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story and why they make a sadistic mouse, a "good boy" is behind me. It's like some of Tom & Jerry cartoons where bad Tom always gets the worst of it, though many times the mouse starts a conflict!
