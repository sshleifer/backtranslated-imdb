I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. It seems to make sense because most movie zombies have their place there. From romero's' Dead 'trilogy to '28 days later'. However, while watching, you can quickly see what this movie really is. It's actually a music video that progresses faster and more and more. Here people are not afraid. Just a few half-decked action scenes that will soon erupt because they last ... and the last ... and the last ... and you'll soon get the impression that you've accidentally dropped the DVD player in 3 minutes but not that they made the movie. It's a shame. I think someone could make better use of $ 7 million in the film industry than to do it. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, they were used again and became tedious because it was the same piece again and again each time, with a different character. Also, what is ROYALLY annoying is the crawling of the arcade game. I played the game. It sucks. So why are they put in here? Oh, that's true, this is not a movie but a music video, and that's bad. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated: lots of violence / gore and fury
