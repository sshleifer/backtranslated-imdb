Bad conspiracy (although good for B-film), good fast fight scenes, no more than 5 out of 10. But I was always worried about this movie: how does Mariska Hargitay never speak? In the TV version, he shares some intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in the garden. Yet in a regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all. It bothers me because not only does it capture the film (of course, the clich√©), it also seems that the final shot looks creepy. This movie would be better if they kept their scenes, because in those scenarios there is at least a personality that undermines everything Speakman says.
