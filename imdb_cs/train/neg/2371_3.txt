I'm not a huge fan of Freddy Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays better Freddy Krueger than he does. But no misdemeanor Robert, he sucked this movie. Actor is horrible, the conspiracy is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that is even worth the attention. Sometimes the sequel may be better than the first one like the Friday 13th year (I thought the remake was the best in the series. ) But this is not one of those movies. The origin was good, 2. In my opinion it was better, 3. It was ok but I did not see the others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake I did when I was following this crap.
