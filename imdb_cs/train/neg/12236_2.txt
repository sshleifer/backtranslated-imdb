It just was not supposed to be. It is predictable and clich√©. Chromie on the screen, which made the first "My Girl" so captivating, is not here anywhere, and acting as a whole is compressed and forced. The script also leaves much desirable, some "unforgettable" lines like "throwing a barbaric habit" are just shocking. Where "My Girl" caused real feelings of sadness and some really funny moments, just as much of the sequel "My Girl 2" tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and unfortunately fails. Maybe I was heavy on this film because it was great, but it honestly honestly judges the quality of the original original with such a driving force that this installment gives. This must surely approach the "Mask of the Son" as the worst continuation of all time. In both cases, the old saying is true; "if it is not broken, do not correct".
