Who did the research for this movie? It is based in Baghdad in 2004, but all soldiers are wearing ACUs and have all the Camouflage Patterns. Nobody cared about it in 04. I just saw this movie when I was abroad, and can I say that the stunning feeling of the audience was the WTF? This movie did not make sense, they had characters that come and go without explanation, and people make ridiculous things that would never happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but we're obviously trying to portray something realistic. Not satisfied, but trying. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone has come up with random ideas, chewed them and swallowed and then threw the movie. I would not want to make this film to anyone. I still do not know why I sat here. GI Joe was the one who really thought you compared to that. DO NOT RECEPTION!
