Unobtrusive, strange, weird and opaque if it is visually striking ... erotic fantasy. Really boring, too naked male (including incest father-son) and only a kind of ruthlessness. I admit, however, that some passages of dialogue, adopted according to their own terms, have loving and terrible quality.
