Well, I had to be generous and put it 2. This was mainly because of the unjustified holes cut out in a lady's shirt where her breasts are. I found it funny. In addition, this film nothing more than a few good laughs with a friend. Funny, if you're willing to throw the "secret science theater" commenting on them with someone, but it's no better than 2. And 2 pretty much a fool.
