This remake of Anthony Shaffer's classic game did not last long in cinemas. I recently suffered on cable with him, I congratulate him for not flushing money on the ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law thought their prestige alone could keep this travesty for an infinite 93 minutes without fun or class of longer origin. Michael Caine strengthens his reputation as he played second in a gorgeous 1972 film. Now he seems to want to destroy him by trying to lead, playing in this version of Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Academy, but lost to Marlon Brand in GODFATHER). When he looks bloated and emptied, the cat slides through a part with a lesser depth than appears as a Batman's valet. He has already dropped on guest appearances in the sharp remake of GET CARTER. What will happen next - ALPHIE II, or the son of a man who will be king? <br /> <br /> But then no one will benefit from this unpleasant adaptation by Pintero, who thinks that frequent curses and additional sexual angles can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's funny gameplay. Branagh's leadership is based on bluish lighting and a soulless, scenic design that would not stand in the second night club. Neither shadows nor tight, excited close can help the law overcome its dim screen. The result is a failure as a direct drama as well as a detective thriller, so you almost do not forget the target for titles. Fans of the original production stage (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine film would well make this venture a bad dream. Late Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the screenplay of 1972, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZIE and several adaptations of Agatha Christie, must turn to his grave and wished he could schedule a real murder or two!
