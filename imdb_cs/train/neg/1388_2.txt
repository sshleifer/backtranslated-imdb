We came to see this movie and hoped to see some glimpses of Jet Li that we were amazed at Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his fighting pieces are so clearly fake that's even a pleasure. Flying kicks would be much more impressive if you could not see the wires that would hold it when flying through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. Too cartoonish and very disappointed.
