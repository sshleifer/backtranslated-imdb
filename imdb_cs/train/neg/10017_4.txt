The "Dragstrip Hollow Ghost" seems to be taking place in the abysmal underworld, which is a long time ago when the greatest sin the child could commit would be to oppose the law and get a ticket. She opens up with a young female fanatic who works from her archival rival who pushes her into a car race. That's about what's happening in drag-racing - this B-flick is mostly about rock 'n roll, man! People in American International obviously loved decent, square teenagers who enjoyed a party, yet they did not mind an adult chaperone. There are several entertaining double entenders and fruit exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we'd go out for fresh air ..." Daddy: "Where do you think you can find it on your neck?") But the spirit is a little late to come. Shortly after 65 minutes, the movie cheats with the top of the cars, which actually takes off the screen and the preliminary "Scooby Doo" demasculation makes no sense. However, for nostalgia enthusiasts, some soulless entertainment. ** z ****
