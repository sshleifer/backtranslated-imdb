This film is quite soaked. I'm in the army and the soldiers rendered in this movie are terrible. If you're in military and you see this movie, you'll laugh and be disturbed by the whole movie because of the way they played as a team. It was ridiculous. It was like a lot of normal people with army uniforms who did not know what to do. It was a pretty horrible film that I would have to say the least. There were a few scenes where they tried to jump. I would recommend if you were looking at it if you were bored and want to see a violent, dreadful movie. It's going to be a better movie, even if you're not in the military. I would also have to say that I liked the first one better than this one.
