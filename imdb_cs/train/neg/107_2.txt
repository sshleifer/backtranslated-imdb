If the crew of the "Zombie Chronicles" ever read this, here are a few tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In the Twist Ending movie, it is not advisable to insert the INTRODUCTION IMAGES of this movie in the initial credits. It tends to ruin the reversals, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you made it at sixteen, and - to be fair - you have done miracles with you, but please, you hire people who really can act. Or at least walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you set a part of your movie in the past, do it only if you have the time and the costumes of time. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist ends should be a surprise. Sure, we do not want to twist that do not make sense, but the sign "reveal" once you introduce the character? This is not a great idea. Kudos to the boys who tried, but frankly, I would rather not ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie completists.
