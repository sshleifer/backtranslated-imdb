I really wanted to like this movie because the critics were unlucky (at least) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Worse <br /> <br /> It worked as an insignificant scenario, the wing passed the direction ... Watching this movie was like watching a car accident - you want to look on but still stare at br /> <br /> because you want to see how wrong it she will have. Well, the car is destroyed and they are not survivors. On the plus side, cinema was nice, I wanted to go on holiday, even if I were cleansed from what is ungodly
