A very "pretty" pretty old lady, desperate for the money to save her house and property, grows a "pot" in her house, smokes with some old friends and then sells them. This is the story of this low-key comedy, highlighting the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor that this situation brings. For most of the movie, it works. Humor is not a laugh-loud variety, but you enjoy it for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. There are fun moments and Brenda Blethyn is very entertaining in the lead role. But the end really destroyed the "cute" film with offensive bad news that they would only like to see ultra-liberals from the movie world. Like most people, I would prefer a happy end, but that should not be all warm and unclear for those who incomprehensibly violate the law. There are also typical (1) children out of wedlock, but this is not a problem and is considered to be okay; (2) spiritual performances as morally weak people; and (3) even a doctor who gets a stove! <br /> <br /> Hello? And the referees were throwing Hollywood here? This shows how secular companies have lowered standards in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least, there's a trace of morality instead of Timothy Leary "If it's good, do it" message.
