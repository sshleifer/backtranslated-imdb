Nell Shipman attempted a conspiracy that was supposed to lead to the final persecution in "Back to God's Land" of the previous year and unfortunately failed. This time it does better, though it seems unnecessary. "Something new" has barely a fence that lies out of persecution. There is a brief assumption that sets the hero (co-author and friend of Shipman) to save the girl (played Shipman), then there is nothing but an exciting, unlikely pursuit from there. Of course, it's all-day ad for Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is ridiculously absurd. It seems that the last rescue films D.W. Griffith or his parody by Mack Sennett and other comics he imitates. One of the points of interest is that Shipman writes and directs himself in the film as a writer of a film story that has as his hero writer (Shipman Again), though she does so clever or humorous with it, though she is trying to do it. Again, others promote the writer's joke in intertitles such as Anita Loos with "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion with "Girl's Folly" (both 1917). At least Shipman has the impression that he or she is not serious about herself or the film - not me. "Something New", despite his claims, is neglected.
