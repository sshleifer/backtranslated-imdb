I agree with one of the other commentators about good story and good actors, but I do not answer and I would say I was hurt. It's about 24 years since I read a book like in school. But I felt you'd need to know Jane Eyre's story when you look at this because the bits are omitted and that's why it does not make sense. For example, Jane & Mr Rochester barely speaks and suddenly proposes marriage !!! Actors do not have time to let the audience know how their character feels in every thing that happens in the story. Actors are good, but they do not get enough time to make this story of justice. I'm sorry to say so, but I did not really like this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott would Jane Eyre's movie my preference, but you should look at the 1983 BBC mini series series with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in two major roles. I love it so much that I look at it regularly. There is a shortened version that takes 225min or full version for 330min.
