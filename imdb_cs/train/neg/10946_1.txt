"That Malcom really kills Fox ... can not we make his own version?" Of course, I speculate and paraphrase, but we all know in our hearts that this is true, and that the only thing NBC added to the Malcom metric was sex. And the boy, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen year old Tucker gets a boner and covers him with a skateboard. Tucker accidentally joins his aunt in the shower and accuses him of watching and hitting her. She spits a cute girl in the next house out of her bedroom window and she knows she wants to see it topless, but she runs away by smiling and closing the window. And that's all in the pilot. Take it from an adult person - a puberty boy is so sexually crazy and guided by the seeds that it is impossible to make it funny for a traditional audience. The only thing anyone has ever come up with is in movies and you can count them on one side. It is no surprise that "Tucker" has the warmth and attractiveness of the bathroom in the band club. Did she really think we'd want kids to look at puberty? Is not that the case in which people go to jail? If you have any doubts about the depression, it was considered: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled it for only 4 episodes; they then made an unprecedented motion of "burning" the remaining episodes by sending them AT MIDNIGHT so no children could see them. Ironically, because the children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to his general pomp, Tucker has regular voices from the lead character to empty bad writing. Even in 2000 it was horribly dated, with random music and sarcasm. I could not have liked some characters to laugh at the vows, and the jokes were not exactly miles per minute ... The NBC damage for this dirty rip-off ... is better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
