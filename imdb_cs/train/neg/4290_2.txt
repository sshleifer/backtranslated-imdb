I will give this movie two stars because it is a beautiful photo. Otherwise, it is mainly about clich√©s and stereotypes: Mountain people are either silly white baskets of fanatically religious or battered racist, or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move without sound, they can disappear in a flash of their eye, talk to animals, and read ideas long distances. And so and so on. Throughout the movie, I was wondering what the point of the film is (apart from showing me pictures of mountains, log cabin, forest, assortment of animals, living mountain peasants and monstrous people in church). The conspiracy touched a lot of issues, but none of them went deeper. It was not a story about growing up during depression, or about being an orphan, or about fighting for identity. She tried to be everything and more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory. Though the film should have been based on the Lesser Tree lesson, we almost do not learn about it. He received a brief overview of the history of his people (who were bold and stoic) and a demonstration of distilleries; he tried his hand when cutting wood (when he failed) and running whiskey (literally); learned to read (and maybe write) with the help of her grandmother and her vocabulary - and that was it. He did not seem to spend much of his stay at boarding school because he was locked up in the attic. However, Granny and Grandpa and Graham Greene have made sure that Little Tree eventually becomes a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - and after paraphrasing here, "to go with Navajos" and "catch up in a few wars" - to "catch up" with his grandmother and grandfather and Graham Greene in heaven (instead of, let's say, get acquainted with girls, get married, have children or other such nonsense). Last but not least, I have to say that I found a grandfather's business offensive. Why was it all yet to be whiskey? To face the "drunk Indian" stereotype?
