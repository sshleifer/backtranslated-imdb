Overall, this film was quite worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more comedy. Last night, I just rented this movie when my and my friends went to tears for a scary movie. It certainly was not what we were looking for, but it made us happy about humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially the girl Tracy, whenever she's in the cabin room to tell the clown to leave. There are almost no emotions and it is so obvious that he is acting. And when the clown looks through the black box paper and grabs Mark, he does not even seem to be afraid, even though the clown caught him and started attacking him. And seriously, would you just JOGGING if you were persecuted? I would be a sprinter for my life! (Although someone would probably drive the clown out because it's like 300 lbs.) And not to mention that the effects are not as big as a clown harvested Susanna's head in the woods, then whenever he threw his head into the deck room with Denise and Tracy at any time Denise throws his head back. Just as in the previous man's comment, the beginning has absolutely no sense and I do not even know why it was even included in the movie. So what was this movie created in 2003? Music has made it look like it was in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Does not really look professional. Half the time it seems that the camera can not even remain stable when it's supposed to be. Overall, I'd have to say I liked the movie. I would not recommend it even if you are trying to find something that scared you, but if you are looking for something you could do fun or laugh, I would definitely recommend it.
