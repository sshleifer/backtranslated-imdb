I just rented it today ... he heard a lot of good reviews before. WOW !! What pile of mating this movie is! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back? Finally, someone has come across "Stop-loss" from the "worst war after the Iraq war". To be fair, I do not think there are good films about the war in Iraq, but that was really bad. <br /> <br /> I will not get into any technical inaccuracies, there are a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that describe them in detail. If the director bothered to consult even the smallest E-nic about technical precision, they could make the film somewhat realistic ... maybe. I think the writer should get "credit" for this film waste. He or she, of course, hatched the story for this film from some vivid imagination that was not affected by the limitations of reality. Does anyone, except me, wonder what it was in this movie? Was there a message? Seriously, though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am quite impressed at all the positive ratings really. This movie is hard to watch as a vet due to all the obvious inaccuracies, but even if one could overlook the conspiratorial plot, the characters are shallow (at least) and the acting is bad at best. It's ironic, I think this movie is about destroying an explosive regulation because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
