I disagreed with no theology in Left Behind, but I found book grabbing and I read 8 out of 12 of them. Indisputably good writing and interesting story. However, I did not have great expectations for the film. There was no way the Hollywood mainstream would accept the Christian series and create a large budget. So it was done independently ... and it was just that I was watching a really long TV show. He just did not feel like a movie; it did not have the movie "experience" if anyone knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of it, and for low budgets, the bad special effects were another issue for me. Moreover, I feel that Gordon Currie was a miserable miscast like Nicolie Carpathia. When I read a book, my impression of NC was that this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome man who spoke English with an almost zero accent should be. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead they found some pencil Clay Aiken, who looks like a month employee from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent. So he lost a few stars for me. The film is not convincing when the main villain does not look or say the way it should be. The actions were fine, but nothing to write about. Some scenes - like one of the conversion scenarios (I can not remember which one) - were real chairs for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was was really in place for some scenes like when Kirk Cameron prays in the bathroom. In short, it was not a bad movie, but it just did not do it for me. Keep books, people, it's much better.
