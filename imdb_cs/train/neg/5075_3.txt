The animation was good, the image was good, though not entirely original, the story was too long, too mint and above the dramatic. After about an hour I could not wait for it to end. With so many characters that have nothing to contribute and draw elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere, this movie really was not a movie at all, and it would be better than a short series or maybe two movies. If you like this kind of typical story, you may like it, but frankly, I was spoiled by a lot more creative stories that really have a message. Bring the Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, you'll get a lot more.
