You think the first landing on the Moon will be pretty dramatic without having to do anything about it. However, it seems that this document needs to throw everything into the most dangerous light. He talks about the risks associated with the module of the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's almost fatal accident with the training vehicle as if the coach and the spacecraft had something in common. This causes the computer overload problem (Alarms 1202 and 1201) that occurred during the last landing sequence to sound almost catastrophe when it was just annoyance, and there was no threat to the crew. And it takes thirty seconds to call the thirty seconds of fuel left before exhaustion, when it's actually thirty seconds before the cancellation is mandatory. If you want to see documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go to "From Earth to the Moon" or to one of the PBS documents, but skip this.
