Create your own mind. Personally, it seemed just as much fun to me as receiving Steve Wonder's spinal tap. No violation of Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's a comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two options to watch your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drinkers to jail, are instructed to instruct two children from Jane Lynch's development center, operated by Gayle Sweena. One of the failures is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), the dirty fifth grader and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man playing in the fantastic medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their accusations an invaluable inner look at life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is cheerful with her dry, humorous analogies. Supports: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
