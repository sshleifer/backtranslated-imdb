Some people have tried to refute this film because they question the credibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West, or women with weapons in the Old West. Grab and read the book. There were quite a few Asians (Chinese), there were relatively few black people (freedmen) and all outside the class dynasty had ready access to the weapon; it's the second change you know. And as for the use of modern language, none of the western people are constantly nostalgic about the language actually used, which is consistent with the time shown. Americans had different accents, used different curves, spoke at a very different pace, and used a lot of words and phrases that would not be recognized today. Do not tell historical inaccuracies that you simply did not copy it. Be honest. Maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you see.
