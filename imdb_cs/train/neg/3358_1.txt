Hunting. Remake, of course. Origin was a haunted psychological thriller that has improved over time. Compared to this remake in 1999, it is a classic. There is no development of character, just cartoons (a slut, authoritative brain, "We will come out of us" a colleague, oh so sensitive book-maker). But when I saw how the special effects banknotes became "stars," I think the characters you can concentrate on are a secondary issue. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Mewing cherubs, elastic doors, irritable dead children who can not speak clearly ... and the idiotically cloudy end that is the most sophisticated to give you a new age of butterfly and soul enchantments. I will be my skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I loved you from "The Cowboys". Stop it.
