Most of the French films I've seen - and enjoyed - were more than just talk, but that's fine. I found them interesting, well-photographed and interesting actors. (At one point, however, I wondered if Gerald Depardieu was in any French movie ever made! It seems like that.) This film has the same interesting visuals and is well-opened. But then it came to talk, talk and talk more ... which is fine for drama, but not for the mystery of murder. After a while, I almost fell asleep and watched it. In fact, the film was more like a game with almost all the scenes that took place in one room. So if you like games, you'd love to ... but I want a little more bang for a murderous story.
