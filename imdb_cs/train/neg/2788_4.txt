Much is written about the Purple Rain, the seemingly "chin-essential" musical biofilm, but I'm here to tell you that the film does not deserve its high praise. <br /> <br /> First we get One thing straight Prince is a great musician and music is one of the areas where Purple Rain excels. Even the score is charming and if it was shot purely as a concert film, it would be a wonderful experience, unfortunately it is not and as such a film has some problems. First is a haunting acting / song, Prince's character "The Kid" is supposed to look like some kind of mysterious loner of a few words, unfortunately it's just gone like a cornet and incense. A good solitary figure should have at least some gossip, unfortunately the prince's character seldom has a few words in the film and it's hard to believe that he will get that girl. Everything seems to me a little gone, which is a shame because you can say that it is a character that is terribly contradictory and lives a very complicated life, but we are never allowed to get inside. <br /> <br /> The surprising aspect of this movie is how much is going on at the concert. Prince's and Morris's lives are far from giving up the backstairs for a performance that I think makes sense from a commercial point of view, but it's exhausting to have a 2-hour movie where half seems to be on stage, especially when story stories learn he avoided it. <br /> <br /> So summarize: It's not a very good movie.
