I saw this movie when he was released, and my reluctance to get stuck all the years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> It seems that Greenaway's goal is to capture every literary image in Tempest and achieve it literal. If someone had to say, "my heart takes years," we would be shown a real human heart with the attached pigeon wings that cross the screen. <br /> <br /> This process is for some fresh tableaux, but in the end it's an easy exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. I do not want to get rid of the pleasure of the other audiences found in this movie, but it is worth noting that not everyone in the audience was enchanted.
