For some reason, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, CBS's local office in New York spent several years in the late night slot on Friday or Saturday nights, usually at 2:00 or at some time. It's a good movie for this time because it's really hard to watch and quite strange (see other reviews for a specific story info). Anyway, after I caught them several times in those days just before the cable TV (And even after it hit, but before I offered a lot of all-day programming), I still caught this little thing. After I did not see it for many years, I decided to find it on DVD. Well, it's just available (from every search I've ever run) in a rather dirty, grainy print on the Budget label "Brentwood Video" as part of 4-pack movies (4 films on 2 double-sided discs) called Alien Worlds, if anyone is interested. It is usually available for about $ 10 - but much less if you buy. The other 3 movies in this set are easily available in a host of other public cinema collections, so you do not have to comment here. But I did not see "Eyes" available anywhere else. Although the "restored" version does not appear in any way, this print takes exactly 92 minutes, so for a given moment IMDb runs 90 minutes is incorrect. Even with a 92-minute runtime, it's not uncommon for a movie played in English from another language to run for some time. It seems to be a common practice in budget and conscience that sometimes saves money without bothering to copy some scenes at all unless they are considered important to the story. Would it be a longer version in no less confusing? Who really knows if you did not see it in your native language ... By the way, my efforts to keep track of it during the day do not work and I'm just going to stop. There's something to watch in the middle of the night that just fits this movie ... or maybe it's just from my previous experience, who knows it?
