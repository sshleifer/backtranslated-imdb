* SOILER * It's a fake! The whole thing is fake! There are no spirits or zombies, Alan is the Lord and his cousin or brother or brother, or something like that wants a castle and his title for himself. So he invests this overly complicated and unnecessary insignificant plan alo SCOOBY-DOO to drive Alan to suicide. Most of the movie is that she picks up the red heads and attacks them. It does not even kill them. She gets to sleep and the girl disappears, and he thinks he's buried somewhere. If he looked at the so-called Evelyn spirit, he could say he was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Do not bother to borrow it, and if you bought it and did not even notice it, sell it. Fast! Make a favor and stay out of Night Fate. I'm giving this glowing CRAP-O-LANTERN.
