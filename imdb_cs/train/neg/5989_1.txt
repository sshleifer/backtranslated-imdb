wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to see this movie in the cinema. I can not think I'm having my time unnecessarily. It works best and the special effects are coarse. They have been filing the worst case scenario in the history of some extremely embarrassing quotes I have ever heard in my life. I swear that God "vanished" is better than this. Madonna should win and Oscar compared to those boys. I want an hour and a half of my life back. Honestly, people do not see it, even a toddler would make this film insult their intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to say who's more wooden, that's boys from their own puppets. dear people, do not waste time on this movie, you will live to regret it.
