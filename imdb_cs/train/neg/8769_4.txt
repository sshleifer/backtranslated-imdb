It was a movie I hoped I could suggest to my American friends. But after four attempts to watch the film to the end, I knew I could not even follow the damn thing to conclude. You are almost convinced that the real war will not last so long. Others will try to challenge my patriotism for criticism of such a film. But out of the plane, you can not go after watching Saving Private Ryan at LOC. Forget the differences in the movie budget or the audience - it does not exclude the director from creating an intelligent movie. The length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it repeats itself - it still attacks the same kick but gives it different names. I thought LOC was terrible terrain - this hill looked like my yard. The sequence of character development (the memories of the plowers who look back at the last moment, before putting on) should be all the time of the movie and should not just collapse into one long memory. To this day I still had to look at the end. But there was a much better film (does not say much) called Border.
