Sure, I like short cartoons, but I did not like it. Of course, kids like it. But then I'm not a child (though I still think young). I will not tell you anything about the story because the simple reason is not a story. How is it possible that this cartoon dragon was nominated for the Oscar? Well ... I think it's because people in the thirties were much more satisfied than they were now. At the moment we live, everything has to happen quickly. Now look at the movies and come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. That's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 1930s because it seems so quiet. But every time you get to the hills, I think ... <br /> <br /> Finally: if you love music (and frogs) you have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, do not transpose your time.
