It may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producer of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and I want it back! Chris Kattan is funny about 10 minutes. His high voice and crazy irritation are getting old, and then you realize the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls into the long line of former SNL-ers who have tried movies. Some were great, some miserably disappointed. There is not much ground in this category. Though Chris Farley was brilliant and then fine, and then not so funny and then dead ... so I assume he will strike the whole spectrum into one career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a plague. br /> <br /> c
