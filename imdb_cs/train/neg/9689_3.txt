In one respect, it's like the "Wizard of Oz", with Paris in black and white and Riviera. However, it is supposed to be sacred love, destructiveness and moral decadence, while in reality they are designer dresses, Riverie shots, lots of precious cars, and the interlude of music and dance that Vincent Minnelli suggests in one of his days. A traceable but remarkable example of a desperate, dark plot and a brilliant style that goes in the opposite direction. (Was it a model for "Talented Mister Ripley"? Does anyone have a sense of belonging between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
