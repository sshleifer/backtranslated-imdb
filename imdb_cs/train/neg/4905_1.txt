I'm usually disappointed with network movies. Even films that attract big actors are usually destroyed by television people. This is the worst of the worst. The script is weak, and acting, especially what is in Tracey Pollan, is unfortunate. I went out to see how kids play in college and to behave better. Pollan behaves as if he were reading the script when he was speaking. When trying to express fear, anger or sadness, it is extremely hollow. Due to the overall quality of production, I hardly took it seriously. If you decide to become courageous, get ready for great disappointment. Scary things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you feel warm and crushed, and you'll probably be as nervous as I should see the end arrive. "First dies" says a lot about this movie.
