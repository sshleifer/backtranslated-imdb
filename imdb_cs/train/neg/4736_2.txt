The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl (I'm sorry I'm interested, I think pretty girl is the only top of the movies) and 0.5 for being shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating . I was surprised that I could sit. <br /> <br /> Lets you talk about the plus points in the movie. Girl. Ueto Aya is cute. That's all it takes to save the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, I'm sure most people (including myself) would not touch the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now you can talk about minus points. First of all, it's really expensive, with lots of repetitive scenes. The scenes from Nachi and Azumi are still coming back. It looks more like a dramatic way to shoot. Typical Japanese dramas of love flashbacks, and this movie too. Secondly, the film is too unrealistic in the historical environment. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a bad way of showing creativity, throwing ninjas that behave like bears and cobwebs, etc. ... reminds me of Shinobi, though Shinobi is a fantasy movie. In addition, to describe "i-don't-know", what effect the director is filming people who die with blood spraying (literally) all around ... people did not realize that their head was cut off ... etc. etc. Too many of them spoil the show. It seems that the film has a strong influence on the anime. This greatly spreads the exhibition. Thirdly, Azumi is not supposed to be a murderer. It looks more like a male army, just a woman. I do not think you'll see that killer warriors return to army camps. The only time I felt she was acting like a "killer" was when Kiyomasa Kato was killed at the end of Azumi 1. Eventually, the plot was thin in both films. It is a linear plot without any development or surprise.
