You will not see this movie if you appreciate your mind. At the end of our collective view, I and my friends estimated that each of us lost 5% of our brains on our track. The only person involved in the work that was not clinically insane was a designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in the mouth. Now I realize that instead of the feeling of resistance, this film has been in my deepest hatred. I hate this movie so much, a lot. Some might say that this film is not meant to be taken seriously. If it did not happen seriously. But yes. The plot is heated to the Blade Runner-esque version of the universe, coupled with cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur films. Dialogue is not only small and insignificant, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg is not even trying, but George Newbern as Theodore Rex's voice is like a nail of soul. And whether her Julie Landua is back with British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as a blustering commissioner, you will dive into an ever-growing sense of mistrust and disillusionment. I recommend this film to anyone who wishes to see the depth of stupidity that humanity can fall into.
