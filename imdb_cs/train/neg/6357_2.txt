I'm so disappointed. This movie left me feeling like I was avoiding my time and mental energy. Here was the important film of Woody Allen: the non-governmental Manhattan from the upper class discussed whether to cheat their wives. Woody, I've seen these characters, I've seen the story ten times. Where does your creativity go ??? You must open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically from Annie Hall - and you have to change it. <br /> <br /> There are much more interesting and funny scenarios where you can apply your brand of rage and harshness - when I learned that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, he will not do anything for me - because I was already expecting his old alertness: a couple who get tired and cheat each other. Compression and the same old, same old. If Woody wants to win back his fans, then he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not offended.
