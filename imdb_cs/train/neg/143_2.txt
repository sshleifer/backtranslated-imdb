In an effort to bring the genre of teen slasher who was taken spoofs like Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday, Valentine fails. Why People Like Halloween? Because it was original, new and overtaken what ever happened. Why do they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slash-flick that barely has a gore what-sometimes. The story is so Halloween and Urban Legend, it's not funny. And the moment the killer appears on the screen, you know who he is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. Teen slasher genre is DEAD Overcome! <br /> <br /> 0 of 10
