The only reason I leased it was due to an article in the Fangoria magazine. This article looked interesting. Well, it is not. It was a very boring, amateur-written and directing film. All the actors in this movie are terrible, with the exception of Faye Dunaway, who is always happy to watch. But too much time focused on Gina Phillips and her absurd encounter with the ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a strong Argentine accent, you can only understand a few words he says. Also at hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays a very sweet love for Gina Phillips. Bottom Line: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and it is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would put this one star, but I gave it only three, because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But it was not so great in that.
