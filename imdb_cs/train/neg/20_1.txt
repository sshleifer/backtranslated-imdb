This movie was terrible. initially, I just read the summary chart and looked OK so I watched it. The game was TERRIBLE. it was as if the actor was almost a friend. everything seemed to be fake. I feel bad about Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I've seen it at least 20 times .... the conspiracy was also stupid. writers were probably sleeping when they came up with lines. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it's a good kind of bad movie. the one you are watching just to find out how much it can get you to tell other people later how you could not believe the horror of the movie. I think everyone should watch it so we can appreciate better other REAL movies.
