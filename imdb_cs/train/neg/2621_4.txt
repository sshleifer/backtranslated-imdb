I do not want to bring a child up to 8 years to see it. Puppies that scatter from buildings that were stretched out by dangerous machines and listened to the terrible laughter of Cruella to name some of the events is too much for a young child. <br /> <br /> Live action gives a more sinister feeling than a cartoon version, and there is a pretty worrying moment, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will scare and terrify kids. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Disney people mean, but neither the story nor the acting was the usual level. Puppies are cute but this film is dirty at best.
