Alfred Hitchcock is not my favorite director, but imagine what he could do about it! Land has great potential for tension. John Garfield is almost always great, and Raymond Massey is murderous. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive front lady, but the supporting cast is big and very capable. Yes, he will start to sleep quite early. There are too many coincidences. And an important subject is negligible by eventually becoming just a little more than a love story. It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey and character actresses. But that's not very good.
