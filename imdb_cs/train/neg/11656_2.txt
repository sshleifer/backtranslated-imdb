Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Simple links to movies like Mission Impossible 2 do not lead to comedy. The film opens well with the funny scene of white people and the great use of James Woods Andy Richter. Unfortunately, the film will drop. The game is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and feels completely out of the box. The movie looks disturbed and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer gags in this movie with a snail's pace, including joints and previously mentioned Tom Cruise, were not fun for everyone in my theater. The film, fortunately, comes in the 83th minute to stop in a sharp unsuccessful ending. (I say shocking because the end does not even try to quit humor) I do not know what else to say, except that it is a careless rushing sequel that makes Miramax more money on the backs of silly teenagers. Overall, a very badly shot movie.
