Too many secondary fence lines without primary. Too many hot knobs have been shifted for no reason, they've got this boring film that does not say anything with every dramatic feature that's out there: death, divorce, money, parental problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, admission, rejected love, travel problems, gender, misunderstanding of generations, robbery, legal matters, weapons, medical ethics, "deep real love"? Do you think it would be an interesting movie, but no hell? all these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the "absolutely deep" (and super-long) lecture for the child at the end of the film is a complete nonsense. Damage. I forgot to mention: actors, everyone, are pretty good. That made me turn it off. Their talent has fallen badly, the film is also well shot: light, motion, etc. Every episode - all is in place. It's just the meaning that's missing.
