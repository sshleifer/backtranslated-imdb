If you're watching this movie, you're either a fan of Fred Olen Ray, you've found it on a $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast, and you thought, "what do I have to lose?" Or you turned around a closed-end video rental and rent the first movie who touched his finger. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically wrong. It's all that a terrible movie needs: a screenplay with a jaw dial and exhausting turnovers in a venue, a mad science involving psyche and other dimensions, continuity that seems to be going through time and space balls, actors that are not just wooden, but it seems (it's not all that's what you would have asked for) and, of course, the 5th monster played what I suppose is Fred Oleen's child Ray. but it's something that reminds the heart - as if Mickey & Judy chose to gather all the kids around and make a monster movie (hey, my dad can drive it! yeah!) We can use the red color of my johnny dad's hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper who can act on it!). Watch the reel over the credit - find out why the final movie was so bad. By the way, Biohazard II ... Alien Force is also worth seeing, but not. have the same pleasantly varnished veneer.
