Tracking the tenants was interesting to me. It's the first film I've ever seen, where I've been moving in speeds in parts (not) - and normally I can watch some of the Turgid action movies on the Serbo-Croatian Indias and find them fascinating. <br /> <br /> Tenants are frustrating, slow and overly orchestral. One of the main scenario problems is a small dialogue about realistic characters, except for pieces where the characters "collide" in a highly structured environment (to make this work, the film needed to feel more conceptual, which was not). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone looks two-dimensional. Worse is the character of Bill Spear, known as Snoop Dogg. I found its characterization very inconvenient and very incoherent. At one point I even stopped the film because I was so disturbed by the nature of the aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery, the lack of a different personality layer than the reactionary "on" switch (which I can really foresee after a while), so I desperately wanted to have some redemption . One reason for this cup, however, may be the faded time of the movie (probably the 70s, it feels and looks rather early noughties). If he was safer in the 1970s, his character might seem clearer. The lighting of the film was also uncomfortable. The whole audio tour will try to provide a crisp, jazz-infusion atmosphere that simply did not work, largely because it was too well lit. Tenants, for me, are an incredible movie. It does not describe real people, nor does it suggest any interesting ways of thinking about the race, identity or life of the writer, whether white or black. <br /> <br /> Special, I came up with feelings that David Lynch needed this project; his exciting, cluster-and obsessive look and feel would lift both the actress and the script into something remarkable.
