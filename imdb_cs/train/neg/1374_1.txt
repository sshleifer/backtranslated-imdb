Man, this was funny. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have realized what a bunch of stems was much easier. Seriously? I want someone connected with this movie to be questioned, immediately effective. For anyone who wishes to watch this "movie", let's take a look at a few points. Oh wait. There are none. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored and he decided to shoot something with some random person and somehow shot a video tape. This film is literally the worst film of all time. Do not believe me? Go to him. Do it, man. I'm doing it. But be prepared to clean your eyes. If you manage without blowing a cow, you are very strong and courageous.
