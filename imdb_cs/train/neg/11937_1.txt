Superhero movies almost always bother, and that's no exception. His only redemption is the fact that COULD was even worse. I'd put "Batman & Robin" and "Steel" above this movie, so yes it's bad ... If you're looking for black superhearts, check out 'Blankman' its not a "serious" superhero movie, but at least its fun.
