It seems that Greenaway has the habit of trying to deliberately disgust his audience. This film opens with incessant and purposeless, pointless, occasional inca. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers trick tricks to shock that they really do something meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. It's a bit perverse because of perversion.
