A pretty crazy whodunit featuring all black cast tries to find out who has assassinated the filandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to make it big. Was that his wife? His girlfriend? His future? Her father? His Butler? Newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result is a little overwhelming, and the actors here do not really have a mood depending on one or the other. Why Snake Poison as a Weapon? Who knows? Who cares? Music is fine, but there is not much of it and most of it is nice "let's go with this" it's not good for your time. All black cast films are better.
