Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sexual change from a doctor (John Carradine - dead drunk) and acts as Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and continues to teach the history of film at an acting school run by crazy John Huston (do not ask) and breaks a young happy couple (young, handsome Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes Farrah Fawcett ). <br /> <br /> Take a great novel by Gore Vidal, who was incurable and naturally tried to make him. They also hired an English guy with a definitely anti-American attitude and hired a couple of dubious talents (Welch, Reed) and old old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West) all together and .... SURPRISE! !! Absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film was rated X at its release (reduced to R), mostly due to the really impeccable scene in which Welch suits Rusty (Roger Herren) and the scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett. The movie is very scattershot ... scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all, but I've never been bored. <br /> <br /> The behavior differs wildly ... Reed is terrible ... really sad. Huston chews again and again the scenery, and again at a furious extreme. Welch is not really as bad as Myra, but its lines do not make sense, so you never know what to do about it. The West is barely in the movie (blessing) and it is really a bad thing to hear a woman almost 80 years old sex rupture. Roger Herren (what happened ...) was very young, handsome and bad as Rusty. Fawcett is all right. It's hard to find things to talk about ... you just look distrustful. He has to see the movie - believe !!!!
