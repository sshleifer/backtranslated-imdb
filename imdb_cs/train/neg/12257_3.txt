"It's not like a big mechanical toy," says the figure soon, commenting on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" would just want the animal to be convincing like a shark from the Jaws series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Actuating and directing are not much better; seems to be more suitable for deodorants or commercial bubbles than for horror film. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre but also for the audience. Let's say you liked this movie, it only encourages the creator to offer us more of this bull, further destroying the horror genre. (* 1/2)
