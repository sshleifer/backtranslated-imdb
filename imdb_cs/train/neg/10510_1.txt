oh god where to start ...... bad acting ... characters you do not care about ... they're Americans or British ... They seem to think they're in America because where else is this enormous forests in the Midlands ... one big blame ... all night through these forests ... until they walk in and around in Scotland they will come in the morning ... when the whistle knocks on the poor traveling woman over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> to "care" for an unconscious woman ... so what do they do, rather than comfortable, cover her head, hide her, or even move her from the blooming path they just let lie on the hard way as they go and make a fire 100 yr away ... and all the time they have a camper van, put it in ... and the horny angels who have a desire for a human species so much that they were thrown out of the sky to live between us ... what do they do? to engage in sexual relations with any men they meet? ......... they do not bite huge pieces of them and tear their heads ... I think they lack the point ... <br /> </ b> They are not beautiful sexually deprived of the former angels who are cannabis vampires ... and when it comes to savini telling how breathtakingly beautiful they are ... well these girls have a good body but nothing special on their face off. the main role was much nicer than the so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> Waste film waste from Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
