Before explaining the comment "Alias," let me say that the "Desert Trail" is bad even according to Western standards that look at The Three Stooges. In fact, Carmen Laroux is like a long-lived girl, Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent, you will instantly recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short Save Belle. <br /> <br /> In the "Desert Trail" John Wayne gets to play Moe Howard character and Eddy Chandler gets into the Curly Howard game. Like their counterparts, the counter runs alongside the 53-minute Moe movie Curly. Wayne's character, the torture skirt, is not very cute, but he's a good guy. <br /> <br /> Playing a rodeo cowboy traveler Wayne holds the rodeo of the box office at gunpoint and takes the money he would win if the proceeds were good - the other riders had to settle for 25 cents per dollar (actually even less Wayne robbed the cashier). It is not explained how Wayne kicks the rider and is still considered the hero that gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Things are complicated at this point because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his deputy Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix - who would go to play Sheriff Micah on The Rifleman TV) see Wayne robbing the treasury and then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly are accused. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another city to get out of law and change names to Smith and Jones. Those who meet them first, but with their old friend, Larry, whose sister is interested in the other half of love (Senorita Rita remains behind him an old town and is no longer in the movie). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is pretty well played by the beautiful Mary Kornman (now she grew up, but in her younger days she was one of Hal Roach's original "The Gang" casts). Kornman is the main reason for watching the mega-lame West, and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than all others in the production as if using a completely different crew to film them. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, the action sequences in this case are extremely weak and the technical movie is incredibly bad. Two major scenes with persecution will end up with shots of shots of wide raider shots that fall from the horse. Both times the editor shoots on the picture of one of the characters that rolls on the ground but there is no horse in the frame, the film is completely different and the character has different clothes than the rider. There is a liberal use of traces in other places, none of which even remotely convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch is the scene in the middle of the movie, where Moe and Curly get on their horses and leave (on the right screen) out of the cabin while the posse galloping towards the cabin from the left. The cameraman watches the slow pan on both sides to the right and then turns to the left to reveal the approaching posse. Outside home movies, I've never seen anything like that, not because he looks stupid (what he does), but because a competent director would never want such a scene. They would filmed both riders away, and then shifted the camera and film posse approaching as a separate action. Or, if they were creative, they would move the sequence so that the camera would display the rider in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
