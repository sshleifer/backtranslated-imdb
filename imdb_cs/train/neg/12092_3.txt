I do not forget Haneke's abilities to make movies. For example, I appreciate the fact that its persistence in unseen natural days illuminates setting as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. Regarding the content of this film, however, it is very sad that in the 21st century there is still a need to patologize relations or feelings of domination-submission (and / or BDSM practices). The problem with the mother is incredibly up-to-date, as well as the alienation and misunderstanding of Walter (it does not mean the frustration of a loved one who is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable, I mean he looks at her as if he was crazy or like a monk, come on!). I think D / s is not something new in the world and I think it's rather stupid to treat this subject as if it was something "weird" or pathological; It is not. In general, films that deal with this subject are lagging behind. <br /> <br /> So, for me, I feel that this movie will end up as a rather program-based film that worries about very obsolete psicoanalitic theories that it's almost embarrassing?), and that does not really concern the real lives and experience of those who dealing with D / s relationships (personal experiences, forums, discussion rooms, and recent study studies).
