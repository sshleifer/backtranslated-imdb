This movie really has no beginning or end. And it's really incredible. Mary-K and Ashley are trainees working in a correspondence room for Italian fashion company. But for some reason they are placed in a five-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Colosseum) and all other trainees with whom they work are as unusually similar as they are. One thing I've found in this movie is the way one of the NESTAT guys with a guy. I think they tried to twist their usual plot a little. Nice try.
