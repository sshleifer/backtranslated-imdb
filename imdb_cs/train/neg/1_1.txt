Robert DeNiro plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate of all time. This film is so full of talent, it's really disgusting. The script is incredible. Dialogue is incredible. The character of Jane Fonda is a cartoon of her own, and it's not funny. The film moves with a quick snail, photographs in the wrong way and is unbearably a sermon. He also joins every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in supporting role, but what? Equally unpleasant is this new IMDB rule requiring ten rows for each review. When this movie is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text to let other readers know it's a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
