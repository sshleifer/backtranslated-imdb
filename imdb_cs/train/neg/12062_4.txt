When talking about the great combinations of director and actor, J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson are not usually mentioned. Probably because the production of nine joint ventures between the two ran a range from really good entertainment to average. Unfortunately Kinjite: Forbidden subjects fall into the other. <br /> <br /> This is sad because Kinjite could be much better. But because of my life I do not understand why it is necessary to make the father of a missing Japanese girl, a guy wont to get some cheap jolly because romance in his marriage was exhausted. That could be good for another movie together, but it meant no purpose. <br /> <br /> Simple political drama with Charles Bronson as a policeman who has seen too much work and has strong prejudice against the Orient. The part could also use a bit of explanation. But he will have to overcome if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to find a captured Japanese school girl. Bronson's time in the vice-communist group told him exactly where to look for the kidnappers. Stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history. In fact, in the movie Best Scene, Bronson made him eat his expensive rolex watch and lit the car. <br /> <br /> At one point Fernandez coincidentally sees Bronson and Lopez in all-day delicatessen and after his rolex snack, he squeezes a place with Uzi killing all but Bronson and Lopez. I really think a small incident would have more than a few police officers from the LAPD to Fernandes. But that's another big hole in the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Fernando is still the end of a very harsh righteousness. I wish the whole movie was better. This was Bronson-Thompson's latest film and the last director, J. Lee Thompson. He had to go with something better.
