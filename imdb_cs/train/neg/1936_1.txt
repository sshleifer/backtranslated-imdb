Saving alert. <br /> <br /> When the sister of the main character is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka beside her to make her drink. But before he kills her, she tells her sister's phone partner (Teri Garr) that she does not have a drink for four days. However, the police never mention the results of a toxicological report! And the characters are talking about being drunk when they fall down the stairs. Huh? A really bad mistake in this movie, which is quite horrible. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad due to the large cast. Some mistakes: writing is not very good, music is bad and there is no tension, because we already know the answer to the secret from the first scene in the movie.
