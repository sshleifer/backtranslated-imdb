After the mob boss Vic Moretti (later the great Anthony Franciosa) kills his lady who cheated him with Derek, their new driver / Vietnamese veto, and blames him from the poor boy, Derek finds himself in jail where he has to fight a corrupt administrator, prisoner brother Vic, who runs the prison, and yes, unlikely attempts by the shadow agent CIA (great genre and principal director John Saxon) to turn from different prisoners to superhuman invincible zombies. Of course, things get out of hand and it's up to Derek and the other unchanged prisoners to save the day after they got infected in prison. John Saxon is a great talented actor and as director Saxon is ... a great talented actor. To say that this film (the only John's trip to this day) lacks a certain visual atmosphere, it would be a little understatement. However, the film is not entirely meritorious. Dialogue, even if it is idiotic, is just awful to ever be humorous. It's sad that it's not so much for the film that it could be in itself and it lasts forever when the film starts to come into its own (which is quite late in the movie). As such, I most recommend this movie is to say that if you are a fan of Saxony (which I am really), worth a watch, just go with low expectations and you should be cool. <br /> <br /> Eyes: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure get topless <br /> <br /> My class: D +
