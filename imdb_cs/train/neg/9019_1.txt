Why else would he do this to me? <br /> <br /> Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I'm aware of how ... it's "good" Dean Cain. Obviously, it's going to be a cheese film and every cheese film has its own special way of scratching your head. I will not call these spoilers because you can not really spoil this movie any more than it is. <br /> <br /> We start ... why is it a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? Why is the scientist from Chicago and the other scientist coming from LA and not one of them could be more Eastern Europe if they tried? How difficult would it be if we got either an American actor or just changed the chill state sheet the movie offers us to say that these people are not American? Why are there two opportunities when the movie gives us a slug line? We get a helipad-day and later we divide into the hall. And then it is who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared for it, even though they mentioned it, but I think it's next. Does the movie actually improve if you can see it on several split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon can surely go down this hall .. via .. and over ... and after .... and after all ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings of film history? It was from scooby doo. Oh dragon is dead now ... you say you want to go for dinner? Sure, but not in some Chinese place .... with a dragon in the name! AH HA HA HA !! HA HA HA !! HA HA HA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But never be afraid ... even if the entire building exploded ... and no one was alive ... for some reason, there is the second undamaged, unmanned lab that survived quite well so they can continue. It hurts for all of us. <br /> <br />
