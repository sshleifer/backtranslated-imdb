There is not much to say about this movie, it's terrible. The acting and dialogues are far from decent, the story of hybrid werewolves is not well explained and the whole thing has a plot of holes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you would not want to see. It's so amateur that it makes me sick. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on DVD was in the Extras. Gag reel. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope no one buys it, it's not even a loan. <br /> <br /> Just keep going.
