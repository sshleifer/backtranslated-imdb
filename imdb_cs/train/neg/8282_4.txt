Now you should know about this movie, the "bomb" of Jessica Simpson, who got quite right on the video (limited anemic theatrical run). Basically, Mrs. Simpson Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her friend to surprise him just to find him in bed with another woman. She's got stuck, but she has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom we'd like to see more often in the movie) that lets her stay. Katie ends up getting a job with two amazing associates (Penelope Ann Miller and Always Fun Andy Dick) who are just using Katie to drive out President Larry Miller. This is strictly a b movie, it does not mean to be deep. Jessica Simpson is by no means a great actress, but she is quite beautiful and never really annoying. The film is observable in that it is not an abomination, but its faded fluff. Penny Marshall is funny in the clip (a fine joke about Milwaukee wanted me), and there's a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (do not read too much about it). So it's not terrible but easy to skip. Your safe bet is to watch it on television, if at all. Again, it is not good, but not a deep disaster.
