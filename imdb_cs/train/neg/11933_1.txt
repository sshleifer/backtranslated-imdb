My baby is doing better videos than this! I feel the tear off of $ 4.00 paid for renting this thing! There is no video stream on the video, apparently designed by Wellspring; and worse, there is no production date for the original movie that is shown anywhere in the movie! The only date is 2002, which led an unsuspecting tenant to believe he was getting a recent movie. This movie was so bad from the point of view of obsolescence and insignificant for any time but exactly when it was done I was amazed that someone would save time and marketing costs as a video. It might be interesting for students studying the counter-culture of the 1960s, anti-war, illegal, fitting, fastening and launching culture; but when you read the back of the video clip, there is no hint that this is what you get. If you make a rental mistake, it's probably best to see the drugs, so your mind will better match the Fassbinder and Fengler brains wavelengths. Regardless of your state of mind while watching, I can tell you that it does not improve after the first scene; so you know you will definitely have to sleep long before the end.
