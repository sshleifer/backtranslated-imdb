Titular creatures cause confusion in a quiet little desert town. This is basically a whole plot for this film, and while the scenes devoted to the Munchies themselves are somewhat fun (in low dimensions), all the remains are just fillers and bad fillers. From the "hero", who is a painful Woody Allen wannabe, to the immortal cop of the city, it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the movie. Sometimes almost everyone appeared on the screen and I thought, "Okay, at least, that girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to stand up against the other fools?" The film is also filled with pop links (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably began in the early 1990s. (* 1/2)
