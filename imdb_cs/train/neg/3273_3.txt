Dukes of Hazzard is quite a success? a $ 53 million movie that is worse than any episode of a 25-year-old TV show. The plot is good enough to use, but hopeless fun is seldom found and casting is quite insulting: Johnny Knoxville is more a traveler than a protagonist, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is a crazy criminal, Enos of Michael Weston's exhaustive, seemingly ideally-occupied Willie Nelson only seemingly waits for control to be clear, and Burt Reynolds is stuck in some purge where he is condemned to survive his old films as a small player, it's a curious choice for Boss Hogga to say the least, but he has a good time with heckler and a hundred dollar bills. Do you know the movie has problems when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen? But worse than scenario or casting is the hopeless direction of Jay Chandrasekhara: seemingly born without the concept of comic timing, unable to do much more than the basic two shots and seemingly clueless to shoot a car, let alone a few decent spells in the film, he seems determined to film some signs of life before it takes place. There are some neat postmodern moments that turn around in each episode around the Stereotypical Flag of the Confederate Flag and Daisy's stereotypical role, but no film that makes you pines when Hal Needham directs such things (and badly) can be a good thing.
