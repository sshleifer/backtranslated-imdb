This movie was so bad that I had to shift most of it to get to good bits. What good bits? the only piece that was worth it was the end (those who saw the movie will know what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie, like the underworld that meets the dawn of the dead, meet Freddy and Jason, but what I got was that crap. The story was forgotten, cast was misused and what the director said when he did. That could be great, but I proved to be the most boring film I've ever watched. Okay, so what if there was a nice little T and A, I was a gorou and I was bitterly disappointed. Do not expect the movie to be good, but if you want to have a bad, stupid horror, then watch it all and see how you should not make a horror movie.
