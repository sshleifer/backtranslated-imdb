the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater. I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and I thought that this film was accepted at the festival. it was an interesting assumption, and it seemed to go somewhere but always fell apart every time she tried to do something. First, if you want to make a musical instrument, find someone with a musical talent. the music consisted of a cheese piano that sounded like playing a stereo in the room where they were filming. the lyrics were horribly written, and when the rhymes were not obvious, they were mood-like rhymes that showed how far they went to try to make this film. and you think you'll find people who could sing when they're making a musical, right? not in this case. Fortunately, most of the time they said half, mostly sang in the cold, but when they sang it, it raged me. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and it only solves music. Some players were pretty good, but many dialogues were horrible, like most scenes. they obviously did not have enough coverage on the scenes, or they simply had a bad editor because they consistently jumped in line and used the awesome possibilities of cutting a movie. At least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added a hook to become musical. I hope investors can assure that someone can write music before they make the same mistake again.
