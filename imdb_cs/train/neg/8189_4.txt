It's always hard to have siblings better in your life than you, always trying to get out of that shade and not to leave bitterness to keep you from your family. Imagine that your older brother is Santa, and then imagine how hard it must be. This is a prerequisite here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays titled Fred, is an outrageous loser, who spends a lot of his energy, making sure that people do not walk around expecting good things to happen to them or give their brother Santa (played by Paul Giamatti) too much praise for mere lust-chopping, glory, hunger, a little scary guy that Fred would like to portray him like. Then you would not know, Fred needs financial favors, so he has to make up for it by helping his brother escape at Christmas. And the result is gaiety and lessons of life. Well, that should happen. The fact is that we have a Christmas movie featuring several good moments of Vaughn's patented fast-talking, ridiculously out-of-nowhere music videos of the moment, Kevin Spacey plays the auditor to stop running Santa (and it's one of the weakest I've seen at some time) , plenty of delightful Elizabeth Banks in rich Christmas clothes, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf clothing (being fair, it's the top), and a movie that's too swimmer in bitterness to feel like a good seasonal fare so far too sentimental in his second half feel like fun bags on all the wrong things, about the time commerce. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz also rides as Kathy Bates, but Vaughn is nothing more than a movie, and if you like his style, you'll find something you can enjoy. Unfortunately, there is very little to recommend this seasonal killing. Outside of Vaughn's rapture, the script barely throws something decent, with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a gruesome support group dealing with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dobkin's directories are not as good as a 20p Christmas card that you send to an aunt you have not seen in 10 years and they seem to think that simply adding ingredients together without a good mix or decent care will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we get a burnt, boring piece with too much sugar on top. Forget it and keep the cheerful elf back on again if you want a big, modern Christmas comedy <br /> <br /> You can if you like it. Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, Santa Clause 3: Escape clause.
