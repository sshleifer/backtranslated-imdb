I got a DVD called "Bogeyman" and this amazement was another feature. I suppose it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": doing "ass" of "u" and "me". I read before I see that BII contains a lot of records from the original and that she was playing actress Love. While watching "The Return of the Boogeyman," I decided to take a look at the original shots to get to know the notorious toothbrush scene. Before I knew it, the movie ended. Break it off. I think I thought it was BII because it has a similar name as one of the alternative BII titles. Well, at least it was just one of the other features, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about movie mistakes. Many, many mistakes. Who does this guy Ulli What does he think he is? He really thinks he will sell the same film in various forms. There is no original that would keep Part III up. It's basically a remembrance of the original with the eyes of the psyche, which gives us an exhausting bore game as everything happens. That's the movie. And one stereo scene, but you can read it from someone else's reviews. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is forever lost. <br /> <br /> Final Note: This is not a series of movies to be watched back.
