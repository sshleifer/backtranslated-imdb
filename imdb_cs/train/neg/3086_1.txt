I once thought "Stoned Age" was the worst movie ever shot ... I was wrong. "Hobbins," it all outstrips how I imagined, and a few that I could not. In "Stoned Age" I hated those characters. In "Hobgoblins," I hated actor ... and everyone else involved in making this atrocities. I'm not going to include a teaser in this movie, I'm not that cruel. I could not submit to innocent people like yourself for such torture. In fact, any discussion of a plot about this film is meaningless and degrading. The words I would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid, asinine, and inventive. <br /> <br /> Finally, please do not follow this movie. Please, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one human being to another, please. For your reason and reason DO NOT USE it. Destroy all copies you find.
