I just finished "Dark Chamber" aka "Under Surveillance" and I'm overwhelmed. Amazed, not by the movie, but thanks to some of the silly reviews I've influenced when I watched him. The story was so ravaged by plotting, and most of the actors were so flat, she considered it a comedy. I was really looking up and laughing in amazement when I held up this movie. Justin leaves the border of life at home with a painfully dependent mother to live with her father's monkey despite her mom's warning that Dad is not good. When a young woman is murdered, Justin becomes a suspect of tenants living in adjacent flats. Using a couple of friends to install hidden cameras to make them aware of them. As the truth begins to reveal, Justin reveals an unexpected secret. One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would want to hit another star or two generously when she was a little cracked, but no such luck. It would be a potential saving mercy of the film. Eric Conley played Justin very adherently, I thought, and I would not be surprised if I could see him in the future. <br /> <br /> The overall assumption of the film, even if it was affected by the clich√©, might work if it was not for the absurdly hollow "performances" of key members, most notably Alexander Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father) . Horror! (forgive the hook). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low-budget movies. I believe that independent film is our only hope for a decent film in the coming days. I will reduce low-budget movies quite slowly in terms of special effects, lighting, even musical score and overall picture quality. But I give no promise to the screenplay and scenario of Swiss cheese. There is a huge amount of competent-made low-budget movies out there. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not help, but I suspect that at least a few reviewers who praised the dark chamber are in some way connected with the production.
