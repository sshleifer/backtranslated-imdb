I was not sure whether Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the movie hit "Malibu Express". With his film Fit to Kill he proved that Sidaris is a serious director and not the only director. The plot written by Sidaris, which was ingrained by the academy, is a complex scenario involving many invisible twists and turns. Major composers work for a sex-based radio station known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In the film "Fit to Kill," he opposes his longtime nemesis Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most popular diamonds. A well written script is not all, excellent acting contributes to making this movie classic. According to critics and boxing films, this film will be awarded in the years to come. Now they have the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but they will undoubtedly become respected in the future. I am disappointed that no critical circles know Andy Sidaris's film work. Costumes, special effects, all help compliment this already beautiful piece of film. You can best ignore the gloomy ratings of this movie and go out and rent yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the relentless Runaway Bride and action that is better than or equal to the movie masterpiece The Last Action Hero. Andy, keep a good job.
