Arg. Mixing dinosaurs are back to get out of our senses in this ubiquitous third film. This time, European terrorists (the Irish said), a hi-jack military convoy to carry uranium. They enter the shipyard, open the wheelchair and discover our old friends carnosaury. Pandemonium comes to visit when rubber dinos chomp terrorists, cops and some marines. The whole movie seems to be (again) largely inspired by Alien (like Carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic Marines going through the "claustrophobic" shipyard? weapons ready. The third opus is probably the driest and worst movie in the batch, with just one cry of blood when the rubber dime breaks the naval head. Dinos are stiff, stirring the creature as usual, and T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when it crashes (it also does not seem to have eyes). One of the film's cruelest scenes is when the burghers arrive on the scene: he enters the building where a bearable car is held and hears some strange sound from another truck. When you open the surprise! The Rubber Plasma Gang exploded and swallowed them. Why was the dinos locked in the second truck after escaping from the first car? How did they get locked in because the truck door could only be blocked from the outside? What was the point of shooting this scene ???? He's worried about who cares? Both inches down for the excess rubber Iguana.
