Just as some of the other reviewers mentioned earlier, I'd like to know what the script was reading and went, "Yes! That's it ... It's another movie we're going to green light! "And who is that person should have his head examined for real brain activity? Because whoever is responsible for really scaring the money to do it after reading the script, I would like to give you your email address and maybe you The Wayans are funny, at least they can be, they've done some good movies, and they've had an incredibly entertaining performance on the road, but here's not just the logic that defies all the logic, not only that it's terrible, but not just the entire movie offensive from start to finish, not only that it's as amateur as you can find, but in reality they want to pay you for seeing this movie. Maybe if it was free ... naaah, it would still be a loss Usually I would like to write some long and detailed insight into why the film is so bad, but it was enough to say that I would let my bits talk. This is the smallest common denominator of the film making and it's about as unhappy as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 .. doing my top ten worst movies ever!
