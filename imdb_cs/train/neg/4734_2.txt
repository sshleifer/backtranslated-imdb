Do you like beautiful girls? Yeah, too. What is wrong to say about beautiful girls / women? Nothing, why would I only share this film with two stars, even if I got the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to watch beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something like that. This is a movie called Action Movie. So by definition it does not really need a conspiracy right? I do not intend 100%, but let's say yes. So what does it need? 20 minutes of shots from part 1 (a little bit exaggerated, but I felt it for more than 20 minutes ...) ?! That would be "no". But then you never know, people who looked at the first part, maybe they do not know what breakfast breakfast this morning, so let's remind them ... hey, maybe they remind them twice? Just make sure they will not forget ... at least until they borrow credits, of course !!!! <br /> <br /> So forget the story, character development, real emotions, "acting" (and no, I do not think women in the skirt of walking and / or fighting are responsible for playing!) ... what left? Yes, action scenes. Action scenes are not bad and that's why I shot the movie 2 Stars instead of 1! I give this movie a chance but it was a waste of time ... Do you have better things to do / follow me, believe me ...
