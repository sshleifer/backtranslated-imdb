As a professor of native films, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen with native content. I'd like to get a root channel to look at this movie again. The use of stereotypes, unthinkable attempts to exploit traditional coyote stories, and poor camera work was only worsened by an unconscious story and a bad script. Writer and director showed the worst part of a colonized approach to display indigenous people and communities. If he is indigenous, he has to return home and apologize to everyone he knows to be an apple, and to the internalized racism and the bad sense of humor they have developed. If this person is not indigenous, he must seriously examine his white privileges and ask himself whether they are uncontrolled, unintentional racism or whether they are deliberately unconscious. My only hope is that the native actors in this film have had a good time and at least have paid for their efforts. If you want to see good native movies then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance Me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals ... to name just a few.
