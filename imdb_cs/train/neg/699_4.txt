Probably one of the most brutal slasher films ever misdirected and misspelled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < one of five characters. ACTING It's not so bad that it's not so great except Daphne Zungia, who dies the way too fast and should be the main hero and the rest well boring, though Laura Lapinski's main heroine sometimes has its charm and you feel it at the end. they really see why they forbid it, the killing is mostly fake, one person has at first the half of a hand that looks really fake, but the others are quite unpleasant, like one girl gets headed by a car, one girl gets cooked alive and another is burned alive . <br /> <br /> TOTAL We are not really great slasher cou They were much better
