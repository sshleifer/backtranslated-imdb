My brother is a passionate DVD collector. He looked at the packaging (two models on the toilet) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to watch what turned out to be probably the most powerful film (I use this term freely). I felt obliged to sit. I did not dare to touch my brother with my brother, absolutely certain he had to curse the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name in the movie is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in one scene where "filmmaker" decided to show every movie (about four) in the whole movie. The whole movie actually resembles this suit. The fact that the DVD contains deleted shots was a shock. (But I went to bed without seeing it). It was no surprise, I found the disc without television about a week later.
