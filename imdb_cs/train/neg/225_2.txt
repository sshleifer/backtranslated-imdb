SPOILER: Young lover Jed is kicked out of Kate (Kate Andrea McDowell), because she mistakenly believes Jed has a relationship with one of her two gracious friends. Kate thought she had caught them. Kate throws Jed's shoes out of the door. Jed goes unwillingly and then sits in the middle of the way to put on his shoes. Then the truck goes ("crushed", one of the meaning of the title). And he dies. <br /> <br /> "And then he gets under the truck." Can you imagine that a screenwriter actually presents a script with this fence element? Until then, there is a comedy to be hurried but lacking real noise. Everyone except Jeda is just annoying. And then they kill the Jedi and all are sad to the end when the guys learn to love one another and to support instead of destructive. I give it 2 ugh's.
