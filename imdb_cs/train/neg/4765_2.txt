While the original helps the intellect, this cheap remake is only designed to shock the sensitivity. Instead of complicated drawings, this so-called thriller is characterized by sudden and seemingly random changes to the story, which only serve to make every bizarre development worse. The worst of all is replacing the original spicy dialogue of the reversed salt pile full of unnecessary four-letter words that left a sharp but uninteresting taste. It was a promise - an unfulfilled promise. The view of Michael Caine, which led to the graduation of Keller-Sullivan, like Patty Duke, is undoubtedly interesting. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor damaged his reputation first by taking on a role in this terribly re-sketched nonsense and then by turning to a performance that looks just as competent as compared to the amateur overcoming of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen a classic original, look for his dated visuals and tricks. Let it down, watch it and just enjoy the story and the half. As for the remake, pass this offense to the original.
