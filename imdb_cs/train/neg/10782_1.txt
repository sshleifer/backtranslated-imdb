the only scenes that made me laugh where people with christopher (crazy film director) appeared in it, the rest of the film was just boring. in the first hour or so nothing really happened. The jokes that should be fun, they are not and zeta jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts does the routine work of a former nasty duck (yes right!) to the girl next to (where did I see it before?) who gets that guy.for short.i really did not care what would happen to the main characters. If a sailplane actually fell out of the building while trying to commit suicide, the film could be more attentive than watching.
