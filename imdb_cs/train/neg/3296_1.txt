Film making of old TV shows is becoming a norm in Hollywood today, but this unrealistic humor in the toilet house, dirty tongue, your mother, dirty middleman, all Dukes of Hazzard fans both north and south of the Mason-Dixon line. From the initial succession of Bo and Luke Duke who made a monthly for Uncle Jesse (without a show of shine because the boys would be back to prison as a password violation) to Jesse's uncle's final succession with the governor of Georgia (Uncle Jesse was a moral compass despite his previous monthly ), this unsatisfactory loss of film is an open face of insult. I can not tell you how many parents I saw getting up and removing children from the theater during the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized they were terribly cheated. The original Duke Hazzards were family shows with basic moral values. The original Duchess of Hazzard were children safely, Hemi propelled, showing the fun that parents did not have to worry about George Carlin's seven words to teach his children. I have read reviews that show that the show and the film are nothing but racist. These commitments may be correct for the movie. These commitments are totally incorrect in the show. The show, if any, was about how to go and be friends with someone. Hollywood finally came out in an open place of contempt for those of us, Yankee, Rebel or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family and doing the right thing, even if it's not a popular thing. Hollywood finally brought to his conviction that these of us in the heart are stupid, ignorant, beer, waste, dirty toll, garbage that buys any waste that they are willing to sell. To prove to the Hollywood elitist that they are wrong. DO NOT OPEN THIS FILM. Boycott sponsors. Fill email and mailboxes from Warner Bros. with complaints that we do not know them to destroy one of the biggest TV shows of all time. Save money and buy a DVD from the original show, but whatever you do? DO NOT OPEN THIS FILM
