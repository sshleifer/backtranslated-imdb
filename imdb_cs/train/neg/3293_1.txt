What is snoring. Of all the bites of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to make and update, it is by far one of the most exalted. It was a totally pointless show and we really do not need a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> It does not matter what fanaticism and sexism have been in the system from the very beginning, so much progress has been made, socially, because the show has shown that the whole point of the show (if any) was lost. Also, what does it make sense to have a character named Boss Hogg if it's Not Overweight?
