The film has no confidence in helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what happened here, even a woman in front of the women's movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The only part of the film that you could trust was that Germany would like to know where the landing will be. Ignore the moment when the British caught all the spies, but even if they did not, they would not wander like that to assure the Germans that the landing would be in Calais. It's not one major thing that causes the movie not to work. It's the culmination of all the bad things that cause the movie to fail. Wrong directories, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (at all) to get together just to make the film flat. Generally speaking, spies should get into woodworking. Enthusiasm comes with a spy who asks if the information they have is valid or not and they are afraid they are exposed. This game has ended from the beginning. This spy does anything, just spying. Your only chance of gaining something that has some credibility and causes some tension can be a book.
