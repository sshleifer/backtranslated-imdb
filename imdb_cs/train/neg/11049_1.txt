If Mr. Cranky did it, I would be tempted to just copy his review and put it here. But as he did not, I would have to go alone. <br /> <br /> The only thing that puts this film in place of 1 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is excellent. However, this film can not save itself from disaster. The director had to be really upset when he worked on this, because it's just a conglomeration of scenes that were worthy of a very low continuity - reminiscent of bad 70s. "Even worse, both the actors and the director seemed to do it, but it is no reason to discuss the story of the line even though it is about a futuristic corporation called Proxate Corporation that has assembled a crew of unnecessary people to transport dangerous cargo to an old container / The computer of this ship is a child kept in a glass container and connected to one of the crews via USB 12 or something .The company should be called Prostate Corporation because the value of the fun of this movie is the same as the same name. /> I honestly can not find one scene I could say well created and created in ko I watched it until I had a touch of bird flu, and it reminded me that there are people who are actually worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. It will not hold it against him because he is a great actor and every big actor is entitled to one bad film in his career and this is doosie. So if it's not the only movie your shop finds or you're a man and you're not doing a prostate examination this week and you think it's a bad thing then put this really wide berth if of course if you're really a community minded, copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drinking path.
