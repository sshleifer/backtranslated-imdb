I would like to enjoy this movie, yes its SAW, fool blah blah ripoff, but I like those movies. If you do it well, all ingredients should be a good, not brilliant but good movie ... unfortunately these ingredients have disappeared! The game was terrible, and it was the first time to see when prisoners are introduced with their prisoner one by one (hood removed), notes and one lining are just terrible, yes I know bad writing .... but that's more it was bad writing associated with bad behavior. Two of the prisoners were in a relationship and they did not even recognize it until much further into the movie ..... I'm sorry, I even wondered why I was worried to review the film at all. <br /> <br /> I'll finish with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & PLOT HOLES! DETERMINATION!
