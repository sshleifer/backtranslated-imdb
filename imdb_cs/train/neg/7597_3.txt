I love showing movies in the 1930s and 1940s. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this picture. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, sir, no good. The only fun aspect for me was the character of Colin Farrell, an insecure writer, and despite the fight against the juicy theme of racism, this scenario approaches an ABC Afterschool Special audience. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not sound that he "acted" was Sutherland and his writings were few. He staggered close to the tired conspiracy.
