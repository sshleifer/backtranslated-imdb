This movie was like a bad wreck on the train, as bad as it was, you still had to keep track of it. My friend and I rented it and lost two hours of our day. Do not leave me wrong, acting is good. Only the film as a whole just made us angry. In this scenario, nothing was either positive or good. After this movie, I had to borrow something that was a bit lighter. Jennifer Tilly is, as usual, a very dramatic actress. Her character looks manic and not all of us there. Darryl Hannah, despite playing, does a great job playing the situation he is in. I found myself several times when I was screaming on TV and telling her to recover or get raged. Overall, a very violent film ... not for a weak heart.
