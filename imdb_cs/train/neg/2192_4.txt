Another film based on the trite, worn clich√© of a mad scientist has disappeared. The film focuses on a surgeon whose life ambition is to bring the dead back to life. I know, I know ... you've never heard of it! Of course, just as all these movies go, the experiment goes very, very badly and creates a manic, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setting, you would think it would be a bit more exciting. Poorly. Like many movies of this time, the idea is pretty, but the execution and the script are average. It's not the worst horror film I've seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still a cake), but not one of the gems.
