Watching this movie for action is more of a waste of time, because the figures on the ships work better than people. It is a pity that Anthony Quinn could not convince someone else to direct other films to Turkey. But it's full of entertaining value because Yul Brynner has hair, Lorne Greene shows the unconvincing French accent and the rest of the big names that appear in a comic book.
