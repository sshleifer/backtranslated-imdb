In 1454, the wizard Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is revealed in France, and his mistress, Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné), is tortured for witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, the next generation of their executioners will curse. Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) took part in a seance in the 1970s, evoking the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to Villas de Sade, the Hug family's property in the countryside, looking for a convent with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and devil's own, bring Mabille back to life, and execute local people in a sacrifice gore. After the death of his father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor Hammer amulet hidden in the well; along with Maurice, are trying to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVD's, Paul Naschm for $ 9.98; despite the fact that I do not have any links, I decided to take the chances. The first DVD of the unfinished and restored version of "Horror Rises From The Grave" is the movie B (or C) that immediately triggered Ed Wood. The funny story is made available through a modest script, direction, performances, cinematography, decorations, a special effect and release, and a lot of naked women. The result is just funny and I can guarantee Ed Wood's style is back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Not available
