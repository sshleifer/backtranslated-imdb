I saw Shiner on DVD. As I watched it, I thought, "It's really bad porn porn movies." I also thought, "Who wrote it has some real problems." Then I watched as director / writer Carlson explains his process as a special feature. Yeah, that was really strange. The film's emphasis is on two alcoholic losers who have struck each other to step out. They are marginally attractive. There is front and full nudity. These factors probably represent that the movie is seen at all. The most excruciating element of the film is gay bashing and subsequent gay bashing of the same victim, who undoubtedly tries to exact revenge against his attackers, two drunken drunkards. Not only is it an absurd and a bad topic from a technical point of view, but acting is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there's a boxer-stalker theme. It's really crazy, not absurd. This boxer is in some way traumatized by the constant attention of the mother of a guy who works in the gym of his car park. That's LA, he thinks. The boxer is so traumatized that he appears at Stalker's house, stripes in front of him and is excited in the process. Well, all I can say is why would the boxer who is the heart of the exhibitionist be so traumatized by the stalker's attention? It simply does not make sense. And I'm afraid some psycho-dynamics really make sense if you look at it. It seems that bad scripts seldom make sense. The director / writer seems to think that this film represents a significant minority in the gay community. Perhaps it is true, I think. Maybe we never know because this minority would be so dysfunctional that they could hardly get enough organized to ever get to the obscure gay movie festival or DVD store, just two places to find this Turkey. Thank you for that.
