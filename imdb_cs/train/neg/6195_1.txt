Poorly. The horrible acting and the ending that the director seemed to have emerged from nothing, because the film was frankly zero. Shockingly, this film is considered a prize at the Gijon Film Festival. Everyone who came out of the theater had the same opinion as I did - what was the reason to even shoot a movie? Links to Iraq were either bizarre or simply not right. I am amazed that this film has been released - very, very disappointing and a waste of time. Sorry, terribly negative reviews, but let's hope they discourage some people from making the same mistake. What a pity that we did not have Q and A at the end of the movie - that might be interesting.
