It's not one of the better Pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> There are two legendary pokemons in the legend. You can see how powerful the Celeb can be, though he is evil again. <br /> <br /> Suicune also looks, he did not seem to be powerful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not have a lot of powerful pokemon, except for those who are peasants? Some battle scenes with his pokemon may have improved it. Ash and Pikachu meet a much younger Professor Oak, though they do not realize it. Misty thought I had it at the end, but it did not close. I saw it in credit. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, the worst of the series.
