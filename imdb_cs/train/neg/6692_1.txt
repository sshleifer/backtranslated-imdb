During the sleepless night I walked through the channels and found the embarrassment of the film. What does that mean? If it's a life after "remote control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder he's gone nowhere. And why did David Keith take the role? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I shot the film near the end, so I did not get the plot. But it had to be the best. This nerd college brings home this dominatrix-ish girl ... this scene is from a comic book - or cheap porn movies. He tells his anal mother and holds his father "Oh, I did not expect my tongue!" Big lines! <br /> <br /> Then I had to see how it ended .. Of course, this bitch from Hell has a past so the SWAT team is up the stairs. And yes ... they surround her! A YES YES! Baby blows my brains out !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA! <br /> <br /> You have to watch TV. <br /> <br />
