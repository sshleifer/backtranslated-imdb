That's just a bad movie. With what looked like a pretty budget, it had the potential to be much better. It was almost there. With heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, the hero fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost as in Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like in, say, Conan ... etc Almost. But in the end it's just boring, and it's hard to find anything interesting about it. Perhaps, in addition to John Rhys-Davies, they fly in a duel like Hero warriors or the previously mentioned Crouching Tiger ... I'm very ashamed of poor old John. He's a good actor and deserves it much better. Just like you - so if you have a chance, just look at something else.
