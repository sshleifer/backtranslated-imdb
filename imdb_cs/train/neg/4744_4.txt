The worst DCOM I've seen. At all. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. That was bad. The actor and story was fine, but the effects of SUCKED! They were so fake! The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene in which I was excited. Overall, I found this movie very boring and the movie suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> I will give her four for Brenda Song, who is a very entertaining actress and one battle scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
