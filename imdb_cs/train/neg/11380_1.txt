When I first watched Robotboy, I found out that it was fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode, this show tries to teach you how to behave yourself, what is good / bad. Episodes have become predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again, we see a smart boy defeated by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child, and his friends: a girl and a fat boy. This show also has no logic. A highly advanced robot that works on two AA-size batteries and can use lots of weapons. The biggest problem, however, is the difference between activated and superactivated modes. We see two different robots and reject the main idea of ​​the show: "Robot must learn how to behave in human society"
