SciFi has been very bad luck lately and makes good movies (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel should be based on the big Beowulf epic, but he deviates so much (and offers so little compared) that TV commercials might well call "some dirty film by Christopher Lambert." I did not expect it to be as accurate as Hollywood production, but I nevertheless assumed that "artistic integrity" would not interfere with the real story (although it changed slightly to take two hours in the allocated timeframe). The director and the producers had some idea of ​​what they were doing (did some research go into it?). Obviously, from massive fleece helmets, it can not be said that Beowulf and his crew (except the boy) are wearing. One of the main problems I had with Grendel is that if Beowulf had to fight him, it should not be sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment also lacked? In my opinion, one in the epic was actually better than the junk; For example: Should Grendel have a hand drawn out of the Beowulf drawer? not cut off on his forearm after he was fired with an explosive crossbow arrow that looks like he weighs 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother? They just joined her with the dragon at the end of the epic, where she eventually dies when she suffers his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was she with the dog? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because of its connection to the epic ?, not because there really is not one (except the character names). The only way I could recommend this movie is when you like the film Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? even if I do not recommend or follow.
