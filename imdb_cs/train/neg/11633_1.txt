If I could put ZERO stars for this but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is no scene I could laugh at ... but the game did not make me laugh. So if you are some people with a bad delay, go to the local cinema, check out this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have done here. <br /> <br /> But for me ... in a movie where the kids are shot to reach humor ... a good taste exceeds the edge ... it was the third time that I missed the time to see Boll and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed of being from the same country as Uwe Boll! PLEASE PLEASE PROVIDE THAT IT IS STORED FROM MORE FILMS !!!!!
