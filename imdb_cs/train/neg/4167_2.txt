I've been keen to see "Mr. Fix It," because I'm a huge fan of David Boreanaz. What I got was 1-1 / 2 o'clock. I suppose Boreanaz is nice: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, the owner of "Mr. Fix It", where the workers get help to get their girlfriends back. Among the problems with this movie are editing, script and acting. Even though I found Boreanaz gorgeous in his other film roles (except the Crow movie he did), it was disappointing. Sometimes his character was interesting and the other, flat. The support of the cast reminded me of the players of today's myths. I realize it was not a big budget, but some scenes and music simply did not look right. My advice: Watch at your own risk.
