This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is due in particular to a large part of the factual inviolability (as an obvious agent who represents a bank credit officer, and at the same time it is obvious that he is talking to someone through a wire or a scene where scientists believe he is safe to enter the room where the virus was released, even though he "did not find a viable host" does not mean he will never find it), cheap kits (the bank looks badly built to resemble a dungeon), and bad acting. It's the story of an organized crime group that successfully stole the deadly virus capsule. However, a head honcho, who decides to remove from the bank safe box, makes it at the same time a bank robbery going down, in the same FBI agents being informed about it, and a terrible earthquake explodes. Needless to say, the consequences of the earthquake are more chaotic than one. The results, however, do not make for actionable movies, but what, of course, was unnecessary at the beginning of the film. (Maybe that's why some screens are captured on the packaging seems to be created with computer graphics, rather than actually capturing the screen from different movie sequences). What the hell is Ron Perlman doing in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he's so embarrassed he's in it, how should I watch it.
