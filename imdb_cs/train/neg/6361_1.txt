Wow this movie burned a great time. I have heard that this film very well expresses the importance of friendship. And with the whole Internet hype on this movie, I thought what could happen wrong? But the film was simply bad. It was boring and the character's development had never been. Space Travelers was also a terrible movie if you do not like the movie, you do not like it.
