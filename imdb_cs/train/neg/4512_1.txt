Having been living in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and even can not explain what Geisha is. Unfortunately, there was a great opportunity to bring Japanese culture a bit closer to a wide western audience and helped demystify the country where Zen, the Samurai, the Geez world of Kyoto originated. Some of the most important moments of the movie are when Americans are exposed in a Japanese environment. Geisha dances were not authentic. There was too much use of Chinese music. Smaller but vital detail: proper use of incense was no longer visible. Scenes from Sakura were almost obscenely kitschy! Interestingly, some Chinese actors were convincing as Japanese.
