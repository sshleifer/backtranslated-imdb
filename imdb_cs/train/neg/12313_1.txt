This may or may not be the worst film Steve Martin ever did, but he was not that good. Obviously, he did this bullshit for a paycheck. Dreck, like this, definitely does not raise his reputation as a funny man. It does not seem like that when people look at Steve Martin, they expect to have fun without bruising. It is sad that he drew with him Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman. I do not understand why talented people can not control the fact that people do not want to see them in mischievous films. If you want to call a comedy movie, it should be fun. It was not. It is a pity on the US Army that she has allowed herself to be associated with this goblin. The whole metal jacket was more laughing than the miserable apology for a "service comedy." Sure, Phil Silvers is in his grave.
