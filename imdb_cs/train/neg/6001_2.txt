It may sound crazy even to people who remember this show ... But I thought of it as a lively act. I think I've never seen a cartoon. but the movie? maybe. I remember it very clearly. The guy was in a building like a showroom. He even had a red jacket. It was dark and he turned into a red car, and the other on the second level looked at him. The car / guy turned and hit a large showroom window and set out on the street. And then he went on to leave. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else remembers it. If not, maybe I'm crazy. But I hope I'm not.
