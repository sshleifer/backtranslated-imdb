I was very dissatisfied with this path. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was fearless, the action exaggerated, the songs merciless. Even the story was weightless. Of the writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had great expectations. The actors worked too hard and the film did not work at all. Of course Kareena rocked the screen in bikinis but for two seconds. I think Hindu stunt managers should explore how action movies are doing. They tend to over-exaggerate. In Chinese movies this style works because it's their signature. Signatures of Hindu cinema are songs. A good action movie should not last for more than two hours and can not look unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these action movies will be much sharper. Also, it should be remembered that comedies and action movies do not mix until they are done properly. Good luck next time.
