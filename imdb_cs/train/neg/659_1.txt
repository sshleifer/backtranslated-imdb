This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid for doing this junk mail indicates that there is a lack of original ideas and talents in the entertainment industry. The idea that the audience paid to see this movie (and as the idiot I leased the film) is also dissuasive. An obsessed teacher (3 years before) kills a teenager's family because he wants her. For some reason, he will not kill his mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see bad acting and direction. A few years later the obsessed teacher penetrates the prison. HMM - the usual bad writing - no one in the city he has terrorized knows until the last minute. The obsessed teacher somehow becomes a marine SEAL and can interwave, sniff people and the knife is a super killer. Sure!!! The now obsessed teacher kills the hotel service for no reason, the pot on the pot for fun and begins to hunt teen friends. Now is the perfect way to get a girl to love you. An obscene teenager slips out of the hotel - again stupid, sometimes a cop would know his face - but he walks right behind them. Now he is killing two cops in a teen's house and somehow getting involved in his bedroom and killing his friend. There is not one positive thing about this garbage. If any other professional work was removed from this low quality, it would be omitted. Still, these idiots make hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and route this waste.
