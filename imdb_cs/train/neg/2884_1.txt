When I work in a video rental shop, I find it my duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen and to warn my friends and colleagues. In one day, a particularly overwhelming debate about what is the worst film, my friend dared to watch B.T.K. Killer, even if I could watch the whole movie and still say my previous choice is the worst movie ever, then I would look at it. I lost. I believe I even have a better video than it did in high school, and it was just a great performance of the young genius. This film not only lacked what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was filmed on bad video cameras, although it is surprisingly clear) but also in acting (wooden, hollow and pathetic do not scratch the surface) as well as generally bad feel the movie. I remember the scene where I heard the glass breaking, I suddenly remembered some bad games in high school (I know too often I refer to high school, but this film seemed very youthful) both from the point of view of the ensemble, that it is too fake, but also as if people read from the scenario of their lines, not entirely convinced what is actually going on. My reviews do not do this movie justice because I can not describe how terribly terrible the time I spent watching this. It's almost ironic that I'm doing a pathetic work that describes a pathetic excuse for the film.
