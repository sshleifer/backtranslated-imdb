I disagree with what has been written and said about this assumed "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) In a simple exposition, there are serious mistakes in the basic communication of the critical points of the land concerning Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed in exchange for a substantial financial reward not to return and return his wife until Oswald disappeared? 2) The end is very unsatisfactory because it is random and random. The original scenario urged Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will when she discovered that her husband had actually married Oswald. In the final version of Maria, however, only water penetrates the wart from the wrist into the gesture of suicide. Maria is then thrown out rather than having to struggle and live with the consequences of her self-deception and moral compromise. 3) Fassbinder tries to overlap the public on a private, political personal. Contrary to what critics and "experts" say, I do not think it works. Just past historic radio news or the sound of Jackhammer German re-engineering in the soundtrack about dramatic events in the film does not mean that these historical events are an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of the rise of Mary from poverty to prosperity is focused on the coincidence of the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Maria is therefore intended to be a woman specific and reflecting her time and place, but in fact she is indefinable and non-specific. Women promote their independence by using sex for self-movement for ages. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are a few cases of inexplicability and amateurism - Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have its effect. Unknown people speak out of the screen without seeing them; music is clumsily interfering with places; and the melodramatic position is sporadically superseded by acting. <br /> <br /> Special when the film condemns the country for the deliberate collective amnesia of the Holocaust, it never says about it.
