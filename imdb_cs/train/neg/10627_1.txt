I noticed that most people who think that this film is telling the truth were not born before the moon landings (1969-1972) or were older enough to appreciate them. I think it's much easier to question a historical event if you did not survive it. <br /> <br /> I was young at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world followed the landing of the moon. Our families gathered around television to watch the start. Newspaper headlines shouted every day from start to landing, from moonwalks to lunar liftoff, to flood, in many languages. Some classes have been canceled at school so we can watch the main events on TV. During the Apollo 13, the world prayed and held the breath of the rail when the men leaned home to an uncertain fate. You can not go anywhere without anyone asking what's the last one. The world was really one community. <br /> <br /> Now with a buffer of thirty years after this, it's easy to claim fraud, because worldwide enthusiasm and interest disappeared. We remain with our books on history, and one can claim that history is wrong and attempts to "prove" it with lots of lies and created facts, ignoring the superiority of the evidence they show otherwise - not to mention the evidence that he lives in the souls and the memories of those who have spent these amazingly heady and fantastic days.
