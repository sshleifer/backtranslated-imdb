"Indian burial ground": If these words appear anywhere in the property list, look to another neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a son is moving to Maine's home near the home graveyard and after appearing on an old Indian burial ground. It seems that an Indian country can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead - if you do not mind having an animal pet for the animal. He can do it for dead people - if you do not mind having a zombie kill in the house. <br /> <br /> Throw in a busy two-tone black roof if a somewhat cramped old neighbor and one child is really not getting enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what's going on out of here - an absent-minded, illogical mess that of all righteousness offers to earn a few fears. Well, there are even worse adaptations of Stephen King (for example, "Maximum Overdrive", also directed by the King). But they are much better (like "Salem's Lot", "Dead Zone" and both versions "The Shining").
