<br /> <br /> The worst. Film. Sometimes. What was the purpose of filming this remake (except it would turn it into 90 minute computer science soundtrack)? Zombie * running * ??? I think the director has never seen the original "Dead" films that show that the creature of the dwarf (from rigor mortis) mixes / judges towards their live prey. And how exactly do the survivors know which ship in the port belonged to the recent departure of Steve? <br /> <br /> 1/10
