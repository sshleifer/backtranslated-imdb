This film had a lot of promises, and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, the director and the editors seriously left the film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the writer, it could be good. The game is wooden, but few of the characters are believable. Who ever did this, he just learned some new techniques and wanted to shoot them all over the movie. There are plenty of fast "crazy" edits in almost every scene that are clearly marked as symbolic but eventually end up as unpleasant. I wanted to like this movie and I expected it to have a decent resolution to break the balance, but unfortunately not, it made me feel like I was timeless and the creators lost money.
