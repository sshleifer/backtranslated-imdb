Carnosaur 3: Primary species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why is it even bothering to see this movie? Another silly dinosaur movie in which secret military boys discover those deadly (and very fake) prehistoric monsters that kill people cruelly around them. Origin was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. It falls somewhere between, though not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR films. EVALUATION: 2 out of 10. R opinion for graphic violence and gore, sharp image and dishonesty.
