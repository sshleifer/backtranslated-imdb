First, if you are a fan of a comic, well, you will be very disappointed. I am sure! Low Budget Movie! Largo should be in a Serbian comic, now he suddenly becomes Croatian, pff! chicken producers gave the spice a little spice and guts (By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and speaks Croatian ... Lol). The stunning NY Winch building becomes a regular average small yacht in H.K. The good-looking Largo becomes some unshaven Tzigan / Turkish seeker. Freddy's cool "scarface" pilot becomes a bit of a fat, sad, average guy. Simon, Largo's good friend, does not exist at all! Put some pepper! Largo does not throw knives, but few snakes ... The whole story is confused and looks like a demanding TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, ability or technology to properly adapt the comics, please hold some romances photographed in Paris. Very bad movie, the good thing I just rented do not count on me to watch the sequel (If there is!).
