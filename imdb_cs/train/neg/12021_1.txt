That could be a bit harsh for me, but unfortunately so far in his directorial career it's true. Just look at what's doing so far. They barely surpass the three-star mark. Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and the heroes play Greg Grunberg. Lucy was excellent in this film, her performance carries the whole movie. I hope he will become a "climax" and enter a larger league of actors, he has his skills clearly. Greg was not so impressive, a typical television actor style. The film is weirdly categorized as horror. The only "horror" is short shows and lasts for a maximum of 2-5 seconds with little blood in them. I would personally call this "drama / thriller". But no matter how interesting the story, bad direction, editing and acting (from Lucy) is destroying. You do not have a real connection with the actors, which is very important in a story like this one. You just sit there and feel nothing. It's like watching a bad TV soap ... actually, I think TV soap would be more interesting. My advice: Be away from this movie ... or better, but just keep away from something Michael Hurst is involved.
