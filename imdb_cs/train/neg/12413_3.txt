I'm not going to say that this movie is terrible because I've seen even worse, but it's not even decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I could not really see what was going on and where it was going. After the movie, she let me scratch my head. I watched until the end of the loans to see if they had something after them, what could solve things, but once the loans were over, it was. I felt like I got from one weak plot to another throughout the movie, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> Character development is very shallow. I could not figure out if anyone was angry or someone had a grudge. I could not tell if half of the characters should be drunk, stoned, mentally attacked or had only a bad actor who portrayed them. It seems that this film is based on stereotypes (it's a lot out of the question when you're making a rock band singer's film) that should ease personality development because so many other movies have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or attempts at heroin addiction be clean. Stereotypes are easy to see, which would explain why so many bad films tend to survive stereotypical characters. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters to the left and right but tries to keep them as trusted as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be released without explanation. I think it's okay because so little time has been devoted to the development of characters I really did not have the chance to know any of them so I never missed one. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Sadie was singing. That's horrible. The music that supports it is not the prize winner, but it's mostly drowned pieces released from Sadie's vocal cords. I swear that there is one point in the movie where she sings the song for at least 10 minutes. I really thought I'd have to turn this off during a storm. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is confusing. The characters are poorly developed, Georgian acting is wooden and solid, Sadie's character is drawn from one bad situation to another, without a story or explanation. Music was unbearable, and I can not think of any good reasons why to see this movie unless you are thirsty for cinematic pain.
