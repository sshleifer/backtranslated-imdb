OK we all love daisies, but what happens to this occupation. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there's no country for this girl, and Daisy was not poisoned! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to the original. Burt was no offense, but I never noticed that Boss HOg is so tall. That was part of the humor of Bossa Hoga, its size. Have they even tried someone like Danny Devito?!? Okay, now that she was Jessica Simpson, that somebody looked at her husband? With Luke Dukem coincides with tee !!!!!! Cleary, these producers did not look at the appearance of old members. The screen t was never present to the Duke! That's how the movie shuts off from the beginning. I give it a huge thumb down.
