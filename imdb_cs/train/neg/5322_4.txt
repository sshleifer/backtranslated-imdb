There are two types of musicals from the 1950s. First you have shiny MGM productions with great names and great music. And then you have a smaller league with less known cast, less famous music and second grade directors. "The girl can not help" belongs to the second category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien have become famous, and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, it does not matter. Every decade seems to have a share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The fence itself is thin as a razor, and one can not suspect it is mostly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or other rock scenes from the 1950s that appear in the movie. If you like music, it's worth watching. If it is not, do not bother.
