In the far Galaxy there is a planet called Ceta. Native people worship cats. But canine people fight these feline people and have no choice but to go to Earth and crush people for food. This is one of the deepest f # @ k! Ng ideas for the movie I've seen. Let it be with Ted Mikels to make the film more incompetent than the already low standard set in previous films. It's like enjoying playing in Limbo's celluloid game. How little can it go? The only defeated in the screenplay is US audiences. Mr. Mikels and his stupid small handlebars must actually have people who buy STILL. story behind creation (nine and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind the scenes; Ted Mikels filmography; and the stories for "Red Eagles", "Girl in Gold Boots", "Doll Squad", "Ten Forced Women" (with nudity), "Blood Orgy of She Devils" and "Corpse Grinders"
