Really - avoid this movie at any cost. I just saw it in my first "crowded preview," and although I paid for it, I left the cinema for just 15 minutes. Which is a 2-minute discussion between my friends, whether you are giving in or not. The first time I left the movie. And I've been through several bad ones. It is one of those films that are nicknamed (and wrong), although it is displayed in the original language. It relies on the oldest, easiest and cheapest jokes in the book. In the army ("What do we do when we get into a combat zone?" - "You'll get out of the car and die", it's actually much fun when you read it as it was delivered in the movie), drugs (guy some " cookies ", behaves really stupid and loses his wedding, or he must live it even if it is high - all badly written and treated), women in the army (" Why do we have only trumpets? weapons! "-" That's it, so it stays ") ... Argh. Maybe you really could find these really funny, but in that case I'm really scared. In addition, I have seen better acting in the form of soft pornographic films that you get on European nightclub. So it had misleading jokes (delivered poorly), lower average playing, lacking tempo, badly dubbed and edited? It just did not work. At least not at any level that would be used as a measure for movies. I would even be so brave to say that this movement proves that there are people who can be much less entertaining of the Janishi Germans. And that says something if you like stereotypes. (Which I do not have, but it's nice to play with them just because someone thinks I'm not quite a PC.) Instead of seeing this movie, do something useful. Try to learn how to crochet on shrimp, paint your nails in really irritating colors, disassemble the wheel, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theory, convert to other religions and back - actually go and listen to "Last Christmas" from Wham! to endless repetition. Whatever, but do not look at this terrible movie.
