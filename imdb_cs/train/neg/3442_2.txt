I was following this film purely on the fact that my cover was covered. But once the film started, I had to regret it. They seem to have used a home video camera to shoot this movie and let him make a small child. They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try to scare people, but I found laughter, I could put it together and do a better job. As for the conspiracy, I felt it had some really good ideas, but because of distrustful lines and in some cases they were shadowed. I had no direction. I did not want to notice it because it caused me physical pain to look at it, but I always finish what I'm getting, so I took a deep breath and let it go. I was surely unnecessary 98 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I would like to save my embarrassment when I knew you watched Haunted Boat and find something more fun. I'm a fan of low-budget horror films, but that was a great disappointment, I thought the Terror Canons did not mean anything, but it made me think. Leave your genre. <br /> <br /> * (The star is for the ideas that they have the worst of them)
