It seems to be the only film John Saxon has ever directed, and he had a good sense to stop and stay in front of the camera. This movie is from the beginning to the end of the dog and it is matte and wooden without much to fit. The military hero of Vietnam works for the boss of the crowd, gets a little friendly with his wife, and then the wife is killed by the boss himself and the war hero is framed and sent to jail, to death, specifically. Now this particular prison is experimenting with prisoners and trying out some form that raises men into the ultimate killer machine (zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong, and then all those contagious people are imprisoned, some of them turning into zombies and others who just do not want to be there. It simply goes on and on, without showing up or saying anything on its own, and I stopped before the end, which seemed to have come several times, but no, it was probably just that, the different and the same boring way . If anyone looks to the end, they can become a zombie alone, so do not risk it. 2 out of 10.
