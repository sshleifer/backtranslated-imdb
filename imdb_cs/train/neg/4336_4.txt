I watched the movie and the original Carlitos way back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know people will say that prequel was made with a small budget but never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but I always thought that the ancestor was made to build a second film, play key characters, and perhaps fill up something about life we ​​did not know. Rise to Power is just a movie called Carlito. The original film should have at least several characters, the end has no meaning in relation to the original. At the end of this film he retired with his sweet heart, but how do we get him to hell from prison in the next movie? And his wife is not the same woman she talks about as her only love in the original. I think the movie is slightly entertaining in its own, with some decent bits, but it fades when it holds up to being a big brother. Do not keep watch at night, waiting for you to see it, watch one more original if you really need an intervention.
