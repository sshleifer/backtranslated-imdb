This film deserves recognition for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic narration. Unfortunately, it falls to all levels. The biggest weakness of the film is the unwillingness to commit anything; has camp, moral, and epic elements without ever committing to them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes is rotating in his grave with this terrible adaptation that will transform the loving, unbearably innocent Percival into the most disgusting and busy churl. <br /> <br /> The most likely two types of people will see it, francophiles or arthuriophiles. When I talked as one of the other, I found the film unappreciated and incredibly tortuous, untrustworthy of a beautiful story.
