What a complete waste of time. The film begins as a Saw clone, but even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is totally terrible. The end is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, not surprises, and only a bad ending. I liked some of the characters and I hoped that everything would be connected at the end. It just will not happen. It's a "wrestler" that has no good acting. I can not believe I spent time watching this. It's not "fun", as some people say. The guy in the mask takes the people who are connected and forces them to find out. The link is a stretch, and first should make the main actress.
