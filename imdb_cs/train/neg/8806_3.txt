How is someone so glad to be "be there" so beloved? People say it is evidence that a decent and sincere person can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. He is wrong. The film is proof that happiness is everything: I hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not in Atari; I hope your shrimp ship is the only one at sea in a storm break; hopefully you will not die to shock when you are happily shot in your buttocks and not in your back; I hope you do not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically responsive - all who rebel against social conventions, lose their legs, make drugs, beat their girlfriends, or die young. In addition, product placement in this movie (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
