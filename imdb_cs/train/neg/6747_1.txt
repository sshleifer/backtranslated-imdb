Wow ... unwise when it comes to making this movie, I can not say much. The cover case on the local video recorder was supposed to tell everything ... no more than 6 actors / actresses who lost on the Scream screen and decided to make a movie! budget, but they were able to afford nudity and nice-looking actors! Style over the essence almost makes its mark here, except most of these actor class failures still forget that there is a plot that has to go somewhere when they read this script. After just four or five killings, a so-called masked murderer and a confused bound killer of the Murder Club, who thinks that a silly actress is a real club she can join (only if she can get over a girl who gets into her car ), you will want to stab your hands with the closest sharp object to remind yourself that you will never be too excited about a good movie like this. <br /> <br /> I feel bad about the people who bought this movie and can not find someone to take it out of hand. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of horrific video leaks directly without videos, without the idea getting into the ground. If you buy it, throw it away.
