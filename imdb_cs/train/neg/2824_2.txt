I'm a big fan of Porsche and the car is the best star in this movie. Haim, the now-desiccated child-abuse drug of the 1980s, is as trivial as usual, and commenting back from minor characters / actors would be useless; Needless to say, they are all very average. It's a great movie like a sightseeing tour in the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good Colorado backgrounds, and very harmless, though I mean a disturbing conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Overall, Do not waste your time by watching this if you do not like 80th movies, Corey Haim or just like me, love the old Porsche school (this one looks great) because life is too short to watch miserable movies.
