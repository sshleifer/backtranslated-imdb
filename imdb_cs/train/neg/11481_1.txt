If they could get Ed Asner, why did not they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why the protagonist tossed the wise old wise figure to the ground when he was never in danger. Forcing an old man to mask injuries from pride and a young man would feel guilty of having him with a long disability. I think that's why the main character rejects money and why the old man works like a dog, even though he volunteers to work. If a d-bag friend is bad because he is a distant friend, why is a soldier better? He has a good reason to be jealous and has good reason to take her away from his hometown and over the protective, manipulative, manipulative father. All the characters to be chained are not and everyone else is a "bad" friend. How did they meet a wine merchant and a sawmill?
