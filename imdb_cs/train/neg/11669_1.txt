I suppose it's nice and trendy to see in the utter emptiness of a movie like this, amazing things. With sometimes unnecessary excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can rest and enjoy the scene without blasts, dirty tongue and dirty unicorns. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when it is properly employed. However, this film is not one of these cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes without dialogue and furious, sparse scenery. I'm sure he must have some great meaning and understanding because the implicit message is shrouded. Efficiency is bad ... immobile and pedestrian ... and represents one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the movie, if you can sit up to the end). The landscape is dense and the ridiculously long ending sequence of a girl walking through a desert park is just as enjoyable as to teeth. I would like to call this anti-climatic, but because the film did not come from any climax ... even in "erotic" scenes ... that would be untrue. I'm sure the script was used when shooting, but with a lot of dialogue I think it could be written on cocktail napkins. In essence, this film does not offer anything that would be intrigued or overwhelmed ... no great story, no amazing views, no visual track, no excitement. In addition to two or three fun moments, this film is a two-hour loss. Tragically boring and sad movie.
