I have nothing to say but it was terrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren was another part of this humiliating mess. And if some actors do not want people to question their sexuality, maybe they should refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think what was happening was cut out of the film. SHUDDER wonders what has passed through the thoughts of the actors who made the film. Talk to think about the thought process and the voyeurism that led to the director's mind. Just as before, I introduced a humiliating mess. It's not funny either. As Ebert told about Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, it's not a good story nor a good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
