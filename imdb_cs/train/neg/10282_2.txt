I did not expect it to be a great movie, but I did not expect it to be so bad. I hated my mother as I had to turn the canal. I turned back and hoped it was only one part of the film, but not. And the daughter sitting there was embarrassed, or was she almost out of work, or she got mad inside her home? Are you kidding me? I was brought up to respect (and even worry) my mother, but I would quickly take her to the nearest hotel if she proved it was uncomfortable in her house. I was expecting to follow a number of rules in my mother's house, after all. I did not buy it. I tried to give him some chances, I really did. Excuse me.
