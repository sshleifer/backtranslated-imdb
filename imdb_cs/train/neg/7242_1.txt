The Pallbearer is disappointed and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that only partially does not work with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the whole movie with a confused look on her face, and it's hard to tell what David Schwimmer even sees in her. However, The Pallbearer is occasionally entertaining especially the church scene and group scenes with their friends are laughing, but that's basically it. Watch The Pallbearer only for these scenes and quickly the rest. Believe me we do not lose much.
