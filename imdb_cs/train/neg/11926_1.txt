I'm seldom moved to make such comments, but after sitting through most of the terrible movie rankin I feel that I really got the right to say what I think about it! I could not really do it until the end and became one of half a dozen or more rides (about a third of audiences) after a ragged conspiracy, a pitiful dialogue and offensive characterization have become too high to carry. this film is all pose and no art. all style and no fabric. it's weighed down by terrible talk, a really modest script, indifferent cinematography, and student-level production values. how the funding came, started and ended for me a secret. I bet you're a million dollars that he's never going for a general release. administrative critics would tear it off. really bad movie. bad bad. really really really bad effort And it's not even mentioning a free-time fryer for newborn-kitten-got-to-deep fat. totally insignificant, utterly light, ill-connected; this film is a terrible embarrassment for uk cinematography.
