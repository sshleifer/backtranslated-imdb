I think it's time for John Rambo to continue his life and try to put Vietnam behind. This series is old and Rambo is no longer a stronger but cold-blooded killer. Time appears on the screen, somebody dies. Vietnam was no fun place, and I'm really tired of Hollywood, which looks like it was. It's not the worst of the films about Vietnam that honor belongs to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo, carrying around 50 pieces of machine guns, which seems to be half of the Viet Cong army and a lot of Russians, is an insult that can be tracked. What's worse is Rambos Speaking at the End ... Please !! Oh yeah, I heard they were doing more ...
