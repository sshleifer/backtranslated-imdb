This relic of a short film begins with a teenager who is in the process of trying to get a driving license. It is quickly becoming a pervasive theme on all possible car-related issues. <br /> <br /> These are, for example, Duna prams, drag race, custom painting and car show. Often trying to be humorous, the film is boring, exhausted and even sexist. No one in the movie is actually heard. Instead everything is done in narration and voting. I'm sorry, but I can not stand it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, Can I Rent a Car?". It's just another piece of soulless filler that takes time on the "Wonderful World of Disney" TV show. 1/10
