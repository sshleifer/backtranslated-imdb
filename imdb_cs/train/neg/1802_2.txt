Bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, my ... this is one of the films that has no positive effect. Everything from actors to story breaks into the sky. I'm just wondering how low I.Q. you should look at this kind of flick and even enjoy it. Is there anything worth watching? There is a lot of nudity, but it is nothing special. And if you just think it can not get worse, you'll realize that all the naked ladies look like she's 40 years old. C'mon guys where you were looking for these actresses. In an older house maybe. <br /> <br /> The lead actresses have some sexual appeal and know how to show it. Again, wrong, she is too thin and old. Altogether, omit these. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
