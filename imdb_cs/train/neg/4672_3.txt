This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too tiny as a daughter and is not a niche for Olivia De Havilland's much finer, mature rendition of The Heerress (1949). The feminist conclusion of the film is also in contradiction with the austere conclusion of the Washington Square novel, whose author Henry James wildly parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I made this film very disappointing.
