I'm a huge fan of Steven Seagal. Damn, I've probably considered as much as she does, even though I do not have the street to sport a cocktail. After I introduced my own bias and affection for the most popular corrupting and American hero, it is hard to say that I have to say that this is his worst film at all. I'm not sure he could make a movie worse than this. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main issues with this movie seem to be in postproduction. It is painful that this film should have another story. This results in sad voices in which Steve's voice almost does not synchronize with the voice of a nickname. Editing is pisspoor, and it's starting out badly, worse, and you'll want to re-evaluate the Da Vinci code instead. Yes, it's so bad. I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laughed at me as I listened to my CD. Is it time to start checking some of Van Damme directly on DVD walnut records? If you are tempted to watch this movie, remove the eyeballs and rinse them in the toilet. The whole darkness is better than 89 minutes.
