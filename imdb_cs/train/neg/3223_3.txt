LOL! It's not the bad way to get started. I thought it was original but then I found it to be a KING KONG remake clone from 1976. I've never seen KING KONG until I was 15. I saw this movie when I was 9. Film funky disco music get stuck in your head! Not to mention the Yetians theme song. These are the worst creatures I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a holy gem of B-films. Rememberable quotations: "Take a soothing remedy and go to bed." "Put the Yeti into the tank and you have Yeti's power." I remember seeing this movie on MOVIE MACRABE, which hosted Elvira. There is one scene where it was like KING KONG in the opposite direction! KING KONG is going girl and climbing into the building, but in this movie she climbs down the building and prepares the girl (who fell)! Also around this year was another clone of KONG MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977), who came from Hong Kong. There is plenty of traveling around the dull scenes and motorized parts of the body. This movie lets you laugh. It's just like another KING KONG clone. Evaluated PG for violence, language, themed elements and some scary scenes.
