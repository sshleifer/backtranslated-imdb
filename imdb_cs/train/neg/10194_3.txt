This 30-minute Bu単uel documentary from the early 1930s about one of the poorest regions of Spain is, in my opinion, one of its weakest films. Let's first admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than then (and when I say it, I fully admit that wealth can bring about its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although in all wealth it is a much better condition than the extreme- poverty). And if poverty had subsided in Spain, it was not exactly the type of socialism that Bu単uel had advocated, but Western European capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene the narrator says that at school children teach Pi. Teaching math for poor people, horror! Bu単uel's myopia is most obvious here, not knowing that there is access to the latest knowledge and technology to help the poor overcome their situation. What does it propose? That children are taught exactly what they do at school? Does Bu単uel not understand that this is a lack of modern technology that has worsened compared to other people?
