The year 1914 was a wonderful year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and he appeared in over 30 movies! While most of these films were not particularly good, they gave him the chance to slowly develop his personality on the screen. However, thanks to this film, the well-known character "Little Tramp" is still developing. Surely Charlie looked, but his character still lacked the sweetness and grace he later developed. Instead, Chaplin has often hit people, kicked or made other unpleasant things, for there was apparently no reason. Regarding this very small film, it is interesting to watch the cast. While not familiar today, Chaplin plays alongside Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all of the extraordinary popular stars with Keystone. The problem with this film is that, while it has several pretty scenes, it seems that the plot is very vague and poorly developed. Chester and Mabel got to the racetrack (a very common theme in Keystone productions - it had to be located near the racetrack). Charlie and Mack appear and slip in. Mack is persecuted by the police for it while Charlie strikes Chester and steals his girlfriend. Finally, for no apparent reason, the police took Chester and Mack away - leaving Charlie with Mabel (which was not strangely reflected in Charlie's chaotic behavior). <br /> <br /> A huge silent comedic buff or film historian, this is a very forgotten movie that is only important in the development of Chaplin. What he and other actors actually do on stage, though not unusual for Keystone, is not particularly fun at today's point of view.
