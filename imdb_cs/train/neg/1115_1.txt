We saw it on a shelf in the local video store, we saw the credits "Coppola" and we were excited. It was the only time that this movie was interested. I could never quite deal with it if it was an attempt at a humorous film that unluckyly failed, or an attempt at a serious film that unluckyly failed. Overall, the whole production seemed incredibly entertaining. In particular, the sound was totally horrible, especially in scenes shot in the bar; the dialogue was so corroded that it was unbelievable. Great disappointment.
