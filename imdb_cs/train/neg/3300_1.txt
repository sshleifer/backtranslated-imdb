This is typical of Swedish films of this type. Odd that acting was so bad, these actors usually give a good show. Casting was badly done, you did something to expect (I will not tell you what). The leader was terrible ... I do not know where to find her. Anyway, stay on and look at "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen", it's a Swedish event that's top-notch.
