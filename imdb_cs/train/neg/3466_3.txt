The slasher squeegee, made in the early 1980s, has a curse on it, which has anyone trying to finish it. A few years later, a group of film students attempted to finish the film - also to resurrect the films of a deadly curse. A great movie idea, but sadly "Cut" is just another unnecessary opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia does not have the best world record when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was an out-of-school student, as well as "Holwing III" (1987), which was a half-American film. As far as our intrusion into comedy-horror is concerned, the "body melt" (1993) is the best forgotten. The problem with "Cut" is that the creators are trying to create a clever horror satire and la Scream (1996), but they do not have insight into the genre or what it does. And though it sounds strange when I say it's a movie slasher, but what "Cut" really lacks is a "heart". It is certain that they follow the basic "rules" set out in "Scream" but do not want to play with the wording, instead it is a cardboard copy earlier. The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in the history of horror. His infinite bastard, the awkward, fragile one-liners, the porn dialogue would look like Shakespeare. Casting never seems like their full involvement, and they look like they're just waiting to finish filming to collect their rewards. And the feeling of the film is as if he deliberately tried not to be scary; looks more like an episode of "neighbors" or "Heartbreak High". By the way, those MTV-style experiments, hyper-cinema during the "research" sequence look just chrome, dated and out. If Australia ever gets a chance to do horror again (which we hope we are still doing) maybe we should take a letter from the book "Mad Max" (1979). Instead of trying to copy to the US, we should try our own genre.
