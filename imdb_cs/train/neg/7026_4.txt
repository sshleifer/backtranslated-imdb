On their birthday, boys tell their mother that she is not her son and that she wants to go home to her real mother. In some ways, Comedy De L'Innocence feels it's coming from another time of the movie, perhaps the 60's or 70's. She certainly reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), both of which deal with the loss, grief, and relationships between parents and "lost" children (Mia Farrow, star of both film stars curiously). > <br /> All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters that behave in a strange and inexplicable way. All three films have a cool feeling, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother and child relationships and eventually all three films ask - "What is real, what do we imagine?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful, but flawed, does not offer easy answers and leaves a lot of hanging, unexplained and weird.
