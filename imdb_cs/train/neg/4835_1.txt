Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel to the young American caper in Afghanistan. He also becomes a highly qualified surgeon and freely moves around Kabul and works on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly demanding mission, he unconsciously raises his rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 meters. Then he is finally promoted to a sergeant, but he is not able to decide between the career of a sniper and a surgeon, so he leaves the army completely. A year later, frustrated by civilian life, he entered the navy, and the last scene shows him proudly a white uniform.
