This movie was a complete waste of time. I have seen the film with a group of enthusiasts who have a diverse taste in movies, and they are always looking for the work of "genius" (as one of my comet comrades on this page had the desire to mark this steam pile?); neither of them found a single redemption. The film ended with an exhaustive bunch of upheavals that I will not print here. I can only guess that the positive reviews provided here by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. After what one of the reviewers tells you, did he finance the film himself? because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world could risk a single penny or their good name in connection with this film. Do not let the semi-famous actors who appear in the movie, attract you to their connections? as Christer Slater admits in the special features of "making" that he signed up for a movie without reading the script or knowing some details (stupidity, I'm sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> A sad, unhappy person who encounters this fool of self-confidence written, directed, produced and financed by a man who is too famous to admit that not everything he creates is a masterpiece do not believe please Google "Anthony Hopkins" And Art).
