OK, the movie is good, but I give it 1 because the idea of ​​a computer virus that is becoming an organic virus is a fairy tale. This kind of crap just adds to those paranoid delusions that the computer does not understand that the computer virus is just like an organic virus. First, code strings and tens of 1s and 0s are added to the computer virus. An organic virus is much more complicated, even if it is much younger. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, the organic virus will attract your cell and join the RNA, then it will change its own RNA code. Explain to me how this could be done from the monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that will change eyeballs to these viruses? I saw it, but of course, the writer did not say it.
