This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that revives the dead. He first uses his brother when he is shot in the drive. His brother then infects other members of the gang. In some scenes, zombies are seen walking very slowly, and in other scenes they run quite fast, which makes no sense. The game is average, but the story does not help the movie. Makeup consists of blood on the face of a zombie. I think the budget of this film is very limited. I believe the movie could have been better if the story was a more original and better budget. If you do not see a good zombie, you can not see this.
