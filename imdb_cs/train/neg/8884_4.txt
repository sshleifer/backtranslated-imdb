"Dominique" is one of the films that had to be invented by "slow molasses". Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times do we see Robertson walking up the stairs slowly, because he's hearing someone playing the piano?). At the end, ALMOST is redeemed with a surprising twist, unfortunately followed by a second procedure that only succeeds in letting us taste badly in the mouth. It's not a nice movie.
