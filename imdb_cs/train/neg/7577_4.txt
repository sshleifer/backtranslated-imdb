This is just a bit attractive for fans of "bad film" fun. It is very useful for 1970-year-old pop culture students: fashion, furniture, attitudes, and a great moment of "female libu" from the early 1970s, when it was still fresh, and a novel about the existence of a self-contained woman. "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a cash career, which is a cash reward (after all, what is an airplane but a waitress for 30,000 feet - even for men), she slept with several men, she could protect herself and others karate) and was not tied to anything. This is a kind of emancipated woman who is afraid of juices from antifeminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband. The "Sexy Stewardess" was a powerful archetype of the late 1960s and 1970s (even "The Partridge Family", I recall the swinging bachelor Ruben Kincaid, who constantly defends with the stewards) and from this point of view this silly film is an important time capsule pop culture before AIDS, free love, female lib, swing of the seventies. The conspiracy is quite terrible. And for the cave in the audience there are a few naked breasts to look at.
