After watching this, I thought there were too few good writers and directors or a lot of producers. In any case, it's a terrible movie. It's terrible that it's not fun, but rather it's teeth and shaking. You scream that he's in the movie "bad". Immersion is zero. Now most of you are likely to get accustomed to horrible mistakes / horrors in movies that have computer hackers, etc. This movie is as in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily, played great by Eliza Bennett. I hope it will become big, and it will ... something that stands for something. <br /> <br /> Make a favor. Do not look at it. This is not the right thing to do. Total time loss.
