This movie is more deceptive than ever before, and with the use of a thrilling looking actor like Walken to play this junk mail, it seemed to have nothing better than playing a boring role like this one! And the fact that the movie was about a wizard and you really can not see it until the end of the movie, but you have to sit and watch this boring movie when it gets or attempt to get to the meaning of that point and you have to go through that whole trace of boring actors and actresses who think the whole time you passed another film and you decided about it and just slowed your money just needlessly sitting there. I'd rather look at cartoons for good. Leave it alone, please!
