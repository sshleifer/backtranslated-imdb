What the hell? It's one of the deepest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why people love so much on this page. His nonsense and nudity without reason. It's worst than Resident Evil. I strongly do not answer that if you do not want to watch the shit, bad bulls. Watch real-life horror films such as Stephen King's, The Shining, Jurassic Park, JAWS, etc. Let this bitch hire if there is nothing else to rent. It's as bad as Crudy vs. Gayson. The attack from Killer Tomatoes is better than this cake. <br /> <br /> Oh wow meat eating zombies. How many damn movies we need. Copy this. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
