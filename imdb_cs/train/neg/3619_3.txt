Basically, there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks his zombie in his dressing room and his parents are fighting all the time. This movie is slower than the factory ... and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kills the zombies. <br /> <br /> Well, first, when you make a movie, you have to decide if it's his thriller or drama! As a drama, the film is observable. Parents are wondering and arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with our dressing rooms that completely destroys the whole movie! I expected to see a similar movie BOOGEYMAN, and instead I watched the drama with some nonsense thriller spots. 3 out of 10 only for well-performing parents and declining dialogues. As for the shots of Jake: just ignore them.
