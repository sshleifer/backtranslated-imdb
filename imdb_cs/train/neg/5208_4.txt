This mini-series, also based on Alex Haley's "Queen" book, tried to use similar formulas, building a long history of family life for many years. While in the queen the result was masterful, Flora's mother was missing the inspiration. First of all, perhaps in the book itself and most in this television production. There is too much time over the years, so the developing saga is shallow, shallow, not as authentic as in the "queen". Full marks for the script in earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed, it seemed to degenerate into a kind of Dalaisian-Forsyth inconvenient mixture in the last third of its three-hour period. I had hoped more; but apparently Haley has been less inspired with this story than his close biographical "queen" and Peter Werner III is not John Erman's rival. It is recommended only to those who have the desire to grow up these long stories by generations.
