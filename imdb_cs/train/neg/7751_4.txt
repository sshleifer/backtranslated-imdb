First, the CGI in this movie was terrible. I saw it during the marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. At the end of the park owner's death, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Even nights of living dead had a better animation. <br /> <br /> This means that the film has almost no conspiracy. Why were they on this island separately? Well, it was not mentioned in the movie. And why would people come to the cat area? It makes no sense. One thing that came out in this movie was a slightly good game. In the movie "B made for TV movie", acting was very good. Parry Shen has emerged in particular. If you have absolutely nothing to do on Saturday, check out this movie. It may be good for some unforgettable quotes.
