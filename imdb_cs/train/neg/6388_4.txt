The Quay Brothers are directors who, according to conventional ideas, should be stuck in making short films. I really really enjoyed their first scene, the Institute of Benjament, but judging by their second effort, The Piano Tuner Quake, I am willing to agree that they are approaching to offset their past genius on full length. Piano Tuner is undoubtedly a wonderful movie you can watch and often listen to. Unfortunately, it's painful at the border to sit down with their complicated narratives and glaciers. When you read the synopsis, it looks like a pretty good story. But the brothers are unlucky enough to feed them. One thing should consider full exclusion in the future: dialogue. My God, it's terrible. A huge bust.
