I found this movie because it was Jewish Ben Chaplin of Game On. The game He's a funny British sitcom and apparently left because he wanted to get to Hollywood and play in this movie. It was a very simple romantic comedy with Janee Garofal, who played a ugly woman who used his neighbor, Uma Thurman, to date, Ben Chaplin, because he thinks Ben Chaplin will not like her because he is ugly. The film is bad for many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from distinct slate bits to a serious biting bit: just by assembling where all three entertain and then beat the photograph. These two scenes raged me! Janean's character is frantically arrogant (and arguing her role as a "comedy" and an arf-feminist is also in real life). She claims that the film is "anti-feminist" when in reality it's just realistic. Men do not live to seek personality more often than not. It is interesting to remember her hypocrisy. A year ago she was feminist and "comic", and then suddenly decided that the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this movie before she was released, but she made sure she kept herself so silent that she could get paid for the movie. I mean, come on! She is acting for heaven! What this movie really was was against a man if nothing at all. Exposing men as stupid animals whose brains are in their weaknesses when men do stupid things to attract the attention of Ura Thurman Noelle's character. There are other bad things about this movie as well as the character Ben Chaplin is a British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx is a token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and emulate his accent several times for good. Is it the best with whom writers would write? Blimey has never done it before, except for all the films from Hugo Grant and Dudley Moore. There is also a really terrible phone sex scene that is just grotesque and proves how the movie is cheap. Other comments here show how Janean Garofalo is not ugly, but she is really beautiful. Erm watched the same movie as they did? She's definitely without a viewfinder, and the only good thing about this movie was that she was properly occupied as ugly. Though I said, I could not even see the urge of Ura Thurman: she is excited and looking. I'm looking for three things on this movie if you've never seen it: <br /> <br /> You'll know what's going to end; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
