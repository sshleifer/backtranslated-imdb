As we all know, Hollywood is enjoying the changing historical events around us, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood movies. For example, bank robbers have never returned to the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD, but we see in the movie that they have returned two times! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who were shot near the end of the movie, it's far from true! But of course, Hollywood must have a good bloody end to add some more blood and guts. Some events have been united and many of the main actors have played several different people, but this Hollywood has always done so why complain? I think the only sad part is that I watched the hourly documents on the Northern Hollywood shootout on TLC that were much better than this one!
