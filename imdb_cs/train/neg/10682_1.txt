So I'm trying to rent a DVD and hit a movie called 'End Game'. He plays James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has an overview of a learned political thriller. So it looks good. Or so I thought. Boy, I was wrong. The end of the game has just the most advanced plot I've ever had, and I did not like it. Now that I'm something like a whodunnit, I can not really shoot it like I want without 'destroying' it for those who do not have that immortality yet. But questions such as "Why did she / she / did it?" And "Where did they get the money to pull it off?" they are thrilled after the musical conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> As for acting - Do you know those movies where you can almost feel that the actor realized that they made a terrible mistake when signing a movie, and then shows in their performance? That's one of them. Treat it with a sad scenario and a serious flawed, irritating direction and a recipe for film poison. Of course, this did not happen and for the same reason you should not allow it to your living room; that's scary.
