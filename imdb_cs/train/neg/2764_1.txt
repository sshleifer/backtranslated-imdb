First of all, I have no idea how this movie did on the big screen. Even its low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, it's just terrible. Me and my friend who loves action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. He went to see this movie and I was waiting for this film Transformers with dragonies, mindless entertainment. Everything we got was a powerless hour and a half. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the conspiracy is so terrible that it's acting, it's involved. It's basically a Chinese leg of the dragons, coming back every 500 years ... Does it sound like a good remake of the rain of fire? No, the plot is trying to be deeper than leaving not just the plot of holes, but with magic and very little real war between the dragons (rather big snakes) it just mixes it. The director tried to add some humor in the movie that failed. Me and my friend laughed at the whole thing (together with all 5 viewers) and we can not believe we have invested it. A short trailer on TV is for most of the action, while bulls make up the rest. I've seen a bunch of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and more, but I have to say if you want a laugh for an hour, watch it. Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Purpose: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not ... but it would help before I was watching this movie
