I went to see this movie (actually I came to see Mar del Plata in Argentina) and I just could not watch it! After the first half of the cutting moments I had to cover my eyes and looked at each other. By the time it was over, I had my stomach upside down and felt how it worked. I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the second short start (BTW, of course not being the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by many brave people who truly loved her. You just can not love how you can love such movies! The shocking, bloody and terrifying images I've seen have really stuck in my head for two days! I also try to analyze the story (my friend saw the whole thing and told me about it) and I just do not think it makes sense. I think this amount of violence and things has no point but to shock people. And that's not a good reason, I think. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say "Well, at least" x "That was good." Well, I think I will never understand such films.
