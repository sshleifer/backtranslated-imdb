After the overwhelmed success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films spread as a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror films. The result is in films like El segundo nombre, television productions badly written, but it has worked and drives even worse. I have not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure the author of the Doll who ate his mother did not have much to do with this horrible production. Avoid it at all costs if you do not seek a quiet sleeping night in a fresh cinema. 2/10
