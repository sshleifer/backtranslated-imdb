Jane Gail (as Mary Barton) joins the younger sister Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton) at the Smyrner's Candy Store. After Mrs. Grandina kidnapped salespeople when buying and selling women as prostituted slaves, Ms. Gail and her girlfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) must save a young woman who is threatened by virtue. <br /> <br /> "Traffic in the Souls" has a reputation that is difficult to support - it is not remarkably well done and shows nothing extraordinary that the "virtue" of a young woman threatened by sex merchants. Perhaps it can be supported as a film that dealt with a theme in excess of the usual length (originally claimed to have ten reels). Placement scenarios in New York are the main attraction after all these years. The movement of the prisoners behind the grid is unforgettable because it seems that nothing else can move the cameras.
