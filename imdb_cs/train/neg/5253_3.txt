The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "woman". I do not know if it was intentional or not, but if there was a giggle from a German spectator at festival festivals last year when it was shown. But that was the only laugh the movie got. Not that he wants to giggle, it's a terrible movie for heaven! A horrible film in more than one meaning. It is a pity that such assumptions have been destroyed by the terrible and unbearable moments of the viewer (certainly not for the weak heart !!)! And it was not even necessary to show all the things that are displayed. I have no moral duty (because movies really do not have such a task or function) to discuss what is shown here, but that is the new low part of the "tortuous movement" that has grown over the past few years!
