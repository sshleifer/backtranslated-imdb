Forbidden as Video Nasty in the UK, Unhinged naturally gained a lot of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found about the film was his amateurism in all departments. The pain I could do: terrible acting, dirty editing, horrible direction, miserable scenario and clumsy soundtrack were much harder. The three girls on the way to the music festival came across a gully during the storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The owner of the house, Batlata the old lady and her daughter from friends welcome the girls and allow them to stay for a few days to recover. But somebody does not want the girls to leave at all! One by one they became victims of an invisible assailant. <br /> <br /> After a long time when they went out and presented some of the worst performances ever in horror film (and it does something to do), Unhinged is really a horrible movie. Music is a complete mess (it sounds like a three year old was released on the synthesizer) and as such, perfectly complements the movie. Only a few bloody scenes to the end and a bit of unruly nudity will save Unhinged before reaching the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you're a horror compliment (and unfortunately I'm), you'll want to check it out of the Video Nasty watchlist. But be warned - it's really, really bad.
