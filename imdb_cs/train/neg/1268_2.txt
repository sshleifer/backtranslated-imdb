Oh, what a blissful movie! Based in Los Angeles, the center of space from film makers of Hollywood POV, this film attempts to be a profound social commentary on contemporary American anxiety. The stereotypical, fragile characters of the widely differing socio-economic environment of the crusade in everyday, humorous life. The section is discontinuous and discontinuous. A number of unimaginable scenarios will preserve the film, such as filming, abandoned child abandoned in weeds, gang criminals intimidating lawyer, a guy flying a night sky above the city, a child in a summer camp. <br /> <br /> And thanks to all these events, the only constant is the generous help of sociological 'knowledge' that is given through dialogue, as the characters compare notes about their life experiences. One character tells the other: "When you sit on the edge of the thing (Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we are, people ... I love the rocks, I can say, me and my worries, it's really funny for that Grand Canyon. "And another figure pontificates the importance of all this:" There is a gap in this country, the ever-widening gap between people who have things and people, you do not ... it's as if the big hole has opened up in the country , as big as ... Grand Canyon and what is pouring ... is a rage of rage and anger creates violence ... "<br /> <br /> In addition to the terribly unnatural and forced dialogue, except for shallow, stinking characters, besides a stupid conspiracy, the story is agonized slowly. The activity is uninviting and irreversible. The tone of the film is complacent and complacent in the scandalous scandal. The film project was approved by Hollywood suits, which are considered all-powerful gurus and look downhill. They think their film will be a surprising revelation to us who are unconscious who want to learn about the true meaning of American social change.
