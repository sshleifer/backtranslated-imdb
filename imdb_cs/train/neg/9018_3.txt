These are science fiction films of Formula B and the director was not interested in it. It is a dragon that is restored to life by a scientific team. Everything you've done is something you've seen many times before. It's a weak script without real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotypical characters and situations. The director thinks it's just that he makes a formal film without trying to deceive us, and this gives the film a slight appeal, but it's not something you could remember for a while. It is best to see when you cook, clean and work. Some senseless fun. It has its place in the entertainment, but there is definitely not something you will sit with your friends unless you are all drunk and does not matter. Weight rating 3.2 is probably fair. I do not think it's as dirty as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the posts thought it was spectacular. This really misses me because I can not see an attempt to even make this unforgettable movie.
