Like someone who likes the pursuit of scenes and was really interested in this fascinating story about real life, I was optimistic about this film, but too many obstacles came into the way of a good story to be. <br /> <br /> The BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duval and many of the characters he played but his role is blunt as an insurer. Dialogue is simple and pretty Kathryn Harrold is a real garbage-mouth. From what I read, there were several directors who replaced the film, and that's too bad. You can say things are wrong with the story. I could not "get involved" in the interpretation of William Cooper or Cooper. He was supposed to be fascinating, but he was not in this movie. It's also a little sad comment that the guy who committed the crime is a "folk hero", but I confess that I buried it for him. "It was not disappointing, I can not complain about the scenery, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona, and I would like to see that this film was again and better because it is a unique story.
