I read reviews of this movie and were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it. I am a big frankfriend and art lover, but I believe this is another case when critics do something "art" or "intellectual" into something that is not. It will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perversion that I have never really wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some serious psychological problems, but I really did not want to see them so graphically. The film is essentially disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem as a dream, I was discouraged by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it was not anywhere near such disgust and repulsion that I felt during this film.
