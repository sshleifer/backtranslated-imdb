Let this film serve as a death to the "big twisted" films that were created in the 1990s. Known in some circles as the Kyser Soze Syndrome, this kinematic slight hand was now deadly by M. Night Shayamalan, and even Ron Howard used a variation in the NASCAR. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna"), uses the motif of Soze in a much more helpful way. Jason Statham (with very dubious head of hair) stars like Jack Green (known to everyone as "Mr. Green"). He may or may not also be a criminal master, Mr. Gold. Or maybe Mr. Gold is an irritating spirit that can have members of the underworld. I'm not sure, but I do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most revolutionary examples of cinematographic surplus, which I had the dissatisfaction to endure for quite some time. Find a broken structure of time, painful jumps, permanent internal monologs, and a painfully challenging animated sequence. This style of director, "Everything and Kitchen Sink," made Quentin Tarantino an ornate look closely. Film smoke and mirrors lead me to believe that Ritchie is as boring as he tells this cute story as I watched him. The film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking, but come just as news for Mr. Greena. I wanted to be like Green, because I always enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps away from the others. Here, however, he fights as a healing reader in the class of English academic literature. His lack of joke is associated only with the lack of restraint demonstrated by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). With delight in the scenery as a hungry man on the smorgasbor, Liotta spits, weeps and smokes in a filthy depiction of hyperbole and leopard print speed. <br /> <br /> REVOLVER has no benefits. It's another Rushie movie faux pas and maybe even overcomes his bad remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst movie.
