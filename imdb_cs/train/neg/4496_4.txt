This film is a fringe-fest of bad acting and poor design settings, as well as sticky lines and a lame fence. But it's so fun to watch. It's all fun about it. The underlying story is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is trying to destroy everyone. In 1146 they caught him. The 2033 Futuristic Laboratory of Scientists is in the 1980s style with lots of "futuristic" flashing buttons and time capsules that look like a lawn. Actors bring their lines with an inconspicuous aplomb that is not difficult to understand because the lines are usually quake like "I've double checked everything twice!" Did he double check twice? Did he check it four times? Not only that, but in the first five minutes you will live the whole premise of the film and continue at a fast pace until you reach the medieval part. When Roger Corman got out of the money. And he had to stop traveling with time and then with different sets. Medieval set is a comic mish-mash whatever from the end of the 10th century to the 16th century. They used whatever costume they found. I think the chain mail was not a budget, because they all wear cloths that dress like armor. Combat scenes are ridiculous when men inadvertently throw themselves on cardboard swords with abandonment and dying in deadly feasts with nose blowing. It sounds really terrible, but I always enjoy it. The lines themselves are enough to have a bout and everything else to create the fabulous B-movie you'd like to see. And as soon as you have, read the review of Unknown Movies. I love to hear all the fun, really horrible bits in the movie.
