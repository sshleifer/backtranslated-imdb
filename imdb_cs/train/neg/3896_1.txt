Good. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic cassette and recalls that "you have not lived until you've seen the sun through the rings of Saturn", all the time when clear sunlight flows through the window when it suddenly has a nose bleed. Then West is back home in a secret hospital, a melting gelling mass that goes berserk and causes a dense nurse to go through a fake glass door. Seemingly, the West "becomes stronger as it melts," which in this hopelessly puzzled, adle-brained moi is as meaningless as anything. Then, this bold "Army Brass", which looks like Coleman Francis (director of many bad candidates), tries to cover information, but man runs around killing anyone he sees because he melts. He is attacking a defending old couple because they melt. He makes one terrible actress screaming and helplessly snores about 10 minutes because it melts. They melt because they melt. FX falling Rick Baker was supposed to be a star here, but they look hokey. The film is badly shot and everything looks so dark and confused that it is very difficult to solve what it is - not that it would help. MooCow says who cuts this cheese? : = 8P ps - "Did you get any crackers?"
