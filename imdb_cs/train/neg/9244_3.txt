It can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this movie was too big. Virtually nothing was close to the truth, and even for this time, it was seen as stupid. In defensive brod, it was shown on an old talk show that he was working on the story as real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile and playing the scene in his own way, told him. Earp told the director about the scene and how it was supposed to be on the stagecoach, so despite what other historians say, Wyat himself claims it was a prejudice. This film portrays Earp as a sincere man, and also his brothers. History does not exactly say they are or were not. Most people like to get a little scam and injustice in their characters, but that's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them that they are law-preserving GUNFIGHT AT OK CORRAL. The men who saw it as a career and believed in the old West did not have time to think about too many others. Characters that do not exist, figures depicted by the dying he did not really do, all make a weaker movie. It is also weakened by the Ripe, who really did not convince the doctor. Perhaps it would be the worst choice for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that the older films were closer to the era and closer to the feeling of truth. After all, Ford obtained first-hand information from Wyatt Earp. It is also weakened by all such predictable events that concern the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very prolific at that time and ready to kill brunettes to show their patronage of Hitler's idealism in a predictable way. This appears in most films until the 1980s. This is not a justification, but it makes art cheaper. <br /> <br /> The actors who play Earps are doing well and Brennan is always excited. In fact, an adult can be the only actress the disadvantage of this film. It's still the weakest of OK Corral's old films.
