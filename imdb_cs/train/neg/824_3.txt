Gene Hackman is released from prison without a government agency that wants him to assassinate. Of course, Hackman has the skills to do the job. No one tells him, but he is given because the audience gets bits and information. It should be thrilling, instead it is annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes through the mission, but the escape is confused and the guy on top of this mysterious entity orders all the dead to hide it. So everyone in the movie dies and you really do not care. One of the other reviewers pointed out that the movie was originally twice as long, almost three hours and was cut quite a bit. Maybe something was really lost in translation, but I think it was a merciful act on the audience. A very talented talent, such as Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert, is so unnecessarily useless that it is a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never know what the federal agencies do, FBI, CIA, DEA or even the IRS.
