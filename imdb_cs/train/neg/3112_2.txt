Let me start by saying that I will try not to have too many spoilers in it. Normally I like Robin Williams movies, but this jewel was not one of them. It was billed as a thrilling thriller. The night listener was nothing but. It was stupid that there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, 2 for good reason. In my opinion, the film was badly written and directed. The game was fine, but there was nothing else to do with it. The film is about a story that reads a good book of a dying child. However * put scary here * no one can verify the existence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try to find the author, but everything he gets is a headache and excuses from a boy. There it is, that's all. Wait about an hour and a half and the movie ends. She had so much excitement and winter as a dentist's visit. Homosexual melodies or underlined melodies did not have anything in common with the story, and the film had a little wrong, but it seemed to be there for no reason, and it makes no sense. In conclusion, I really can not write this film with a decent overview because it was nothing, it was as breathtaking as watching dry paint. I gave him 2 because the acting for what was worth was fine and it was not by director Uwe Boll.
