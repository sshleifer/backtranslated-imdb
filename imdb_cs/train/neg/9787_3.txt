... but the problems with this production are that it is very far from a good musical work. We admit that one can not always expect humorous masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; but the music of this work is done by Andrew Lloyd Webber looks funny. It is lethally boring and insignificant (with one or two exceptions) and right after I noticed it, I could not remember one important melody - which is rather tragic, coming from someone who taught the other hundred people. <br /> <br /> It's also strangely unatrical. It's going on an incredibly large stage (you really have to apologize for those front row people who broke their neck to see something happening 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left) and doing nothing at all. If there's one person to sing on the stage, it's just what you get - and the rest of the enormous scene is empty. For me, as an ambitious theater director, it was almost painful to watch. The fact remains that Cole Porter seems to have captured French culture in his works better than these non-talents ever fail. And I'm confused by the popularity of this future legendary musical.
