After seeing the previews, I felt that this film would be a really good improvement over a fast and furious series. So I expected it to have a missing story, but at least this time it will not be loaded with a lot of helpless citizens with tin cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine the movie Fast and Furious Movie with the worse part of the story than it would be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen (I'm pretty - no, I would not take a baseball bat on my nuts like what others said). Not only was the act non-existent, but the action was also bullshit. I think the director thought they could throw a bunch of women and exotic cars and then tell them the movie. For example, the movie is where a guy pushes the nose button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies through the McLaren SLR to win. And after the battle where Eddy Griffin came into the fight with one of his "girls" (in this case, the Imus commentary), the girl asks her to pull out of the PLANE and of course it does in the middle of the desert. After this amazing scene I could not take it anymore. So I saw only half of this absurdity. This is the first movie I've ever left. Then I had to stop drinking some beverages to kill all of my damaged brain cells. I gave her 1 because 0 is not an option. You'd better go to the local car show and stop on the tape joint on your way home. We will keep all viewers in prayer.
