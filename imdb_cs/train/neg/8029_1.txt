my friend bought it (very cheaply) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I never saw it because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover looked pathetic but then my friends and I really got bored and watched it. from start to finish! I know it's a great success, but it's really a masterpiece. is hard to describe. you should see this, it is a true lesson about what people are capable of when they believe they are creative and smart, and it really is not. "Acting" is a sous-terrain (in fact, you can actually see in some cases that they "laugh" laugh, definitely the worst). "The story" is stupid to sum up and really everything in this movie sucks. pay special attention to the "Sheriff". the guy is an adult, and therefore he has absolutely no justification to take part in it. is also extremely bad. regardless of having any merry moments. look at it, haha
