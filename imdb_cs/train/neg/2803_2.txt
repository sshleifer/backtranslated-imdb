Due to the boundaries of this film (The whole film in one environment - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors in total) it should be much better. If you have these limits when creating a movie, how could illumination be so bad? And the actors were terrible, talking about their hair under the leadership of the officials, except that it was a nice movie, it had no merit. Well, she tried, but she really failed. An attempt is made to focus on themselves in several parts, but the lines were so poorly delivered to the actors that it was bad. And the main character Neal guy, which is pathetic looser. It is obvious that ten people made the whole film and they all knew each other and it was probably the real rock band they had, but unfortunately these people really do not know how terrible they are all around. It was done in 2005, but everyone seems to look at it from the early grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not see it (Starz on Demand adds!) But that was under the title "Owner" is not Studio 666, no matter what you are doing with the name, it can not help. It could have been a much better film - there is no excuse for this bad movie when you have the obvious limited parameters that movie makers had when they did, work within these limits, you should do things you can control and things work with the best, what you can. Instead, they thought the average would be good enough. And this music video, wow that was bad, I quickly drove that. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair if you look at the whole b-movie shit, I assume you will go and see it.
