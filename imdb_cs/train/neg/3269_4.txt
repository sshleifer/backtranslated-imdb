With the exception of the Meryl Streep concert, which is always on my mind, I would have avoided this film because it has the dated quality of the movie "Movie Week". But it is worthwhile to see if you think some of them say: How did a couple withstand media control and how they treat them? <br /> <br /> In the whole movie, the question is the credibility of different. Australians are different from "we" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) will automatically get a "peculiarity" about them. The engaged couple is religious (other than most culture) and Adventists (others) in it. So their lifestyle and thinking are suspicious. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we face annoying questions. The real story is how society (and the world) treats different, those who have different accents, different beliefs than we do and how we treat what they say they are suspicious. hear the phrase "Dingo took my baby!" without laughter and there are sad humorous posts about it. But in the years that followed the story and the film, it was discovered (as you can find in internet searches) that much larger children were watched by dingos. Research from dingos experts has shown that it was not only possible, but most likely that the child was taken dingos (perhaps a couple), extracted expertly from clothes and ate during moments without a trace. <br /> <br /> But there remains a question of why people defended dingos when they found they were threatening children, rather than killing dinga to save children, because because the female influence (expression) is so cold, it is assumed that he is guilty and he and he. <br /> <br /> Cruel questions, with or without a movie.
