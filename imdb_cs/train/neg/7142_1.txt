This is by far the movie I've ever seen. I wanted to wait for a cheese film, but at least some cool scenes / racing cars. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is such a low budget that they tried to make it look like cars were "going fast". In one scene, the Mercedes SLR moves from over 200 to 0 in 4 seconds, just spinning in circles. It's just ridiculous. If you want to see a real movie about the car, look for the fast and furious series. They can be a bit deep, but 100 times better than this movie could ever hope for. Better yet, just watch the Mischief 3000, the best car ever made at all I think.
