I agree that even though this Melville story might be seamless, it is not a plausible attempt. Moving the story to the 20th century just surprised the intention and nature of the original story; Maybe you could have moved her to England, but it must be a period. Even our narrator of the story - the owner - tells it back and returns somewhere around 1800. Towards the end of the 19th century a strangely disobedient worker would have been eliminated without the idea. And the 20th Century? Come on! Give me an exclusive break away !!! Even around 1800, this behavior did not work very well, given that it was the end. And the end of the movie? I do not know what it was because I did not see the whole travesty - I had to stop. It was like a "Streetcar Named Desire" setting in Elizabethan England.
