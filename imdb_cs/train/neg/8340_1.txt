One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's so bored I turned it off so I can watch the news. When I switched it on again, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues in a dream and ends in a dream. Then there are a few dreams among you. Come on, what interests me? The film has to be interesting. The moment you felt that the film was just a dream, it is when a sensible filmmaker turns off. Sometimes someone has suffered to tell you your dreams and what does it mean to them? That's it! <br /> <br /> Absolutely horrible.
