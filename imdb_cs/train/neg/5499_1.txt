I saw this bomb when it hit theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? Because the stupidity seems to have made me crazy. I look at it and realize that there is not one thing in the whole movie. Nothing intentional on the bed. It is amazingly funny that Lizzie cn chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a huge, carnivorous demon ... yet her gray little dress is perfectly intact even though she is now a hundred times bigger than her when she was the first to give it. Or the kind of film in which one can be shocked by a defibrator and just falls unconscious and returning to consciousness without any medical attention. And do not let me start with the ridiculous fate of the "villain" that they have decided they need to create a "conflict." Uh huh. <br /> <br /> A person who complains that Disney is targeting only children - It seems this horrible part of this film is rebutting this claim. Do we really need Daryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of having curly videotapes? You do if you are Disney and you are thinking of making a movie appeal to an over-8 crowd without writing a smarter script! I firmly believe that Disney is paid on a rating board so it's possible that movies can get away with murder and still get family-friendly ratings. What is a loss of DVD format.
