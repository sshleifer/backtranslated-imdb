A really horrible movie that made me feel when I was watching the forty minutes or so I could stand. It's not the fault of the actors, but the writer / director, producers, financiers, etc. They need very hard interviews. Maybe he thinks it's deep. It is not. This rape and ultra-violence, unlike the one that is central to Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say or add to the sum of human comprehension. It's not even Straw Dogs that I've seen in comparison. Rather, it feels like something Pete Walker would turn by hand, but even if he said I was probably a bit unfair to Pete Walker. Revenge is a strong human desire, but The Bedroom Window has more to say about it and male emasculation than this pitiful exertion. I do not think it's particularly misogynistic, just too kind in my description of certain details - the blood runs after GA after legs after rape, an example. It's neither demanding nor confrontational, though I'm sure filmmakers think they are very "courageous", deeply unpleasant. Is it as high as we can focus on? Is that why they wanted to shoot movies? (I wrote a Latin phrase that translates as the Oh Times, custom, but a new spelling check on IMDb would not allow me to send until I removed it.) I also had to remove square brackets. sorted by IMDb.) Where is the high aspirations? Noble impulse? When you look at the British film - the joyful comedy Ealing or Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Green on Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the Noble Third Man (a film that has far more to do than a thousand Straightheads); work Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and emasculation, check out Sidney Lumet's director John Hopkins' original game, check out the "Tunes of Glory" for something worth doing, what to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, Straightheads is, unfortunately, totally hateful celluloid waste.
