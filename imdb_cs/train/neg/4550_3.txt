My dear Lord, what movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Do not try me wrong, I'm not one of those fanciful fanatics, but I really thought the superposition was a long past practice, especially in the 1960s. So for some time I thought they could shoot this movie a long time ago, and it took it forever for it to be cut and relaxed. But if I know that in the 1960s they did not have mobile phones ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is a good story with a really good message. The effects are secondary, the effects are secondary, I do not mean a bit of inconsistency. However, in films such as this bad acting, incredible, etc., they contribute to making the bad film even worse - it has become to me by Celestine prophecy. My wife said that the book really was, and although I'm not in all such spiritual matters, I can see that it can be done in a credible way - the film did not. There could only be one reason to look at this. If you really love cheese movies, it will be right for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality, I had to rate 10 stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, the three stars are due to the fact that there are worse movies, such as "Critical Mass" (check out the comments on this - Merry). Celestine prophecy is, to some extent, at least fun.
