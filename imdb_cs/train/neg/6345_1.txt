this film is just an excuse for writers to create a movie of two unsuccessful scripts. <br /> <br /> Its characters are just a collection of characters with clich√©s with tragic or comic attributes, the sum of which is the neurotic dialogue just a wooden Allen could write. this woman loves it because it's like looking at the mirror so this movie is probably going to be devoted to the movies she did not like but because there was no car pursuing and the movie did not no fighting. there were also no drug gangs or gang bangers. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This movie has no snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether, think about what I said before you find out that you are watching this movie. Of course, if you do not remember a woman and an ally mcbeal, then it makes sense to you.
