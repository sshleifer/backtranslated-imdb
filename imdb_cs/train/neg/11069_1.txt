I really felt a scam when I saw this picture. It seemed like I sat watching this movie for 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they thought when they did. He just gets into Jeffrey Dahmer's murder and has no end. It seemed to me that they would leave this film open for the sequel. It was like watching a soprano television episode. It suddenly ends and you know that next week will be another episode. It also seemed to me that I was watching part 1 for a two-part film. There are many possibilities here; they were lazy, they exhausted the money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to be Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie everyone sounds very accurate. I watched Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly I hear that this music plays, then she writes on the screen and tells how Dahmer served 2 years of his punishment and was attacked by a prisoner and killed at the age of 34. Wow, goes from walking the forest to his death in jail. And to show how he got there. How about showing Dahmer's exam. How about showing some details. I can not even explain what happened in this movie, because it's all over. I really found out that I did not believe, "Is that it, is it the end?" I would like to close this review by saying that it is still a good film by Dahmer. To the movies, I would like to say if you do, do it right.
