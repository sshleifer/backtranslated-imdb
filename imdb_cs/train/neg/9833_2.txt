False accusations, John Wayne (John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) alter their identity to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is to be Rev. Smith, but Wayne calls him Dr. Smith. At no time, none of them are as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy; though, Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, career. Pretty Blonde Mary Kornman (like Anne), who has grown from her days in "Our Gang," is a great interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have some cute scenes with Wayne. If you are not a fan of John Wayne's low-budget films from the 1930s, this movie does not make you.
