Everyone who watched several movies about the life-long film network knows that the credibility of the plot is the first thing that's planned from the table. When Lara moved to Patti's home and methodically started to run her cottages, I did not blink. When Lara eventually raises her activities to threaten poor Patti and dares her to do something about it, I just nodded. You will see that people on Planet LMN do not behave as they are doing for some special reason, they just do it to make the event happen. Only on planet LMN would someone almost have the owner of the house thrown out of his own house with his seductive powers! Poor Patti - she was too trusted, and Lara had disappeared from medicine, and then the big fight was on the top of the stairway, which contained a syringe filled with deadly things that eventually entered someone's bosom and the front door fell out of the body. Horror! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is classic. You have to watch her once, just because of the big laughs you have. On a scale of improbability I give this film 95/100. Take a large dose of popcorn and get apple slices. Later you will understand.
