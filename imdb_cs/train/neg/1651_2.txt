Bad script written without known characters. As for comedy, I forgot to laugh. There are about 2 infamous friends who cheat to get into a marital figure (no sexual scenes) and another friend (who is remarkably strange) who sometimes cheats, but is mainly considered to be the master. Three friends meet and fall on the same woman (Amanda Peet). Something is happening without real romance. Three boys cease to be friends because they separated her separately. She flushed them out of her friendship because she cried women. - Bad film
