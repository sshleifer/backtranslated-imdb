There is no doubt when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, both because they both thought it would help their film career. If you have experienced the suffering of watching "Ice Cream," then you know that at that level it was a hell game. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a renowned actress (or "oktrzou," as she could say in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can not get away long enough to make a performance, the taste might even be decent. And that's the thing that people do not like on the screen on the screen: the feeling that her ego is so inflated that she prevents her from just going and getting in touch with her viewer. If there is any justice in this universe, it just exhausted the last chance.
