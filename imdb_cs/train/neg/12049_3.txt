The "To Die For" box has exhausted me - an infinite blonde and a promise of laughter and sex. There was plenty of Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is easy to look at, but does not laugh and a little sexiness. The couple, Mark and Simon, have been reportedly together for several years, but neither character is interesting to take care of it, so it's hard to imagine they care about each other. The error appears to be a scenario, not a performance; both actors do the best with what they have been given. <br /> <br /> The end is gentle and ineffective (well, not entirely impacted, I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about homosexual relationships and AIDS, which is funny, "Parting Glances" is much better.
