I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloa. Eventually, she saw him as a star of a recent film, not just a bit happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I received an awards at college and the only thing I can say that I did not like the film was made in an abandoned part of the city and it was not a transport background or a lookie loos. I have to say that acting is leaving something that would be desirable, but Arnold is a great actor, I have to chase this in a miserable direction, and the support cast leaves something that would be desirable. I love Arnold Vosloa and he saw the movie. Otherwise I would write it as another miserable movie. I found out that the raped scene is brutal and useless, but the actors who finished at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shots were pretty bad. There are some glitches (continuity) in the film, but they are overlooked due to the low caliber of the film. Overall, I liked the film because Arnold Vosloo was in it. <br /> <br /> Jackie
