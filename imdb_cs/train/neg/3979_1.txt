OK, this has 2 to be one of the worst excuses of the 4 movie I've ever had a misfortune to watch. Like all other Olsen films, with the possible exception of the new Mint in Minsk, this film did not have a story, apparent hole holes, disgusting confused acting and bad shooting even !!!!!!!!! if you have not yet recognized I hate Maria Kate and Ashlee !!!!!! The only reason I followed this was because I was really bored and there was nothing else. I wonder if the EVER twins will stop making the same stereotypical films where they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic place and save the help of the two cute boys that will immediately launch them. The least would be if one guy had a guy or they were both the same guy. The story in this story was so frantic and just stupid. even a toddler saw defects in him. Maybe they should split up and start filming individually or maybe movies with a different story. Everyone who liked this movie was no offense - either really stupid, really artificial, or did not see a really good movie. or maybe they are really clever and have only poor possibilities of cinematography. I would not recommend this movie to my worst lover for a good movie experience .. The only thing that is good 4 is a ladder split with humor in humble attempts to be cool. if you look at laughter, it's funny. basically I will give 0 or less.
