I stopped watching this POS as the snakes began to "take over" the plane. At first I thought maybe he should get "one" for comic relief. But then I realized that I can just watch all three hundred free and laugh more! All I could have for Samuel Jackson was irretrievably destroyed. And Hollywood again demonstrates how they are actually excluded from reality. When I was a little boy, we got snakes of fun. The only thing the snakes would do is hide at the bottom of the cargo area. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth a trip to Blockbuster. Please note: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. If you really want to be afraid, I recommend Descent. If you want humor, go to the local comedy club. Their worst artist will be a million times better than this waste.
