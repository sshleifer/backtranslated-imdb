my friend bought the film for 5? (its value is not even 1 cent) because they wrote it's like an American pie. but soon we find out that the American cake is far from that bits. it's not even a comedy, it's really really a really bad document. not just the story is bad, the picture and the sound is also angry. some alcohol, chickens, dwarves, and drunken teens. and the result is a disaster. if you see this movie, do not buy it, rather you spend your money on something else and better. if you are going to torture yourself, then do not invite your friend / friend if you really hate it and want to get rid of it.
