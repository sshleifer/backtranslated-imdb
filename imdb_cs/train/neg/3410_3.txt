Yes, this film has children in a space camp and it starts well enough when children meet each other and learn. Then he will introduce Jinx, a robot who could not exist in 1986 because he has nothing artificial with such artificial intelligence. The kid becomes a friend with a robot, and the robot pays a childlike favor by shooting him and a group of other children in this camp into a space with a very limited oxygen supply and radio that have no signal to reach the universe. This camp is not very fun, because these kids are really trained and the instructors get them because of unsuccessful missions or do not do the right thing. Give them rest, they are there for fun, they do not become an astronaut, they just give them experience from a space flight, not a military camp. However, you can see Joaquin Phoenix in a rather early role. So ultimately a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors that you and your children should have in the fight against aliens at the top of everything else that was done in the movie as if it did the movie is a little more enjoyable for me at least. Probably for a few others who would like to see Kate Capshaw's face tear off some strange super alien creature.
