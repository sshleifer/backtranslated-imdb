In 1692, Salem, a false child of the lie about the slave of involvement in witchcraft, is sending the entire community into turmoil. Costume drama with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not exhausted, even if it is not a live picture of contagious hysteria. The three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King) are stories of interest (especially from Hollywood in 1937), although everyone who has been reading "The Crucible" by Arthur Miller since then will not be tolerated on the screen for too long. The biggest problem with the painting can be casting: Colbert and MacMurray are a poorly matched pair of lovers wielding witch hunts because MacMurray is too far away for this area. * 1/2 from ****
