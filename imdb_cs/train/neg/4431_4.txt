This agonistic comedy-drama has surprisingly sterling reviews after it was released in 1979. I remember opening the LA Times magazine's movie section and looking at a two-page ad for a "second chapter" full of shining subtitles like: "Better than" Good-bye girl! "and" Neil Simon does it again! "What does Neil Simon do? Does he take an autobiographical situation (he marries too soon after the death of his beloved husband) and makes him rusted, unpleasant and - worst of all - that is, George - a writer who does not seem able to return to life after losing his wife, to enter the lively Marsha Mason (the real Mrs. Simon ... soon the former Ms. Simon) who attempts to love George in spite of moods and general melancholy Mason is very appealing here and could save the day if it was not Caen's indifference (not to mention the subtle chapter about painfully thin, blond Valerie Harper who is driving the unexpected stop.) I really liked Mason's explosion ("I'm amazing, I'm about me ") but for these two people I have not seen any happy end ... and time has shown me to be right.
