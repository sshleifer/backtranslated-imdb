Much of the "Over her dead body" is so painfully unfortunate that I really avoided my actor's embarrassment for the actors. Eva Longoria proves she can not shoot a movie in this terrible romantic comedy, and that she does not even have any comedic timing. She is hungry and annoying as a ghost who returns to the ground to keep the cook's psyche from dating her widow's wife. The fianc√© plays Paul Rudd, dripping and unstoppable, while the psyche plays Lake Bell, bringing the film any anemic energy he has. I was very sorry for Bell because he seemed to have some comedic skills and worked overtime in an effort to do material work. Unfortunately, it is unconditional to shoot any movie that has Jason Biggs tolerated and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast as Leo DiCaprio at the end of the "Titanic". <br /> <br /> "Despite her dead body," she really got rid of me because of its laziness and total lack of effort. I began to think about all the interesting projects that can not be funded because a huge amount of money is triggered into such unhappy bulls. Seriously, Hollywood thinks such movies are good enough? How stupid do they actually think it's a movie audience? <br /> <br /> Grade: F
