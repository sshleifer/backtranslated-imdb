I honestly do not even speak when I say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a unique unique originality in its humble dialogue or sharp plagiarism of the story line. I can not even count the number of things in this movie that are, of course, torn from "The Omen" and other movies like that. For example, the "Lucy" nanny in this movie is actually one of the devil guides sent to lead and protect the fetus of Satan ..... that sounds a lot like Ms. Baylock to someone else. The other thing is that the orphanage first got a child burnt down on the ground just a few months after it was adopted, just like in The Omen. Fortunately, however, one priest survived the fire and escaped the north burns all over his body ... yet another chance ?????? And above all, the burned priest remains in the hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls, just like the priest in Omen, who has colored wallpaper on the walls of the page. Please do not even start drawing a comparison between the end of this film and "The Omen" for you because, as I said above, there is too much to mention here.
