Do not try to watch this horrible mini series. This is a six-hour shout, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry with each other. There is no warmth in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It's dry, boring, stretched and unconditional. Nor does it meet the expected level of technical competence. Take those six hours of your life and use them for something that would be useful.
