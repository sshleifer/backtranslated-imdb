If it could be rated as 0, it would be. Out of the dreadful wood acting on a boring, productive pace, furious exploitation angle, and secondary pseudo-blaze little stuff added purely to sad audiences, it's the disaster of the film. predictable, from the outset it is absolutely certain what happens to all the characters and how the conspiracy begins. From the boring, unusual beginning to the pathetic and bleak end, every single presence in this movie is useless, and every modest talent dug up for this step is wasted. If you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with a lot of the same childish detail, watch one of the Ilsa movies. At the very least they are unwavering and preferring what they are trying to do. How this terribly wrong when you managed to get a rating of over 5 is a miracle, as sometimes people who have neither the taste nor the demanding standards can combine for the most ambiguous purposes. It is not scary, it is not interesting, and above all, it does not in any way spark the word. In my opinion, it is a crime; it is a crime that such a terribly insulting and incompetent piece of waste has ever been invented and acquired the resources to emerge, and even more a tragedy that some pitifully misleading viewers still defend. <br /> <br /> Neither Elvira's cheerful personality and funny ways could mitigate the impact that this awesome scary movie is. Avoid it at all costs.
