Under normal circumstances, I would not feel qualified to review something I saw only half an hour, but I would make an exception for this exception. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some of the bad guys: "I feel ... a teacher!" "I'm sorry, teacher, you'll get F!" <br /> <br /> A bad boy and a bad girl (right after the death of two cops and the theft of a full drug delivery, they start to be hot and heavy): <br /> I- "So how do you feel when shooting some innocent people? " "You're sure you can show the girl well ..." "One generic boy who ran for his life, instead of helping someone, sums up his life and personality in that direction -" I AM THE CHURCH TWITT! "(It was a US network version) My old man was right, he left us ..." Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (Basically, not a spoiler) Bad guy (in the fire) shouts "Aargh! Fire!"
