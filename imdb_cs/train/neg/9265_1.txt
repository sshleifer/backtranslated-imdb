When I listened to and enjoyed the comments of Omen II Harvey Bernhard, I was shocked to find that he was also behind this absolute piece of garbage. It's like a really bad TV movie that you could watch in the middle of the day when you got the flu and you're too sick before you get to the remote control. I think that at the place where Michael Lerner is struggling with what I can only describe as Les Miserables High School, my mouth hung openly in disbelief. And then I started up and down because I laughed so much. Catastrophic. I do not know why I have to write at least ten lines, I briefly mentioned that there is nothing clever in this modern state of mind.
