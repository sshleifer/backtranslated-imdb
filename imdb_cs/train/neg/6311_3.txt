It's a bad, very bad movie. Well, for people real realistic film is a good thing. It's not for me. Life is also predictable, bad, unpleasant, trivial, absurd, sometimes. Maybe that's why people say this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Too many common places: You are black, you are a criminal, you are condemned and cursed, whatever you do, end up by shooting or someone shot; do not let children play with weapons, it can be dangerous; and then there are those who go to the church and then they are good, very good ... Before, I did not see such a bad movie. That's why I never noticed the importance of photography in the movie itself. In this case, every scene is covered in the day, outdoors, bright and unpleasant blue. They did not even have to fix the color balance. Oh! In this database, I have "rated" more than 300 movies and this (3/10) is my lowest.
