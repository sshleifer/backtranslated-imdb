This movie is roughly what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and sexual scenes (quite twisted)! The film is not sure what it wants to be and to a great extent will end up messing up. It's more expensive than most of Al-Adamson's films, but it's not the same level of budget as spectators expect from science fiction films. Actors are pretty bad, and unlike most of Adamson's films, there are no former namesakes or B actors. Some music is fine, but it's easy to understand why Cinderella 2000 is forgotten for so many years.
