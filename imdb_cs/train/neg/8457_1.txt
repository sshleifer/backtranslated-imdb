I watched this movie just because I was so impressed with SWAT by Oliver Martinez. But that's not SWAT. The SWAT had a conspiracy and some sympathetic characters and made sense. Bullfighter did not have it. <br /> <br /> I had to realize that it could not be good, after all, always painfully bad Michelle Forbes played a major role. <br /> <br /> One poster here called the film discontinuous. Another called the worst movie ever. Both gave the movie too much credit. I'm so glad I got it out of the library for free, but still I feel it is broken. IMDb must include the vote "0" in the vote on this film just for such films one.
