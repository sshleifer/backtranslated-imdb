This movie was long and boring. Surprisingly, they were selected for Cannes, although they tend to doubt it. It is true that unlike other Dutch genres of art, such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels totally empty. Even more, it has no quality of film. Long shot does not mean the depth of the movie, it's just a long boring fence. The story was not interesting, and the characters had problems that I did not even know. The actors did not shine in her direction and she seemed lost sometimes. Leopold tried, but it was not the hope I was hoping it would be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? In the Dutch cinema they actually did some waves. Leopold just made another attempt.
