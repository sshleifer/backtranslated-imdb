Feeding Masses was just another movie that tried to make money from the zombie madness that is going on, mostly due to the popularity of films such as Land Of The Dead and Resident Evil. <br /> <br /> It starts at an army-guided TV station and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombie) is approaching the containment and the city will soon be able to do business again. The problem is that it's totally untrue. The zombie runs inconspicuously and only a small minority of people are aware of it. Among them are the Torch (William Garberina), cameraman Sherry (Rachael Morris), leading anchor woman (who for some reason is listed as playing Shelly on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. Torch and Sherry are against lying to people, but the station is run by a secret service (or some other government agency) and they are strongly censored. This film gives you a pat on the back of the box-cover, which says, "We're getting FEEDING THE MASSES on top of all three Dead of George A. Rombero movies." The source of this quotation has lost my credibility. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is bad. I do not mean it badly, as if I expected more (of course I was, though), but I think it's bad that I did not find anything in the movie. Effects in all parts are either finished or too wooden. Did anyone remember their lines or read the cards? I can not even think about what's best of the movie or about the best actors / actresses. It really did not matter. If I had to nod to someone, I would say to Roger that the military escort was probably the most interesting, but it does not really say much. <br /> <br /> I would have to recommend submitting this movie, despite the fact that the box-cover looks pretty good (that's what originally drew me into the movie). 3/10
