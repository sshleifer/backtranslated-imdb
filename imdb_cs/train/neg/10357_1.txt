I really did not like this movie because it did not really notice the news and ideas L'Engle brought in the novel. We read the novel in our English class and I loved it absolutely, I'm afraid I can not say the same thing for the film. Between the novel and the modified version there were some serious differences and just did not give any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! That's why I gave her a bad rating. You can not see this movie if you are a great fan of L'Engle lyrics because you will be very disappointed. However, if you are watching a movie for entertainment purposes (or educational, as was my case), then it's a good movie!
