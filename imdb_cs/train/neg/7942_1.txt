Really. Does Oprah have a week to remind us that she is abused as a child? It is corrected in every conversation. <br /> <br /> Oprah can not resist commenting to answer every question he asks. It often interrupts guests before a response is completed to hit its own side or anecdote. The directors are clearly instructed to focus on their detailed response rather than on the faces of the guest, because that is what counts - what Oprah feels what Oprah says. Oprah, Oprah and Oprah. Oprah is always about everything. <br /> <br /> Oprah says: - I'm sorry I was so poor. I feel the pain of my battle with my weight. I feel wounded when I turn away from my favorite store after they've shut down. I feel good when I bought my magazines and books. I feel good about my success. You feel good when you give my love to look good to me. I feel good about doing more of my wealth. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of her view: ISSUE IS ALL CONFIDENTIAL AND HAVE REQUIRED MY DAILY ADVICE. I have all the answers to your life, even though I have nothing to do with you. I've never been married, I do not want to be. I never had to wake up a family - but I know about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like myself to others - witnesses of "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we are not gay. <br /> <br /> As of July 31, 2006, her website actually reads: "Oprah.com is your foremost source of information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health." bias and annoyance? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, she crashed two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to collect footage for her series in September 2006. She still promises to stop playing television but her yapfest is dragging its endless. Contrary to what they think Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess, nor a personal mission from God. She is just one very happy, overweight, black woman who copied the style of Phila Donahu and called her own. She was accidentally in the right place at the right time and she knew exactly how to endure the demographic law. <br /> <br /> Oprah is P.T. Barnum of this age and it astonishes me that people can not see through her facade. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you and Oprah if you can wrap this inflated ego through the door - This way up to the big exit ...
