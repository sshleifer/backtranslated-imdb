This TV thriller is all it does, it does not work. He works hard to create an intricate conspiracy, yet writing is so confused that the exposure is at best cloudy. In the end I did not know anything more about these characters than I did at first. She has a quantitative scenario of the "Ten Little Indians," but in the middle of the road she is in favor of focusing on Sally Field and her detective killer. The field here survives the carelessness I have rarely seen from her. Initial introductions are good, but writing quickly deviates from the pitch and eventually overcomes the top. Lots of hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects (which do not bring anything). Special failure from producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all these talents we could not give anything more than a scenario full of red herring, and Sally Field is hiding in the closet?
