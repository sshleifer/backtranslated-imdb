I saw this movie last weekend and it's stupid and helpless. An ancient curse turns a person into a mummy in a pajamas? The victims are afraid of meaningless and can not run from the slow-moving old man. They fall by the torches and tremble instead of trying to avert it or burning it. Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham about marriage weddings married Diana Brewster, a Miss Canfield alias of Leave It to Beaver fame that is unfortunate in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the cast follows the tombs and wait for the shout to react and help them. The Egyptian girl is not bad looking, but she is not too much for the film. Where is the mummy? It's just a cursed curse. It's not a flashlight on Universal Mummy movies in the slightest. Take a look at this movie if you need to sleep because you will dose it.
