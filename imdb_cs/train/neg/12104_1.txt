Religious Bill Maher is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to the mockery that the rabbits break out of twisted machines to get to Saturday's regulations, they do not really attack Judaism and seem angry when the rabbi really challenges the existence of the state of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to a logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on so-called "Holy Books" of organized religion. This is proof of his complete and complete lack of objectivity or focus on the creation of this film. In my opinion, it is really hard to believe that man is an atheist or even everything that is intelligent. Whoever can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their conviction, but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he tell them why they think they are stupid. What makes him a "rational" person in the room? In this way, it reflects how it really is and in such a process it looks as stupid as these people. If you want to see a good movie / documentary about the real evil religion and how religion really can harm human civilization, watch "The Roots of All Evil" by Richard Dawkins. It's a well-proven document that clearly describes what it hopes to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Religion Bill Maher is not funny, does not pose any interesting questions or provides any insight into such a controversial topic. It seems to have been the cries and screams of an old man who disheartened with his Catholic upbringing. I almost like it.
