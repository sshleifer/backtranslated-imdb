It's pretty decent with some stylish shots, but the tiny budget is getting worse. <br /> <br /> I also think they were trying to shock with some graphic weirdo perv web materials. <br /> <br /> If you like the anime in specific things like the cybernetic city and AD police, then it can happen on your street. In essence, however, it has a low budget matrix cash, but it is not completely deprived of its own style. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack from some unheard of grunge / punk / post grunge bands. It's worth it if it's just a soundtrack.
