So it came. Fast, expensive wagons that only drive the top 1%. Girls who sit beside them in magazines. Second and secondary actors. Cheap promotional performances of people from niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the rubbish offered by Hollywood. Do not get me wrong; I love ruthless action moves with hot chickens like any other guy. But please collective Braintrust, who green the light of this stuff, please stop, count to ten, breathe, have the heart of "Woooooosaaaaaah", then take back twenty-fifty years and remember what makes movies enjoyable once in a while? Then actually do some of those movies again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole explosion of the popular culture that has enjoyed the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother now think they are their Maverick (not that half of them even get this link). Some executives said, "Hey, what demographic thing do you want to pay $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, market 18-35." "Okay, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Brilliant idea, sir." Result? The movie I've seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV and more often than in Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Do not understand me, I'm not a movie snob. Above-average artistic moves like the English patient do not fill my ship, but generic films that should not even be on DVD also scared me. Only adolescent heads will have their engines revived, and I imagine those who are at the higher end of their IQ line will see what it is: wells.
