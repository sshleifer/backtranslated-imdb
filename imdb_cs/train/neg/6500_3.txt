Look, I'm sorry when half of the world is offended, but life is pretty confusing. I do not have to look at it. I'll kick Anthony Hopkins, great time. I even followed the fracture and I knew it would be Quentin's pile. But this thing is not well shot and it's not courageous - even if it's artistic. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and quick adjustments, not this "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation" of excuses. This thing would hurt your head. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you. I still love AH and I always give him another chance, but if you do not have enough time to watch bad ideas on the screen, skip it.
