Even after I watched it, I can say it's not the worst movie ever made, yes people there is worse than this, there are some good movie points, you can watch drunk teenagers, have terrible deaths, and cute-looking rats, and they get a grotesque giant "drunken nurse," a dirty doctor, and a girl in a thong underwear that has absolutely no shame, stupid jockers "I could not personally wait for a rat to eat those drunken fools, she was I was rooted for the rats all the time, had a good assumption, "the first part of the film" was interesting though with a scientific explantation about rats and a little singing story, but I think it destroyed it when stupid drunk horny teens come into play, rat in my opinion the one that got lost, her name is Brenda, was so fake, had to be cGi rat, looked like a guy dressed in a beaver suit, it was a nice schlocky, lame, but not quite terrible,
