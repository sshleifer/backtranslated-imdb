I'm glad to see that most other people here do not even think about this movie. It has some big names in the cast, but that's it. It's nothing else you would recommend besides ogling a couple of handsome women that you can do in thousands of movies. The story contains nothing but unforgettable, self-centered, chain smoking, "hip" characters that all film critics all look like ... and most of the public can not stand it. <br /> <br /> The accents from Oklahoma are so fake that they are ridiculous, Southern racist stereotypes are directly from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
