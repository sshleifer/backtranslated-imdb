I'm looking forward to this movie. It's a good family film; However, if the editorial team of Michael Landon Jr. he worked better on edits, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes from the context. I hope the movie will be another movie, everyone is very good. But if another is created, I begged them to take care of the repair. This story was everywhere, and it did not seem to have a center. What's unfortunate because the other movies in the series were great. I like the story of Willie and Missy; are both great models. In addition, the romantic side of the audience always loves a good love story.
