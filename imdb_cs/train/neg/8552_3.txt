... just look at the poor Robert Webber character (great performance, again!) who is trying to fight a machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems a bit bad. The biggest mistake is, in my opinion, the effort to give the action a firm base in fact in the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this film and the more fantastic, ironier and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes as an unsuccessful attempt to celebrate SAS commands. Ideas as if the commando shouted "he says" all the good guys are doing it and all the bad people not so they can detach ad lib (with good conscience) that the main character is not mowed with a gas masked commando, even if he wears the same clothes and carries a gun from their arsenal, seems unlikely and it's hard to take the film seriously. And it happens to be trying to be more than just fun. episode of the toilet mirror ... <br /> <br /> I do not mind the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for criminals and the arguments between peaceful fanatics and settled, even leaders of power in but this political commentary is somewhat feeble and misunderstood, which is quite regrettable , as the film features a morning show by Judy Davies, who plays the main fanatic, and seems to have conducted extensive studies of "subject." Anyway, her performance is a fraction over the others, and in some way I feel the movie has let her down.
