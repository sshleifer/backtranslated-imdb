The whole thing is very beautiful when I look at ... The European shooting position was a good idea. Leading actors are attractive. Score can be repaired. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE ONLY! And undeveloped land! And from here it was all downhill. Pacino is helpful and Keller still talks about how bored she is ... baby, dear, you are not alone. Making the imitation of Mae West, you may have to cover her face, her painful monitoring. I can not imagine how one actor or director Sydney Pollack was doing, or the better question of why it ended up stinking so badly? Because death is represented in almost every scene, anyway, maybe you should have little enjoyment here. Perhaps he should feel empty and cold as death. But I still can not recommend it.
