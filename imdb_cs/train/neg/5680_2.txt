If at least cruelty and exhausted death were intended to justify their inclusion, but the script was just incomprehensible and simply stupid. It was not going anywhere, the story had no readable continuity. It was just a lot of unnecessary sneaky scenes and a really stupid end pinned like I said ... "ending * you beating * my haters and my few defenders to watch my garbage." <br /> <br /> I do not understand, a masked murderer who never had a mask removed in prison, a prison of rape that was supposed to be considered a guy who raped a ugly, deformed serial killer and killed him and nothing else? no explanation, no punishment, a really weak major cop character who was the loss of an actor like Pare who did not try to turn off the man who killed his cops, tortured the child, the woman and the dog and sent them to you to watch the video. For some unknown reason, in their own night at night, they wandered (individually) like a lot of badly typed teenagers to be killed one by one like a bunch of idiots, and no other cop heard that they were dying in the dark one by one and they just keep wandering until they're killed again. <br /> <br /> Lots of scary scenes from the real life of snorting animals at the beginning without reason or explanation, reminded, watched it masturbate, it was a comedy for him ... what was it? Nol Boll just thought he was good enough to distract animal lovers .. anything. <br /> <br /> Then Pare believed the word of the psycho-path to let his family go if he killed himself ... a more receptive, stupid cop you never saw in the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I'm not trying to do my job completely. I'm trying to find some reason to explain the art of horror writers, but these things ... clean bullshit. <br /> <br /> Boll, what are you doing now? I hope you'll lose it because I know that much more deserves people who can not bear to get the budget you get over and over to make their movies. If you want to see Boll actually in his best check "Poštovní" it was okay.
