Somewhere buried deep inside this movie is a half-decent film that tries to get out. The only tracks are several early scenes in Los Angeles (in the bar and cemetery) and then a few pieces of production design. As I said, buried very deeply. One of the biggest problems faced by supernatural movies is how characters react faithfully in incredible situations. Annie McNero's reaction to the fact that her sister (probably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?) The Werewolf is, as I recall, according to the pattern; "Really?". None of the better answers to this challenge. The noncontinuous continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba (the apparently self-proclaimed) "Queen of the Werewolves". Like Stirba, Sybil Danning are two of the best things in the movie. Yes, even better than the group sex werewolf, Rebana Brown's acting and strangely looking werewolf suits. Final credits have taken on a smaller legendary status and are available in all of their glory (at least until censorship is found) on Youtube. Try them to find out why and remember that the whole movie has the same meaning. If it happens that you've done it on US TV, the credits have been redesigned to replace the infinitely repeated Danning splatter, which broke its peak with another infinitely repeated clipping of the cloak, but this time it has some tip on the top. It's a kind of absurdity, the moment of a cherry on top, defying satire.
