The heart of this movie was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically spoof a la "Airplane!" (two years before the fact - nice to go.) about what happens when the vegetables, or in this case the fruit, attack. Through all the ways of movie magic (motion stopping, paper mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse shooting, people watching extraordinarily colorful tomatoes, people throwing tomatoes on the size of basketball on screen actors), tomatoes actually attack everyone in deciduous catching. <br /> <br /> Then it's on Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I would not want to save on any day of the government. Of course, there's a tough reporter (Taylor) who appears in the worst times, he's dancing and singing to soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed voices, some guy pulling around a parachute and a Samurai sword ... and oh yeah, San Diego Chicken before, before he did that big. <br /> <br /> Gaga's not so great here. In fact, you would probably improve when you were watching them. Some of the dialogues are extremely bad ("Please, please hand over ketchup" - something we say before tomatoes.) And as for "Love puberty" goes ... well, I can not blame tomatoes for it, you hear it. What's wrong with that? I liked the thematic song and the initial credits and there was a scene with four people on the phone suddenly it was pretty well executed. ... that's probably it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. It's not a comedy "Killer," but it's trying. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
