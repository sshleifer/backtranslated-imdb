Yes, I'll tell you about this, so do not read if you want surprise. I have this called Christmas Evil. On a DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night was another Christmas horror. While Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Death Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, this was not so good. It was so exciting that he was looking at the villain (if you can call him) watching kids around and writing books about who is naughty and kind, but after a while you're looking for some action and this movie is failing. You need character development, but it goes across the deck and you still do not know why heck catches. He kills three or four people for about an hour while the crowd is horrified, and the guys he's killing are not even his goals of having fun. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to block anger. Then he continues to try to kill the other guy and tries to break into his house by squeezing into the fireplace. He immediately gets stuck, and hardly gets out. Then he enters through the cellar and then tries to kill that guy by hurting him in his bedroom. The man does not seem to kill him so he grabbed the star from the tree and cut the boy in his throat. What the hell did that make a tree in the playground? Oh, yeah, the killer before this killing stopped at the party and had fun too. Well, that's about it except for people who chase him with a torch and unresolved part with his brother and the melody he wants to play. What was it like yet? He spoke of something that had never been explained. How it ends, you ask, and because I have spoilers, I'll tell you. He runs out of the pavement in his van and continues, but lets just say it was chrome !!!!!!!!!!!!
