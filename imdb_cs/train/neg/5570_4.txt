let's appreciate it. Fun: A script script that thousands of times wrote by unintelligent people in front of typewriters .. Pathetic acting that is frustrated by the story ... OK production value, including a good set / placement and a beautiful girl .. -rar 4/10 <br /> <br /> social report: the film has no social report. it is thought free of charge .... but when I pretend to be 10 and my IQ is 70. I feel the message is: Do not be afraid to love? -reactivity 0/10 <br /> <br /> Inappropriate things: nothing special, just a mild Jewish hedonic and arrogant attitude that the writer / director is. in general, good, nothing degenerated - 8/10 <br /> <br /> Overall rating is 4/10
