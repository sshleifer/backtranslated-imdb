Ummm, please forgive me, but there were no more than half of the characters missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a 19-year-old man who has been arrested for robbing a loaf of bread and has tried to escape several times. It goes on and is tirelessly pursued by police inspector Javert. There are MANY characters on the way that were not in this version. Some are worth mentioning Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. Throughout the movie, I was confused and frustrated, trying to see how it was somehow associated with Victor Hug's epic novel.
