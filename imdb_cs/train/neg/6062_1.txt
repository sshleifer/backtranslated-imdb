Wow. The only people who judge it positively are Carpenter apologists. I know many of them. The guys who look at John Carpenter come to the celluloid and capture the film and claim that it is a horror. This "movie" is an absolute crap. It looks like it looks like porn (good lord, soundtrack is terrible ...) and has a sub-par with porn acting, which is shocking because Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when he did. Probably "beans, beans, beans ..." until someone gives it up and does not stop covering it on the day blanket ... There is nothing about discussing abortion if they could have a very interesting central theme religious gaudy anti-divers feel when is it a child of the devil?), but instead they chose to have Ron Perlman and his terrible kids kill a lot of people and have a terribly busy doctor to try to calm the hysterically poor pregnant girl. No person from this episode or what you should come undamaged. It's scary. Plan 9 of Outerspace is terrible. Like a good god, please, someone turns it off before I break myself. Try to follow this and the thing on the same day and your mind will fall apart.
