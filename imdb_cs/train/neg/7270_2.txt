This movie loooooooooooong I gave "2" due to attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read as a speed reader, NEVER get the subtitles that try to keep up with the top language in Spain! And what the hell is going on the conspiracy if you can not read the subtitles. Endless looks and fools and constant rejection. Just boring in an hour or so. Some good cinematography, but a bit like TMAK you think the screen burned. How did this win anything I never understand. It's hard to talk about "ACTING" because the leading actors look just staring and looking for love for each other when they do not push each other out. The character of Gerald is so attractive that it's hard to believe someone would push him off. And what about his mother? I simply did not do most of the time except that there were three boys who seemed to have some history. But they never knew who was "EX".
