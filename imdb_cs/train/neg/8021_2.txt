Visually distributed and full of himself, the director apparently decided to look for a faux-depth to extend a 5-minute plot to an 81-minute snore-fest. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are very limited and the characters do not even feel real. How did you feel invested in the main protagonist, who was so unreal? <br /> <br /> Essentially and stylistically, it all seems like a strange sensational sequence. Creating irregular camera work, inappropriate silence and gaps in action, and what about a small spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thinks this must return to the film school. Adding no value, just cheese, and even stylistically did not work with the rest of the film (assuming that the film even had a style that is a close call). Which flop.
