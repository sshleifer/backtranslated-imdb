I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, compared to the philosophy of classic 1970 classic film classic by Robert Altman, which was philosophy in 1970, this program was probably designed to be less than average ... even if it ran for 11 years, it does not necessarily mean any good. This show was an integral part of my early childhood (every night she repeated and quarreled, whose parents watched her and laugh), but it is one of those memories that will not miss me. Now, when I actually saw the movie, I can give this series a precise critique. In itself, it's not "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like that in the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but they are just the same. For example, since Alan Alda is something like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as well as his characterization and outlook. The new characters are not so great; just serve to miss the ones they are replacing. It's the same with new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that really brings in the series is the Radar, which is still (even when the same actor was playing) just a pale imitation of the original. What else? Yeah, yeah. With a mixed track (no matter if it was used in surgical scenes or not), it's scary because of what's happening in other settings. And since it took almost four times longer than the real Korean War, viewers will get into this bizarre time difference that does not work outside the world of cartoon movies. I never liked this show and I will never.
