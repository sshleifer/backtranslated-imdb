It sports a nice, deep cast, but for the thriller it is better to deliver more than the name of the actors and talk. The first third of this film was nothing but talk and talk. Most of it was a lot of women who were shaking each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It probably plays on the Lifetime network. There was a quick murder scene and then another conversation. By half they lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old.
