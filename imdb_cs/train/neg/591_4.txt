I was really disappointed with this film. it started really well and built some great atmosphere and tension, but when it finally came to reveal "monsters" ... it turned out that it was just a psycho with skin problems ...... again. Who does it. Another movie with nutjob ... as if we did not have enough of them. <br /> <br /> To be fair, "creep" is really worrying when you look at it and the way it moves and strange sounds makes it quite terrifying, but I'm sorry to lend the movie that way just because I'm not sure, to find out that the monster is human, even if it is twisted, demented, weird. When I was soon seeing all the rats, I was hoping some strange hybrid stuff of rat-monsters ... it was when Creep revealed himself. this, some things in this movie do not make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell Creep kills a security guard? What is the reason besides holding a great decoration that says, "I AM PSYCHO AND I AM HERE HERE!" It's stupid, and it seems that it's just about preventing Frank Potente from getting help. What the hell did he eat down? I had the impression that it was really closed and only the unexpected opening to the tunnel section had managed to relax ... so all the time it was tricking the rats, and if so, why is it hanging from time to time? Why is it so hard to kill? It's thin, malnourished and not top performances ... but it seems to go on despite injuries that are equivalent to those of the non-psycho characters in the movie. The DVD comment says they are meant to feel Creep, but I just did not attack him. It's such an effective film, but unnecessary so many opportunities that cause me illness.
