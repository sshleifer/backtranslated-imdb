I'm a very unpolitical guy, so when I say a sexist, it really means it reduces the female visiting leader, Dr. Miranda Jones starred Diana Muldar. though she thought it was brilliant and self-controlled, nothing but a big, jealous, and disproportionate child. Why did you tell it now that her technical assistant, Marvik, also a reluctant lover, jumps up as he tries to kill Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, out of jealous anger, but first saw him. (You think he could just enter the room with his eyes closed and unpack the box, too easy) to take Enterprise into a non-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys conquer it. Well, the ship is jammed, at that moment they could go to a good doctor and discuss it. "Spock must join Medusan so we can get home. I think you want to stay like beet as long as we get supplies and die?" But the lady in the real Star Trek fashion is a jealous creature who whines and yells when the thought is pricked even though her bear idol tells her to shut up and go with them. So the beetle of distraction mixes with the spooked Spock and forces him to forget that he hangs on to himself, which causes Spock to be mad. Kirk, of course, figured out how totally wrong he was, and he fell in love with her to hit Spock with her superior telepathic power. Of course, at the conclusion of Mrs. Medusan, she leaves and everything is forgiven. You almost want the President from Battle Star Galactica to show off the witch from the chamber for her destructive piece. But in the land of Star Trek, the ladies can be totally disproportionate and cruel, yet there is supposedly gender equality. That's what I mean sexist.
