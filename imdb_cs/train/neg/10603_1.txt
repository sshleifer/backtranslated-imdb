I tried to watch this movie twice and I could not get to the end of the credit. For the first time I managed to set up the first combat sequence, then lost interest. For the second time, I managed to spend more than an hour when I wanted to get rid of bad behavior, the SFX blade and the extremely bad direction. Pales compared to the original one. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever heard about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who did not let me fill. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest boxes of all time ... Atari decides to release a movie toy on its 2600 home console system. To shorten the long and financially painful story short, the game came in a long time and resulted in thousands of Atari 2600 ET games to be discarded in landfills because they could not even drop them, let alone sell them. <br /> <br /> What has Universal Soldier: The Return with this story? See rating 3.2 and find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> The amazing movie ... IMDb forced me to give him 1 out of 10 because his rating systems are not so low to negative.
