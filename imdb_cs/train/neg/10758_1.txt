This is probably the most disgusting, worse and useless movie I've seen last year. The plot, which was supposed to have some philosophical aspects, turned out to be a very bad copy of a matrix with a lot of clich√©: a lone wolf cop, good looking, mentally disturbed, sleeping with a gun ... + handsome tough worker and shy but good-looking scientist , you add 2 cents and you have a robot! I was terribly concerned about the obvious advertising of brands such as FedEx, Audi, conversation, etc. This film slows down commercialization and is rather a poor advertising spot, which unfortunately does not end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend it to your worse enemy if you have some spare time, check out a good TV program or read a beautiful book.
