This movie has a very simple, but somewhat bad plot. The whole film is that the girl is sucked through the gate to another dimension, then a few years later she opens again with a witch while a group of friends (including a lead actor who has difficulty getting past her former girlfriend, one of the other campers together with her new partner ... another girl ... it is true that they are lesbians and of course it is nudity of course for no reason). Unfortunately, the demon is now following the adult girl back. Also, unfortunately, nothing is explained. Where exactly were they? Where does the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator suit? The game is terrible, I think, but it's hard to say because writing is so bad that nothing could do with it. I gave him three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap. I do not answer it, it was not bad enough to be funny.
