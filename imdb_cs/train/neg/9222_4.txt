I love really sexy action and sci-fi movies of the 1960s because of the actress who appeared in them. The sexiest women who appeared in these films were found and it did not matter if they could act (remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed with this film was that he was not nostalgic enough. The story has a European sci-fi movie called "Dragonfly" and the director is fired. Manufacturers are determined to let the young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) finish the picture. They are one really beautiful woman in a movie that plays Dragonfly but is barely in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who from his early days uses some of his paternal exploits and puts them in the script. I wish the film could be a homage to these early films. They could have a lot of cameras from actors who appeared in them. In this film there is one actor who has been popular since the 1960s and his John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I will have to wait for the director to take good care of the movies of the 1960s. If anyone reads this, "Make it as sexy as you can!" I'll wait!
