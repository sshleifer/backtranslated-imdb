While it makes a strange good joke, humor is generally quite dry with panel members often pulling their faces or resorting to the rough tongue and waiting for the crowd to applaud lame jokes enough. Contrary to what another comment says, I do not think it's the best RTE ever did, it's really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the smallest form of joke, there are some truly entertaining intelligent gags that really could laugh at you. People seem to be comic beliefs by familiar names rather than by judging the quality of gags that are not really that good. Overall, it's average with some good laughter, but it can often be quite media-based. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. Benny Hill seems more fun to me.
