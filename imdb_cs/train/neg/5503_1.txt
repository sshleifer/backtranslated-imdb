I grew up when I watched the original TV series in the 1960s and one thing I can tell you right away is not a comparison. This movie was totally ridiculous with an air suit that was alive. Martian, which had different shapes. Special effects that looked like something the baby would have created. In contrast, characters originated in the original, and the audience developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only culmination of this film is that yes, in fact it did not matter when Ray Walston finally appeared at the end. He was wearing dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a kind of fun on a TV series. But even my real Uncle Martin could not save this step.
