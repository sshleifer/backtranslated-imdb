I myself and my other half are great fans of horror, we could not resist getting a movie that included the two giants we were excited about! However for the film in 2004 with a break from Freddy Vs Jason it's shame! The worst movie I've ever seen but it's worth looking for laughter if you can sit through it! The effects are terrible effects ... and I could do better in my camcorder in fact it's so bad that they just bothered to put makeup on the zombie faces and missed the neck, hands, etc. No story line, weird flashbacks that do not have sense and horrible script! "" You broke my tooth! "You broke my cigar from a vampire" was the answer of a man who looked like Uncle Jessie of the Dukes who crossed Santa!
