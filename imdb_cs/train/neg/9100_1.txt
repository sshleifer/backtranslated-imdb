Christ, Oh Christ ... One of them is overwhelmed, disbelievers, and perhaps furious, for this furious exercise in hopeless sadness draws on all the wits and dexterity of the Galapagos stomach turtle. Can such things be? Is this movie really, or I was an unconscious guinea pig of some shady international pharmaceutical company and drinking my coffee without realizing it was burned with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of movies and a lot of bad movies, but it did not work for me; by the end of it I was frantic, snivelling a wreck, tearing on a carpet with teeth like a dog, biting on the walls, shouting until my lungs were hurt. I asked desperately, angrily of mercy (to whom this challenge was made, I do not know) and longed for the burning desire for Ozu Yasujir's calming balm. Sweet crying Jesus, memories ... sometimes he comes back to me. When I'm in my most vulnerable when I'm least able to handle them. I tremble, tear myself in tears, bite my nails until my hands are covered with blood, but I can not totally eliminate the terrible memories of my mind. I'm scary. I'm damaged. I'm the cloak of a man. Other commentators here suggest that I'm not alone in undergoing this terrifying experience, which may mean only one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist; or b) I am only one victim of the legions of an international conspiracy of truly ominous proportions . What is totally awful is that some people seem to enjoy their misery, or at least have not been traumatized. They may be part of the operation. God damn them, maniacs! God is damn everyone in hell !!!!!!
