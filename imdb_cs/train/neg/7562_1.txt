I did not see the original album, but I wanted to notice everyone who's going down right now: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or come back to warn me not to see it. I give him two positive nods: Sarcasm of Cage's character laughed a little at me and the beautiful scenery of the island. Sorry, that's all. Things come here. The film plot is propelled forward because other characters do not make straightforward answers to Cage - and he did it !!! How it could go on for more than an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater plenty of pending questions to fill the library. How could one read this scenario and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see the shadowy outline of what the movie should look like" is out of my reach. Or maybe even rent it on DVD.
