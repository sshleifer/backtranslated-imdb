Anyone who does not know about the original British film "The Wicker Man" from 1973 would undoubtedly leave the cinema with the impression of "Poor" and "Peuri". As a devotee of the original self, I left the impression of the poor. From the terrible reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the power of law and order into a network of pagan barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island named Summerisle (the original) near the Amazon Colony outside the Maine coast of the US, named Summersisle, remake barely hit the site. This is, sadly, a case of what might be a classic remake of classical being that has been modified to provide a simple public. NEVER EVERYTHING AND NEVER MORE. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or due to the revised context of the movie) The ladies involved ... hang on their heads in shame.
