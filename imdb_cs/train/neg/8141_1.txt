Watching it live at night, you are wondering who has revealed this cage in the world. The newlyweds go spelunking on their honeymoon, the bats attack and the man starts running around in a pajamas attacking different people. And where exactly are they? They are in the desert, then they are skiing, then they are in a small town that looks like they have mountains. The city is controlled by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against the boy's doctor. The Ski Hospital runs a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the woman looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the end lets you fill with anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston has made the effects for this movie. I think you have to start somewhere.
