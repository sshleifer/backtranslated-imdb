This movie was simply bad. A cliché is present and counted around each film cliché. The evil man will disappear? control. Partner? control. Wacky Personality Clash With Your Partner? control. Does the Rookie do anything? control. The Rookie appeared on the grizzled veteran. control. The only thing they did not touch was idiots who fired at their feet and turned away, but I think they'll save the old chestnuts for another Dooley trip. Add to the Battle of Girl Power along with tired old visual gags and banal stuff stuff like Dooley's car prize, which is still sinking and you have a recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this at all costs.
