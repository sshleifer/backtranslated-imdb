I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. The game was terrible and the plot ridiculous. I get the fact that the wife of the main character who left him caused a mental disorder, but it was so stupid and boring, after a while I could take care of some of the characters. The film went on, over and over the same thoughts, without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with Geiger's countertop became too long after Stuart started to open his wall to find out what was behind it when there was something on the counter that said something was there. <br /> <br /> Then there were repeated scenes with a flyer and confused where they meet. <br /> <br /> I had to guess that this movie was a flop when I did not recognize any of the actors. Make a favor when this movie appears, read the book! You'll be better.
