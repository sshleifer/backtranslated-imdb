I have Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought it was great in American Gothic music), but unfortunately it did not play a big role in this film. Let's start right and the pace moves nicely ... but it's getting tedious and boring to the end. That does not mean it's a boring movie, but it's just a very average and nothing spectacular. I did not like his "obsession" side and there were no decent gore scenes. Plus, the "main" story was very confusing and the end does not make much sense at all. But I loved the story that surrounded the Gothic girl, and how she avenged her oppressors. I would not mirror mirror-like opposition to horror fans - it's nothing to get wet.
