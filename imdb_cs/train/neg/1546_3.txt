I rented the movie for a few laughs. I've never seen SNL skittles, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World it could not be that bad, huh? Answer: it was. This film was barely a means of relaxing after a busy day at work. I still waited on the plotline and the funny part, but there was none. Highlighting was tiffany amber thiesonic, and that's probably it.
