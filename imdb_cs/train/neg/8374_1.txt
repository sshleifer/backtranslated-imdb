What is the point of reviewing such a movie? It's painful and embarrassingly bad, not even allowing you to make fun. Movies like "Little Man" suppress me. They represent the film in its most accessible place. This film was made for a group of 18-24-year-old boys studying hoping to come out and see it on Tuesday night before a word comes about how bad it is for the film to quickly get its investment. A hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably could not get their films because the funds were heading for the puddle to be thrown away. <br /> <br /> Grade: F
