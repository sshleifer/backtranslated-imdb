Add cartoons to the list: Southern preacher and "assembling", Sophie Tucker ?, The Dancing Corps and The Brothers Mills - only makes it worse. Contemptible burlesques of Montenegrin artists who often appear in films to parody themselves and their race. Although the "black comedy" could be taken in its time, it is extremely insulting today, and I doubt that it was sometimes funny. Although I would not be offended, I do not think I would laugh at the humorous attempts. Like an 11-year-old white boy, I may have misunderstood some.
