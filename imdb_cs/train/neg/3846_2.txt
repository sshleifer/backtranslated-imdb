W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is a classic English language. If so, the film version had to be a lot. Phillip's (Leslie Howard) attraction to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so utterly inexplicable that the script seems to look like a post-breakup rendering of a relationship from a human perspective. As a family lawyer I have heard many such accounts; the man is portrayed as noble and always right, and the woman is a hellion who has no other purpose than to exploit a man. Indeed, if you are not willing to laugh at the social assumptions of a filmmaker, it's an unpleasant movie that you can watch. Phillip even loves Mildred when he brings a child of indeterminate paternity, but the real peak comes when Phillip allows Mildred - an angry and now dubious mind - to run his apartment freely with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but this period did not happen here. Actually, by the end of the movie, it looks a lot like the character of Baby Jane, who would play thirty years later. I note How Howard's character is always perfectly dressed and dressed. He tells me that Phillip desires the middle class. Someone could not run from the Cockney-accent woman quickly enough. Phillip is a student for most of the film; such a person would be more credible if he was younger and had a fuzzy look that denies the low income and low self-confidence that often accompanies student status - the English Raskolnikov, as it will be. And he balanced it by allowing Mildred a little charm.
