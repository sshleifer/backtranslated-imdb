Big slasher movie - too bad they were producers and not part of the script. The basic summary - a person with a red-haired fetish brings such women to their apartment just to get into some sort of frantic coma and progresses to divide them into different degrees of success. Only the carving crew behind the scenes had to think that the film was the way I did and cut the hell out of the movie. There is nothing to worry about losing what a redhead is at the time (and he has not moved) and most of the time, the cameraman seems to have driven out and continued filming when he wakes up. Not that I could blame him for losing 2-3 times, and I had to go back and go on again to try to get back what has a little conspiracy. Warn when you see the end DO NOT use it to associate something that happens before - you get an aneurysm. It is not worth the time, effort or God to forbid money. The only reason to get 2 instead of 1 - the thin chance that hacking occurred between the movie and the terrible version I was watching.
