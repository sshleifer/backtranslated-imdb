This movie reminded me of those charming "erotic thrillers" I used to delay late and watched Cinemax when I was 13. I would mark this fine film because there was no simulated impact and mill. But there is a tone of nudity - the opening scene is in the strip club, we see Kane Hodder's (or at least a piano piece) and the inexplicable 10-minute lesbian dance scene in the center of the film and a naked female werewolf who seems to have avoided Munsterov's costume. 13 year old boys rejoice. Besides the werewolf transformation scenes, they have the worst CGI I have seen for years. The footage looks like FMV from the quality of the Resident Evil video game. The wolf is too bad to explain, and despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way too many times. Conspiracy and acting do not make sense. There is a mysterious story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - Darkwolf is the other, but from what I can say, hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do - they look like humans, they turn to wolf and kill people. Darkwolf tries to find a friend, but strangely, he can not find a friend, but he can listen to anyone he touches. Once again, this skill turned out to be less than useful because Darkwolf kills several people who never touched, met, or even saw the best I could say. Mother does not know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something. You think it would be hard to refute a simple monster that is so bad, but it was good. You want quality low-end werewolves, go to rent Dog soldiers want the tone T & A this is your movie.
