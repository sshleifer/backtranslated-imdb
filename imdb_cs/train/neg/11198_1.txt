I should not even see this movie because it's not really a horror film - and that's why it's not worthy of Dr. Cheese. At least it is not horror in the usual sense. It's definitely a creepy suggestion that you will lose your time by watching that bullshit. That's why I switched it off after the first four hours. So imagine my surprise when the clock showed that only 45 minutes passed. Yeah, that's true; clearly, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. "" The Order had a lot of mistakes, not all of them are unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's reluctance to involve Christianity in its own words. It is quite possible to create really scary movies that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, such films are just about anything - a smorgasbord of filmmakers (usually boring and illogical) ideas. Think about it. If someone filmed a movie seemingly about, say, physics, but not just having basic physics laws wrong, but basing the entire conspiracy on the wrong impression, you would soon get tired of the resulting futile conspiracy. The same applies to these types of films. In other words, "Order" (and many similar films before him) invented substance from the whole substance about the Catholic Church and the Christian faith, and attempted to make conspiracies from these inventions. No wonder the plot will end up discontinuous and stupid. This movie has the added charm that it's just as interesting to watch your nails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steam pile.
