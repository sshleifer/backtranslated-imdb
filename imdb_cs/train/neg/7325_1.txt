It makes actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Society. This film is jaw dropping in how horrible it is. Turning off the DVD player was not a good procedure. I want to find people who are responsible for this catastrophe and throw them around my face. I will never return. Never. How can you create such a banal, boring and soulless movie? I could not think it would be a procedure that would make it easier for a tedium. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a stupid cinema. What more can you say than repeat how awful the acting is. Avoid.
