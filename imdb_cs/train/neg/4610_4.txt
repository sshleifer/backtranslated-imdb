I was watching this movie because I noticed that Kari Wuhrer was in the cast. For a long time, I had the theory of being a talented actress, but she never seems to be able to do it because she's always in such a low-priced movie B. She's still beautiful and still trying to act on the unfortunate material I've always seen. That does not differ. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it does not work. George Wendt played against the guy, and it was so shocking that he acknowledges his role. Another remark about Mrs. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have diminished considerably since I saw her last. Possible reduction surgery or (more likely) removal of implants. That's not a bad thing. It still looks great. I would like to see her in a better film.
