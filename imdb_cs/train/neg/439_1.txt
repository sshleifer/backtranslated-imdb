It's just an ugly tear in the infinitely better "Murder, She wrote," it's absolutely amazing that this badly written garbage lasted eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this unsurpassed bull were in the 1960s and 1970s, and they were just tuned because they had nothing better, or they just remembered their star from the old Dick Van Dyke show. Van Dyke, who had only a decent career in the 1960s, was not at all a performer at all (by his own admission) and was too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. He looks like he's a very old one, smoking and heavy drinking. His talented real-life son, Barry, a wooden actor who rarely got into anything that did not include his father, plays his son in the show.
