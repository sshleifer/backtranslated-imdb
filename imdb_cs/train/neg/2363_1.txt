This movie was terrible, the first movie was not so great, I think it's ridiculously stupid if it did not have enough of the first 5 movies you had to add another, why not just do it in the ongoing series like James Bond, I'll tell you exactly because the bond movies really are very good and these movies just smell, I do not understand it should be a cross between genres like horror and comedy for good because my 1 year old niece will not be afraid of such a ridiculous horror attempt, spit on the face of people who at least at some point they will want to worry about so-called horror film. Please, no more of these movies.
