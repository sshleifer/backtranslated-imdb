With Adam Sandler. It is undoubtedly one of the most idiotic films ever made. This is a waiter with a cruise ship, Shecky (Sandler), who wants to be a comic on board. First, there is no honest, no clever line in the whole movie. It's so unfortunate that it's pathetic. Surprisingly, neither is sexual humor, but the f-word is abundant. The budget is really low and it also destroys the movie. It will take place on a cruise ship, but it seems that they only have money to rent a small boat and have only 10 shipping supplements, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Initial credits are animated reeeeallyly cheap, and it is just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else who sees it hates it. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. rated R for language.
