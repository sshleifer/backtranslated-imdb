This film was a confused piece of rubbish. You never knew what was going on. The characters were badly written and were largely unsympathetic, with the exception of Guse (played by George Eads). I hate this movie, but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) should win the Academy Award. It was especially sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and unpleasant film. You've come to a whole new life all your life. Someone must ensure that this director never works in movies. It was also a horror movie, because it was much more fun than scary. For Shame Life, For Shame.
