It's not like SPONTANEOUS SPAL has little potential. In fact, the insufficiently explored phenomenon of the title is quite interesting, and at least in the first half of this effort, Tobe Hooper promises to entertain in such a way only by 90-year-old horror. But somewhere between Brad Douff's performance and his too complicated plot, this haunted thriller loses its way. Dourif, who appeared before his built-in horror fan, is the average guy Sam. Of course, the average guys will not stay in horror films long, so after a well-made initial contour, we see that the different parts of the body start to float. Soon, there are other people who are furiously angry with Lisa, Cynthia Bain plays unforgettably. While the film's name suggests that filmmaker Hooper chose a fire to make Sam a reluctant killer. This approach gives the film another human depth that would otherwise be missed, but it also prevents us from really worrying about the human flame thrower. We wondered if it would work better as a straightforward villain against every effort ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a relatively nominal effort when everything is said and done. It will bring another attraction for the Douri fans and those who can not get enough horror in the 90's, whether good, bad or between them, but only in a slow night.
