Freddy's Dead: The final nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street and another bad sequel. I think it's tied up with the last follow-up to Dream Baby. I was lucky to get a set of nightmares on the Elm Street series for my birthday, so I had to look at all the sequels. I can say that with these sequels I'm getting more and more disappointed, at least in the last two years, it seems that Freddy has lost his edge. It's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and just destroy instead of discovering the story. This was a sequel that was unnecessary, I apologize to Robert Englund, but that was a lot under what Freddy Krueger stands for. Freddy is back, but he has something we do not know about, daughter. Maggie, she is not aware she is her father but soon finds out what his dark secret is and wants her help. She must try to withstand her strength, but it is difficult with all the good memories her love father has. It's ironic, is not it? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating her in her ways. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, Radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, this is bound up with the fifth sequel of Nightmare on Elm Street, I'd rather look at the other Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. It just had bad acting, silly adjustments, and yet a bad idea for the story. I did not like the concept and just ruined the whole idea of ​​who really is Freddy Krueger, he is the master of nightmare death, not Father Knows Best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
