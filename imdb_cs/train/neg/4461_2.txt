After a rather long, partially pixelized naked shower scene, we set out for the Blair Witch Project project - we are looking for a horror film about three of the girlfriends who ventured into a deserted cabin deep in the woods to get away from their hectic life for girls' weekends outdoors and pipes.There are two people who seem to be friendly enough to drink and tell ghost stories until late evening some of them are discarded.This is a relatively slow film that unnecessarily stretches the "tension" of the scene, bad acting can not carry a myriad of scenes where nothing happens, but thoughtless doubt, and the film as a whole is crazy, deadly boring. Nothing happens until the last half an hour, and when I did it, I had to dare I really care.
