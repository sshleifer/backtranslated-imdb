I just watched it, and I and my half could not believe how terribly and wrong it was. If someone else thinks it is good, you have to be easily pleased. Actually, I gave up one night to look at it, it was all before. I.E. the hostel reminds me, but at least it did not mean that you were confronted with the bad acting and the lack of the story, the same old things, they hatched again, I read so much about this film, I even recommended it to my friends, my guilt, someone said it was good! no more horrible, horror or sad back than your average "spooky movie", we must say, please do not bother with this movie. get mary poppins. now scary! Now I'm leaving, I go to the cinema and look at something more terrifying than this, maybe a little sun
