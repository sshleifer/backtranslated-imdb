The "Black Angel" is tiny while June Vincent as a woman tries to save her husband from an electric chair after being convicted of killing an old friend. Dan Durya (wife of a murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real perpetrator. Peter Lorre has one suspicious role. Film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never reaching anything special. It's nice enough, but then it stops making sense at some point, and solving this mystery causes one of those big reactions to "stop me." The finishing itself could completely sink the film, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good. Vincent is a funny hero, and Durye was never too good when she played good boys. I like movie legs, but this was a real disappointment.
