WOW! I did not know anyone would shoot this movie! that's horrible! I wrote 5 things that can tell why they do not want to see this movie. Number 1: "Its Greatest Rage Sometimes" Where's the Raven? I could only see a few people dancing around .. <br /> <br /> 2. When they are ravaged, they can ONLY see blood everywhere, no people, two torn tents and one stage .. and what are they doing! drink! <br /> <br /> 3rd worst actors I've ever seen! Captain and his crew ... terrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people burns a common weapon, shoots almost 30 times without transshipment! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everyone in the world can fight like a professional! it must be a new thing .. I wonder what the manufacturer thought! "it's going to be a big hit, it's gonna be a classic ..." surely the fool ** does not see this movie, his passport of time. MY EYES STILL BLEEDING!
