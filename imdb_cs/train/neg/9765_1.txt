I'm not often publishing "you," but if there's ever been a movie that deserves such attention, it's "Gas!" It is a self-service bull that comes to some of the atmosphere M * A * S * H ​​and falls flat on his face when he tries. I see what Corman went to - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's helpless role in the original movie version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar conspiracy (in the movie "Whiffs" - look at IMDb, http: // <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould were approaching a brass ring with "Whiffs" before Corman did with "Gas!" but it did not quite get there. Neither of these films has ever achieved the success of M * A * S * H. What happened to "Gas!"? What is not? No one approaches the fact that it really is at the level above junior high school. Production values ​​are declining. Someone else mentioned the magically regenerating headlamps on the run from the car and there is more that lack of attention detail. Nothing works as it does in this movie, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually fell asleep. It's not a cure for insomnia, but it's really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction, "Gas!" falls somewhere between "last year at Marienbad" and George Clooney's remake of "Solaris" (remarkable for being more boring than the original Mosfilm, despite a seemingly unknown studio with the idea of ​​keeping the viewer's attention with reasonable editing). <br /> <br /> Judicial editing would destroy the "Gas!" for about twenty minutes. The result would be unnecessary, but not more than the original film. Some movies are so bad that they have a convincing quality that's worth the same. This is not one of them. Do not waste time. It's not even fun.
