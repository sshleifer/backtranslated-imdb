When I come to IMDb, I always worry when I see the "worst movie ever". After watching this * movie * I think I will soon be making my own contribution! <br /> <br /> Introductory titles: great, some lame magnified on a gas oven (yeah, focus on fire = explosions = great action movies !!) Actors: I think Ice T is a great rapper, even a handsome actor (sometimes it insists on "sometimes"), but Steven Seagal as the policeman who plays is behind the words. The rest of the cast is ... but I do not know where these actors were hired, but I think! I bet my dog ​​would be a much better actor than them! <br /> <br /> Conspiracy: Hijacking.original is not it? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I said good, cool! At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics. . I was dead wrong. The rest of the film is mostly filled with low rent shots taken from air forces ... Dialogues are merry, the music is pure, the end is happy (I think I was happy at the end because the movie was over !!!) My cousin who watched the movie was delighted (I'm 22, it's 42 ...). he was on the brink of shooting the movie and firing him. Maybe next time I'll watch ... (who never said ???)
