It is unbelievable!! .. someone before me wrote that it's time to lose to sit and watch this movie .. it's it! Do not do it! I'm totally horrified! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I found it funny to have his name in the movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (at home, of course), but now (right after) I'm absolutely disappointed! It was his worst film ever. Inwatchable !! Bad acting game! Bad cameraman! Bad script! Just one good thought: that beautiful girl! It must be a dummy sure! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 lines minimum?! I do not wanna waste time when you're reading my opinion! I hope I was clear and unstable because English is not my native language. So I have time on the grill and I see good movies as if I have tried ... Peace!
