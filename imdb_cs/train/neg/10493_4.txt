Heavy film to sort out. I never gave him 110% concentration and then as simple as a plot I could not tell exactly who did what the American FBI characters and what their roles were. Nor could I take Irwins seriously as movie characters when their lines and scenes were in the style of one of his performances, and they were not. <br /> <br /> It's nothing more than a celebrated episode of the Discovery TV show, with a very insignificant piece of land that seemed to be getting in the way. However, any Irwin show is always worth watching, this movie is also worth a look, but not at Christmas. I'm talking about doing better things than here. <br /> <br /> High 4/10
