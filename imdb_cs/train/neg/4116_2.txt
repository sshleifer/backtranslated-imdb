My review of one line should explain everything, but I have to go for it. <br /> <br /> From the movie Get-go, this movie seemed like a soap opera, and that's all I can comment on. There were some interesting scenes, such as "Big", which hit the middle of the movie, but wait what it is? Earthquake * exhaled, wait a minute! That's Dante's top! Parts of it broke and slammed. I can not believe how badly this movie was done, "borrowed" scenes from other, much better movies. One wonders what the director thought the audience was stupid enough to believe that the big forest mountains are in the background in LA, but Dante's Peak. I recommend forgetting Bond Wanna-be, Nash in this movie and going for a real thing (again someone from Dante's peak accidentally.) <br /> <br />
