With a low expectation, a new surprise (more than five minutes) from "wives" appeared as a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new record was Class A material but provided a very solid foundation for what could "be" a good original movie. Unfortunately, it was put together in 1955, during a one-day timetable. After a new video, Jules White decided that it would be enough to pack a series of "brides" into this short film, which means that Jules and Felix Adler try to fix the new shot, giving us the old, worn out boys (Moe and Larry in in this case) get shot in the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
