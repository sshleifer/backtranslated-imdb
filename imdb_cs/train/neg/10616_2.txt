Catastrophic. Just terribly. The script is invented, it acts painfully and the story just stretches. It is undoubtedly the celebration of Sally Potter and something else. That would not be so bad, but she's the director, the writer and the movie star, so it's a self-celebration. I found out that I do not care about the evolving romance between the two main characters and the end did not come too soon. It has two redeemed features. First of all, a lot of pictures are really pretty, especially in Paris, and look good in black and white. Secondly, whether you are a thang fan or not, the music is overall excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk or if you need unintentional laughter. I'm sure someone is calling. Statistically, it must.
