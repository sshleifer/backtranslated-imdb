This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie with Kevin Costner.) Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout the movie and his supporting actors did not even seem to be trying to act. Chris Rock is a fabulous comedian, but he just can not transfer his talent to this film, which is probably just two tense laughs in the whole picture. If you did not see the movie, avoid it as a plague. Go into something more constructive and more interesting, like watching a weather channel or observing a dry paint on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For the effort of Chris I will give it 2/10! <br /> <br />
