It was almost for you to sit through this terrible "film" just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as it did again. Act - 0, scenario - 0, fight scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (cedar bob from eight miles as a heroic war hero that gets a girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is a wonderful and not a terrible actress). These are the criteria I used to make it on average for two. I lost count, but I believe that sometimes the film clich√© is in this movie. When the driver who allegedly killed her father miraculously appeared at the end to ride with her, they drove it in advance. Plus, it simply appears without reason. He had never mentioned it before. I do not know what to say here. Just look at it when it comes out on television in a couple of years. At least some of them will be edited for advertising.
