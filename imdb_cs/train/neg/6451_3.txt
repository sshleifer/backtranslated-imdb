"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) collects a group from a high school for a meeting at a cabin where his brother Wes disappeared. While they are there, a creepy creature in the shape of a man (reminded me of a lot of Gillman from CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) waits in the wilderness to choose the right time to divide them one by one. The biker, a young thief from the time of Ellen Ripley, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker in which she practices experiments while also serving as a security site for bloody shocks. Kat knows more than she says (she also suffered a child's loss), but there's another news that most of the group have no idea. This creature could be a lot more human than they realize ... and its former identity could shed light on the scam that only one other person has hidden since Wes's death. Kat is the key to many mysteries that unfold as the group stays near the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, much of the film stays away from the creature that jumps in the air while we see the misty screen as we look through her eyes. The film has melodramatic instruments such as Dawson's Creek, which often hinder any real tension that has to be built in a small monster movie. Direction is very soft, resulting in a rather boring experience instead of causing fear. Cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) can be the only cartoonist for this film.
