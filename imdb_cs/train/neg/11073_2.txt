This is really a bad and amazing worry for Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is one of the five best companies in the world. BUT WE ARE YOU WRONG AWFUL FILMS! This is not particularly bad. It's especially typical and typically bad, shot in two-bit hotels and public park in a thin direction, high school acting actor and "star ... do you see what this button does on the camera?" photography. If Michael Moriarity had such an intention to make Jack Nicholson unveiled, could he not at least make a good impersonation of Jack Nicholson? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, really one of the most beautiful cities in the world and also the yacht building center (part of the plot), why did we in God's name let this endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it is hidden like Seattle ??? Not only I'm crazy on this movie, I'm embarrassed and more than a little shy. Australians will show some wonderful things. We make a demanding second beer. Gawd !!!!!
