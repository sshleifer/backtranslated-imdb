SWING! is an important film because it is one of the remaining black and white films of the 1930s. Many of these films have simply worsened so that they are inconsistent, but this is in a fairly good form. It's also a great opportunity to see many talented black artists from the time just after the bloom of the old Cotton Club - a time that's been forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the movie is historically important and has some beautiful performances, it's also a mess. The main storyline is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of that time - including the first donation that destroys a show and a surprise that does not seem where the day is saved. But the scripture is just terribly crazy and somewhat intermittent - and it shows the paintings of Black America that some might humiliate a little. This is because before the plot really starts, you are treated with the blameless bum that lives out of your hard-working woman (the popular stereotype of time) and when it is captured by a house (which, by the way, plays the role entirely) which looks like a WWE Smackdown scene! And one lady wants to cut the other lady straight with the razor - the real scene! Later in the movie, when the girlfriend is behaving horribly, her husband will hit her face and all of him will be applauded! It seems that the film sometimes wants to address the smallest common denominator in the PLUS audience that they can not even do well - with some of the worst plays I've seen for a very long time. <br /> <br /> However, if you look around for miserable production in almost every way (with trashy characters, bad behavior and direction and bad writing), it might be worth looking to see excellent singing and dancing - just like capturing a flash of forgotten black culture. Just do not say I warned you about playing - it's really, really bad!
