I tried to watch this show several times, but on a show called "To '70s Show", there are not many differences from several hairstyles and occasional references to a disco that really evokes the 1970s - the ten years I grew up in. From the episodes I've seen, most fences and jokes can be set at any time. Remove the novelty (probably) set in the 1970s, and the show is neither interesting nor funny. If you are looking for a show that successfully represents the experience of young people in America in the 1970s, in my humble opinion, you can do nothing better than "The Wonder Years."
