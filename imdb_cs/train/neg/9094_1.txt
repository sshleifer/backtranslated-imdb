Okay, let me divide it for you ... it's hot! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such a fantastic job on the first harsh intentions, why did he do such a bad job. I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, the truth is that it can improve if its series was ever broadcast, but let it be realistic ... this movie pots! Lots of bad acting * Note The show scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What is the line? "Sloppy when wet" ?????????? We can say DUH-M! This movie tried, I'll give it to you, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny by giving stupid accents to service households, which were ... not fanatical! It was pathetic. Not to mention that everyone in this one view absolutely does not take the form of the original cast. It's like they did them look different than purpose or something! I like to watch when I'm actually on board, which will not happen occasionally. For those of you who liked it ... All right, what do you think? Can you choose this movie over the other who had great acting and wonderful Sarah Michelle Gellar? The film is golden if Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this movie is not, no violation of Amy Adams. Yeah, yeah, when has Sebastain heart ????? UGH!
