The writer / director of this film apparently knows nothing about the film. I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced by a monkey because everyone was either too dark or warmer than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was horrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone who said that this movie was designed for poker fans and not film fans, someone is kidding their own (it was probably a writer / director). No poker fan on this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. To go to the casino and play a few hands does not give you experience that could write about poker. Keep your daily work. And if he plays poker, then you have to be hurt'n.
