Like many other people here have commented before, I must say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've ever seen. There are no direct links to movie footage or sequences in this comment because I hate spoilers. I feel I've been watching an episode of a TV show or something that has some extra spending on CGI (I've seen it worse) ... Overall, it's pretty offensive to the viewer, at least if you have any knowledge of computers and / or technology at all . There are just too many of these insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found out that I just begged for it to end all - quickly - in the middle. In addition, there are a lot of "easy skipping" scenarios, which is also an insult to your intelligence as thought human beings ... <br /> <br /> This movie will completely disappear when compared to the old "Wargames," and I think it's damn it's a shame that this is even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, just for one thing and one thing: the performances of the actors are not half bad, given the regurgitated bits of the script they had to work with. Nevertheless, they should never sign up for this movie. It's not really a career move, but I think we all have to pay bills. For those of you who have given this movie a top score ... you have to be at the championship or something, that's my only explanation. <br /> <br /> For those who have not seen it: by all means, observe it and create your own mind. But lower your expectations on the floor (and then some).
