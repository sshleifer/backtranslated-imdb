I saw this movie because I did it (my task includes watching movies of all kinds). I could not stop thinking "Who gave the money to shoot such a horrible movie and also handed it over to the Cannes festival!" It was not only boring, but the actors were terrible. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
