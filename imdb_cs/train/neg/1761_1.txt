First, I realize that rating "1" should be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets it from me, because, as one reviewer points out, it's not bad at what she thinks might have some comical or cult value. It simply leaks every count. ** Contains possible spoilers ** Dialogue is utterly rude. Continuity is so intentional that it is painful. Daniel just finishes talking about his lost love, and the last word starts with flamenco dancers. A mock-shock of what its name (you see, I do not even remember the name of her character, let alone the name of a forgotten actress) when her husband (Baldwin) first tells her that her boyfriend is a bad guy. The car and the motorcycle hunt did all the right things. Vegetable carts flying. The vehicles hit each other. Motorcycles going down the stairs. People are almost hit, but no one is notable. Yeah, that's true ... with the exception of the one who was stabbed several times, he's probably hit the curb with knife injuries and the approaching car apparently did not notice him. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> I find it increasingly remarkable that such films can be made. There's so much pressure in the film industry to make money, he thinks someone in Hollywood will think about making good movies worth seeing. Now there's a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: this movie is not seen. Do not play DVDs. Do not look at the cable. There are plenty of other things you can do, leaving you feeling comfortable.
