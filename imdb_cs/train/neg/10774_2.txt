What stinkeroo turned out to be! Linda Darnell was one of my favorite films - she was never an actress, but she was very beautiful and pleasant (especially in "Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand"), but when I saw this immortality, memories of her golden days quickly disappeared. The story is unbelievable and fake, it is a second speed, a supportive cast unbearable. I can not think that someone has had unprecedented performance compared to Tab Hunt, and Donald Gray had to be the most inconvenient leader he could choose. A terrible photo has been added to it (and I'm not just a reference to the color!) Everyone involved has to shake whenever it is shown.
