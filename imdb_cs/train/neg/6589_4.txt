I'm afraid I did not like this movie very much. In addition to some rescue graces, nothing is written about it. J-horror resurrected the past five to six years, but the films themselves on more than one account were repeating and carbon copies of previous success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning is promising with cool scenes from the morgue, where the dead girl has her eyes grafted but soon opens it. However, after this, it's fast falling. <br /> <br /> To be kind, I'll start what I like about "Gawi". On the plus side, the visuals are glamorous and the movie looks great for its type. For those who love horror films, there are several beautifully done murder scenes. We also get some good exciting sequences / sets. <br /> <br /> There are a few disadvantages ... <br /> <br /> First of all, and my main complaint about this movie is that the site jumps and jumps forward and backwards in time with alarming intensity. Usually it is not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same no matter what the age, I was confused more than once. <br /> <br /> Performances are fine, I think (and a little hard to tell if you do not know the language), but it looks a bit stiff. And for the horror movie, I do not think it was pretty scary. For a moment, I was quite bored. <br /> <br /> Being a giallo fan, I expected a lot from Nightmare, but unfortunately I was quite disappointed.
