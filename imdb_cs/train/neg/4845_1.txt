There is no artistic value in this film that would deserve a price. He also does not deserve the audience. The irony is that one of the awards is for cinematography, but frankly, camera movements worry the smallest. Every shot, you feel like you're getting a "full picture," like someone "trimming your opinion" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I could not carry the whole movie. The part that was most absorbing was when I saw the soldiers who participated in their barracks and one of the soldiers was trying to drink alcohol. This and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take the advice, keep away from this bullshit.
