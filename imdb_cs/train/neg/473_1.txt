That's what my friend Brian said about this movie about an hour. He could not lose himself. I guessed how hard it was, and eventually I dropped and played it when I missed the adjectives for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you want the peak of hack-work. Something so unsightly, so terribly horrible that everything you want to do after you've seen him is sitting in the dark alone and talking to no one. Some people work under the illusion that this movie is observable. This is not a form of narcotic or brain damage. I would recommend it to somebody to help them understand how unbearable it is. Do not believe me? Gather round. <br /> <br /> For being like a nation, we in America do not always portray people from the Middle East in a tasteful way. But what about a boy in a sexy dress that bounces in a salaam-fashion on a pile of Castrol engine oil bottles? You will find it here. DO GO TO IT? ARAB DEPARTMENT OIL. I could not believe what I see. It would be better to fly a flying plane to a skyscraper. Who would think in the right mind that it was a funny joke? It's not even "cleverly insulting." It's just upset and it makes you want to hit the one you paid to put it in your face. <br /> <br /> A five-month group called "Landmines" will be featured at the ball of officers in the middle of the film. Okay - are you ready? The joke is TERRIBLY AND OFF-KEY. Why did I write it in my cap? Because the joke is POUND, POUND, INCORPORATED IN HIS HEAD with HORRENDOUS marathon marathon. They start bad enough; glasses, popping glasses, breaking drums ... then, I am 100% serious, two-murder stop-motion sequence and A WOMAN CLOTHING OFF. You were right to read - the music was so bad, in one frame, feet on the feet of your shoes. In the near future, shoes are turned off !!! Get it because the music was so bad, the shoes dropped! Co F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless assembly of serial records to drive home that SINGING IS BAD. If a human being really suffered from this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be surprised. This movie is sincerely a practical joke to see how fast people would kick the door. Robert Downey Sr. directs the comedy that his son will respect by staying without drugs. Poorly. Other things to keep in mind: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music shoes where possible. Every time Liceman appears, Iggy Pop's really inappropriate song is playing. In addition, all actors do everything they can to behave for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbara Bach's criminally terrible accent. It sounds like she was trying to talk like a child while her tongue is marble. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where boys all moan and tangle from the perspective of her split, as they are in the classroom classroom community, and they were directed to act like excited retarded people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his rebellious dog with a condom. Remember; when this movie appeared and threw "abortion" and "condom" was considered "irritated." <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a dying, boy-hungry pedophile, back when the Hollywood idea of ​​"pedophile" and "homosexual" were one in the same. Flat-out torture. <br /> <br /> 5. Watch the end. There is nothing wrong with the VCR. That is the end. Tell me it does not mean you want to explode anyone who ever did a movie. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. The Academy is known to make other movies, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less entertaining simply by placing a videotape near them.
