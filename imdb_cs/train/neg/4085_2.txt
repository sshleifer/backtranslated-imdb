"Sir John Gielgud had to be senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one," this is one of these films, I think it is considered "art" but not "Do not be afraid ..... it is garbage. Stick to "art" you can admire in the frame because movies that are labeled as such are usually incomprehensible counterfeits like this one. In this masterpiece, Giegud recites Shakespeare's "Tempest," while panning cameras to naked people. one of them a little boy urinating in the pool. Wow, this is real stuff and real "art", right? This is just one example. Most of the story makes no sense, it is impossible to follow it, and so is that liberal critics are afraid to say they did not "understand", so they give them high marks to save their false ego. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
