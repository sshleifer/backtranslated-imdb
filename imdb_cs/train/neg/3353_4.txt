A pretty bad movie does not offer anything new. Common hair and moans are trying to makeup for a confused but thin story. Efficiency is barely beyond doubt. Why did Liam Neeson sign up, it's someone. Owen Wilson will really turn into one of the worst performances in the recent horror history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun when she looks and is not too much, though Lili Tayor has done an above-average job. The special effects were quite memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and breathtakingly beautiful. However, they can not make a makeup for bad acting and a plot that seems to have been last assembled. Do not bother.
