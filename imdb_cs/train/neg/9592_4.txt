I have seen the film just recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see a fun movie, but let me tell you that Princess Blade is not against Azumi. The "Princess" is not much talking, as you may have noticed ... Jean Claude Van Damme reminded me, who was just trying to express himself, and then defeated the bitch of the opposition. Throughout the movie, I expected to hear at least a confession about what she liked, why she fought for whom she loved and believed. I was waiting in vain. Dirty movie. Bad dialogue. Do not look at it until you get bored of your mind! It is so bad that I finally thought how I was not screaming in frustration for one and a half hours. Approximately. I give 4/10.
