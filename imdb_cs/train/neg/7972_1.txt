I love B movies .. but come ... it was not even for the price of the grade ... The end was stupid ... b / c NEVER I AM REAL END! .. not to mention that it comes to life on my own ... Do I mean no storm lighting or crazy demonic powers? They slow down like fools and then start killing characters one by one like a 15-minute period ... and I'm not even starting a thing that would kill a man without a head ... and then you can not even see what Jigsaw is doing with his so-called " new jigsaw ".... If you have nothing better to do ... Id watch the dry color of Id I recommend this god-left the movie to anyone else ... oh and to be even better in the same movie totem, you see the guy who threw one creation in the basement from the window ... it was funny like hell and probably the only good part of watching the loss of the movie
