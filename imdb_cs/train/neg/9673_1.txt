"Plants are the most cunning and the worst of all forms of life," one of them may be the victim of "The Seedpeople," silly, flabby remarks about "Invasion of Bodysnatchers," "Day of the Triffids" and about a thousand udders. And why are moore seeds dangerous than plants, can they ask? Because, according to the same mine, "the seeds can persecute us". Yes, I remember a terrible incident where MooCow was just a calf when they chased him all over the school with a dandy droid ... Yeah, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this furious little turkey look like hairy little muppets, some of which revolve around like bad blabbering, others floating on strings. There is not even the slightest sense of fear or tension. For reasons that have been unexplained, monster seeds are eliminated by ultraviolet lights of 50 volts, although they can walk in daylight, which has roughly 1,000,000,000,000 times more UV power. As you can see, there was not much thought in this cow flop. MooCow says you go to the garden and do not leave the photosynthesis here. : = 8P
