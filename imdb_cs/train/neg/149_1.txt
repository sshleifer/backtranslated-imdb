You know the rest! It must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when she took over that role. The lead role plays (for me) a complete unknown, and I imagine she disappeared right back to the unknown. this Turkey. Bruce Lee has led a martial arts tax in the early 1970s, and since then the battle scene has to be either martial arts based or at least brutal when using street combat techniques. This film uses quick cuts to show martial arts, but it can not even hide the fact that the lady does not know how to hit the stroke. The average eight-year-old boy would have done it separately as it turns out. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, the only secret that's shown here is that this has not earned golden raspberries for her year.
