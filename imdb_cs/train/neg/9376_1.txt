when I watched this movie I got wrong. I stayed with Pippi and it was a pleasure every time. when my wife came to Sweden, she looked at the old man and she had a really good laugh. but this US version should be renamed and never re-displayed. it's terrible from start to finish. how they manage to make it so bad. well I think someone blamed the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never near Pippi. this movie can never be seen and never broadcast on the broadcast. burn a movie and save children. if you want to look at Pippi, look at the original movie and laugh good. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry for Tami Erin that you will never become Pippi .. Oh yes .. when you read the explanation of "spoilers", you "spoil" the surprise and steal the viewer the tension and the joy of the film. "and I think the director is worth it ... you look at this movie at your own risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
