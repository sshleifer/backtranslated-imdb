Everyone who saw the original film of 1970 knows how an excellent cast, script, and director can compose a comic masterpiece. In the same way, it is easy to see how it can be the opposite of another hollow hole in Hollywood! This movie was pathetic! If it was not for John Clees (comic genius), I would have gone for about 15 minutes to this terrible celluloid waste. Neil Simon would not write another script for this version (he said he could not improve on the first one) and I'm surprised he will not sue for humiliation after this movie fiasco! Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a great job of the original what did the producers think when they introduced it? How would a director and an editor look at these scenes and think one of them was fun? I do not know, but one thing I know is not surprising why foreign and independent films are becoming more and more popular .......
