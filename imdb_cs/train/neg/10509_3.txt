Exiled from heaven, a gang of naked naked female angels (with large plastic fangs) settled in a haunted forest where they feed on any unfortunate soul that should roam. Is it not long before a group of friends on a road trip falls victim to bloodthirsty girls? Independent low-budget horror in the UK, Forest of the Damned takes an exciting prospect and pays him to the pan with some of the worst actors, effects and direction I've seen long ago. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts shows some casual atmosphere behind the camera? the scenes in the decompilation house are quite tense and there are some hand-crafted "shock" moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateur. Take some really horrible performances from the horrifying icons of Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have one really bad movie on your hands. Some fun can be derived from the totality of the film and there is plenty of female nudity for the boys to enjoy, but most will find it fun to sit.
