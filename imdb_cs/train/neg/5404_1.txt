Have you ever obtained a flow that would kill an hour or two to do the job and watch the movie so badly that it rejects the reason? Well, renting movies one weekend I see boxing art for this and see T-Rex. He knew the dinosaur was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I had to rent KNEW just because I was in the mood for a bad film. least. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more interested in their assets and shareholders than lives and, of course, the big, badly animated, sock puppet T-Rex. Is it my movie that there are scenes clearly intertwined from other films? Not to mention that Rex is hungry is never satisfied ... at all. How hungry is behind me, because it really does not have a throat (Really, if you look down on his mouth when he burns out, it's solid ... like a toy or something). Now I like incredibly bad B-movies from time to time, because it reminds me of how much better the barrier film is. This was cheerful. I'm not sure if it's a thriller or a comedy because there are scenes where you do not make mistakes, you laugh. <br /> <br /> I blame the budget of the movie ... yes, but it did not help. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, like some female roles ... if you were crying, should not you tear off? Meh, I will not be angry at this movie, I knew what I was getting, and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, it's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then watch Jurassic Park and then the lost world back to back. You will write Mr. Spielberg thank you letters the following day.
