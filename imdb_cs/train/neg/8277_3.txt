That could be unbelievable, but this film earned in Russia $ 878,138! It is shown in almost all cinemas and is still running! Well, I have no idea why distributors pay attention to this particular "film" that almost did not see around the world. That's some mystery! Ha-Ha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that the next film, "Promise this" with Paris Hilton, which was just as well released by the DVD almost everywhere, had a major projection in Russia and earned more than $ 1 million. In addition, both films have had a lot of promotion, like dolls around the city, TV commercials, and so on. I was talking about the movie, I think it's boring and totally boring. It would be better, really. Even though she has Jessica Simpson.
