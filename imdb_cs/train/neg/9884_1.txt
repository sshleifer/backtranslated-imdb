I was a fan without a trace of the premiere episode. I really can not express my disappointment in the episode last week. This is a REAL problem that deals with too many US families and continues to solve them. Insufficient media coverage, which is crucial in the first 48 hours, has been documented by a recent study. Implementation of law, including local, state and federal, is also co-operating. What was the purpose of advertising this topic and then digging it in the end? Apparently, television can deal with almost any extra matter. It's shameful. Get it together or not check it out.
