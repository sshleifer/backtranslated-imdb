This movie is just like any other Dutch film, so if you like movies like turkey fruits and de kleine blond d√≥da. then you could be fine with this (although these two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte is starting pretty hard, but also that one good scene ends and has nothing to do with the story. It's a lot of nudity (but I and others just could not find the girl attractive), the dialogue is ridiculous (as we did a lot of the other movie observers) and some scenes are so accidental that it's more unintentional than anything else like a random scene in which an owl scares someone's eye out ... has nothing to do with anything and is referred only once in a sentence saying "you have heard what happened ... I was there"). the only reason I gave her 2 is that some of the places they are are looking pretty ... that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went out of sight (here in Holland we have a special system that involves thumbnail previews, you pay less money than a regular movie and you do not know what the movie is that you will know , it's a new movie that's not yet in theaters). My advice is to stay away from this movie if you really want to see a good Dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek.
