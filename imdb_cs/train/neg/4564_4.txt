Disney has now made a direct follow-up to the video and brings a lot of animated features. Two of them were made for their 1991 classic, "Beauty and the Beast". Well, these are not really a sequel because they both fit into the first movie events. The first of these two direct films was "Beauty and Beast: Enchanted Christmas," which seems to be unhappy with a number of fans of the theater precursor, but I think that can usually be expected with a sequel. However, the latter, "Belle is a magical world," is certainly worse. The film contains three short stories that take place while Belle is in the castle and the place is charming. The first is "The Perfect Word," where a misunderstanding at a table between Belle and Beast leads to problems and does not even want to be the first to apologize. Another story is "Fifi's Folly," where Fifi and Lumiere are coming to fifth anniversary, and Lumiere is unprepared, so Belle helps. However, Fifi sees Lumiere trains a novel with Belle, and thinks they are really in love. The film ends with "Broken Wing". In this story, Belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing, but a bird in the castle will probably be a problem if he finds out the animal because he hates birds! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that in the DVD version another story is added called "Mistress Potts side", but I only saw the original version. Since I doubt that one story would look like a classic over the others, I see no reason to watch a special edition. Anyway, the first thing to say about Belle's Magic World is that the animation is very two-dimensional compared to what we're used to at Disney, which would of course disappoint a lot of people. I really did not like "Beauty and Beast: Christmas Enchantment," but you certainly can not say about animation. I'm sure stories from the "Belle Magic World" could have a lot of kids (mostly younger, I think), and every story has morals, so they could also teach some valuable lessons. However, it does not really have much for adult films. I personally did not find good humor in him and found that the constant conflict between Bella and the Animal was lost and the stories did not make me at all at all (not very well written). In the "perfect word," Belle tells the beast: "You are making crude ... and stupid!" is a bit sweet and I think there are quite a few other cheese moments in these stories. By the time this movie came out at first glance, I was about eleven or twelve years old. I do not know what I would think then, because I lost interest in Disney at the time, and it would be years to get interested in this interest. Even when this film was released for the first time, I think I was a bit behind the age group that it was targeting. I have never seen "Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" a few months ago, but unlike this movie, I've never heard of it recently, I think right after seeing the first Disney 1991 hit. Well, as much as I like the theatrical original, I would not be too much if I never realized the existence of this movie. For small children, I'm sure "Belle's Magical World" can be very entertaining and probably somewhat educated by its morale, but I do not recommend it to adult Disney fans.
