Can I do this until I need glasses? at least proves that someone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. People who have unleashed this incredible pile of dirty vomit into the world lack any kind of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience must consist of recently labotimized children and children playing with their own faeces. Anybody else would be too world-wise to get even snicker from this movie. It consists of a series of Sophorian Scouts in which the dividing line does not even apply to the obvious. It ends in absurd. The jokes they tell are the types of jokes that primary school children say (usually atypical or sexually related) where they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like the dad's car and the maminka's garage. The use of any stricter method of criticism would be pointless because the usual standards of negotiation, writing, direction and such creative "minds" have never been heard. for this mess. It is not legal, but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously consider their purpose in this country. <br /> <br />
