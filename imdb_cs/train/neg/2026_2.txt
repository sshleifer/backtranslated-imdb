Such a hype appeared on the show with Bill Shatner ... especially at the moment Deal or No Deal and 1 in 100. So of course everyone had to tune in to find a new game show. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says so stoically and nasally, "wooww". The only thing that appealed to this show was the fact that you knew it would end up. Sitting for an hour it was like going to the dentist ... you find that you are looking at the clock in what you think they are at 10 minute intervals just to find out that only a minute has passed (but it seemed like eternity) from the last time you looked at the clock. So why did not I just switch the channel? Well, apparently for the same reason most other people ... out of pure optimism. I mean, nobody really wants to think that a show with Bill Shatner can really be so bad. Personally, I never thought of the first 15 minutes that this is the kind of car that would introduce the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. Watching left me feeling depressed. You still wanted to get some excitement, but there was nothing to be. There was not enough light on the set to get a sense of energy from the audience (which you have not even seen). Dear Network: People do not look at the game to cure insomnia. .. Their watch game shows to be excited and have a good time. Please do all the favors and lose it in the vault.
