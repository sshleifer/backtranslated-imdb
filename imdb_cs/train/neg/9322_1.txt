Please do not let the cover of this movie be deceived. And if you're looking for a cheap horror film you'll laugh at: it's not true. Usually I will go stupid if it's funny but this stupid was so stupid that it almost (or maybe) caused me to be stupid. The quality of the movie is better than a handheld, but not much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on the Casio keyboard. These problems should never be a detective if you would see a horror movie, but add this amazing (cry) cast and you really have a humminger. The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his family cottage in Texas for the weekend. He also extends the invitation to crush his lady in her office. On the way they meet a woman in distress who is invited to come with other girls. Cabin stay includes sex and nudity, and soon all panties are in a group when one girl disappears and odd objects appear in the house. From here (audience) and crazy, um, actors, you try to find out what's going on and soon start to mistrust. Overall, I think I did it better than it is. The main struggle with this film is that the characters are very poorly developed, plotting parodies, bad behavior and crazy motivation. Once again it can be forgiven that it was at least a bit funny, but unfortunately it is not. The end of the end is just a twist in that no one would appreciate it simply because if you really thought back to a movie that would not make any sense. Please do not let this review stop you from seeing a loophole escape from this movie. (Woah, my nose just grew eight centimeters.)
