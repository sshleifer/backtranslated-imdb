If there ever was a movie that deserves a big fat zero, it's a pile of bullshit. I love zombie movies and even bad ones usually have something for them but not this atrocities. In fact, I started to feel angry that I was watching this film because it is so insultingly poor, I can not believe that the people responsible for it would actually think it's acceptable. There is no conspiracy, and the non-fence is a cut with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not respond, do not work, or in any way resemble human beings. The whole movie is also filmed in two rooms that are modestly decorated and vaguely resemble the places to be. The whole thing is an unnecessary mess, it does not go anywhere and when the zombies finally appear, they look like garbage and do not do much. I could make a better movie than this, so you could and so could someone who had never seen a movie before. It is the poor and undoubtedly the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the worst film of all time. You will realize that the only positive reviews give this 10/10 and I encourage you to buy a DVD. I can not imagine that someone neutral really thought it was a good movie, it's terrible. 0/10 and that's generous.
