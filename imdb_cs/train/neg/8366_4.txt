"SherryBaby" is a rather painful and sordid melody in Jersey, a story of a young mother who is out of prison on a drug-related condemnation probe and struggles to stay clean to find a place for herself in her life and especially to win her love daughter who takes care of her brother's family. The only reason why you need to watch a movie is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, which fits very well into the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. This is not enough, because the story line is too simplified and the expected and emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - I still asked myself whether to justify the former and perhaps future drug addict mother as a director and the screenwriter she wanted or an innocent boy, which is in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting did not convince me that I should not worry about the child.
