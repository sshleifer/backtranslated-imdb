The film was TERRIBLE !!! The very worst movie I've seen in the last few years. One of these films will be able to tell people that in the next three years it's the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for responding to this burning question: "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" Answer: Celebrity prophecy. Trust me ... I read a book, enjoyed the message and was thrilled to see the movie, but then the audience was treated as if we were alone. There is no story, and the story that is there is crippled by too much charm and coincidence. It is too bad to have to explain nine prophecies and can not simply relate them to a story that is entertaining and following. They did not take any time to develop the character and it was easy not to worry about whether a character had died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who have been waiting for the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is pretty boring, but I liked parallels that could be seen in everyday life when reading a book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would advise you not to see if you want to keep the book's words close to your heart. DO NOT VISIT THIS FILM. Believe me.
