I just visited the Russian forum of our TV channel that showed this movie. Well ... 99 percent of the active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more facts about our space achievements in this film. But the authors have something else to mind ... :( We are a big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here We are proud of all our space dreams, real successes on the one hand in this area and science on the other side. "Where is our LUNOHOD?" "And where the hell is our MIR station?" "I'm pretty sure that the LUNOHOD events were earlier in Armstrong's" Moon walk. "and scientific errors - I really do not have time and with plenty of space! With our constructive criticisms at the Russian forum at www.1tv.ru
