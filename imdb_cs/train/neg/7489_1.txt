American movies about war and the Nazis simply can not be good. They can not refrain from becoming an idiot and follow agenda. All Nazis are bad, foolish, too proud, and the Americans are so modest, yet capable and reasonable and human. Come on, stop this bullshit. The main character says something like "we have to do this aggression war as a crime." Is America a peaceful state with a $ 420 billion global defense budget (China No. 2 with only $ 51 billion)? Is it simply spent in this without ... ROI? Why represent America as a peaceful nation when it is not? I deeply dislike movies with agenda - they throw the art into hell and try to convince us to believe something. Hollywood should place a label on movies, as well as record companies have this "parenting advice" label. We should have some "bullshit", "promotional advice" or "politically correct" label on some movies. That's one of them.
