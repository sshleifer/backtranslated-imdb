Christopher Durang had to be taught in the remembrance of a terrible nun because he simply can not leave this concept. The play "Sister Mary Ignatius explains it all to you" has been introduced - at least in Hollywood - exactly the same tone as the Diane Keaton lecture scene. Sister Mary was exaggerated, puppeteer, bitter satire of self-confidence, doctrine, and a highly conscious nun - and as Lynn Redgrave played, she was cheerful. The film, however, insists that we consider this exaggeration to be absolutely serious - while, as mentioned, we keep the same tone in the "explaining it all" scenes. These two approaches diverge, and in the last twenty minutes the film is off the track, plunging into the abyss and exploding. There are no survivors. It could work if the tone of the scenes with four former students and their encounter with Mary sister met with the same scenes of sister Mary. Or if the sister Marie scenes were presented more realistically. It simply does not work that way.
