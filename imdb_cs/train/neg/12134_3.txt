The face should be a great movie, a great cast, a plot with many possibilities, and one of the best Hollywood movies behind the camera. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear why it was another 8 years before they decided to try and re-direct the film. This movie fails at so many levels. In a movie where there are not many events and most scenes are filmed in several places, it is essential for the director to provide tension and continuity. It's not here, the spectacular film is terribly unused, nothing more than a brilliant late John Spencer, the plot is such a running mill and nothing you've seen in a hundred other television films. There is so little character development that he does not care about any of the protagonists. At least we know that Spacey has a lot of friends and influence in Hollywood studios to get away with a bad move
