When I first saw a small scene in some announcements, I thought the show would have fun watching. That little robot looks somewhat cute. Animation style looks somewhat familiar on some classic shows. Before the performance I studied her from several sources. There I was a little horrified. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are reasonably expressed, but Robotboy is an exception. It would be much nicer if a young boy had to portray him. One good example is Robot Jones, a robot figure from "What's Everything Robot Jones Do?" The show is not really bad. But the way Robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is the only criticism. So I do not see much.
