You do not even have to watch how this shiny spoiler destroys everything about 'Annie'. The characters look almost discounted by a badly written story and have a low quality feel for production. It was very clear for television, but if I found it on my TV, I would just jerk it. Children in the movie do a good job, but the adults who act are incredible, so the film does not really lead you to draw you. This film lacked musical / dance figures that became an original brilliant and really enjoy Annie's love. Johnson, because Annie is occasionally annoying and not doing ... you can not convince her that she's really Annie. Differences in the appearance of the character continued to irritate me throughout the film. It's sad to say that this sequel was a total flop.
