When I was a child in the seventies, at the local theater, the Mothers had children every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (someone remembers them?). This thing showed one year at the time of Christmas. Me and some friends have seen them. I was expecting a great movie Santa Claus. What I got was a terribly dubbed (you can say) and a really scary movie. Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the magician (do not ask me what these two are doing in the same movie) Satan (some joker in silly diabolical costume with horns!). The paintings attracted me to me. I've always found Santa Scary to start it, so it did not work. The guy in Satan's suit did not help. But what really frightened me was the wooden predatory deer that pulled out a sledgehammer. When he hurt them and the terrible sound they did, and the movement - I remember that I had nightmares on these things! All these years later, I still remember getting out of the theater more than a little concerned about what I saw. My friends were scared too. I saw a commercial on TV and all the nightmares floated back. This is a scary, disturbing little Christmas movie that probably scares trousers from a small child who sees it. Avoid it - if you really do not want to punish your children. It gets 1.
