I was a haunted film with horror and horror, and so it was so bad, I felt embarrassed not only as "actors," but also with the director and the poor juice of the producer who really gave his money for this deal. /> <br /> You would expect some great massacre, a bit of a plot, and at least in some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what looks like a bit more violent and sexual episode Three Stooges. At least I laughed at Three Stooga. As I watched these bits, I turned to another television and began to watch Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say that I was watching Stern. Watching this "movie" I realize I can make a movie with three monkeys, two DV cameras, 50 bucks in relaxed changes and a broken computer. This movie is my inspiration for getting into the movie without a budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but beware ... there is nothing but a lot of talking and very few steps. It makes "KaZaam" look like a movie by Meryl Streep. I'm sure Germany has not forbidden it because of sex or violence. Other countries have to take into account.
