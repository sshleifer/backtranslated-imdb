I can not say enough bad things about this train wreck. It's one of the few movies I've ever wanted to leave. It was bad assumptions, first pregnant men, but then they tried to spoof it. What were the spoofing of all those real pregnant men ??? That was the worst movie I've ever seen. If there were enough votes, it would be on the bottom 100 IMDB. If it were possible, I would grant it zero and I would still feel that I gave her too many credits.
