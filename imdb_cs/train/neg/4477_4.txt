What a blank and lack of a shiny edition of a classic novel. I wish people stopped talking with the classic when they apparently have no idea of ​​the real intention or point of origin. This version does not differ. I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse, though as casting Juliette brioche, because Kathy must be the worst casting decision EVER ... as well back to this version. The aim is to make a story relevant to contemporary environments and musical styles. Success in both, but the high art is thread. A guided tour for a rainy day maybe ... Direction was average and editing was opaque. Worse than old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great turn like Hindley and in fact is one of the Britons a waste of talent. Part of Heath was played with great charm and faith and I think casting is the strongest point of this project. Though a more talented director would make better use of the equipment he had. Obviously, he is the director of the lease and did not explain the project with the passion he deserved.
