No one is a bigger fan of Flashman Geroge MacDonald Fraser than I do. I was surprised to see right now that Richard Lester drove the Royal Flash, because I also see that he did three / four Musketeers with Fraser, but I did well. <br /> <br /> This is not the King's flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie was released and could not be excited because I read all those Flashman publications that were published until then and were drunk A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I'm still , but there was never enough chance). What disappointment (I saw it again when I was 20 on TV and it seemed even worse). <br /> <br /> No sharp dialogs in the books are being converted to the screen. It seemed to me that Flashman's character comedy was misinterpreted in the same way as a group of high school students trying to parody that they would do. Fighting and fencing were terrible and unsustainable. Looking back with mature eyes, the film did not finish to take advantage of the direct satire of older film versions of Zenel. If you read a book and did not see a movie, I can only say that the film ends when Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg become fast friends and play the game Rudi just invented: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> Pathetic betrayal of everything that books are about. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie recently, but I'm glad I was not. <br /> <br /> If Fraser reads at any time, I can only say that I think he is brilliant - maybe the greatest comic book novelist of his generation, but on the basis of my appreciation of this corpus of work it is hard to believe that he wrote the script of this film, because he made all the horrific movies of Roger Moore James Bond.
