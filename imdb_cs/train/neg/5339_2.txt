OK, so like most people, give me free tickets and I'll go and see most things, now that multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember the old "lightning pit" single-channel cinema and I'm a healthy party 40). In England, this film was released as a "liar", a dog. It is a complete waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for photo and only for setting.
