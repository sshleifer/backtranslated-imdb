This series would be much better if they just did one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head Instead of Code Name: Tree. Diamond Head needs someone who can handle the role of the lovely robes that McShane proved to be able to do with the Lovejoy line. Roy Thinnes, a real diamond head, is really just the way. McShane is not really as good as a bad guy. France Nuyen's character, Tso-Tsing, apparently fails to decide whether it is an unfortunate victim or a woman who is ready to fight. She really earned her salary at the end when she was to play the role of Diamond Head's lover. After reviewing an episode or two, I ended by not happening what happened to someone. The tree gives us much to hate it, but Diamond Head does not give us anything he likes. Unfortunately, the spy genre in the seventies was not as it did in the 1960s.
