Oh dear! The first time I heard about this bad show was when one of my friends screamed like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while we were playing video games. I thought it was a confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life), and changing "Quest" with "Test". It's strange that I'm wrong, but I was actually wrong, did not change anything, heard about this show. One day while watching TV, I heard Cartoon Network be released. what was the conspiracy of this show, so I watched adventurous and here is my answer "WANT MY DAMN HOUR BACK" (Because I watched these crap and "My Gym Partner's Monkey". <br /> <br /> This is one from the worst shows I've ever seen: first the beginning, with the deepest song in the world, then the conspiracy where my morals are? It's a boy who has AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT sisters who have a lab and experiment with their own OHHH brother, why is his name John TEST, is a test of nurse attempts. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> You know, I sincerely miss Dexter La b (before it was transformed into NEW DEXTER, the same bullshit.) That's a bad copy of that old good show , except that this show is terribly bad, and do not look at anything more productive than half the hour to watch the bullshit.
