Efficiency is terrible. This movie makes Fast and Furious looks like an Academy Award-winning film. He throws a few cubes and ass to keep you interested despite an extremely weak and far-reaching story. There is a reason why people on the Internet do not even make this movie. This film sank as an iron tower. Do not waste time renting or even downloading. This film is and will always be PERMA-TURD. I'm stupid to watch him. This title should be referred to as "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Saying it's a movie is horror and insult. hateful, disgusting, cruel, disgusting, unpleasant, disgusting, terrifying, frightening, frightening, fairy, terrible, terrifying, creepy, terrible, creepy, creepy, angry, evil, unpleasant, terrible, disgraceful, shocking, ill, terrible, terrifying, ungodly, ungodly, ruthless
