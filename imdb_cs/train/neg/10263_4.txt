Yes, The Southern Star has a pretty forgotten title song sung by this difficult encounter Matt Monro. This largely creates a tone for this inflated and rather boring feature, amazing miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventure couple looking for a big diamond. Add to Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing an ostrich, lots of traces of wildlife, and a badly composed and boring photograph of Raoul Coutard, and eventually ending with a far-reaching scream across the jungles of Senegal.
