Some gorehound friends have recommended me a "live feed," and basically I can not really complain because the film is sure to deliver a lot of gross sadness and bucks full of dirty, but of course it's not a very good movie. Still more than returning to the latest trend in horror film, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to overcome every other movie in this subgroup (including the "Hostel" and "Saw" models) with her sick and twisted makeup effects and thoroughly spoiled clippings of naked co-workers tried, suffered and begged for life. There is no real description to describe. Five helpless twenty-one friends go to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but I also do not know why they chose to travel to Cancun. They obviously do not care about continental culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness the local cute puppy massacre on the market. The quintet then submerges into the furious nightlife and one of them accidentally offends the leader of the criminal clan. Just the justification is clearly not enough because the gangster follows them into the adult theater and gradually exposes them to cruel torture. One girl has her breasts crowned, and the other poor one even has a poisonous snake that puts it in her throat; yikes. "Live feed" is surprisingly boring despite all bloodshed and amateur production values ​​are difficult to overlook, even if you're accustomed to watching independent cocktail fans like this one. The fat guy depicted on the cover, the oriental S & M executions, is certainly quite cool and he is also the most talented of the whole group because he kept his mouth at all times. I do not want to recommend this pile of dirt, but hey, if you like loud and awesome metal music, nauseating torture and lost losses, go ahead and watch!
