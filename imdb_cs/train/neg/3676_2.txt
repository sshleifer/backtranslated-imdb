Susan Swift is an attractive young woman who was a transplant until the 80's (as a young Susan Dey), but she does not have enough vocals for dramatic dramatic leadership and tends to kiss; she is still rather sweet and she has bright eyes and a nice smile. In "The Coming" (as it was called when it was briefly released to theaters), Swift may be the reincarnation of the Salem Witch. The movie is a very low budget and it borrows it from many other pictures I've given it for about 15 minutes. It starts very strongly and has some appeal in the camp. It is obvious that there are more serious films dealing with attempts at the Salem witch that deserve to be seen above; however, as junk movies go, it's not too bad. Boston sites are a bit of a plus, and supporting the cast is amusing hammams. * 1/2 from ****
