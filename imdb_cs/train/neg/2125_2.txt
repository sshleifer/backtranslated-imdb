If I had not been forced to follow this for business reasons, I would never have done it in the last 10 minutes. And even then I confess that I was quickly passing parts. The film version of '63 was in all respects enormously superior. Yes, I read that it is more faithful to the original game, but what was wise for the writer to change the script in 1963! It's too long to stretch, the songs that are in this version and not in the movie version are boring and unthinkable. The "Kids" version of '63 was a very fun and real classic of sarcastic parental humor. In this version, Kim is too old, Conrad is terribly terrible when I see (when someone pulls my shirt, I knocked disgustedly ... the director of this version does not know what is sexy). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing (and can not remain in the melody) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley was really such that his career would end before he started. As for the other actors, I still waited for Alexander's toupee to fall when he danced and Daly stopped playing completely like Mama. Check out Stapleton's performance in the movie version to see the same role correctly done by someone who understands comic timing. This television version is nothing but a complete waste of time.
