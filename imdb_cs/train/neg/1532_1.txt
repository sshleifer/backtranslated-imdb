Although I rightly warned that I really sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I mostly give each film a break and because I thought the only film could not be that bad. I fix it. Even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could not save this turkey from sinking like tons of bricks. Only once did I leave a terrible frantic laugh during this humor. Especially during the scene, Simon says. Other jokes are either poorly executed or simply malfunctioning. And some of them actually see that they are coming miles away. This movie just does not have what it takes to be a good parody like a plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. Everybody had A. funny gags, B. good dialogue and the most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. The men in white have none of the above. Calling this movie would be grossly underestimated. KEEP THIS FILM EVERYBODY! YOUR WARRANTY IS SELECTED!
