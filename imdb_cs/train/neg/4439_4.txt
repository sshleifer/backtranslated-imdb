So. That's pretty bad. The game is immense and the decision to transfer it to the film is not good - especially when Peploe does not decide how to treat the theatrical origin of the material (sometimes we look at a theater audience, etc.) and decided to go with the jump style that still reminds you that you are watching the movie while in fact only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor director film that is overwhelmed by its materials. Mira Sorvino's main performance is eagerly poor: the scene and the plum, it is as if she played her part thanks to the work of Merchant Ivory Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona Shaw produces performance - and perhaps her theatrical pedigree means she is best able to handle the material - but it's hard to watch the movie for one performance alone, although performance is so light, true and like Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns on average and disconnects, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling, plays his supporting role. Obviously, none of Bertolucci's spells take on his wife if this film is to be proof.
