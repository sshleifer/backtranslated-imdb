I have not read one IMDb note for this film that states how a Jewish character jumped up and down like a small child in this movie because his face was replaced by a racist skinhead while the black figure of the film was snapping at the head of the gun. I do not know how someone feels like a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not bastion of tolerance, as they should be, and the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not create his characters of such a wide cartoon. On the surface, he tries to portray the character of Ice Cube as a bad guy who provokes Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who will end up at the end of the movie of the redeemed epilogue? It seems that Singleton has a white color because she is not able to empathize (I did not say sympathy!) With my colleague, a black student OR ARE only able to take the path of a racist skinhete. Many people who have been harassed by people of another race will not appear to be extreme bigotry. Even women who have been raped will not immediately turn to lesbianism, which is more like cult than lifestyle. Quite frankly, what was the reason?
