I watched that movie really did not expect much, I got it into a set of 5 films, all of which were horrible in their own way, and for what I could expect? and you know what I was right about, they were all horrible, this movie has a few interesting points (and it's a little stretching out), the occasional view of the camera is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, so damn annoying, and that's the fact it's so boring that what I can only suppose was an attempt to build tension, nothing happened, and when it's a really tedious forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but it's released) and is seriously the leading vocalist of the band that looks great, because they do not mention how beautiful it is a lot of hell, I thought it looked a bit like a meercat, I did not even mention the killer, I do not even have to go into it, just do not want to explain it. Anyway, with regard to me, the star and London are just the only reason to watch it and except London (which was really fun) it was not because of their acting talent, I certainly saw a lot worse, but I also saw a lot better. Best avoid if you are bored with dry color.
