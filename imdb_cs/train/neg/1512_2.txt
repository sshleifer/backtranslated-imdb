Poor attempt at "seven," complete with a subgroup of second grade, horrible camera work, a half-burned story, and a tough offensive lame propaganda. Yeah, they're "sexual offenders," they live side by side and you're raped, really. <br /> <br /> No surprise from the vice-terminatrix woman, she acts as always - convincingly like a piece of wood. Richard Gere sticks to the sliding bottom and down - and is as low as late Steven Seagal. The crazy singer is best when dead in bed; and even the wolf was sub-par (though she was the best artist in the movie) - maybe she fed her before the shots or something. Unlike the "Seven," which was interesting, however, a story to which one could focus more or less regardless of the country, it seems that this film focuses only on the obsession in the US. If you do not care too much about "sexual offenders" - and statistics are that lack of exercise and poor diet are causing more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to be seen or worried. > <br /> There are some fetishes and some sinks, but the gore is less than average and fails as artwork (because it's useless), like gore, because it's not enough to bleed. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this.
