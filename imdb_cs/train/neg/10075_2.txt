I'm sorry, but Adrian Zmed from TJ Hooker can not save that sequel. During the half of the movie, I thought it was the original. Then came this wild and hideous scene of the motorcycle (note that it is the only film that directs Patricia Birch); and sadly I realized he was trying to be serious. I got kicked off that the opposition gang, who lost his "wheels" due to his gambling habits in the original lubricating fat, was forced to use motorcycles in the second film. She was horrified by this caring figure of Carrington, I hated to see what they would resort to later: maybe mopeds? I also never bought a dull motif: a hunky-australian-boy-can't-fit-in-outsiders-a predominant-school-ergo-goes-for-tough-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look. It was a bad story for Disney. So it looks like you could ruin a good thing by placing bubble gum Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took from this film was the idea of ​​how much of the ten points it gave.
