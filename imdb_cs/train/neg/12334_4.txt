The assumption is ridiculous, characters incredible, dialogue trite and end absurd. Believe me I'm a Kevin Kline fan, but I watched him have Pepe Le Pew's accent for 2 hours because the supposed Frenchman is not as fun as it sounds. <br /> <Meg Ryan is so inflamed and adorable as (choose): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is the most cute creation on earth. He does not even have the slightest resemblance to a real human being. The film seems to me to be an opportunity that boys Lawrence Kasdan and Kline took on a vacation in Paris and the south of France while they were well paid. I can not really blame them.
