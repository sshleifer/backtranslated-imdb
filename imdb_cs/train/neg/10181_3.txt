This movie is so bad that it's funny. She plays Scott Backul as a coach, but it is not important, which is important for the big black man playing on the 1st base. At first he must be at least 75 years of age, but he still plays baseball baseball, the other starts the outfit, although he is unable to walk, let alone run. Backula coach greatly induces him to quote for the first time that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for too long. Backula shows at the end of the film a brighter coaching strategy (SPOILER), telling his star player "in the center" to hit a home run, clearly "central" it considered a good move. He struck home run and won the game for his team, a small league team playing for the twins, which was a class of majors in the movie. Now, if only Tony Muser, manager of the Royals, was such a clever coach as Backula and told his players that they would simply hit the home run in each on the bat, the Royals would never end the shift without losing the game.
