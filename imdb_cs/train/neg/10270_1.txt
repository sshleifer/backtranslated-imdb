"The American Nightmare" is, in my opinion, officially tied to "It's a Bed!" for the best film of all time. Seven friends (similar to the K-Mart version cast "Friends") gather in a cafe to listen to an American nightmare, a pirated radio show. A guy with a beard is a guest. This is the most exciting aspect of his show. Chandler, Monica, Joey and ... oh, wait, I think, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad single-skinned gang. reveals their greatest concern to the bearded DJ. Unknowing that the crazy nurse / serial killer is listening ... The crazy nurse then continues to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, I'm sorry again ... by their fears alive. These fears include stunts like "voodoo" that are caught by old ladies with dental prostheses. <br /> <br /> Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was ruined. Crazy crazy sister lacks motivation, is not it what makes the viewer "jump" ending with wounds and - again - voodoo? If you do not really care about your loved ones, we rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones - even a little bit - go to the local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmares" and hide them in your freezer.
