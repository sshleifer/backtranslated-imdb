This is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression. Writing Story It's about making movies. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable visual effects .. Very good action, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect. Except ... The story is just poor, so everything goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you have the power to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our crazy scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could not think of any other thing just to entertain and rape the women. This is all his "genius" what the mind thinks. Trying to get more power? No. He does not bother the research to come back to seeing. The guy is basically a sexual crazy maniac. <br /> <br /> Add a work atmosphere to that, you have all these young guys .. Throw around jokes as if they were in the bar .. If it was not all white coats and equipment, you think it's a bad imitation " Cheers". Very shallow and bad personalities and very little caution come to the fact that you think these guys are just lambs for the wolves of a hollow man. Even as a thriller, the film drops so briefly, because most of the "exciting" scenes are narrated so badly and are full of illogical behavior by actors who just yell "It's just a stupid thing to do to get a hollow man to find me and kill me. "<br /> <br /> If you read the current book while a scientist (Cane) goes for women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and a worrying thought that goes into its character. In the movie, Cane is just a sick man who walks on a crowded market to pull a woman out of his body and step on her. Just sad.
