- I had a plan to write something that would explain what I did not like about this movie, but that would be harder than I thought. Frankly, I do not remember much. I watched it just three days ago, and it had almost no impression on me. This is usually a sign of a real glowing. The only thing I remember was that most of it was extremely boring. The novelty that Humphrey Bogart looks like a detective has quickly vanished. It would be different if he could act, but he is a funny. Killing scenarios were amateurishly controlled and there was no tension before them. If you can not find the killer for five minutes into the movie, you have to see another euro horror. Casting is a deadly determination of the killer's identity.
