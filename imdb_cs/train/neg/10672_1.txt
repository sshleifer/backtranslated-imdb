She had all the clich√©s of films of this type and no substance. The plot did not get lost anywhere, and at the end of the movie I felt like a fool for watching. The production was good; scenario and acting were B-film quality. Casting was bad because there were good actors mixed with gossip actors. Good actors did not hold their own, nor did they lift the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. cartoons play in other movies. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for homeless entertainment, I would not answer this movie so far.
