Just a good movie about a woman who is twins with the distracting visions of her sister in danger at home. She then returns home to find out that everything is not good and that she will have to figure out what happened to her sister and why. This is such a thing that works almost, but does not mean, not quite. I can not really put a finger on why it does not work, but it was good enough that I wanted it to be better, or at least got little things right - like having girls playing twins in flashbacks to be closer in size. I think maybe it's not right, there are a lot of little things that are just wrong.
