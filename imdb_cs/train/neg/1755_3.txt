This film is not deprived of magic and also shows a bit of warmth, but in the end, this effort is too futile and too focused on leadership. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with her whole screen but takes too much attention from the rest of the cast. Another problem is overloading the clich√© script. A daughter who secretly leaves college, a senior woman is finding it difficult to get a good job (and first ends up with a somewhat degrading job), a dirty network manager with powerful toys, who looks like a glitz over the essence, a journalist who holds for him there are no real mistakes, that is, all are firmly rooted in reality, but there are too many in combination, leaving too much of us already and too little surprise.
