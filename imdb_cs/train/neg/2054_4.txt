Cold Blood was one of the 60s that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote created the phrase "novel for literature," which describes the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of this form was transferred to the film script he wrote. In spite of the fact that we entered the period of color film, Richard Brooks chose to present this film in black and white to highlight both the horror of the landscape and the stupidity of the story. This is the first problem with TV remake - the color changes the tone of the story. In addition, restricting film shooting to television reduces the possibilities of filming and focusing. As a result, we lose a dramatic clash that makes the second part of the original film (police talk, trial, imprisonment and execution) claustrophobic. On a small screen, it's just another version of laws and orders. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Scenario Search is continuously transmitted to films that have been successful at another age. It's usually an error, and that's no exception. <br /> <br /> All actors are competent. The script is fine. Management is not getting in the way. It's just that the film does not work just like an original precision instrument. It does not oblige the viewer to ambivalence towards Smith and Hickock, which raises the original film. At the end of the TV version, we are left feeling: "It buzzes him who cares about it?" <br /> <br /> First look at the original on the largest screen, then look at the TV version just to understand why the first was such an important film in 1967. It will not hurt also to go online and read a little about Capote and the original book. This will help you understand the extraordinary effort he has put into the material, as well as some discussions around the book and the film. Actually, I just gave it 4 because I saved the bottom 3 ratings for real bombs - those that make you angry that you were sucked into spending
