I simply can not understand why all these Cesusescu relics refuse to let go. One clearly sees how frustrated the censorship comic has forbidden them so many things that appear in their movies, and now they imagine how much artistic fartsy of freedom fills the screen with people who are excreted, urinating, vomiting, swearing and any other kind of abomination you can imagine. This is not a cinema, girlfriends and neighbors! It's just a visual reversal. Forget Bunuels Chien Andalou, David Lynch, Forman and Neorealism, and other filmmakers who have worked with aesthetics of ugliness. These people did their job - well, you did not! Make us a favor, all Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and the other obsolete old men and let us alone! Its a bit of time to see on screen some romance movies that are sufficient for your immature terribilisms! You are not the director, you are wrong!
