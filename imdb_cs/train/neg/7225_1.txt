I sat with this film and I must say that I only managed to keep my attention. The film would be a little more tolerable if I did not have to look at the terrible CGI for future reference to the industry if you are going to use CGI to track it so you know what to avoid. Obviously it should be a graphic novel for the screen, but everything I saw was a bad movie that is not related to the graphic novel. <br /> <br /> The whole story was not as bad as CGI, I was pretty impressed by acting and thought the casting was good and a little bit more information about the game would be nice because it's a little confusing for me sometimes occasionally but it's not surprising, as I said, that it just kept my attention, but in every sincere wish I gave him this mistake.
