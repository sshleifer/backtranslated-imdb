It must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 64 and a football fan. I expected to see a football movie. After about 10 minutes, I began to wonder how such a bad film (especially acting) could enter the theater. About halfway, I whispered to my husband that it was terrible, and he explained to me the facts behind the film. Even though I was a bit offended (and saw how someone could be very offended if they were not a Christian) in a cinema preaching, it was not such a deal. But it was a great matter to be subject to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of acting. It is a suitable film for a church expedition but to be exhibited in a church and not in a theater. Am I going to the church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I go to the movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Definitely not!!!
