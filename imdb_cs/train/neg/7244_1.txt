I wish I found my loans from this waste so I could give it to the House for the aging actors. Total waste! Five people watched this movie at the same time, and there was not only a laugh that could be heard, a lot of yawns. Paltrow is a beautiful woman and it was the best we look at all the so-called comedic film.
