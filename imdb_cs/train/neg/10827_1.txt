This ambitious film suffers the greatest delusions of the magnificence of the writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Highly derived from much better material (Altman's "Nashville", Lumet's "net"), this carving elephant takes too long to get anywhere. Several entanglement on the way (embarrassing music interlude, biblical epidemic) does not help. Nor is the level of performance unequal. Particularly Bad: William H. Macy, whose character and plot could easily be totally excluded; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing anxiety. And how many times do we have to see that John C. Reilly is "Sad" ("Chicago" and "Clocks") is enough? Tom Cruise looks good compared? his misogynist, the stubborn Holy Roller was quite fun. Speaking of dirty mouths, the script was so loaded with "F" bombs that they lost their impact in a moment. Do not even talk about a terrible soundtrack full of innocent and annoying singing from Aimee Mann. Her extended release, "One," the starting number that started with me, led me to distraction at the beginning of the film. I had to take care of the manuscript on the wall, and I saved three more hours until I was pushed to the brink of hell. One redeemed feature I have not seen in other reviews is the best performance in the game, unknown to Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, a damaged coke who wanted to defeat himself. Her credibility greatly surpassed everyone else. This movie was too much appreciated and simply did not know when to finish.
