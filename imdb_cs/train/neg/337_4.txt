Well, what to say. The golden child falls into the "so bad, it's good" category. Eddie Murphy has some funny (and sometimes quite unpleasant lines), but you still have fun. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as villain Sardo Numspa (what it was ***). Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD ... hmm ... but my best guess would be people who like embarrassing movies, and they can talk badly, bad plotting and even more embarrassing dialing. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
