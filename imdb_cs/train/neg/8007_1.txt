I really did not expect this type of movie outside of America. How can someone deal with sexually abusive children and turn them into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (who I once admired), who moved like a Rambo lifeboy, was unconscious and offended all children who are sexually abused around the world. What is twice depressing is that the stunning and ground-breaking film "Happiness" came out in the year before this film. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some comments from smarter viewers. They could see a bad and ridiculous handling of the subject. Those of you who think it's a great cinema show a disgusting amount of ignorance, and you have to look at "luck" to open your mind to the real horrors of pedophilia. Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold for sexual slavery or abused by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm ... I'm interested. If he is going to make a film about international child slavery of any kind, it owes everyone to become realistic and emotionally involved, instead of pushing bullshit. 1/10
