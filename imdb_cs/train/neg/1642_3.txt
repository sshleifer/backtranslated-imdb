In the months preceding the release of this movie, you saw it being promoted in all types of print media, so I patiently waited for its video release to see what all is humor. After the end, I had to apologize to my roommate for taking the video recorder for the last hour and a half to watch such a terrible movie. It basically fails, because it's a character-based film that involves relentless characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is Amanda Peet) you can not build any of them. The film relies on its dialogue, which is sophomoric, sad and raw. The only slightly funny character is Eric, whose rendition of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The final step that will help you laugh at the three main characters just instead raises the same resistance to Peet. All in all, just rent if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
