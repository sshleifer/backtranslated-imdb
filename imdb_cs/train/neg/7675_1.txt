Can we sometimes say that there are some films that have no redemption features at all? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After managing the dreadful House of the Dead, director Uwe Boll took his less talented eye to further adapt the video game. Do not get this guys? For everyone who does not understand, there is a chapter here for you: DO NOT USE VIDEO GAMES ON GOOD FILMS! The effects here are, at best, unusual. A set of designs and special effects are bad. Unlike a video game (which had scary moments), the film does not have the atmosphere of impending perdition, no sense of danger or threat. Pacing and rendering are confused and the paper on which the script is printed would be better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the favors and abilities of a monkey with a brush. Hackneyed magnification, swoops and pans are entangled in the whole business matter in unpredictable moments leaving the audience disoriented and bored. Why should this boy ever leave near the film in the first place must be one of the modern cinemas, the biggest secret. Avoid at all costs.
