I liked how it started, featuring some decent special effects especially for a 50 year old film. There was some pretty impressive scenery. However, the film began to move relatively soon, as men all try to flirt with Anna Francis "Altaiya Morbius.") When he saw it in the 1990s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again, the actress who has done most TV shows since then what this movie was released ... and still playing. It was also interesting to see young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams") who I would not recognize if it was not for this voice. the movie before boredom was almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. We owe them that they are making this VHS tape in stereo mode. but it was a weak effort. This is the overrated movie the "elite" thinks is so "heavy" and "provocative." That's bullshit. It looked "smart", because the rest of the science fiction movie of the 1950s was so stupid! Some would look great on a wide screen at the beginning of the scene, which I did not have the time to write. Maybe another look - this time for a 2.35: 1 widescreen transmission would change my review.
