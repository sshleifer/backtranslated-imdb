Believe it or not, "Woodcupper Massacre" gave me a full-fledged capuchin! That's right, I have my smoldering discharge just because a group of kids went with a camcorder and somehow agreed with the devil and got into the distribution. It is beyond my understanding of how someone with medium intelligence could tolerate this wearing of the film. The only reason I managed to do everything (not without a few suicide attempts on the way) was because I was first crazy with boredom and the other - I think I wanted to explore this newly discovered type of hate I was experiencing. .. This movie is "horror / comedy" "shot-to-video" about three siblings who are left for a weekend in the care of their bitchy older aunts. The youngest boy will end up with an accidental stabbing of the old lady with her hunting knife Rambo-replica. Then they get to divide their aunt with different instruments (apparently she did not have one drop of blood in her body!) And she picked it up in her father's leased chipper ... Her convicted son then stops searching for her mother and the children end up grinding that it's too. I do not recall that I have ever seen the cast of annoying actors who really made me sick. Sure, the voice of one blonde chick kept me hurt. All the actors were just ominous - literally just shouting their false audio dialogue and breaking the jokes that had to be written by a chimpanzee who did not care! Now I can usually appreciate self-effort, but only to those who can realize that people other than their relatives can follow it! I do not need to see the 3-minute shot of the car pulled out of the lane and the torturous, painful long-cut lawn that collapsed with some ridiculous and crazy music. Moreover, why does the box of this film have a piano on the neck? There was a piano on an ONE scene and no one was killed near him! I'm remembering this movie. If you do not like unbearable bullshits, I'd like to advise someone with half the brain to avoid this waste.
