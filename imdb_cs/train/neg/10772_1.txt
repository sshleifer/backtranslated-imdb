The saddest part is the fact that it's 87 minutes to never come back. I knew it was terrible of what was going on, with a guy dressed like a crazy Indian boss on the roof. (See if they can get in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is really on baseball, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Though he seemed to be doing well in part, I had to get angry when I heard all the unnecessary dirty tongues. Bad, bad film. It was a terrible fury for bad bears. Completely blatant and completely predictable. I do not mind a predictable movie if it's good, but it was not.
