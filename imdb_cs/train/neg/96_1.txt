Wait, I can! This movie is not meant for typical movie snaps if you do not want to remove your typical movie definitions, such as "Continuity editing" and "Geographical match." I could not say where I was in this movie. One second is in the present, the next minute they allegedly in the 1970s drove a modern SUV and wearing what looked like my 80th style of clothing. I think. I could not give her enough attention because the acting was terrible. I think it just got attention because it has 3D that I did not see. If you are a b-movie fan, and a b-movie I mean a BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's a home movie and any style that is not sensible will laugh you for as long as you stay awake. If you want more for Goddard and Antonioni, just skip this.
