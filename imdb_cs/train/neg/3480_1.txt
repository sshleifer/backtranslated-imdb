This movie is terrible. GRAPES. One of the worst movies ever. I can not even imagine that Gigli is worse than this. The samples tell us "NO," but then we look at something in the middle of the outdoors right now we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. It's an image and it can look good with explosions, but not even the type Bruce Willis got into "Die Hard". If he took off his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys, it would be a comedy. The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini again surrounds (unless it was for sopranos, will be flushed) as he did in "Mexican". Affleck pigs every scene and as others have said - no character has any motivation for their actions. <br /> <br /> KEEP THIS FILM ON ALL COSTS.
