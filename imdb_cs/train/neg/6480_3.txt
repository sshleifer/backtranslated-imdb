It was nice to see all the famous characters again, but the story was worrying me. We loved Ariel in the first film - so why is the other concentrating around her daughter? The new characters were uncomfortable and I did not like it. The worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop the overturning of classic movies with these dirty imitations.
