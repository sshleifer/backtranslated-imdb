Yes, the topic is a direct quote from the film and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored to the dead with this unnecessary effort. All flashes and others that do not make sense after the first 20 minutes are just bad movies. If you are epileptic, you should die at least five times. Of course, all fans of David Lynch would raise the flag of this type of turkey to become the "best film ever made" because it makes no sense and when it makes no sense, it must be art and art the film is always good. Right? I say wrong. This kind of artificial artistic grip is just a pathetic way to try to show you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins as an outstanding actor should stay.
