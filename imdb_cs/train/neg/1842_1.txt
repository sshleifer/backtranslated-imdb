This is my first IMDb movie review. After watching this movie I had to register. I can not afford with good conscience that this film is not scrutinized by me. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I like Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, he hated. There is a conspiracy, but who cares when there is no script. Dialogue is unreal and ordinary boring, situations are conceived, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are uncomfortable and uninteresting, and the story, even if it is based on a good assumption, is stupid. This movie is a bit poo. <br /> <br /> Do not forget that you are losing money on this movie, it does not even pay that your time spent watching. Please do not see it ... please!
