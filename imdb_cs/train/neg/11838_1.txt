If your entertainment idea looks at graphic shots of people who are being driven by cars (you can see a woman who walks under the front wheel is twisted when her vehicle passes before going under the rear wheel - and show it twice in case you are it for the first time they missed it), then it is a document for you. Best regards, I was not looking at this very worrying piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe it's even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for TV networks to start showing movies. Perhaps the demonstration of games based on self-harm can be nice. I already know that people are being disturbed in the world and doing terrible things. I do not need to see the evidence that television camouflage is fun.
