Frank Sinatra plays a former ex-soldier and frustrated writer of heavily living and hard drink who returns to his mid-western hometown and meets again with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now a big shot with an impartial wife and a hard daughter. Frank joins gambler Dean Martin, the uneducated flame of Shirley MacLaine, and has some interference with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. Overcome a simplified track that switches to a soap opera and plays MacLaine, which is exaggeratedly "colorful" and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunk belt on "After You Gone" is the pinnacle of the film and is professionally mastered). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees her directly but is surprisingly kind, and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The image looks incredibly handsome in a wide format, with a nice look at detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in spikes. ** z ****
