Hollywood's attempt to make Jack Jack London an adventure film "Jack London" is not a bad idea; certainly led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, wind flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has several London speeches; and it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive a "Calling Wilderness" after spending some good time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog "Buck". Virginia May and Susan Hayward are both very pretty. The film draws on the unfortunate "yellow dangers" of a parallel between London's life and World War II, both tense and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
