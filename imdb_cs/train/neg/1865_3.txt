Well, what can I say, there are B-type movies and there are B-type movies, and it definitely falls into the other. However, because it is obvious that film makers know it's not a credible movie (look at the final credits), it can be forgiven. The plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed. At random, his genetic material is mixed with an experimental acid that combines and loses in the snow. The killer now takes on the shape of a snowman - if you believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is behind the rural town of Sherif, who puts him behind the bars. Jack Frost eventually kills half the city. This film does not contain any real burns, and the effects of the film itself resemble B-Class films from the 1950s. It is, in itself, worthwhile to look at the laughter. A movie that will take your time.
