I myself am a big fan of horror films with a low 80s budget. This is not the worst, yet unreal. The land line is decent but too long. You are over half the movie before you even get to see some zombie action. Murders are not very creative, and zombies are not very skilful. I really think this movie would be better if the zombies were skipped and just got into a mafia. It's observable, but I feel that this movie stole at least an hour of my life. I'm going to give the film a little bit of originality. If you're really in horror movies B, it's worth browsing, but if you're not, you do not have to bother. But you do not have to talk about it.
