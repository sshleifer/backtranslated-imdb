I like British humor, I think it's one of the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (well ... maybe it is not Monthy Python, some jokes were great, but some of them did not understand.) But this League of Lords is good for you that you are wrong. This show was somewhat good; it helped me lose weight a little, because I was following this piece of waste to feel I was no longer hungry. It's really just a disgusting, sick and not fun TV show and I wonder who's actually laughing. I looked at it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting, looking at men dressed in a woman with yellow teeth and urinating on a car ... I mean ... what's so funny? It makes me rush. No humor, just a disturbing picture and cheap, lashes to laugh ... I do not know ... if you like it ... go into it ... look at it ... but to be honest people watched and enjoyed it must have some emotional problems. Garbage.
