Only designed to bother (or entertain) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the director intended to leave the title character, it would be all right, but I know there's no such thing as a Hollywood director who criticizes the American promarxist 60s, not a 1970s filmmaker. There are so many idiot dialogues that she sometimes wondered if I was actually seeing a comedy. Should not you have a mistake when you think it's satire? so a naive film appears. The universe was in my share of the left-wing films that lead me to the obvious, inevitable conclusion that the red-headed hick is one of those Hollywood liberal fools. But I think they are not all? Nice breasts, but with ** t for brains.
