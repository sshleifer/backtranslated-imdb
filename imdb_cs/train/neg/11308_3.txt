<br /> <br /> Get your brothers and enjoy this bad move. Speakman's considerable kempo skills (nice spin kicks, decent with sticks - bad couch!) It's the only redeemable quality of a movie that just shouts bad acting. This conspiracy is not absolutely bad; only hurriedly executed. But if you see this movie for anything other than martial arts, you miss the boat completely. And for a movie to be held in Koreatown, there are too few Korean actors (even extras).
