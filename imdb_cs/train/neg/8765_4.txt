I saw this movie with some Indian friends at Christmas. A quick summary of this film must be avoided. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did nothing of it. The film tells the story of Pakistan's attempt in 1999 to capture part of the Kashmir controversy from India. It is supposed that from this film you can mention the difficulty of the Indian Army in re-capturing the area from Pakistani troops - who occupy the highest position. But instead of telling what had to be a surprising and heroic story, this whole movie is doing, the Indian army looks ridiculous and stupid, which I know is not true. I watch this film almost entirely Indian audiences who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie but also found themselves laughing at scenes that were not considered fun. The script was absolutely silent. It made him feel that Mr. Dutta did not know anything about how the army was working and that it was using references to bad war films. The result is a script that is insignificant and repetitive. The effects of most directors were not stellar, but given the script, it is hard for me to criticize too much. As for the accompanying cast, it is enough to say that I hope they are amateurs. The cut was also bad. It was quite hard to see what was going on for a long time, and the music would suddenly end up with the changes of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Good things: Cinematography was pretty good, although it was a little wounded that the movie did not appear as a corrected color (the color balance differed significantly in the scenes). Also, some of the songs that were in the movie were pretty nice - at least the first half of a dozen verses. Unfortunately they went for much longer than they had. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess is four hours long. There is enough that a good editor could almost extort a good film from 1.5 to 2 hours of what was shot. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work on this movie.
