I should rate this movie as minus 10 but unfortunately it is not. <br /> <br /> Why did not I go in the first five minutes of this movie I can not say. I should go with my instinct and leave immediately! Several people in our theater did it and I did not follow them sadly. The story lacks all the criteria for the movie. NO plot. Wonderful acting! Even Robin Williams was so disappointed I might never see another movie he's in. No relationship in the story went beyond the talk. I liked the Tazer scene. It was a pity that there was no meat in the conspiracy. Someone needs a writer and director of this movie!
