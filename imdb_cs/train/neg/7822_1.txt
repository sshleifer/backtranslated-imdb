This movie is a very bad attempt to make money using a classic theme. I liked Superman movies, but it made me shoot myself. Very bad action, frightening special effects and conspiracy equal to zero. Summary: Superman leaves the ground because scientists have discovered pieces of their home planet, some were in the universe (duh), they say nothing to their girlfriend before they leave (duh again), take off in a spaceship (?!?), Comes back I think about 5 years later, and I look forward to seeing her friend again (who is now deflecting his son, whose son is in my humble opinion for at least seven years). And what about Lex Luthor? Is it trying to grow a new continent to sell land? Please! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 in 10 for this movie just because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have something to do with your time, you do not have to see this movie and even if you have nothing else to do, stay at home and watch TV!
