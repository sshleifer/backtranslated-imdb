This is the worst movie I've ever seen all my life. The story and the message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie that you can not keep up. I do not even know how this movie can get any nomination, let alone it be. Why: 1) Sam Lee portrays an angry / irrational detective that was caused by his father's disappointment. Pros: He's upset right. Disadvantages: As to the explanatory scene, he can not tell the sadness / disappointment he has in his father. The poster scene was too fake, and it literally pushes the tears from the corner of the eyes. 2) To attach a movie to a title, barking or a dog sounds during the game. combat scenes and a rape scenario, which is totally irrelevant and confusing for the viewer. I understand it's supposed to be a metaphor or not ... but it's just such stupidity! 3) WHY DOES NOT USE THE KILLER? What's wrong with this movie? When the killer began to stab the officer, SHOOT him. He's already dead! What the heck? There were plenty of opportunities for the killer to kill, but I do not know why it was not! 4) During the scene where the girl had injured her legs. On the scene, it was very clear that the LEFT leg of the girl was injured, so how the hell on the next scene that she borrows all her weight on her left leg? And the actress is nominated as the best new artist? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are turned off. <br /> <br /> 6) I guess this movie is trying to draw attention to the brutality and violence among children in Southeast Asia, so why does a bad guy win and then the policeman joined the fight? 7) This movie is just too violent without purpose. Will the police beat CI on the pulp and then, if they cooperate, give them marijuana and coke? This is the worst movie overall. I really think the person who wrote this movie is a sadistic and sick person. I've never seen a disgusting movie all my life. THE BEST MOVIE!
