Two sisters, their disgraced brother and their cousins ​​have trouble with the car. After that, Dr. Hackenstein is homecoming, who comfortably needs the parts of the body of the three young women who are used in the experiment to bring back their life back to their deceased lover. He tells them to help them in the morning to spend the night. Then a good doctor gets to work in this low-budget horror comedy. I found it funny, nothing at all that would actually go out of the way (I caught a look at Netflix and streamed it on the xbox 360), but I was better expecting it to be the movie won by Throma. Most of the humor does not work, but their parts are still some parts that made me smile. Plus later, great Anne Ramsey has a small part and she has always been very careful. <br /> <br /> Eye Sweep: Bambi Darro and Sylvia Lee Baker got topless <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
