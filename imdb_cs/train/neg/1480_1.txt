He took the boys from the inside! It is true ?! No one really wrote that it was like an improvisation that is terribly wrong. I think at all. This movie has to be spoof because of who would say they wrote differently. Can anyone imagine that the whole actor is sitting as a director, and the writers go from the script. The director says, "Next, our inbreed villain uses his 24-inch mache to clear our token of a terrible neighbor, he'll pull out the smells of his bunghole" <br /> <br /> "Brilliant!" <br /> <br /> No way to do that, no one writes it stupid! I have to be spoof. <br /> <br /> I love the part where the lean introspective gal defeats the rodent curl to death with a cast-iron puddle found on the floor of the cave. I was not sure whether the inbreeding cannibal species bothered much to cook. Perhaps it explains why a doll lay on the floor in the dark at the right time to kill the ruined ruins. It seems ironic that after the strange guy has packed martial arts porn stars and several tokens of the door type, he falls so easily into the pan alongside a brown, tiny, defenseless girl. What the hell is that this is Richard Greco's guy? Did he burn his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can someone explain the ending because I also did not get it? I can not quite understand why a pretty girl wanted to kill a funny lady who made her tea. It does not matter I do not want to know.
