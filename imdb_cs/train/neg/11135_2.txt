What more can I say? Negotiations were almost without exception amateurish. Management and continuity were pitiful. Sceenplay was predictable until the last scene and the dialogue was tiring. One of the features on the DVD was labeled "Gag Reel," but it could be a description of the viewer's reaction to most of the movie. One of the most amazing things was in the director's comments on the DVD. He said, with a straight face, that he had made a film of high productive value and name - and that he did. With such delusions it is easy to understand how the film appeared as it was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointed aspect was a monster. The darkly dressed suit was a modified monkey suit (according to the "making" feature on DVD) and somewhat looked. The mask and claws were a little better than the police tasks of any costume business. Cgi effects were painfully obvious and of similar quality to cheap video games.
