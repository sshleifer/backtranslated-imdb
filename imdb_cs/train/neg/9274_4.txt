This sequel is an overall screening of the first film. A totally insignificant film. In essence, he simply took every element from the first film and they wrote it again in Omen IV, except for the female antichrist this time. It ends just like the first one! The music is too busy and intrusive, and because it's almost a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable. It's not a terrible movie, it's not scary, there are much worse movies, it just did not make sense. Omen remake of 2006 is much worse, yet unnecessary than this, so I think it does. If anyone has shown a gun on your head and you have had to decide to follow this sequel or in 2006, I think I would have chosen it.
