In Sao Paulo, they have just entered the upper class Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel classes, and on the eve of the opening class they go to a drug and booze party. The next day, by classes, comes Cristiano's date at night and three men rape. The girl dies, panic and decides to get rid of her body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, surprises Gabriel, rotates the stairs and breaks her neck. The Trio decides to launch and burn the corpses in the garbage dump, but during the night there will be another tragedy. The polemic and shameful "Cama de Gato" is an overrated, demanding swan about the theft of youth, and is certainly the worst Brazilian film I've seen for many years. A nice, tragic and dark story is actually a comedy of bad taste in black humor. The script is not fun, with stupid lines and dialogues and boring, manipulative and silly shots with interviews with teenagers at the beginning and end. The game is terrible, seemingly with many improvisations, but no talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of the promising Caio Blata in this garbage. Camera, framing, cinematography and release are amateur and very low quality. The sound is terrible and in many parts it's impossible to understand what actresses and actresses are talking about (probably the plus, because this flick is upset). Gang bang is very realistic and is used to promote this average movie in a very poor marketing of sexual exploitation. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Bed of the Cat")
