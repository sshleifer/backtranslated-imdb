It's a bit weird movie because Santa Claus lives on a cloud in the universe and fights against Satan and his helpers ... but it's still fun. She has some real laughter. . whether they are all deliberate, is certainly questionable. This movie is not good, but I can say I really enjoyed watching. I would recommend this movie through "Santa Claus Martian Conquerors", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
