If I could give zero, I would change my mind and give it a -10. An absolutely horrible film without a film plot has no meaning what is going on. Just swimming. Do not forget this money. Please! This movie could be so good if it really portrayed the real story of the Zodiac killer, but the Nop, I felt nothing but resistance when I watched him. Make a favor and rent some classic movies instead, it's better to watch the movie you've seen as 3-4 times before you look at this crap! I do not understand why people are even bothered to shoot such movies when they know they will not do well. A zombie killer should be called "Boriac Killer" instead!
