These writings are about the end of the plot, so do not read it if you did not see this waste. I found this waste film in a horror section that was thinking that it would be horror. If I own a video store, I put it in the BORING section. This movie is such a waste that you will feel like you've lost socks. This film contains endless shots of people who drive as if it were scary. Well, I say I work and back (and sometimes to the shop or visit my cats) almost every day and believe me it's not scary. It starts with even 20 minutes of driving some people. Even the little kid does. He rounded around and never stopped. What is so scary when I look at a small child on a bicycle bike for an hour? I think nothing and if you look, you will not think too. The family in the car arrives at the big castle and they get a tour only to walk through the endless view of the kitchen. Then man walks about an hour trying to kill the family without reason. That's all that happens, and how you see it as waste.
