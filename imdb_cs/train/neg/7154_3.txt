This movie has all the honors too many cooks spoiling goulash. Based on the autobiography of Shilah Graham, it seems that the forces they are can not leave alone. They could not decide whether it would be Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and how much a soft pedal would have, whether it was a story that turned out to be. So the film, which could be the story of two fascinating personalities (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Mrs. Graham), becomes a horrible disparate soap opera, something that tells us something about it. Added to that there is absolutely no sense of the season other than for 1959. The clumsy scene follows a clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time we are going through. However - and that saved my film - Kerr never looked nice and Peck is like a very good man, as always. They really do a beautiful, mature couple and I wish they had better material with them. There is one scene that works - Scott goes after Shielhem in a drunken state and seeing these two normally refined stars knocking each other is very worrying and gives some flickering idea of ​​what is happening in a relationship like theirs. In addition, the film is an unnecessary opportunity and does not reach the classic characters of other Wald's soaps from 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, BEST OF EVERYTHING).
