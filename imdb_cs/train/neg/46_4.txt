I've been looking for this movie for ages because it's quite rare to find it because it was one of the movies. I finally found her on DVD at the end of last year, it's a very low budget movie Story is placed around the Amazon jungles of tribes living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model kidnapped by a gang of criminals while working in South America. They take her to the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native, who calls himself the "Devil" must go after all the unpleasant things until they are happy. Girls are Chained. The devil demonstrates the meal in a terrible way. Peter Weston is a devil hunter who goes to the jungle to try to save her,
