This film was to be a "lady man" who was ready and willing to settle once and for all. However, I did not care about his mission to settle because I did not care about his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women saw in them. He had absolutely no class or charisma. At least he had a way that made the ladies weak in their knees, except his saxophone, but without success. Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention what he did to get the attention of a married man he fell in love with in a five-minute recognition that she was totally disgusting and ridiculous. Does that man have any shame what? If he calmed down and stopped doing and saying stupid things, he would have been more appealing as a figure, but unfortunately his character was boring and boring. The character of Gin Gerson was unnecessarily British. Just as easily as her regular spokesperson with a regular spokesperson, she could easily as well as a poor British accent that sometimes fades from the film. The only two characters I cared about were fish and a frog. Now the two of you had chemistry! Academic nominations for both? STATE! Perforation of holes, lack of character development, terrible behavior, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a disorder of film.
