This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a little more than what Wayne did for Lone Star until then. One has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, who is a much better actor than the standard villain Lone Star, brings the professionalisation needed to the environment instead of the usual hesitant reading that often occurs in these respects. The plot, the mistaken identity, the robbery, and the murders, is just as justifiable and irreparable as you would expect it to be in the western part of the low budget of the 1930s, but Wayne is a nice look, cheerful charm and path with a line go a long way to make it more pleasant . Plump, bald Eddy Chandler is not quite as believable as Wayne's "female partner" and there's a jerk about something happening whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fight that furiously rises. On the other hand, Wayne's love interest plays no one but Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" of the early "Little Rascals" of glory. Today she is 20 years old, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne's directors in these Lone Star / Monograms "B" were fairly mild and colorless, but Mary is bright, cute and yes, sexy. There is a scene in the general store where she works, in which Wayne asks her to give him a bottle of "nerve tonic" that happens on the top shelf so she has to get the ladder and climb the shelves upstairs. Wayne plucks his little back as he descends the stairs, then again when he descends, and then again a few minutes later when he asks her to climb up and get another bottle is surprisingly unclear for the 1935 film. Wayne is not trying hide the fact that he definitely checks his ass. Anyway, this is an interesting little "B", not big but not as prone and random as many of its LoneStar productions. The final fighter does not hold on to it, and Chandler gets a little nervous after a while, but overall she's worth seeing, just to see the cute and sexy Mary Kornman.
