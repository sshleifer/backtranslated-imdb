I will be so short, because I know I do not have to say much. "Alive" is a weird little movie that apparently appeals to someone, but I found it shockingly loud almost at the very beginning. The film shot very little to make some of the characters look, and the story sometimes becomes so confused that I totally lost interest. As I said, I know the others liked it, but I found Kitamurova "Alive," that's something else - a chubby, extremely boring drama obstructed as a science-fiction action scenario. I felt like I was sucked in to watch this movie, based on its fascinating presumption and uber-exciting cover art. My proposal? Take it for a much more fun newcomer Kitamura "Versus" or his uprising in 2004 "Godzilla: Final Wars". And do not be angry with me, I'm always a good philosophical film, but it certainly was not. There was a time when I really cared about one event that takes place in this overly preached and dialogue heavy movie. If you want to talk ... talk about boredom.
