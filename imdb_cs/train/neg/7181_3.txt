do not be angry, I love Christmas movies. I love his beautiful life and I really enjoy the Christmas Carols version with George Scott and Alistair Sim. but this particular movie is terrible. I think that I love the song of life, which is more a Christmas present, is particularly painful. albert finney sings quite well in Annie. I do not know what's wrong with him in this movie, but it sounds like someone's been trying to sing through the mouths of the dead gerbils. the only thing that made this film for us was to turn off the sound and watch the dance numbers accompanied by the Christmas park Christmas park.
