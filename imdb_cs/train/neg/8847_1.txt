This soap opera in the US, "Knots Landing" has all the fun values ​​that are trapped in the elevator. Each episode included land such as rape, murder, kidnapping, and drug smuggling that did not differ much from the lands of other dramatic performances of the season. As for casting, I saw better actors on a grain box. From mid-end to the late nineties, U.K-Gold's replication of "knots" disappeared as a diaper diaper tops. I regret to say that I had to suffer because my mother was a huge fan of the show and watched it religiously. Although since then re-runes have been little and far between (we hope it will remain so). The only positive thing that can be said about "knots" is the catchy saxophone signature melody, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, "The Upper Hand". Great legacy, right?
