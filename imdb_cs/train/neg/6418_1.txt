Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of horror films. I have never seen them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... The only reason I was watching this movie was because my girlfriends and her friends wanted to look Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than ... a movie? Anyway, we did not expect it to be good ... in fact, we just went to laugh at it. Cool with me ... I have a problem with destroying the movie for other people in the theater, but because it was just the other couples they talk and do, it did not matter. After 15 minutes 2 other people who let themselves get involved in Borat, I would like to see this movie again. The film was not frightening and not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not scary as "Baby Genuises" terrible, it was terrible, like ... not at all fun. Avoid. Now I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a PG-13 horror that's boring and not scary or you can have a horror horror movie that's either too bloody or too disgusting for people. Do you want the PG-13 horror that's upset, but is it fun? See "The Grudge". Avoid this movie as an epidemic ... because it can literally be bored with you. <br /> <br /> 0/10
