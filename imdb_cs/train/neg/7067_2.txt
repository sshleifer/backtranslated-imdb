Five bus passengers tell each other their dreadful dreams and wait for them to be picked up. But there are more of these nightmares than those that meet the eye? <br /> <br /> Happy, five bad movies at the price of one!

I swear, you will sit there as if I were, bored of tears waiting in vain to make something interesting happen. Do not bother. It is never. In fact, I even stopped the fast-forwarding of ads because they were much more fun than the main ones. And the end is the ultimate exclusion. Yeah, none of this ever happened. If you could just say that I set up my VCR to record these cobblers .. 2/10
