(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure what Dreamworks thought when they decided to lose $ 80 million down on this very tired and lame animated movie. Probably they thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring viewers (mostly families) to see them in the swings. He seemed to be working for the opening weekend, making about $ 26 million, and about $ 38.1 million. total (estimate for this weekend). But I think the audience that came over the weekend saw almost the same thing I did when I saw it and spread the word. This is one of the main movies, except the animation of everything else, mostly the script seems to be made at the age of three. The film is only about 80 minutes. long, but it's like a three-hour epic. There are a few points for me, but it is also an irritating narrative that is so obviously written. At one point, he escapes some kidnappers, and when you see the horse seemingly scared, he discovers the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) to clear any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest of minds). Another is the constant popping of Bryan Adams, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but he continues Dreamworks really thinks the audience will be able to handle 8-9 of his songs in such a short film, I certainly could not. Finally and here is the spoiler, the horse shot by a calvary member at a point blank, she (the horse) then falls into a furious river, the Spirit (the focus of the film) trying to save her but they both pass through a waterfall that must have at least 50 feet, and later the film at the end we see that this horse is alive and well. I know it's a kid's movie, but even a small amount of realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, it's really lame that I know, I'm not saying kids will not like it, but someone else will check their watches just waiting for this horse to end. Definitely on my 10 worst list this year. - ** from 4 stars. <br /> <br />
