The only thing that prevented this movement from becoming a complete disaster was a few interesting stylish touches. <br /> <br /> (The modern spoiler warning) The comic's death is a bit derived from the scene in the Twilight Zone: A film that carries a death caricature. It was still manageable, especially in terms of ink bleeding and color exhaustion. In addition, there is one good scene with a demon motor. When he said it, I was glad I got a DVD cheap in a store that was out of business because it was pretty awful. I bought Soul Survivors at the same time and both movies were just as uncomfortable with the constant realization that you were watching the dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to redeem, or it makes any sense, it has at least a few stylish notes, listed above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD lets you go to 8 "nightmares" where something really happens, which is the only way to watch it. Scripting between the gore's creative moments is rather unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
