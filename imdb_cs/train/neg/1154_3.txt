May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) pay an apparently rare visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. When the visit begins, Toots suffers from a deadly heart attack, leaving May reluctant to question her life and her future. In search of a friend to Darren's girlfriend (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences. Beautifully shot, but for all her announced realism and recognition, Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, balanced repellent characters and asks the viewer to collaborate with them. Reid shines in May, and it's her skill and commitment as a beautifully underestimated actor to save the film from a totally depressing mud, but Michell and Kureishi allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such an unpleasant figure, difficult to care for what will happen in May. As it is written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so selfish and chilly that one begins to ask exactly what Kureishi is trying to say. They are either unwilling or unable to lift Bobby and Paul over two-dimensional in their terrible selfishness. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing Reid's performance, but nothing else. Shame Shame ...
