Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in cosmic girls' costumes. I love 50 scifi, even loving the 50s, but this movie is really really bad. And not in the MST3K a bit. <br /> <br /> Practically unacceptable as a pair of bozos to make their best "hip cat" impression of Abott & Costello. Chessecake can usually save scifi cheese, for example in the category "Cats on the Moon", but in this case it can not. This movie requires a mute button and fast forward. <br /> <br /> This means I could watch Gloria and Dolores walk around the spaceship for about an hour or so.
