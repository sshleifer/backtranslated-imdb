It's really bad. The only half-quality redemption is the effects of thousands of beads used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. The game is terrible, except for Kirk. The story is just as silly as the gall and the belief that the movie is a video game itself is killing a movie if it was not a corpse anymore. So in all it's a waste of your life. I would give it zero if it was a chance on a rating scale.
