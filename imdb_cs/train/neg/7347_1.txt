No spoilers, but I've been a fan since Waking the Dead, but the last series, of which only three are so far, is terrible. Stories have no similarity to the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last series of jaws that looked ridiculously absurd. As a BBC licensee after the show, I heard BBC complaints to hand me over to my disappointment. I'm overwhelmed that Calorie actors Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone have no objection to the story. These actors have been with these characters for 8 periods, unhappy that they see it is lost in all directions. It's a good job, it's the last series or another series can start with a team that investigates the death of Father Christmas! Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
