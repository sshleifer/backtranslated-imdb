The game was not great, the story was full of simplified turns and transparent characters. These are the consequences of the struggle between the right-wing Flemish block voters on the one hand and the people of Morocco living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is it a political analysis? Is it a kind of Belgian West Side Story or a modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is simply not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming that they were also questions from the director). However, some scenes may work as a kind of Ken Loach, located in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point for an extremist, right-wing Flemish block party and struggles with a lot of problems and tensions between different groups of people and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, and unfortunately this is not a success. Still, it tells the story of a very real and complicated situation in today's Belgium. Several foreign spectators who are watching should try to enjoy it and realize that it is not an important film, but the social dividing lines that experienced it in Belgium, ten million people, in 2000 Dries Van Dongen
