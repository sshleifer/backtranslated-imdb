Was it the biggest movie I've ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four, it's nice to look at something that was light and fun. It was great, but it was cute. I think it definitely had some room for improvement, but it did. I'm not sure if this film deserves the extreme level of abuse from the second reviewer. Obviously, he does not like Eva Longoriai. I think it's better than The Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. Actors play a big part in whether it's a hit or a flop. Perhaps the cast did not work. There may have been too many things. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to talk about the average movie, not the awful. It could be just a cat. Somehow like a Split-Up movie or a French kiss. My husband is still talking about those. :)
