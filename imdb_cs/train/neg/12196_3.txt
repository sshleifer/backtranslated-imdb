The actors played a really good job, especially the mother. However, as the film progressed, I found out that I was looking at it more, not because I cared least about it. And sometimes I felt irritably irresponsible, and my hands were accessible to parenthood, which was showing up again and again. The daughter is a 17-year-old shallow skank, whose main goal in life is the obsession of famous men and become a dance nyfhette (complemented by a bunch of "prey frisk"). The son is a low self-respecting guy who seems to be very desperate for his relationship and friends - so much that he throws a drug party late in the movie. Husband and wife are both bored, but rather than bringing energy to their outdated relationship, they would rather find new partners (though a woman catches badly because a man who "throws himself" becomes homosexual - OOPS!). I just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and hard to care for such shallow mourning. I think that the attempt of the author was to prove the total banality and disobedience of the capitalist system. However, since these characters are NOT typical of the average Western family, it seems to be irrelevant.
