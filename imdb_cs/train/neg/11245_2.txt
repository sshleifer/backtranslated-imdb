In 2004 I entered the theater at Sky Captain, who expects a good movie. Almost every review of this movie was positive, the effects looked tempting, the insights convincing. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, disappointment does not actually describe the feeling I got from this movie. It was furious. In addition to being boring and misspelled, the reason why this movie gets 2 out of 10 stars is that everything in the movie has been stolen from another source. I understand the difference between honor and theft: it was theft. Even more importantly, it seems that the creators did not steal their progress or move. They just stole to show they can. Literally, it does not make sense to show the Wizard from Oz in the theater at the beginning of the movie, in addition to creating another scene that we will not process, which steals from this movie. No need to say that every concept in the movie was neither an original nor even a rotating idea of ​​the old concept: it was literally just a rehash of something I've seen, pulp robots that resemble Superman's old cats and the recent movie "The Iron Giant ", a silent warrior who has been used in countless films, most known in recent years as Darth Maul in" Star Wars: The Phantom Menace ". <br /> <br /> The subject of the real movie was most of the performance entirely wooden. Maybe this is because the whole movie was made on a blue screen, computer slides filled everything that saved the actors. Frankly, this is not an excuse for bad acting. If someone ever was a child, they understand that the lack of a visual link is not a justification for not attempting. <br /> <br /> Finally there is no humanity in this movie. The protagonists are the only real people here. Almost all antagonists are robots and the number of friendly characters that are displayed during the movie can be counted on one side. If robots are attacking the entire planet, should we not expect them to see humanity from them? The performance of our main characters prevents us from joining something that's here. <br /> <br /> The film was not the worst film and I did not give it to him. 1 The film was rather an example of everything that is wrong with modern action films: filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects but without the artistic view or originality of any kind, it becomes flat.
