Anyone who gets acquainted with my reviews in a movie database on the Internet will know that I can be an unfortunate bastard from time to time. There are a lot of films that I do not like and which, for some incomprehensible reason, I felt the need to rethink. However, if one of us is curious to know the name of the worst film I've ever seen, do not look more than Transylvania 6-5000. It is unquestionably the title of "All Day 1 horrible film I can not believe I actually did this from the beginning of this clunker to the finish!" It is clear that it captures the taste of the young Frankenstein Mel Brooks but where the film was entertaining about horror movie traditions , Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are ashamed of being journalists in modern Transylvania (perhaps they soon realized they were doomed in this duel). of their research appear against all the main monsters of past horror favorites, such as vampires, werewolves, and mummies, and anyone who can carry this film to the end can pray, go over their hearts to relieve them of the boredom of agony. a career of the nadir for all involved and proves that when a comedy fails a great way, it results in terrifically amazing fun.
