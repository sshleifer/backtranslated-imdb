I have to admit that her dead body was not as bad as I expected, my mom wanted to see it, so I rented it. I thought I was just going to show the horror of my eyes, but it was not bad. I just waited for this terrible movie, but it seems that the writers did not mean any harm, but casting Eva Longoria (Parker, I apologize) seems to be very little for the film. I think I could have been a little better without her, just annoying me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat pleasant. But you have to admit that this movie does not make sense, it was one of those quick winning odds. The film could be more fun if someone really paid attention and had a better cast. Henry just lost his bride, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on a wedding day. But when his sister leads him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls to her, but Kate is following her behind the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so fast, and she'll make sure Ashley does not get him to hurt him day and night with her obstacles, believe me, with Kate's voice, that's scary. <br /> <br /> Despite her dead body is a movie, I'm not sure if it's worth the money, but I'd give it a rent if you want to see it or you're curious. Eva Longoria just does not have enough starry power to make the film work without breaking those who love it, but it just belongs to a small screen over the silver screen. Not to mention the status of Ashley, she seems to be still not very sympathetic to everything she pulls out, or her "gay" girlfriend, Dan, again, not really sympathetic. Only with some rewriting and proper attention could this movie be better, but instead we get an average predictable, romantic comedy that will have an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
