I'm so confused. What was this movie in the world? What was the murderer's motivation? He seemed to be angry enough, but I still did not think why. Nothing in this movie makes sense. She had a zero depth. Or the depth less than zero. Which I think would mean it would be a hill. Or a pile. From the bullshit. The game was terrible. When I was looking for a few actors in this movie, they had very few things I heard, and that was not a surprise. I can not decide whether they will be sorry for being embarrassed in this bad movie, or think they should never be offered any more acting work. Begins . . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Indeed, you do not waste your time. There is so little there is nothing that can only be entertained. It was undoubtedly one of the worst slashers - NO, one of the worst movies of any kind that I ever had an unfortunate watch and I saw a couple.
