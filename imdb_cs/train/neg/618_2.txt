Maybe one of the worst teens I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad points of the movie that pretty much hides the whole movie. First of all, something nobody can avoid: TERRIBLE ACTING. I swear they picked up some random children out of the street, as they looked. Secondly, BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You barely know half the children who killed you. The only thing you think is that it deserves one or the other. The character of the scarecrow was exaggerated and cheap to tear away from other great killers like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOGUE: The scoundrel was filled with terrible disposable inserts that would make you laugh just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find some small animals for torture!" you really will leave your eyebrows. Last but not least: Another opportunity: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? Like 30? The back of his head ached for God. There's a lot more to say about this movie, like cheap special effects, it's an effort to "high school movie class", but it's understandable. It's a bad film shooting in the worst. Regarding what I found in the film as "good": -Support for those with low, low, LOW standards - It would help to sleep insomnia. Very cheap laughter or even giggle.
