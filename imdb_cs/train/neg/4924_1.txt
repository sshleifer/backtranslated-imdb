This movie is really bad. Maybe it's rough, but it is. It really is. A bad script, every vampire clich√© in a book is used, and it does not concern itself at all with the condolence of the main character ... ie, Dracula. In the past, there have been really brilliant Dracula / Vampire movies, but it does not even make it to a "terrible" slot. Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of the teen-slasher movement, add the crumb of Dracula Lore and mix in the heatically toned religious / surreal day-dreaming ... and get the confusing mess of the movie - Dracula 2000. I really can not find any good things that could say about this movie, as if it was not bad enough that it was done first, it seems that Johnny Lee Miller did the English accent effect ... What the problem with that I hear you cry .. Well, he's English, but it sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. Overall, you can also tell your money (if you're thinking about buying) or rent it, watch and discover for yourself why it's as scary as Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
