I stupidly read the back cover of this Best Buy film a year ago and I said, "It seems funny, plus Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose it?" I started paying $ 15.99 plus tax for it. I took her to the house of friends and we were both horrified at how badly it was written and acted. The wooden performance is great. All the "cheerful" and "excellent" performances she promised never seemed. After 90 minutes, I was in a shame to hang my head because I knew I could not even make it for 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I literally screamed, because if it were what could be considered a "comedy", I did not want to believe in the movies anymore. My friend kept telling his friend about the horror of this film to the extent that he needed to see them just to understand how bad he was. During the summer season I watched him because he did not want to watch it alone. That was another terrible mistake, because when I watched I was just angry. I started screaming at the film, and I'm not the one who talks to the movies. Everyone who knows they even saw this movie agreed on their worst of what they've ever seen. My sense of humor is bad and twisted and often offends my friends, but it could not save this movie either. The fact that this movie is not on IMDb's list 100 is overwhelming. The fact that his rating (at this writing time) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
