Deep SH .. is much more! Eels are just films captured in the movie. Think that "the incredible Mr. Limpet" meets the "Leviathan". Very labile. <br /> <br /> No character or relationship development. The so-called "romantic" scenes are very furious and predictable. An interesting idea, but a badly written script and the special effects of LOUSY makes it definitely must-miss!
