I thought it was really a terrible movie - I found out she was actually shouting on my television several times. One or both homosexual men were miscast; there was no chemistry between them, and Richard Ruccolo looked as if he was kissing the dog. The film covers their long and tortured lessons, emphasizing each farewell and make-up, but has not developed the rationale between these details. These reasons would be for some interesting characters, not a fight or a make-up scene in bed (chrome, even if you like the movie). Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but it does not mean the movie is worth the rent. Save money.
