The film begins with a voice that tells the audience where they are, and who their characters are. And that's the moment I started to miss the movie. With all the endless possibilities that each film director has in my hands, I really think it is a very simple and cheap solution that would express the situation in a voice that said everything. I really believe voice voices are betrayal of the concept of film making. I hate hearing a voice when I say where we are, which day we are, and especially what the characters feel and think. I believe that the director has to find a visual way to transfer feelings and thoughts to the characters of the audience. <br /> <br /> But after a bad intro introduction, a very striking film begins, which takes quite a while. The life of the middle class family and all members individually are rendered in a perfectly realistic way. I think the director has the talent to capture real-life situations. For example, a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom may at first seem unusual, but life itself leads us to situations that may seem abnormal but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer of real life. But that's it. After a while, realism in the film begins to sacrifice a story. I really felt I had a great headache due to non-stop talking characters. It was as if actors and actresses got to the topic and were allowed to improvise dialogues. It's really realistic, but the characters always ask "really, it's so", etc. To each other or characters that say "no" or "you listen to me" ten times when it says only once, headaches. I also think that playing exercises and reading book scenarios are more than they should be. I understand the game and the book in the movie are related, but I think the director missed a place where he should stop showing these scenes.
