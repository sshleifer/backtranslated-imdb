I watched a mask in the 1980s and is currently showing at Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember that I thought it was okay and that I had a few toys, but now I was watching the tears scare me. I never realized how tedious and insignificant this cartoon really was. It's just terrible! It's not a place where they are almost in the same league as Transformers, He-man or Thundercats, and they almost forgot almost everyone when they stop being produced. I see it only on Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 comes just after it (that's when the mask does not get me to sleep first). One of the 80s cartoons I hope to completely forget when it finishes broadcasting on Fox Kids!
