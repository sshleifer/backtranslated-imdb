Hammerhead is a combination of a mad scientist and shark shark films. In a cast of casting type, Jeffrey Combs plays the above-mentioned crazy scientist who develops a human shark / hammer. Bizarrely, this creature is in fact his son, who has turned into this monster to prevent his cancer from dying. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of friends is invited to a private island of scientists. They are ultimately used as a shark bait or shark. For some unknown reason, he led IT as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, it turns out to be a resourceful, somewhat overweight, Ramboesque tomb. I'm working on the assumption that he has learned to handle the assault rifle as part of his daily job working in 1st line support. A normal day for IT may mean repairing someone's network connection followed by a call to arms. Or, calls to repair someone's PC must be scheduled between physical confrontations with terrestrial hybrids of sharks? Anyway, it's amazing and saves all day. She's even a girl. The shark-man is a bit chaotic creature, but OK, I think, judging by the effects generally in this movie. And the movie moves at a decent pace. It's a complete hokum, of course, but if you buy a Hammerhead movie and you expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a person who has turned into a terrestrial killer fish, you really do not have anyone blaming themselves, . As it is, there are guns, ghosts, girls, and maybe even an exploding helicopter. It's rubbish, but not as bad as anyone could say.
