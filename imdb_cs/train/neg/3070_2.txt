Oh, dear sir ... They turned what was a rather well-thought film into a fake testosterone festival. The original version of this movie in 1971 was beautifully unclear about our hero Kowalski. He was a man who was trying to leave Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life at the price of a handful of uppers? We are not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had a couple of glimpses that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline addict and probably guided his whole life, which he was trying to move into disappearing. You will see the point in the distance, where the left and right legs of the road link together and the path itself disappears. He lives only to be free, and means that nobody is sick. Several times we saw when the accidents occurred, and stopped to make sure the second driver was okay before he could go on, even the police pursuing him. When he saw the vanity of his search, he took his life rather than arrest and live life in captivity. He died as if he lived, ran openly. In remake, Kowalski has a whole history (including a baptismal name, even). He tries to get to a hospital where his wife suffers from the complications of her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband and an excited expectant father. He comes to decide to take his life after he has heard that his wife has died in childbirth, but he even leaves when he suggests he might have jumped out of the car before he hit the bulldozers. They even gave part of the "super soul," the blind DJ (famously portrayed by Clevone Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?! ?? Give me a break.
