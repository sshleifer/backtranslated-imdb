Do not make any bones about it. There are a lot of things wrong in the movie. It's a cliché all the way, not very fun, predictable and illogical. Start at the beginning: characters. He is a boring, blameless guy - he gives Stiller another notch in his boring, unhappy band - supposedly wild but in fact just quite normal, loving interest - which Aniston plays well but really does not need any effort to do - fat, a Jewish friend and then a cliché assortment: an irrational arational clever person, a certain Spanish guy, etc. The story: the beginning is a bit unusual, but then goes into the standard of any movie style, each conspiracy changes as predictable to your average joke. The biggest problem was that the development of "Stiller's character" really looks like it comes from nothing - like the average school game, the writers knew where it started and where it ended but did not get enough stock in the right story in the middle. Finally, the alleged "jokes" were nothing but highly scattered versions of standard gross humor; there was a regulation of the chunder scene, sweaty thick men, etc. In conclusion, the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word "shart" was the only good thing. Hamburg actually drank a canine dinner, and Stiller and Aniston's sugar coating may have attracted audiences, but the taste in the end was equally stunned. it was terrible, but Aniston still chose better among Friends-period movies than Kudrow devoted to 'Mark X.'
