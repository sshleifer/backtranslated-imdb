What do you say horror story without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing about the movie: I feel that writers have never really decided what really happens in the movie! It's something else you know, you give advice to the audience and you do not quite find it, but here you have the feeling that the screenwriters do not know, the characters in the movie do not know and the audience sees no one knows! <br /> <br /> I burned a lot of 80 horror / gore films and this film has its roots deep in these films. But many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. They still repeat the empty lines again and again. The story does not really work - it's never going anywhere. B-acting is fine in this type of horror movie, but it's not much in the script. We do not care about our attitudes. There is nothing they can remember about them. There is no sweet humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no excitement, no fever. You will only get some commonly used elements of the horror movie genre. They show Lord monsters one by one, but their characters really do not contribute anything to the story. I am sincerely convinced that this amount of story, the development of character and atmosphere could be achieved with the minimum amount of crew and equipment. Yeah yeah, movie makers did it - and even more - 20 years ago! I felt the public's embarrassment when the film ended. That's really bad.
