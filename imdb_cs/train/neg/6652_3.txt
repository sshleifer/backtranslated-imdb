It was a strange film about low life in New York and focused around the main character (the title of the title by Brad Pitt), who thinks he is a Ricky Nelson musician, except that he has no real talent. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch until the unfortunate hardcore woman in New York has a terrible accent and takes over her. The movie destroyed me for me. It must be Catherine Keener, who usually plays harsh women who are sorry. <br /> <br /> The amazing hairstyle of Pitt - the exhausted Pompadour - was fun. I can imagine Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note: It's no wonder you hear a 1992 movie (other than Woody Allen's) with mono sound.
