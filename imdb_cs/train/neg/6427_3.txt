so I noticed that this document is weird and really useless. I know she received awards and things, but I personally did not use it much. there was no humor or drama to interest you, just a lot of wierdos and their work. some of the people are somewhat different, which is not a bad thing, it just did not leave a good impression on me. I was boring with this film, without the insult of my creative writing teacher. the theme of the circus throughout the movie was a bit cool, but I did not do it, and robotics and the lion's bloodshed are definitely not my stuff. the green animals were clean, I really liked the garden of lots of colorful flowers, but how did these four work merge? it just did not make sense to me why someone would make a movie about it. But if you are on such things, you can enjoy it. who I am to stand in the way. I'm only warning you of possible misery.
