I'm impressed by the positive reviews of this deeply inspiring movie. I often skip reviews with foreign films that complain about the slow pace and the seeming "absence of action," as many of the best international films live up to the film storytelling model in West Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I love the arts and the lack of clich√©s on the foreign film scene. I love that many strange films do not balance things in a clean, tasty little bow. <br /> <br /> This means that this particular movie has not offered any buy-out value for the time I am unnecessarily watching. No meaningful personality development, no intriguing story, no way to engage emotionally in any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Lots of emotionally immature troubled colonnies are badly treated by slaves and a little girl hurts her only girlfriend when the "home boy" finally gets out of his mouth and abuses her. <br /> <br /> While the above paragraph is sad and dramatic, this movie will make you bored while playing the script. I was so impartial that it took three meetings, and I would not even do it unless it was a positive assessment. <br /> <br /> If you do not have academic interest in the period, I strongly recommend that this is not the case.
