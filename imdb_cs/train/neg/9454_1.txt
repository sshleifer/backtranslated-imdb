When my own child asks me to leave the introductory introduction of this film, I know it's bad. I wanted to raise my eyes. I wanted to get through the screen and hit Mike Myers to sacrifice the last dignity he had. This is one of the few movies I've ever watched in my life, and I immediately wanted "inadvertently" if that was possible. The other films are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", which are better than this hat in the hat. I could have drunk tonight sleeping in a vain attempt to forget that I had ever witnessed this blasphemy of the good name Seuss. <br /> <br /> I tell Mike Myers that you hold Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because he worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
