This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlin's finest. The story is quite routine, but the atmosphere is what really gives life; in fact, the story of ghosts is almost imaginative. The real horror comes from the prison itself, and Renny H. does not provide any details that show us how bad conditions are inside the disintegrating old hellhole attacked by a rat (with a sadistic guard!) Viggo Mortensen is an excellent custom in the lead role, supported by some very authentic prisoners (there are no nice guys in this cast.) Horror fans should check this message.
