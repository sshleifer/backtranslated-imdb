OK, as everyone has emphasized, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, it was because it was a horrible sexploitation film that had a lot of material cut (or darkened near invisibility) to escape the censorship rating of X; but the film has many other shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First, the writer seems to have his werewolves and vampires mixed up. The bad guys in this movie are hairy and do not like silver, but they behave like vampires in every respect. Now you just can not do it with a miserable genre, you have to adhere to the rules of this genre or the fans get all confused and upset by suspending infidelity in the wrong thing. In fact, the whole (dumb and badly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but it does not make any sense in a werewolf film. Secondly, werewolf costumes are the deadliest ones you've ever seen. Anyone dealing with werewolf films should know that werewolves costumes and transformations are something the fans rated critically, but some of these werewolves are simply goofy. There are a couple of good bits. Actually, I really like the score. Others mentioned Sybil Danning's breasts. A ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing may exist) <br /> <br /> I also liked the plan to attack the werewolf fortress. There are so many horror films that rely on stupid characters but in this case they first get a very reasonable and effective anti-wolf arsenal and kill the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver balls, and today we have pretty strong firearms. It should not be too hard to put together two or two, huh? But in a typical style, this film moves over the top and adds extra zany and fun anti-lycantrope weapons.
