I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get blues if this movie is anything. I expected something better from Uma Thurman, which was the reason why I had this experience in the first place. An amazing film that only has music as a redemption. It's just a shame we could not provide 0 out of 10 points in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
