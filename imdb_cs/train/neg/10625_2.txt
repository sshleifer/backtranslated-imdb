I am the 11th year of my high school. In his class of Current World Affairs, this video boy was in my class and suggested that we look at him. So we did. I'm firmly convinced that we went to the moon because my dad is working for NASA. Even though I think this movie is the biggest piece I've ever watched, the guy who created it has some serious balls. Did he first have to show that JFK was shot? And how dare to use all those biblical quotes. The only good thing about this movie is that this is a debate, which is good in my class b / c, we have weekly debates. This movie did not change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. Michael Moore's next movie could be called "Funny Thing Happened on Spetember 11." or "The funny thing happened on the way to the white house".
