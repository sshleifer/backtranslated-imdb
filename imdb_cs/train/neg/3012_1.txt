The film opens with a long, single-lane shot at factory-filled workers. We, what have we done, a planet you might think. I hope we look at it. <br /> <br /> This is very rare. If you do not look at the horribly angled narrator's angle in the lecture hall, you watch him set his camera and shoot at different places. It would be nice if he chose areas that fit his theme, but not. So you will hear some more narration, watch a few pictures and see how it sets the camera. Why not use a camcorder to view more landscapes? It really kills any sense of motion and the colors of that guy as a futile jerk. I could read the tips on how someone set up their camera, fast forward in this whole movie and waste much less time.
