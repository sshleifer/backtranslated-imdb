I wanted the whole movie through this movie. First, the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has attempted to create some comedy movie going through cars. Imagine that "Englebert sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Do not take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name of Parsons in the name and theft of his body is being used as a springboard for a low budget movie, a reluctant attempt to catch a few bucks from Parsons link and his fan base. Gram's father was long dead in 1973, the other global figures are fictitious, none of them have anything to do with Grams' life or death. If you are a fan of Gramma, I advise you to watch this movie. I wish I did not. It is sad to see something special to consider such a disgusting feed. I'd swear he'd heard Gram filming in the tomb during filming. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and reference, you do not have to consider anything in this film as Gram's representative. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about this movie. If Gram was alive and saw the movie, he would be killed. And then he might be afraid if he knew this movie would be the result.
