**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely no doubt one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. It is absolutely impossible to take it seriously. It will require a great novel that includes a list of all comedic routines. During the famous days of her program, Carol Burnett and the company that often chooses to make movies deceived this in a way that was hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly got worse with a gentle cough, and spooky music immediately appeared and everyone looked around and wondered where it came from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost looked like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing that is more fun than this bit is a real movie. Jenny really seems to die right ... she dies to make her make-up artist come and give her a little color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage their loved ones to get in bed with him during the patient's final moments. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal, sitting on a bench in the snow that reflects on his future in the movie, is an instant classic. He had a lot of worries. He never recovered.
