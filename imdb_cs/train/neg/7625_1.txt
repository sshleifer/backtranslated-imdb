This is your only spoiler warning. What is the sad state of our film when an unprofessional junk e-mail as such is considered to be "Oscar Worthy". I divide the material into three levels. The first is a theater theater. Here, the viewer stagnates and the power lies in the presentation of the actor, and most importantly, in the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter, because he knows how to make words better. The best dramatists know how to create images that the infertile scene can not show. <br /> <br /> The second level is a movie. In this medium, a weaker writer may be used, but the viewer is not sitting at one point all the time. With the film, the context can have, in addition to strong writing, the properties of visual poetry and meaning. In addition, the film can handle elements such as sound and color that are almost unreal. <br /> <br /> The final level is literature. In this context, everything that the authors present translates into paper and then reads the reader again. Far more detail can go into the novel than it is possible for a movie studio. <br /> <br /> This is why customization can increase but never decrease. Novelizations are never better than basic movies (see Dime-dozen at the local bookstore), while the movie can not transmit the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Movies can be seldom transferred to games and always played in movies. <br /> <br /> As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails. It's a movie that should be on the stage, because the director is too stupid to shoot something right. The characters speak the same thing and act the same, it is pure vanity. Add an unpleasant soundtrack and you have a totally outrageous movie. I saw it in my classroom of a dramatic high school with about 20 other pupils. The instructor shouted how sad the movie was. What is sad that such stagnant work is considered depressive when the material itself is cheerful. If it were the color scenes of impotence, party parties and old head would be considered a great comedy. See what Lucas did with American graffiti a few years later. The American secondary education system has to start learning ABOUT the film, rather than trying to teach the film. Two visually powerful descending movies: Apokalypsa Now and Barry Lyndon. Rely on them, not on it. It's the last thing I want to see. 1 out of 5.
