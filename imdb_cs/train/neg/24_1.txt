I have to congratulate the genius who approved this. Edward Furlong, you are not as good as you think you are a friend, you can not grab every piece of cheap amateur crap that only needs to get some money. is bad and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result or better. Negotiations, let's say: You will not go to the supermarket to look for actors. Good people usually come with peace or at least have a damn experience! Director Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director who simply sucks. Your direction is bad, all angles are dirty (it's not a good way), lines seem to be read from toilet paper and damn music .. it always comes when it is not and goes without any obvious reason. And do not use the writer anyway. Making movies is not like serving in a cafe, it requires art and skills, things that I really doubt you will ever have. Instead of doing a vicious shoot-out, you should shoot him back into oblivion and wait for something good to happen. Or just find a job in a cafe. You will have less stress and save movie visitors some money and bad night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <
