It's unbelievable that he is scaring at so many levels. Scenario, acting, direction, and casting are ugly. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also terribly terrible. I especially enjoyed this film when I assumed it would not be good. It seems to be a shame that people spend so much time and effort and produce something so poor when they really did do something quite decent of the assumption (though it's not very believable!) But instead, we treated somewhat annoying and cheesy a story of dragons and knights who lacks any charm found in other such fantasy movies. We just hope the Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and the hairstyle by David Thewlis makes him look like He-Man. That makes!
