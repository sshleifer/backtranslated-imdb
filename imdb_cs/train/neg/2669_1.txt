I have rarely moved to comment on the film online. But I can not understand how it happened. Who did it? How could they think they are capable of filming a feature film? Did they do a weekend at a movie school, got their father a lot of control and kidnapped David Badiel's family one after another until he started to agree? Or was he for some reason a long-time family friend / distant relationship that made it out of total, bad kindness? I do not care, I do not want to know. Even he seems completely embarrassed to be in it, mumbled in the rows and hid his face from the camera. Meanwhile, the DOP had to be a neighbor, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, scenario, routing and editing are ubiquitous and honestly, apathy that surprises me means I can not bother spending more of my life thinking about this movie.
