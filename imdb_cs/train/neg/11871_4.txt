Gregory Peck's acting was excellent, as one would expect, and the cinematography was quite stunning, even though he played directly into the melodramatic "moment." But the rest of the movie was exaggerated and hard to watch, just like me. I tried to like it, but I had to go through the last thirty minutes or so. I feel I've lost a couple of good hours. If it were not for Gregor Pecke, I would not have done fifteen minutes. 4/10.
