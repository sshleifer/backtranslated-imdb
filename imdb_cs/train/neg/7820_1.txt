Or is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, look ... It's a disaster! Or: No need to look at the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic titanic movie that would hit the box, The structure of the SR can not do this, a dark and limited color scheme (I would call it "wishi-washi"), boring usual dialogues, a clown with advanced alien technology, missing fun and spells, etc. It makes the film completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. The main thing in a character, such as a superman, is that he is a superhero. That's the core, the most important thing. Love problems and sadly lost depressive supersoftie can only be the only aspect at 2:40 long Superman movie, not all the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is like (and in this case very bad and boring) social studies, where every 30 minutes a person is flying. <br /> <br /> This is a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so give us the Supervillains, Superaction and the most important Superfun thing. WE WANT ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to do 2:40 long soul, do you love dramatic drama about lost and sad people? Then take normal human figures and make a remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman is coming back. And then, in the doorway, it occurs supernaturally. <br /> <br /> Maybe a singer tries to kill a legend without kryptonite, but one bad movie can not do it. Do not give up, plan to continue ... Another singer (and Warner Brothers) you make a superhero movie, not a depressing soap, or let it go. The movie superhero means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. The film is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, technically there are different kinds, yes, there are a lot of little talk, there are a few jokes, action scenes, etc. But the only thing that all these hot pieces have in common is their poor quality. <br /> <br /> It's no more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The sad strategy of casting can continue in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter, looks like 19th Superman was full of five years, so six years ago he slept with her so she was 16 (it looks like 13) and the daily reporter of the planet to spend the night with the superman. "Warner Brothers, </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder have played so fun and entertaining.What is the difference.Jesus poses at the end also ridiculous.What the hell should it be? <br /> The problem is that it means serious, not Spiderman, or Batman or Ironman, falling and rising like Jesus or angels, or talking directly with God, why not? They are superheroes, they save lives every day, so at least one conversation with God every week should be possible. Oh, my god, maybe It was not the real reportable film, instead it is a bizarre parallel universe opaque. <br /> <br /> For the Warner Brothers, this depressed superlama movie may be the biggest disaster in history. Not just for the money. I understand how difficult it was (maybe) to create and transmit some messages or feelings, but showing lonely, lost and sad people is not new and thousands of movies or TV shows have done better, in very old or new ones like magnolia. And flying frogs there were much more impressive than this flying supermoman, sorry, of course superman. Singer and WB, it's nothing. In fact, it's more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys passion for (comic / superhero) movies and steals us three hours of our lives. <br /> <br /> Smilin little brother. (Very angry and green as a debris.)
