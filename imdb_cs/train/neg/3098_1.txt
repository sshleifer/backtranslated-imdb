As Rick Sloane was allowed to shoot five movies, it is harder to believe than the cold fusion. This movie is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie, I thought Manos: Hands of fate were the worst bulls I've ever seen, but at least Manos moves so slowly that you can fall asleep, saving your eyes from the pain he suffers. The biggest tragedy of this film is that the old man who keeps Hobgoblins "locked" leads to the final scene. The time spent watching this film was an absolute loss of my life.
