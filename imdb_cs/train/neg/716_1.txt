This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no plot, gags are just for the retarders, and there is absolutely nothing else to watch out for in this movie. Throughout the movie Fredi (oh, my god, what a funny name, ha ha) does not ask himself how he came from the plane to the middle country. There are a lot of stupid and totally dysfunctional characters whose names should sound funny. eg: Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I've never even smiled during the whole movie. Gags look like they were made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when you hang someone's coat in the door (this happens about 5 times) then this movie is possible for you. Another Funny Scene: They try to guess the code word for a closed door (do not ask why never ask why "in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): a foul. So if you laugh at these examples, you may enjoy this movie. For everyone else: Go to Youtube and check out "Lord of the Weed": it's a lot more fun.
