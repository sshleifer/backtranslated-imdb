I have recently been subjected both to this film and "King Arthur," on DVD selected by others for evening "entertainment," and together they have achieved nothing but a growing awareness that a modern film watching the public is completely lacking in discrimination and is satisfied reaches the "action". Both films were total waste. What happened to personality development? Whatever happened to a meaningful dialogue? Whatever happened to ACTING? And when we look at something that is unequivocally referred to as "historical", whatever it was trying to capture a degree of precision, some realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of that time, even some mild taste of that time, attitudes. Why should everyone show the value of the 21st century America? I read in the news panels about the rejection of "little known" of the Dark Ages. It is not so. Significant amounts are known, with a lot of science discipline, but these jokes simply could not bother doing homework. I just wish I could vote 0/10
