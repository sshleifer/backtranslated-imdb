... child actors were uncomfortable. It also appears that the creators of this film wrestled for 90 minutes. Scenes of dignified death. If not for death scenes, this movie would make Disney feel very much. The main child protagonist did not seem as nearly as fearful as it should be. If I were in the middle of the forest with the teeth of the fairies of a killer of a spiritual kind, you can bet on your ass that I would not be out wandering around and cycling a bike. Overall, I've seen worse (that's what it's waiting for), but it's nothing to watch again, or I suggest that someone bother with it unless you're a passionate horror collector.
