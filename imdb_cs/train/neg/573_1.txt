The last reviewer was very generous. I'm quiet like the first movie, but I can not say I like it very much. The start is tolerable, but it goes very fast. Jon Bon Jovi just does not see me as a "bad vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor terrifying. Many scenes simply do not make sense. I mean, some normal person would suspect something would happen when a strange woman suddenly appears from nothing to pick you up, let alone an experienced hunter. Why can Una communicate with Jovi? It has never been explained in this movie that you would not mind if it was fun, but it was too much to ask. It must be one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen.
