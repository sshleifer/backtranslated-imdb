All in a while, Disney makes one of the thoes movies that will surprise everyone. The one who will keep you to the very end. In the Pirates of the Caribbean tradition, this movie will surely turn into a ghost and kill and rape your village. It's scary. If you want an unthinkable, pointless, predictable movie "action", go straight ahead. I believe that kids can enjoy it because they like it ALWAYS always win. But I, I like movies where it's guess who wins. This movie never lets the Bad Guys have the upper hand. By the end, when the heroes are left in a "unusable" hole, you know they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, never having to think of a puzzle or track for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is. Check out this movie if you want to see some impressive scenes, not if you want to see good acting or good movie. Come watch superman movie, it would be much shorter, and kids would like more. For example, the scene where Cage escapes from armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed Armed Armed Armed Armed Forces the film shows the decline of films and the film industry to cheap gags and the boring, unrealistic actions that this film provides in enormous quantities.
