Shocking! In 1965 I saw the jury of Gagarin alive. He was sincere, undemanding and kind, he was fine, and he looked like a well-educated and intellectual man. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like a dummy with affected gestures and mimics. They made a cartoon! Real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe this movie! I saw the film after the films "Taming the Fire" and "Apollo 13" and reading the books "Rockets and People" by Chertok and Korolev: Myths and Facts by Golovanov. I was shocked by the tedious scenario, bad acting and production, and lots of inaccuracies of "Space Race". The film is a boring rendering of well-known historical facts in Russia. A lot of interesting facts about space projects have not been proven. Some facts and details have been reversed. For example, in 1945, Korolev was not a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was no longer a gold mine in Kolyma Prison, but in a special office of prison design. Korolev was designer in prison design and was not buried dead prisoners. But in the film Korolev worked as a grave trench after 1940 (because of the prison's shoulder straps on the uniform). IMHO, filmmakers do not have a deep understanding of this part of history and can not make interesting films.
