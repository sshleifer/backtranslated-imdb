This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not only does the dialogue be terrible, it never stops. You think it's over, but not. How long does it take 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I will never see her again. It is as if someone has taken a romantic comedy, has drawn a comedy, then decided to drop the romance and left us with a bunch of crap that got to the screen. But do not take a word, find out why this movie is horrible.
