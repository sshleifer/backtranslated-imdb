In my time I saw poor movies, but it really takes a biscuit! Why oh why was this movie created? There's nothing here. Please put my trust, drag the switch and destroy a copy of this movie. There's a conspiracy ... which could take about five minutes to appear on the camera. This is a key problem, the story "based on a true story" (mmm ... anything) simply does not lend itself to being omitted for 80 minutes. And that's why we have to watch over the hour for people walking around. This is it! For the first half hour, nothing happens except that someone is looking at the store ... and then the three boys are going through the wood. This time, maybe it was possible to spend on character development ... but no. And so there is absolutely no connection with the people on the screen, so when they start shooting, we can not care less about it! Actually, I finally blamed the baddie for the movie to end! In addition, working with the camera is really terrible! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West is waste. I hate to hit a man, but really is his work trousers! These boring close ups and then a long single takes the people who walk - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists! How this man was brought to direct another horoscope movie is behind me! Completion, acting is also terrible ... which is for the film as a whole. Save your mental health, stay out of this pile of complete excrement!
