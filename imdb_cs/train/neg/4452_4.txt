Let's say I have to suspend my infidelity for the spiderman less than I do for the hooligans. That means I have a minor problem believing that Toby McGuire can hold buildings like me. I will not get into the specifics because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​adult, professional, British men who get to death every weekend is okay ... funny. And this movie is not. The fight, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken too seriously. The difficulties of pugilism and the respect that the object is being treated are irritating because it does not create or resolve this conflict. It seems that the story, with holes large enough to drive a Guinness truck, has been linked to the fictional theme of "fish from the water" so that viewers can look into Woods's tearful eyes when they learn how to become a man, beat other young men of opposing soccer tastes with blunt objects and then run as fast as possible. Characters are cartoon, especially Harvard Americans. Character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its height until the end you spent nearly two hours of your life, you never return. Pick up the "Football Factory" or "Combat Club" instead of this leg and disappointment. Do not waste time with an empty melodrama, tired old "Yankee in King Aurthur's King's Court" or crying, parable of bullsh * t arrivals. They are just pure, dark and clever fun; the way in which violence is to be.
