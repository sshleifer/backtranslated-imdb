This is one of the most horrible transcripts I have ever seen. If they want to make a film with a miserable story, they should refrain from publishing the title of a good book. There is hardly a relationship between Wolfe's book and this film other than the title. I do not mind changes if they help the story on the screen. At least the changes should not hurt the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. Actors are wrong. Of course, the director and / or screen writer could not decide whether to make a chrome comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon. If you saw this movie and did not want to try it, try the book. If you saw this movie and liked it, read the book.
