I tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission and allow me to tell you you will be watching something under such circumstances. He did not even do that. The first five minutes set the tone with weak porn-movie qualities, strange unconventional spells and incredible situations and behaviors. Then it worsens. This movie does not have a simple saving mercy and yet it's not bad, so it would be ridiculous to watch. It's scary. I've seen a lot of movies in my life and I'm not one of those well-known snob critics, I mean, I'll have some of the movies to some extent, though they're bad. This ... man. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, my friend.
