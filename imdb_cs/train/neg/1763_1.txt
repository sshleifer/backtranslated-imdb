It's one of the worst movies ever shot. Banal. Predictable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rated one point was a couple of pretty scenes that highlighted Barcelona. I think they would use films like Guant√°namo or some other secret CIA / NSA jail to abuse suspects. Often bad movies have some redemption, it has nothing. If I was in or working on it, I would change my name. Really turd. It's hard to write more than this, but I feel world movie observers need a head on it. On the other hand, it will be a great gift for people you can not stand for. <br /> <br /> You could send them to politicians you do not like laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W. and many others.
