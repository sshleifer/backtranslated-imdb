The TV version of the Twister springs several leaks, but it can remain observable. My sister bought it at Wal-Mart for several years when she was released, I saw it then, and I thought she was all right. Later, "Twister" with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt came out (or was it before? I think it was '97) and overall better work. But "Twister" was a sillier fun; it's realistic with the news. Does everything depend on what you want from a twist movie: Twisters or a low budget study? John Schneider and Devon Sawa (that's why my sister bought it), and Devon Sawa, who went to "Wild America", "Final Goal" and "Slackers" got a big break here. So I was one of the first people to see him really take off. I do not know if it's honor or shame, I have not seen how it works in recent movies. "Night of the Twisters," all depends on personal taste, as I said, all depends on what you want from Twisted: Twisters or a low budget study. "Night of the Twister" has the other. So you decide. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
