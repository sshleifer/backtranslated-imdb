I saw this movie on Sundance 2005 and was amazed at how bad it was, although based on the catalog description I was thrilled to see it. Probably the "mockumentary" of two high school students who recorded a documentary about college life were bad acting, poor direction, a total lack of impressive figures as it is written, and a whole bust everywhere. I like good high school movies, and it's not one of them. Characters are one-dimensional and self-conscious "cool," though they should be thrown out. You get the overall impression that a lot of people sitting around make a deliberately bad film to show their friends, but somehow get to Sundance. Mystification.
