Although technically a bit more polished than the previous movie in the BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES series, it is a weaker escape in the picture, which is a less exciting and leading man who simply does not have the charisma of Ray Milland. <br /> <br /> This means that several actors and characters continue to play their roles and keep the flying flag. Also, John Barrymore is present, appearing throughout the film in a number of unusual disguises. In any case, it's another endless night for BD to go with his cohorts about trying to save the poor girl she intends to marry. The reasons are stupid, but the supporting actors are making fun again.
