My wife and I wanted to rent really silly horror / science fiction movies and watch them with our friends laughing. We saw it at fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now that I say this movie is terrible, I think it is good. Everything about acting, cinematographic work, story, costumes is just so spectacular and low budget, but that's what's so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they really went to the place. I really hope that the person who made the film was not serious when they did, because if it were, then it would be sad. If you want to look at really silly horror movies just to talk about them, I recommend this.
