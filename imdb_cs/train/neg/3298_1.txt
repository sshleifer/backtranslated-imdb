When I heard that the dukes of Hazzard would be transformed with current actors and a solid scenario, I was sorry: "Okay, I'll give him a chance, it will not be better than the first one, but what happens." I saw what had happened. I saw the great 70th and 80th vintage show, which was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad that Hollywood scriptwriters can not come up with something original these days. They seem to have a great show that has a great target audience, and is trying to "Remain" a classic show. HEADS UP Hollywood ... TO DO NOT USE !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider is surely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and used. Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, like Luke Duke. How deep can you drop? A dirty gambling actor who plays dear Luke. It forces me. I will also give Jessie Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting is upset. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was a clever, sexy, strong, deliberate and good IL "South Girl who was growing up all the models of little girls!" Jessica Simpson played an intelligent ass, a bit of a bitch like Daisy Duke Daisy was never blonde Why did they have to throw her out Jessica Alba would play a great Daisy Duke She could speak with a big Southern accent, it was wonderful and would do great work Anyway, I would say that this movie threw something wild I feel like I lost my $ 8.50 ticket and I would have to pay back the money If you like Dukes of Hazzard (the original series) you do not see this movie It just makes you upset It's a country song television CMT the dukes all night long, so set up your TIVO and go with a real thing, not with imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
