I only watched DVD 1. Your own program can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise they are complicated concessions of religious people. It's as if director Brian Flemming recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and with these tools he feels he can easily struggle with his opposition. Flemming also faces personal affairs and takes on the film. He will never return to the topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are apparently rooted in inappropriate education. The arguments of such victims seem to be irrational and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will want more data. We do not have to say that religious people are nuts, more than American Jews need to be informed of how unpleasant Christmas music comes to the middle of December. In the best scene, Fleming's childhood Christian schoolteacher is almost unmistakably confronting the director with his motivation. It seems to be the most honorable part of the film and it was too short. If Fleming was a little more confident, he might have a good story about his own (past and present) relationship to Christianity and the abusive institution that refreshed him in his youth. And maybe he could lend his "Christ never went to earth" material to a more serious documentary. I'm not going to study the writings of Saul / Paul to find out how all this is airtight, but the quick crawl of Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. Bonus talks are pretty good that Fleming's work is not very good. Sam Harris is a good speaker for the anti-religious POV, and he does not make light on these other, non-Christian religions. Harris also has good (and easy Google) interviews at Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
