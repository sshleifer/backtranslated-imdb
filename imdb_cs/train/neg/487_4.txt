What did the director say? Anyone who has read the biography of Artemisia is interested in his courage to face the public rape process in the Renaissance times and even suffer torture to show that Tassi is guilty. This fact shows true independence and emancipation - in her worst hour her MAN stands. Why are films showing the Renaissance so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid of seeing the biting aspect of life, or that she has won Hollywood's happy joy? While I always guess the director's freedom to create my own reality in the film, I did not make sense to bring my biography to Artimis. Very disappointed with the choice of filmmakers.
