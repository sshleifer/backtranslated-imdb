The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The apparent exciting romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch, and I wanted it to be inevitable. However, once the action turned into the home of Ingrid's fiancée, she completely disintegrated. Instead of romance and magic, we see that some unbearable parallel characters appear to destroy the film. The heart son of the marriage and the military attaché tried to make the girl look silly - like the submarine from the old Love Boat episode. How the spell and elegance of the first part of the movie can get out of the reach is beyond me. This film is Renoir's obvious attempt to win success with the RULES OF THE GAME because the film is very similar as soon as the action turns into a rustic estate (just like in another movie). I was not a huge fan of THE RIGHT GAME, but ELENA and her men appreciated me with the artistic and nuances of the original film.
