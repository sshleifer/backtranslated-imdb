I do not want to believe what these people were doing for the perfect game. <br /> <br /> - Do not talk good fight, right? <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogues could have been delivered with more feelings. The rest of the actors needed it together. Romeo, Romeo, why are not you still dead, Romeo? The actor, though not only completely wooden and dead, could not even read his lines. He was totally unfocused, having trouble, without looking at Julie in his face, and absolutely no grace with the lines given to him. The one who threw it deserves to be punished. Julie is almost successful, but she does not give any depth to her character and seems to be out of touch with the game. Mercutio was incredibly spooky and totally out of character for his entire dialogue. Benvolio was unbearable and ruthlessly torn. <br /> <br /> I was forced to withstand this half-produced production of Romeo and Juliet. The effects were compressed and the costumes were nothing distracting. I saw puppet shows with more effort. I just wish I could get this movie zero.
