I've always been curious about this movie because it's so hard to find it, so when I hit him on Ebay, I bought $ 10 and bought it, now I see why it's so rare! This movie is so bad, so horribly written and hopelessly low, that the final credits that show all the cut scenes they kissed about are literally the pinnacle of the movie. The film is about psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her ruthless scene), which uses her power with an experimental machine to pull out objects of another dimension from this fact. When he inserts a box as an object, the army unintentionally throws it into the open rear of the truck with a soldier who protects it, and what do you know? SURPRISE! The child in a foam rubber monster costume jumps up, instantly kills a soldier scratching his face and then escapes to a nearby town. But rather than deploy half of the county's armed forces to find and protect the public, responsible, leave it to Petty's and Ray to find it themselves, but no matter how this film destroys all its credibility before. It hardly escapes my vote just because I laughed unintentionally, someone has to warn the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not know about it anymore! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
