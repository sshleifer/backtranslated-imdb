As for the movie, it's a science fiction movie OK. She has so many great things and some quality scenes. This means that it's not so good, and some things are pretty charged enough ... When it comes to calling this another cube film is a complete and complete bullsh! T. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie ... The whole feeling can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the bar itself is a bit of a stretch ... <br /> <br /> I put it 3 *** due to the back of the original. This one should still be sterile in many parts of the film, there is no time or space to mention them ... <br /> <br /> Watch for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube but are not recommended for fans of the series .. .
