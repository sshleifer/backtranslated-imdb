The word sums it up to d'oh;) The five girls lost themselves and tried to find their way home when they stopped at the store to get on their way when they hit a parked car that smashed a single headlamp to get into trouble , but suddenly they will see that one lamp (ooooh) appears behind them. From here everything scream, weep and violence when trying to escape from that crazy person who lost him because the light of light;) and screaming and crying almost all over the film (very annoying) The film is shot, with a cheap camera trying look "real" or "shocking" I think it's just embarrassing and useless. If it is not better, I compare it to the "Blair Witch Style". Shouting and crying all over the movie with a foul sound were over the top of annoying, literally got a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it was not scary, just an unpleasant painful piece of film.
