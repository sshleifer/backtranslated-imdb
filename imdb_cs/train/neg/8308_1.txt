Entertainment Today night has been decreasing over the past few years, but it has reached a new level last night (August 17, 2006). In an effort to try and broadcast their broadcasts, they decided to record the real body photos of JonBenet Ramsey last night to their shows ... "Pictures from a case you have not seen yet". Both photos were graphic and very worrying. One was on the side of her face and head and neck and you saw the cord that used it to strangle her neck and her bruise on her face. It was so horrible that I could not believe it. How does it have to do with NEVER remotely connected to Hollywood Entertainment? Nothing!! Their level of dignity and values ​​has fallen to a new level ... and it shows it. This was the premiere show you're looking at ... and now it's just garbage. From that moment I will look at Hollywood access.
