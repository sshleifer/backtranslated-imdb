I considered this film an interesting study of the causes and consequences, but a little more. The basic story is governed by the lives of a handful of people and their activities (intentional and other) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film is a big promise, but I feel she can not fulfill her promise. Too much time is devoted to viewers of chaos theory and too little time to show it. As a result, I never felt a real feel for some of the characters and never had a good connection with them emotionally. By the end of the film I had a sort of attitude for all of them. A stronger direction of character development would make this movie great, but it's just so at its stage
