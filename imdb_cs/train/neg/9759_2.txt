It's rare that I feel the need to write a review on this site, but this movie is highly deserved because of how badly it was created and what its prejudice was. <br /> <br /> I felt a strong attempt on part of the filmmakers to show the Palestinian family as vicious and untrustworthy. We hear they are discussing the sadness they feel under oppression, but the film is shot down and organized in such a way that we feel that the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We do not see any evidence parallel to the status of a Palestinian teenager. We hear only the other Palestinians in prison. I understand that there are limitations, but the political nature of the limitation is designed to avoid peace. I came out of a movie that felt the mother of the victim was selfish in her sadness and completely shut because of her fence side, so to speak. She continued not to see the bomber's parents injured, and her angry and closed minds made the final meeting impossible. It is much more realistic, in my view, to see Israeli thinking as the root of the problem; ignored reasons for understanding and freedom ignored requests for recognition of the process by which the Jewish population gained ground. I gave it two because of the selfish mothers' weaknesses that would normally be admirable in the document, but in the light of the lack of impartiality, everything seems to be exploitable. Also for poor adjustments, lack of backgrounds in a particular case and ultimately lack of proper representation of the Palestinian party. It's a bad document and a bad movie. I acknowledge that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I have to notice the shortcomings in the direction no matter what makes the heart delicate and sad.
