As the only film I've seen on this year's Nordische Filmtage in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as the most expensive. <br /> <br /> This movie, which was reported as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a bad shit! Excuse your tongue, but no words to describe it are decent. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not save the film. E.g. conspiracy: After the first 15 minutes, it was clear that John was sick, the neighboring girls were not real, and he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sexual scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flow to me has to do with sexuality), but unfortunately these were not the only disgusting images that should be displayed. Everything else was copied by other directors, such as Lynch, but of course without their genius. So, summarize the movie and save the other audience time and money: the guy loses her girlfriend, the girlfriend turns around home, the guy kills her girlfriend and then goes mad, guy presents hot but crazy neighbor girls, has one of them very disgusting sex thinks) eventually realizes that he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lying in his apartment all the time .. bad story, bad actors, pictures that want to vomit you ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for you to understand how well you can understand Norse if you have learned Swedish - at least one evening's advantage - and you can not select 0 points here).
