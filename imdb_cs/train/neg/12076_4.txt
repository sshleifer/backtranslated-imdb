You all know the story of "Hamlet". I'm doing. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase 'be or not to be' (not the speech itself) has been suppressed in the ground so many times it's not very interesting (in fact it was not so great to start with). In fact, it seems to me that "Hamlet" is a good, but overly overrated game. It's not Shakespeare's best: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with "Sen nocturnal" and "Othello" not too far away. "Macbeth (you knock your desk, from his drawers, the puck changes, OW!)" It's not so bad. There are plenty of others that are better than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I'm not really going to comment on the movie, I'm going to get a totally terrible episode of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Good. . . Mike and Bots win the card game, win the movie. . . they ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them this, yadda yadda yadda. . . and get ready for the most demanding sci-fi episode of MST3K ever (I certainly did not see any of the CC Ones). While "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" makes viewing this episode terrifying because it's not really a movie, rather a random, connected scene (I remind Mike's line of "future war": "Maybe it's an anthology of short, film-free plotters" SOL Crew and a lot of good cracks. I can not say the same for that. <br /> <br /> The riffs will fall flat, the host segments (as usual) are best average and when the movie itself (which is not so bad) is actually BETTER (I think as a quality film, not as a camp as "Prince of Space ") than its version of MST3K, you know the show must be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw it a few months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried to have fun - but I just could not. Only an occasional line like Queen Dilbert's boss! (and when it's the funniest episode, well, oh) - and occasionally, I think about every ten minutes - maybe even laughing. For the second time, I tried to watch her, and I did not blink at the jokes I had found before, and I just walked away forty minutes ago. The film is not terrible; it's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough and although dubbing is not the biggest, it is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, yes THREE for MST3K. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY, MST3K!
