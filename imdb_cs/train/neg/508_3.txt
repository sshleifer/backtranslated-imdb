Morning film by D.W. Griffith; this is a wonderfully happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the King leaves the scene, his queen makes music with Minstrel Palace (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers lovers, he decides to accept the terrible revenge of Edgar Allen Poe. It is hard to believe that lovers can not hear those who obey them; although the actors try to look alternately noisy (lovers) and silence (cement mixers). Sets make "The Sealed Room" look very good. The performance is fine and the story is easy. <br /> <br /> *** Closed room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
