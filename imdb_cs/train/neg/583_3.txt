I bought this adaptation because I liked the Anna BrontÃ« novel when I read it some time ago and I usually look forward to the BBC drama. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than it was to move me like a novel. <br /> <br /> First, the music (and the song) seems to be completely out of place in the drama period (sounding like it was written for the contemporary horror film) and as another commentator, I was particularly angry how cameras he turned and turned around the actors. I saw some scenes shot in this way on the "North and South," and it seemed to be all right, but in The Tenant it was definitely exaggerated and simply uncomfortable. Camera moves can not make a lively live action. <br /> <br /> Most of the other roles were difficult to distinguish first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were initially listed correctly. The little boy did very good performance, is very cute and best feature film. SPIRAL Tara Fitzgerald's characteristic of Helen Graham made her feel cold and harsh and left no emotions to pass. She does not seem to be able to cry in a realistic way. I could not believe that Markham would fall for her, not mentioning the terrible hairstyle that had been given to her. I could not help feeling sympathy with my husband! Fancy married such a virage ... Besides, he was the only major actor who sounded right to me. I found Toby Stephens okay, Brother Helen Graham is not very good. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition to what the book just suggests and leaves the reader's imagination in the book, he is satisfied with television adaptation: making some scenes both rough and comic (as well as when he begins to bleed the eye of Huntingdon) and others, a period of drama! I mean, we do not have enough of those scenes in bed in the current drama?
