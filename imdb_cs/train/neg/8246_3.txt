Daddy girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West get some amazing news at the local post office that they do not know they are being chased by a criminal, Charles Insle. Meanwhile, Father David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron), which requires his father to leave home; so when the young women return, can they be? home alone. As a vulnerable pair of bed for the evening, the local "Big Ball Black and Tans" is rolling out; and the dark-skinned drinker poses another danger to D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his better roles in Biograf and steals the movie from The Girls and Daddy. It is ironic that director Griffith looks like one of the black-faced accessories on the "Black and Tans" ball. "The Biography of the Girl" Lawrence and the West suggest that later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in the "Storm Orphans" (1921); and are too loving in bed! The radio tone is unfortunate because the story of a thief redeemed to save potential victims from greater danger is interesting. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Daddy (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
