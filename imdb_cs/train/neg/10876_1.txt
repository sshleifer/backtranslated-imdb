What the hell was D-film? Bad actions, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / stories I've ever encountered. All that was cool here was Coolio, who was pretty like a terrible cop. The rest of the film is terrible and boring. It's not that bad, you can laugh at it. Just bullshit. And who would compare it to the Evil Dead Series could compare Tomb Raider with Indian Jones (well, ok, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
