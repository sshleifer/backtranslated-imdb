I thought the movie was fine but very disappointed that they did not catch the real picture of their lives. I was expecting his mother to be a real Jamaican that makes me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. Which I totally lost interest just a few seconds from the beginning of the movie. I'm very disappointed that it's like watching a biographical tale about Mark Anthony and having Arnold his role. I do not know what the writer thought he was missing a valuable piece of film I'm sure his mother played a big part in his life. I say the movie was OK except the main Fla !!!!!!
