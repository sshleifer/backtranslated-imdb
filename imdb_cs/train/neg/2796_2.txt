for the most part, on demand brings some pretty terrible horror movies, and offers just the other horror movies they've all seen, and they already have an opinion on. It was either Innocent (I like Mark Wahlberg movies) that I did not see and I was actually watching the movie in the movie, which is not happening often because I have already watched all the films I own a million times, and that's a lot of movies and I do not have a big interest in new movies and boy, this film made me regret. I will not put any spoilers, just tell you that few of the very few actors in this movie are half decent. I think the main girl, dead, who kills everyone is very unpleasant, but convincing; I would take her every day as a psychic female, so she fits well, even if she is chubby. The blood is not so great, just a few of those killed, or I can say that the "wounds" are fine, but you do not see much and there are no props in the movie to make the wounds more convincing. At the end of the movie I begged my girlfriend to turn it off and was a member of the band, the "recording" parts were not very interesting, though what happened would really happen when she was about to record. I'm done if you want to look, adjust.
