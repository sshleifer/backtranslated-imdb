This movie could be much better, especially with regard to talent. Larenz Tate's portrait of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. He does not have the lips sync well and his stage maniograms are Larenz Tate when he was to be Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of women like a lot of golden hoofs was written by Hollywood around the world. The forces that obviously pushed them, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the film featured a portrait of Miguel Nunez Little Richard and a portrait of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is an eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It is bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivic A. Fox were unnecessary. Frankie Lymon's entire saga was fascinating in real life. The pity that this film was an unnecessary opportunity.
