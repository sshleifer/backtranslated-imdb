- = contains spoiler of original and film versions = - <br /> <br /> I am a huge fan of Notre Dame de Paris, I also read a book this summer and watched the film today, at the beginning I was hopeful to watch a good movie , especially when I saw the 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good but I actually waited on the stage scene right out of the book but it was normal but when Esmeralda kissed the gringoire I felt something was wrong..this did not even kiss in the book, even in musical .. and there was a huge gap, why Esmeralda be judged by the sorcerer, in the book teaches her goat, how to respond to the number of hours or write the word "phoebus" .. wait for there to be a phoebus? In this movie some soldier is not wanted anything more, the creators made Quasimod's love to show off and even cancel Frol's love ... but Notre dame was frollo. his thoughts of his struggle between love for God and love for man in the movie We can not find anything like that we only have it, a villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts .. and he does not mention the phoebus, he does not show love to frollo , without mentioning the jehan (brother frollo), who did not mention Esmeralda's mother (maybe it's ok, the story would cut a lot) even did not give a real story .. (another PS: frollo was not an opus dei cultivated member who is really interested in alchemy that he is trying to make money ... he was stuck in science and religion) at last you are not looking at this film, it's some release of directors to a real masterpiece, and if you followed it before you read the book, God <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the harsh Notre Dame II animated film, time is tracked by Notre Dame D e Paris musical .. enough he said ..
