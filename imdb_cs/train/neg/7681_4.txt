Sean, you know you think you're the absolute greatest actor in the world, but I can not commend you. Comedy is not just your strong suit. <br /> <br /> However, it was not just your fault. Some things were too hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to wonder where the lines got from the beginning. Again, Sean ... I'm sorry.
