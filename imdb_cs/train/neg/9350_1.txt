This movie was terrible. The first half hour is more like ... well, sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost copied from one of the first in Clockwork! It is supposed to be a tribute to the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the wall of the protagonist, however "ripoff" is a more appropriate word. The film felt as if it had been torn directly from classical Kubrick, just shot the eyes of a new director. Blind director. Unfortunately, when it stops masking Kubrick's work, the film gets worse. As another commentator said, the depth of this film is just stuck in the neck. An arrogant, self-serving, and ultimately nonsensical disgrace. Perhaps the arguments of the protagonists would touch the nerve if there was some real character development in this movie. I feel absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I think if anyone could feel for him, it would be me. Extensive character development, dialogue and storyline. <br /> <br /> The worst part about this movie is the name. For a film called "16 years of alcohol", alcoholism is hardly a factor. Take a look at the first paragraph - it's such cutting A Clockwork Orange, which I can not overcome. A more appropriate name would be "16 Years of Violence," or even better "Banana with Clocks". <br /> <br /> Just make a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and take it anyway, drink it. Believe me.
