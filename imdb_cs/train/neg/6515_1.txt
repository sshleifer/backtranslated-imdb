It's not a boring film, the audience could stay in a chair fascinated by this selfish figure, Miles Berkowitz, filmmaker and actor. The story is simple: after the divorce and the ten-year Hollywood breakthrough, the author plays the love of the camera. The first question is how true is everything: what is written, what happened by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no", show M. Berkowitz as a low average human being. If you look at a love affair like this one, I suggest that you read some independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... Besides, I felt quite disappointed when I heard so much against my country, France. I know Americans usually say that French is arrogant (it might be true) etc. And surely the French (and the whole world) have a lot of sadness against America, but why so much hate? Do not think I just liked this movie just because of it.
