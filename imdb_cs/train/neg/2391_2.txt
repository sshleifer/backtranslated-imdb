I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love those that are unfamiliar. I love dramas, comedy, action adventure, science fiction, mystery, western, any genre in addition to horror. I love foreign movies as well as those in English. I like good movies, and I even love bad because almost no movie ever has fun at some level of having fun or having fun. Except "Even Cowgirls Get Blues." When I attended the late night show "Cowgirls," I joined the audience at around 10. Less than half until I was alone. Soon, I can not even tolerate the disturbing disorder that unfolds before my eyes, and I also left. To date, "Cowgirls" remains the only film I've ever left. I do not understand how to describe this incoherent, empty film, insignificant film, or how to adequately communicate its inadequate redemption. Just say it's one of the worst movies of all time, absurd and inexcusable at every level. He tries to be clever, but his concept of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. He's trying to be funny, but his humor is crude and cringe-worthy. This is one of the few movies that can profane your own ethos, by showing the protagonists so that they are so far away that you rebel against them and their values. If you want to watch the movie, look at the "Water World", "Ishtar", nothing but this. Besides the new "Alexandra". If you choose between this and that, read the book.
