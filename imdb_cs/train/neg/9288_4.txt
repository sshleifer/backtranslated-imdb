Half Past Dead, where Steven Seagal starred, was the main hit B. Half Past Dead 2 is just a straightforward sequel to the video, an action movie that will not lose anything, but is not able to win anything. It's less fun than the first: in all respects. But it is still a good look. If you like action movies or just something you can watch during a popcorn session; if you also want to look at the old WWE stars on the screen, or even if you like watching the sequel, even if they are right or not. Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he is not at work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did work, but nothing amazing, nothing bad. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, the production made by Sony can not be great. Cinematography was a disaster, but the overall direction was acceptable. Whatever it is, just look at it if you want to. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose.
