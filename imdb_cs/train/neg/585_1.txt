The original Man From Snowy River movie is one of the best I've ever seen, almost perfect. Lady and Tramp story in two senses - rich girl / poor boy and ability vs. bloodlines. The sequel, however, is not just a blatant attempt to improve the reputation of the original but also ridiculous, exaggerated Disneyfied mess, best summed up as "Rambo meets black stallion." Without the Black Stallion spell. The young hero returns from a three-year absence and suddenly is a Superman; in the original good movie was real and believable, but unfortunately the cartoon broke down in the sequel. As soon as I was so disappointed in the movie and occasionally I was a bit annoyed - just missing clich√©s. Brain manipulation with viewers - do the head studios make all that you have to do with a horse loving audience to show them enough horses in front of them to be happy? Movie mess.
