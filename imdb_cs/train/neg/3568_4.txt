The truth is that the film based on Harold Robbins' novel is not awarded. This is no exception. "Lonely Lady" is a pure B picture in budget, cast, and execution. Technically it looks like a movie made for TV. The game is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly horrible. Anthony Holland is embarrassed. As one reviewer said Katherine Hepburn's performance, her range ranges from A to B. Mrs. Zedora managed to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and lost in their roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserve better. But the whole thing can be very fun. As Robbins suited, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for fun ... and you are not too sober ... it could be for you.
