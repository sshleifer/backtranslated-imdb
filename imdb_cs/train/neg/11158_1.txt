What a terrible, awful movie. The worst clich√© collection I've seen a long time ago. Not that I saw a lot. I let the theater scream for about 40 minutes searching for a hard drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was as horrible as usual. How many injured and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's earnings were - so often - totally unnecessary. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? I'm trying to make this film quite correct, still promoting racial stereotypes. (A brave, inexperienced, lonely music teacher teaches children with low education in music schools). The children were not cute! Just written to suit a scary script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really talked to me. really terrible!
