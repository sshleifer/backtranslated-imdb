Eleven "great" filmmakers, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes of each of the overwhelming, sophisticated, blissful, self-satisfied. It heals people of all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt gives "hip hip hooray!" for terrorism in the amateur segment. Despite the green line, we have Amos Gitai from Israel, with eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerk reporter. Mexican Alejandro González Iñárritu focused on the Twin Towers, but seemed to forget to turn on the camera. Sean Penn did not know that there were no buildings in the shadow of the shopping center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignores the whole thing. Claude Lelouch focuses on trivial and cliché of love. Ken Loach from the UK focuses on Chile. Etc. etc.
