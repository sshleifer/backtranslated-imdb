In the best times, I'm not a big fan of rom / com. Several of them were pretty good (insomniac dream control), but this is more the same but less. With a running time of 100 minutes I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. The only true laughter of the stomach is when foreign and friendly men instinctively help Lee's temper. <br /> <br /> I can only say I avoid. I gaurentee there are at least 10 other movies in the field that deserve $ $$ <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 (And just because I'm a big Lee fan)
