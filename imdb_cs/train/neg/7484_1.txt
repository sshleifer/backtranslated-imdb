Within 15 minutes, my whole family was rooted for Goldie Hawn's position to die or, at least, for Steve Martin's position to leave her. In 40 minutes we switched them off. There are only a few movies a year that we try to prove so annoying that we can not even stomach long enough for the story to become. <br /> <br /> I usually like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying the original Neil Simon. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director "What's the Worst of What Happens" and the writer "Miss Congeniality 2," and I think that's what we're done with.
