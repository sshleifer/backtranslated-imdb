What he left! It began with interesting secrets and interesting characters. It is true that it was moving at the speed of the snails, but still I was gripped and watched. David Morrissey is always good value and Suranne Jones was good. Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalized by possible terrorist connections. But then Morrissey's character was killed and the whole air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. The whole thing turned out to be a very small beer and the d√©nouement was incredibly weak. Five hours of my life for it? My advice: instead, observe the color.
