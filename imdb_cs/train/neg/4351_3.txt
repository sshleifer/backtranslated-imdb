Every generation fully believes that he lives in the final period. This has been valid for thousands of years. And movies like this are alive. How did they get a great Orson Welles to tell this wreck train? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. They try to link the prophecy, as well as what was happening at the time it happened, so it is obviously dated and a little stupid. Reconstructions look as if they were from "Unresolved mysteries" but without high production values. People should be embarrassed to take part in it. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is dated, stupid, reactionary and useless. Good if you want to laugh good, but it's not good enough to really look for you.
