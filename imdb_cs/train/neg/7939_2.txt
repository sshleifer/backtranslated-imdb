From the sophisticated order of the overcrowded sub-genre "Hillybilly Horror," this miserable story comes about a holiday family that has been terrified by inbred red. Does it sound familiar? Well, it would definitely have anyone with even a deep knowledge of the horror genre. Here is quite new. The film looks happy with the fact that it recycles all old worn out clich√©s (deformed bunches, the quiet family turned to the murdered murderers when the pressure comes, the rebellious daughter, the "angry" who is in the heart, etc.), but even imperfect enough to make it a complete waste of time. It is a forgotten training, but funny that the head of J.D. Hart once starred in a film titled "Movies That Suck" earlier in his career, a completely ironic sign really. My Grade: D-
