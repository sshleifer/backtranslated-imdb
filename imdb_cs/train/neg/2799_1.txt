The person who wrote the screenplay for this film does not deserve to work in Hollywood (they are not even there) and these actors have to find another job. The most dangerous hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just watched it be better, which, unfortunately, did not work for me. Even in the end, credits gave me anxiety. I think there was not a lot of people behind the movie, so they had to slow down their credits ... very slowly. This movie is definitely a great guide to "How not to make a movie". Pity I can not give 0.
