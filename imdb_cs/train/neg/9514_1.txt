Please save me from these films that teach us that crime is fun and legitimate. A couple with an empty screenplay with an intense desire to be brother Farrelly or Coen and the lives of another group of people with a supposedly high school age who play their teenage engagement in Dawson Creek, complete with GenXYZ soundtrack, who is pitifully trying to make the movie "feel" cool and we have an intense and painfully nasty satire. This is not even destroyed by "Ferris Bueller" ... I'd like to look at changing the traffic light. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only one scene excels as anywhere for the price of entry: when Betty's camouflaged girls meet with friend Richard Nixon Masked. It's a real moment. Unreservedly. But for the rest, I'd rather have toothache. At least I can use some benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
