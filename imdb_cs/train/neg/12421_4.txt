Mark Pirro "Deathrow Gameshow" from 1987 is a black comedy, which is extremely cheesy in many parts but occasionally very entertaining. This movie would certainly be much better, acting is horrible, and some extremely soaring scenes make it difficult to observe at times, but this concept is fun and has several merry moments. in the near future (in 1991), the games have changed. Chuck Todean (John McCafferty) hosts the Live Or Die game show in which convicted death rowers have the opportunity to play for their lives and for money. Candidates who have failed are executed in the air in various ways, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and more, bizarre means of execution, followed by applause from listeners. The show is of course more controversial and Chuck has done a lot of enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly crude and harsh in many aspects, and acting is terrible, but it is certainly fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. If you have not seen them, you have not missed anything, but it's definitely funny and good time. 4/10
