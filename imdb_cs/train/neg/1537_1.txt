A really bad video on a "movie" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video creators. If you make a bad horror movie at least throw some blood, nudity. There's some blood provided with latex-cut shoulder props purchased at Halloween. They're lesbians and prostitutes, but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but they just talk. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are no editing effects - disappearing, napkins, etc. Once in a while it looks a bit of a black separate scene. > <br /> Great music from bad heavy metal bands, whose websites take up most of the credits. Wolf waves are represented by rubber masks that are associated with the face of "actors". They did not even bother to use brown make-up on the neck, hand or wrist. I guarantee that 10 years old with a video camera could put together a better movie. There was no reason to buy, rent or watch this movie, except for example how to create a low-budget video.
