This movie was bizarre, completely unexplained and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a large empty house. I really love the opening stuff with Lisa wandering around lost in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lying in some exotic European national environment, albeit perhaps not with a low budget. Definitely end up where there are extra sexual scenes that have been released (in my DVD copy). Do not try to understand it, just go and watch out for those strange pieces ... which is all. Do not look at it if you really want conspiracy or characterization or make any sense at all. Pretty beautiful, though you can just give up and decide to watch a real horror movie, as if it were Dead Alive.
