Cannon has pulled the true visual beauty of a medieval epic that looks fascinating (except for a dragon stand). Now, how long did Chuck Norris last for a long time with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? The point in the point: amateur acting and terrible plot is a sign that the revival of the medieval legend is not a cure for some bad execution. In fact, they went and made other cheap exploiters with hundreds of delicious bimbos to make them look even better. For the two "barbarian brothers" they certainly know how to make strange sounds than state brave fighters so strong and courageous to save their native land. It is the only biggest loss of potential I've seen from the "expensive" low-budget movie, and even worse, to keep an ax of pursuing a beautiful print without grace. All this was followed by an advertising campaign selling barbarian shirts! The movie itself is a great souvenir!
