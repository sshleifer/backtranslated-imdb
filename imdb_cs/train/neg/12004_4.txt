Salaam-e-Ishq is a relatively short, but superficial comedic soap dish from India that starts us with six intertwined stories of romantic love (which in my opinion is at least four stories too much) <br /> <br /> Filmed as a cross between a MTV music video and a Super Bowl commercial beer, the movie is a vast mishmash of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-stepping song-and-dance numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, side-by-side blinkers, upset dialogue and crowded comic performances basically standard things with Bollywood events these days. It's an exhausting job, just trying to keep all the characters straight while dancing, carrying and haunting the way through an incomprehensible story. <br /> <br /> There is plenty for the viewer to see his eyes - all the drops of dead beautiful women - but he will need Job's patience to get him all the way.
