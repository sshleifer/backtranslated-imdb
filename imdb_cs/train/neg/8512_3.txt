I like silent movies, but this was a little dirty. Whatever I wish, I could say it's worth the hour I stood up. I do not think any version of the movie is even close to the book. And do not try it out for kids, they might be angry. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old is she? 38? I know that the labor laws were different at the time ... But come to the people.
