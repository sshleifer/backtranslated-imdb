Hopeless, ignorant, ill-conceived, killing in a career (where Angela Jones is now talented?), Defeat Defects. No wonder Reb Braddock has not said anything since then - anyone who has the chance to shoot their first film based on their own rules based on Quentin Tarantin's own story and create something similar to TO feels it's a story that is worth the world to the world, does not deserve a second break. Under these circumstances, performances are good - actors do what they have to do, and they do it well. It's just that they should not do it first. <br /> <br /> 0 of 4.
