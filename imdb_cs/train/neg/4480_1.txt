Let me start by saying that I first watched this high-hopping film. It was recommended to me by a friend with average taste in movies and "MTV" was put on the front cover, so I did not expect much. What I was expecting was a slobber, too dramatic, but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, let me begin that I have never read a book or looked at any other version of the movie. It was my main shot with the movie. God is AWFUL. The main girl is quite average, but Maryl Streep is compared to the rest of the actor. The main "hero", Heath, is just terrible. She can sing a decent soundtrack, but that's it. His acting broke "sad" moments so I was so bad at the points I just laughed at. The girl Isabella was also pretty and the brother was just a flat character who played an actor who could not at all show emotions. And when he tried, he failed unsuccessfully. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor to play Edward, though it is obvious that the direction is bad because he does not even fulfill what I've seen. Oh, and my father was not half bad but he was in the movie so little time that I hardly remember. The story itself was not very good. More breaks than you can imagine. Predictable story (Until the end I barely understood). EXTREMELY one-sided characters without real depth ... Overall, it is not interesting or convincing, nothing we've ever seen is much better and nothing to be interested. <br /> <br /> The ending is supposed to be tearjerker. She did not do anything like that. The end is not built at all, almost feels like an idea. In fact, I had to ask my friends why it really was the end, which when they explained it to me, I had to look at my face, "Wait, when did they say it?" What? Never good sign. Editing was probably the worst I've ever seen, though I realize that fade-in-fade-outs are doing because it was originally made for television, but it really is not a justification. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is just garbage. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during the bullshit, not even close. This movie is really not worth your time. If you really want to see the tearjerker look elsewhere.
