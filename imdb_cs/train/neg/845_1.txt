It's a shame you can not vote for zero stars on IMDb, because I would not hesitate! In fact, I would go so far as to say that this film was in negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie when he thought that because of Michael Madsen, it could be good ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine the length of the movie "The Bold and the Beautiful", No, Primal Instinct did not even get that good, and I thought there would be nothing worse than the length of the movie "Bold and the Beautiful". <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do it to us? The worst thing is that I did not cover up a little bit forward, I hoped it would eventually reveal that it was all a bad joke that they thought it would be fun if we were watching such a bad movie. should I start ...? Star Rating, Star Scenes, Zero Stars, Star Zero, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Star Zero, Makeup - Zero Stars, Casting - graphic design - Half of the star, DVD menu - Half of the star. However, I think it's very important to see bad movies just to know what a really bad movie is so for that reason I'm happy to see this movie just because I have a bad movie I should put on the bottom of my list.
