Vovochka is your daily hooligan vs. film authority. Vovochka, the main character, is referred to as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from several adults who meet on the road, he finds he's changing his dirty ways hard, even though he is worthy of doing it. Personally, I found an actor who played Vovochka too uncomfortable to be sympathetic, but changing the tone of the movie would make most sense to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka wants to be good with, but bad things are still going on. This fight makes the film a bit different than other movies of the same genre, that is the little taste I wanted to say. Overall, I did not really care about this movie, although it was most likely aimed at a younger audience.
