This film is again one of those films someone thinks or tries to make others think they understand. Everyone who tries to do it is MORON! My advice would be to make two not one but two hits of very strong acids and at least you will have the visual excitement of it! Although at the end you can kill that you lose acid !!!! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those of you who will try to defend the film. Incomprehensible. Garbage. Schitzoid. The waste of talent. The film is ice, with paper at the target site with ringing clouds, sunny diving in pudding ... Sounds like a lion in the red light with the searing hair. Now it explains it to me !!!!
