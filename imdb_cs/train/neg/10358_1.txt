I read the entire book "Wrinkles in Time" and then I saw the movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but because the book was 190 pages and the movie was 2 hours, it felt really loaded with too many effects and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A witch in time is probably a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin have to get together to find Meg's father and get out of Camazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really stingy. The game is horrible, the direction is ridiculous and the situation is not necessary. I was really crushed to see the same person, Madeleine Engle, who wrote a book and created a movie, created a great book and a terrible movie. Playing is worse than any direct action. Yes, I have to admit it was great. But, seriously, they were all done horribly and not serially in any way possible. If you read a book, the movie will be crushed. I wish I could give her 0, but sadly I can only give 1. Half could be useful.
