Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deserve it, so I'm glad to see one of their films. Basically, the man in the corner factory is the fourth to break, and soon Ollie explodes with all the sounds of the corner. He rests at home with Stan by his side, needs peace and doctor (James Finlayson) phoning to announce that he's coming to look at Ollie. After completing plumbing and breaking electricity from a true ophthalmologist, the doctor gets checked and, after several tests, recommends drinking goat milk and seawater at sea. After Stan is practicing a trumpet, hanging out of the window by a telephone cord and car crash, he and Ollie will be on the ship. They held the ship on the dock and tried to slam the milk and Stan brought the oven! Meanwhile, the newspaper on the front reads that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) has escaped and he crashes on the boys' boat while they sleep and the goat chews over the ship's rope and goes to the sea. In the morning you will see their location, and Killer comes out asking for something to eat, and he sees Stan and Ollie making a fake food, such as spaghetti cords, cheese soap, bacon, sponge balls and forcing them to eat. When Ollie starts to strangle, Stan helps him to help him, and Ollie's anger makes him hit Killer, and it goes on until the police arrive just to get Ollie's anger into jail. There was the smallest comedy, but it's not a great black and white movie. "Well, here's another nice mess you've got!" was 60 for 100 years, 100 quotes and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 in a comedy comedy. Good!
