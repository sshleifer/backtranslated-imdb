After reading some good reviews even when hearing good things, I decided to rent Come Undone. I have to say that I was rather disappointed. The story was hard to watch because the film is set as a series of memories between the present and the recent past, which are very poorly executed. Characters, though they are the best actors, are flat and uninteresting. Gender is, and nudity is brighter than necessary. I have never seen a movie where it seemed that the act was so futile. The end is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions on the story line that she did not explain very well. In my opinion, it is a waste of time.
