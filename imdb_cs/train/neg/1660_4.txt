EXTREMITY <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A woman rotates the tables on a potential assailant when she assaults her house and he is forced to decide whether to kill him or to inform the police, in which case he could be released and re-convicted. The use of fans who could expect another crude 'n' prepared fantasy of the RELEASE OF THE LIFE (1978) will almost certainly be disappointed with EXTREMITY. It is true that Farrah Fawcett's character is exposed to two inconveniently prolonged attacks before gaining an attacker (suitably sober by James Russo), but scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young, with these unpleasant scenes just long before revealing the dilemma, informs the moral core of this production. Would their final solution be delayed in court? Maybe ... <br /> <br /> Based on a scenic game that reportedly left her actors broken and bruised after each performance, the film does not attempt to open a narrative and relies on a limited environment for the main event. Action and technical credits are all right, though Fawcett's overly muffled performances will not effectively play audiences who might rely on her to provide sales for their outrageous indignation.
