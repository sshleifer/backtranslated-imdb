Absolute garbage. The reason why it is so terrible is not that it deviates from the formula, but because the conspiracy was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The supposed star did nothing to solve the case - and no one else did - it was just a regular police job. Completely boring. You were sitting all the way and hoping it would happen - and it was nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was so much potential when he had a relative apparent abduction. Could the personal involvement of the Lieutenant finally complicate his judgment? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were that the alien did it. But surely the genius, as Lieutenant C, constantly discovers a terrible plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower, while the masked bridegroom surprises the bride, hides the body and then produces fine traces. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
