Basically, they are a couple who want to take a second child. At the adoption agency they meet the mouse (Stuart) and decide to accept it. If you think it's stupid, hold on to it because it's getting worse. Stuart arrives at his new home where he treats him as a human child. (Win me!) The rest is rather the usual cliché, family problems, jealousy from the older "brother", and ultimately all the problems are resolved and everyone is a "happy family". Boring and worn out because it is, it is also displayed in the saddest and most slimming way. I do not know if the director believed he was creative by putting the mouse in a cliché, or just trying to fill up the minutes, but only upgrading clichés from boring to nasty. So why did I put 3 and not ZERO? Because of a family cat who loves Stuart as well as a "brother". And because of the fun concerts where Stuart is making good use of his small size. Overall, I believe the movie will work well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "sibling". b. She stayed in funny concerts as if Stuart had tried to overcome a cat and left a tedious cliché that did not match anything else.
