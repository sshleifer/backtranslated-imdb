This is the first Horror film I watched, and when I almost thought I did not need to see any of the others. I've said it's a "thought male horror film," and I have to say that if it were to make me think I was a shutter to think about the shrewd movie in the collection. Do not get me wrong, nor gore in this movie makes sense to sit. The story is very emptied with too much art for sake art. Camera effects and music are out of the box most of the time, and the characters are probably banal. Several characters and scenes eventually seem to be worthless when they begin to uncover some of the "Hamiltons" hooks. I found out who Lenny was about half an hour when I shot the movie. I was so visually underlined and confused by Lenny to reveal that I felt completely ruffled. I expected what I got but could go so far, in fact, all the gore were completely flat. With movies such as "Hostel" and "Saw," you have to get a little better for a movie that is "considered to be graphic or too worrying for a general audience."
