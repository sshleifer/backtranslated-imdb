This movie was so badly written. The figures did not have depth. They should never make a movie about it. My 11-year-old son could write a better script than Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor he did not eat was the zoo keeper. He was the only funny and credible one of the lotos. I love movies and I try to give them the benefits of doubt but this one was there on my lame list at number 2. Number 1 be for you Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those of you who thought it was a good movie, you have a serious need for brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most creatures in the movie were not even dragons ... why did they call the D-War?
