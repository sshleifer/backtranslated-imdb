What a pity that Alan Clarke must be linked to this three. This does not exclude; to get a group of boys and some Stellas together, and have a whale of time that runs back and forth again and revolves around the floor in tears of laughter. Big unnecessary night things. Al Hunter's homes in the well-known theme of the late 1980s - that hooligans were well organized and did not really care about their own football - often with respectable jobs (real estate agent). But as Clarke can convince us that any one of the two-bit actors who separate from other Grange Hill TV productions or soon get into bad quality drama (Eastenders), they can believe in the nanoseconds that they are hard football criminals are bizarre . Would we really believe that the ICF (which, of course, is based on a drama) would EVER go to another city to fight only with just six blocks? The ICF would have pulled out station stations and similarly HOURS. Andy Nicholls' scene must be read before he thinks of a story of this nature. The game is scary and provides most laughter - the Oldman is so camp that it's incredible. Most of them seem to be in Mr. Matey's bubble. True inspiration for anyone who has a digital video camera that thinks he can take a picture.
