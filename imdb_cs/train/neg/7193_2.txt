I did not have absolutely anything to do last weekend, and he and his friends went to see a movie ... a movie. And because the only movie we did not see was Gadget Inspector, we decided to go for it. <br /> <br /> BIG MISTAKE. This is a movie that could only be about children. Oh, and it's not like I did not like movies aimed at a younger audience. But this film had absolutely nothing to attract my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to bed. Better than wasting heavily earned cash on it. Take a movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a baby :)
