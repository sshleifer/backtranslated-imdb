Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the black list of one of the worst movies humanity has spent. The film, one of the many movements of disabled people that arose after the phenomenal success of Black, makes ridiculing handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are just cartoons of people with disabilities. While Black portrays the charm and emotion of a disabled woman and gives us a glimpse into our world, Pyare Mohan shows two monkey monkeys who have no concern about being affected and killing half the world to protect their love affairs. Anu Malik's music is pretty fair. Vivek Oberoi, who made a promising start with Saathiyou, unfortunately in Hindu cinema soon loses his balls. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just nice girls in distress who have nightmares in Thialnde without saving them - except for the aforementioned desperads. Boman Irani, like the vile Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. If possible, avoid film.
