Rob Schneider is the famous comedic cause of his movements, his face and the show of "no people". This time is Animal. Marvin is a defector who tries to be a hero, and one day no one calls from an attacker, so Marvin has to take this case and save the infected man. But on his way to the crime scene, he collided with his car and was really damaged. He does not remember what happens and on the next day, his life is not the same when he finds he has animal instincts. Of course, we have our wife that our main character is trying to achieve, but his attempts are useless. It's played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative signs. The negative nature is fate if I use this metaphor. Marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again. By the way, his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so. The movie is so unrealistic that at some point it's stupid, but it's one of the movies, called hopeless fun as I wrote above. So look at the monkey style of Rob Schneider, but it's definitely not one of the best comedies ever, or one of the best films that Schneider will make. He's a great comic, but it's not his best movie.
