This review also includes the spoiler of the first movie - so if you did not see a movie and would not want spoilers, please read this review! <br /> <br /> The movie is about to be Christian and Kathryn meets for the first time, the film is a bad copy of the first cruel intentions. The actors who introduced Kathryn Ryan Phillipp and Kathryn Sarah Michelle Gellar are really bad substitutes. They can not even break the stinking, sentiment-rich attitude that the original actors have done. It is totally horrible that some of the dialogues were literal - not so much between the Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen enough, you will recognize it. There are also discrepancies in the plot - if it was really the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, so why is it that the Christian fell in love with the girl at the end of the film? He was supposed to be for the first time in love in the original film (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). It could also be bind with photos / "You can be a model". the end was totally feeble and did not add anything at all. Overall, this film was a waste of time. I can not believe they have done cruel intentions 3.
