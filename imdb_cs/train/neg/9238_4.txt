An unmistakable comedy that is likely to attract today's feminist teeth on the edge. Betsy Drake's salesman falls in love with the idea of ​​children and marriage and reminds her of her hopes in women's magazines until she succeeds in baiting the fashionable bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the film stretches from one vessel to another, while the inexperienced Drake watches its quarry. I think the word "perks" is just about the sum of Drake's role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of remembering her dentures I started to overdose. Grant's role is essentially secondary to his usual taste. But there is one scene that almost rescues this slim exercise. Drake is angry with the unfortunate Grant who was following his lecture in the room of the worthy ladies. Here is her exciting way of unprecedented freshness, which is really remarkable, and if production does not ruin our noses in that sincere smile for 90 minutes, the film could become more than a girl's dream dream - around 1948.
