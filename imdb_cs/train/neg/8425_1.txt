Really disgusting, shameful film, with only a small amount of real humor. The peculiar figure of my father is in extreme vulgar (deliberately so obvious) and he appears in the most pathetic, my husband and I found this movie terribly upsetting, with absolutely no redemption features at all. Frankly, I wish I had never seen it. I regard this British endeavor as ill and gross embarrassment. Those who have enjoyed this film have the ability that I am completely lacking in: being cheerful at deep corruption and annoyance. Producers should be ashamed of themselves.
