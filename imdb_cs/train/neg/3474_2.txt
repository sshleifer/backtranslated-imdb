This is a terrible thing. The character of Ben Affleck is a self-centered and cheerful sadistic - fistboy sadistic punch-you-in-the-nos. And it's a romantic HERO! His cartoon character has not changed from start to finish, but his money eventually allowed him to buy happiness. If I were a socialist, I would convince myself, but I'm not a socialist. </ br /> <br /> </ p> <p> We, the capitalists, as a little christmas charm from time to time. It is not a spell. I do not know what it is. It's scary. And it's a terrible loss of talent. O'Hara has been laughing hysterically since the late 1970s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all scarcely used. If Ben was an equation, someone could say something great.
