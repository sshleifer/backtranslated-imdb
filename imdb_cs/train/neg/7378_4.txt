To live with integrity and morality not only with people, but with all beings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it's so much better than why why the brother why ... <br /> <br /> The production of steam rollers has been sold out I promise I'm not gonna tell you Tell you the truth in the face so we can fix it. I love that some others have slept 90%, but to be fair, I was tired and had a great meal just an hour before Sensai, what are you doing? 12 million? really? you have some idea of ​​what we could do with $ 12 million. It could have been in theaters and a hit-hit hit, if you wanted, we could have donated money from a huge profit to a homeless shelter or something. These postproduction people kick you out, man does not have a choreography, we can make a better man, the eye flashing thing was from the men in the black movie, I was expecting half to appear, or Tommy Jones saying they are frogs not the eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal is an aikido gentleman, why do you do it for yourself, for us? when you came to the scene, you had such a fresh direct style and it was obvious that you were a teacher because the way your movements were so clear and sharp were watching your first three movies, I felt as if you were teaching me, now I feel that you just scrawled or something that I feel I need to save you to a friend, this time you're the one who's been killed and I'm gonna go and I'll take revenge for helping you make the best movie he ever did.
