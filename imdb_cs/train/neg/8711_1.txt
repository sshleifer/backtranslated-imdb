OK ..... This is the third of a series of carnosaurs. Allows a star with dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie you can not see the Dino cause when the body starts counting, you can see only Dino's eye vision, quite clever to hide bad puppets! and maybe 16 minutes ahead of the movie some special force team with Scott Valentine as leader Rance, the team goes into the warehouse and then they start to find parts of the body and the dead body after the Dino rampage, after some time a big box comes the team failure and you can hear a velociraptor scream , pretty scary !!! and then the black girl goes ahead and now one blooper is found! He pops up to the raptor's hand and grabs her face, but if you stop when the Raptor's hand comes, you can see that it's just a man with a hand puppet! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist attacks cause some cars to cause some weapons to be washed there. 2. They are where wrong is wrong that it's ten tons of raptors and one giant t-rex out there! How did t-Rex come in there? 3. Rance and some do not like killing dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some silly blonde girl told him to catch one of them alive = (4. Saints Jesse, predators have wheels on their actions!) 5. Dino is now on a boat in Pacific 6: Strange I did not know that t-rex had a strange thing on his neck hes ??? 7. THE END.FILM is good if you want to laugh good.
