I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally unfortunate film mixed with Todd Solondz's troublesome family reality, Todd's helpless humor. The story stretches along, and each scene is worse than the last. Maybe I missed it, but if this movie is an example of every girl's everyday experience, I am glad to be a man.
