No real conspiracy to this, just a series of short scenarios that come out of some very old jokes. I have struck once or twice at the beginning, much to my anger. Even in just 73 minutes, this movie exhausts that it's been greeted for too long and it's slow and boring (with some nudity sprinkled back and forth to wake you up). Still as bad as this movie is (and it is quite putrid), it is a comedy gem compared to almost everything Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg (Date Movie, Epic Film, Meet the Spartans) Also the song is sadly catchy in sad way. <br /> <br /> Candy eye: 11 kits, 3 shrubs, 3 asses <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Original trailer for this movie ; and trailers for "Doom", "Dead Pit", "Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
