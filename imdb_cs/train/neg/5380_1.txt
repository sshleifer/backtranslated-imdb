At the time of writing this review, it would seem that more than 50% of IMDb voters gave this film a rating of 10 or 1. I can only assume that those who gave him ten were either crew members or crew members. <br /> <br /> They say that because of the abundance of monkeys and plenty of time and enough typewriters, those monkeys just accidentally imbedded on the keyboard will eventually print Shakespeare's complete works. However, I seriously doubt that, given that it is the same number of monkeys and time, you can find a single movie that would get this movie 10 points. I watched the first half patiently, humiliating that the film would develop at some level either a plot or characters, or perhaps some sort of social commentary, or barely intellectual thinking. Otherwise, I was totally prepared to accept action, tension, comedy, horror, or even gratuitous sex as a way to keep my attention. Finally, I was disappointed, and as a result, much of the other half was seen at double speed because I was looking for a small snippet of cinematographic redemption in vain. Unfortunately, he was not. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" opposed the episode of Scooby Doo, I'm afraid the cartoon will win hands down in terms of secrets, intrigue and unpredictability. And to talk about cartoon characters, the acting abilities of the various members varied between acceptable (at best) and embarrassing poor when Brooke Bailey portrayed a sinister, obsessed, pseudo-goth in London and was so bad that I was almost sorry. br /> <br /> I would like to end up with a positive impact, but even the soundtrack, the second rated feast of contemporary punk rock, did not even worry, let alone help to improve the very bad motion.
