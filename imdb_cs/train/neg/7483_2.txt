One would think (like me) that Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese should be at least decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) produced some of the funniest comedies of all time. Well, it seemed to me that I was grossly wrong - it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I mean, how one joke after another is so deeply unhappy. I hurt to look at those talented actors who perform one of the most remarkably charming scripts I had to meet. I started out exclusively from big names, I stayed long enough for the duration of the film but did not provide any entertainment. <br /> <br /> Usually as with movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased commentaries and broad generalizations. But with this movie, it's hard not to miss. I can count on one hand, maybe even with two or three fingers, with the main Hollywood productions that have left me more bitter than this. It's simply one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy - I did. But out of town, it is unfortunately disappointed. If you really want time-consuming fun, just take your money and watch it swirl when you flush it to the toilet. Just please do not watch this movie.
