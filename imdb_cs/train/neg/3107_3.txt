Woody Allen made a "September", which shows that even genius could disappear. This is "shining" Mel Brook. Monumentally stupid, boring and unhappy, I must admit that I did not get it to the end. Flick ranks among the worried few (like "The Pit Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") that either forced me to sleep or forced me to get to the "back" button. And I say it sadly as a devoted fan of Mel Brooks. He should keep a straight comedy and leave the commentary on his own. How would the same person who did the "Young Frankenstein" and "Space Spheres" could jump off such a dog that is outside of me. To avoid at all costs.
