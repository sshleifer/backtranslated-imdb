Even though 99.99% of people who have seen this movie are Brazilian, I will keep up with English because it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit cr * p. The worst acting I've seen for a lot of time. Children are terrible. Especially the boy. It was the first time I saw anyone with less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger and the only tone of voice, like a 5-year-old guy read in front of the class. How can someone be so bad as the film's main actor? Give it so shallow that my daughter could have better (she's been 3 years old). It's so simple that it can be written in a napkin and told in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three options for someone enjoying this movie: 1) you are preschool; 2) You have devised Globo's stupidity that you think everything Globo's seal is amazing; 3) you have serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! Damage to the Brazilian film scene.
