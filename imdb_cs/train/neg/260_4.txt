Well, I can and will be very short. This is an incorrectly balanced, unconvincing film that could be a bit better. It seems that the script does not know what direction ... from fun to serious clich√© ... it's a little stupid. And that's too many things we heard before "the hacker is in Florida or not, he's in Madrid, nobody is in ... a bad signal." <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
