This is a 30 minute one-joke show. Joke, the Cavemen are not fair. Ha ha ha !!! He can not dial the phone because he's Caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as humans. Oh, uh, those Cavemen are so helpless. There is no humor in this show. They can take this long joke for so long and already have Geico ads. This show does not deserve a period of time at the National T.V. <br /> <br /> This show is trying hard to be funny, but it's not. Watching this show I thought it was like "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show". That means going to the bar and trying to sleep with many women. The crying cave is unpleasant. Caveman with glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). The three of them have personalities, but I can not see why I do not care.
