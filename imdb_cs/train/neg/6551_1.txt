Studying in the wrong. Bad dealings, bad music, bad scenario, bad edits, bad direction and bad idea. Pieces of slices do not come any cheesier or inadvertently more fun than this ... thing. By the end of the movie, you do not understand why they are being bothered at first. Bad Malcolm McDowell, was he lacking cash or something? Still thinking about it? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you did not die in laughter in the first thirty minutes, you will see when you see cyborg city called "Cytown". Avoid this, my friends loving film. Avoid.
