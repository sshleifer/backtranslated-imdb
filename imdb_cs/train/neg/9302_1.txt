This movie is terrible. It's boring, it's low quality, actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen, and the script is so bad that it's funny. The "main" actor should be the hot guy who gets all the girls but it's ugly, overweight and looks like it's since the early 1990's. All the characters are gone at the end of the week to get together among friends but no one is actually friends! The couple did not see the "main" boy in more than 5 years, and even then they were not really friends. The "date" of the main man knows him only from work and before there is the girl they chose at the bar. Now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even real friends. Because that's what he's doing at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Do not waste a minute of your time on this lemon. I've made home movies more terrifying than this! <br /> <br />
