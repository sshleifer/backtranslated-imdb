First of all, I'm white, so I'm trying to cover the ever smoother object of the race ... White people hate Black people = BAD, but Blacks hate the White people = OK (because we obviously deserved it!). where should I start? I wish I had something good to say about this film as an unintentional comic scene: the infamous scene was Ice Cube and what. get into the fight with some really big, really strong, really angry and terrifying looking neo-Nazis and win! neo-Nazis who have a double size :) and persecution! the chase is invaluable ... This is not a film about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not ... it's a racist film that reaffirms all clich√© stereotypes, white crazy guys, black roommate automatically transforms into a skinhead ... cmon simply terribly I like to regret seeing her sometimes. <br /> <br /> Save time and the terrible experience of a badly written, poorly spoken, boring and obviously biased image if you're in the subject, go and borrow American history X, now it's a movie
