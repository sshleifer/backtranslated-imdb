Despite favorable reviews and screenings at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. The story is very similar to other films in which a teenage girl from the immigrant family needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to fight the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. He does this by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy who, for some reason, falls in love with her, he is struggling with her problems and wins. In Girlfight it's a box, Go it like Beckham, it's football, and now it's Kung Fu. But Fighter is a much worse product than these two, it was just awkward to watch. Semra Turan, an actress who plays the role of a teenage girl, may do a lot of things, but one thing she can not do is act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions, are horrible, her body and facial tongue are amateur actresses, poorly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but it just can not save this cliche film with stereotypical characters and shallow conspiracy. In addition to several relatively good moments, this film has nothing new or interesting. <br /> <br /> Even kung fu fighting is not the reason why it will look, it's so boring. Slow motion was really unnecessary, choreography was basic and lacked inspiration, and most kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kung-fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks like when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them to their feet. <br /> <br /> The only reason why this movie was perceived is that it is European. It is very easy to post this film - The first Danish film about martial arts, but do not be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about a silly teenage girl and her troubles, which by the way are not really convincing. Bad film with embarrassing lines, gambling and story.
