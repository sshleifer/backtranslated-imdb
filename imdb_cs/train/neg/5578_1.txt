Even if you got through the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the sixties (ok, so Katie did not join the Manson family and nobody died in Altamont), this movie was still incredibly terrible. I had the impression that the "writers" had just stranded in the room watching the films "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's 60s films, and called him research. Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode of "spinning head". He was right.
