Pros: nothing <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: everything <br /> <br /> Drawing summary: The reporter runs into a hitchhike that tells stories about the deaths of people who have been killed by zombies. > <br /> Review: Never in my life did I encounter a movie like the zombie Chronicles. Filmed for a budget of about $ 20, TZC is a horror horror movie that depends on lame, forgotten actors who could not act to save their lives, and that it is rougher than frightening. How does such a movie even happen? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. My Last 2 Cents: Humorously, this movie was made by a film company called Brain Damage Films. They are brains that must be really damaged to come up with such a big film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it was me, this movie would get a rating of negative bajillion)
