It was a classic case of something that should never be. Gloria was now her mother, her husband left because she would not live with her in a community (he was angry that Reagan was elected and wanted to turn to society). That's when I had problems with the series - come on, I say, is the same noble Michael Stivic, who fought Archie Bunker's right-wing philosophies? The series went on but she just had no pizzazz. Regardless of the strength of Sally Struthers from the whole family, it was long gone. Perhaps if the series were given other names and was presented as completely independent of All In The Family, it could work. Well, that's a show business.
