During the Civil War there were many cases of loyalty; apparently many occurred "in the border states", where the north met with southern geography. The young father, Owen Moore, leaves the border to join the Union Army. In short, Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, wanders on the enemy's property, desperate for water; finds an offer where the young daughter of Unionist Gladys Egan is sitting. When the Yankee soldiers watch him, Little Gladys innocently helps to hide the Confederate. Later, when he returns to kill his father, the girl's favor is recalled. Sweet, little story by director D.W. Griffith. Location and humanity are lovingly displayed. <br /> <br /> **** In the border states (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
