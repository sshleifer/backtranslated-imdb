[1] Adam Arkin is more than Whitney Ross Geller of "Friends" <br /> <br /> 2) Great cast is useless (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The film suffers from severe stimulation. It jumps around in a mixed, confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) The story does not make sense. Why does he want to break football? What about silly violin music? None of this is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not funny either. It's like a lot of accountants trying to make improvisation, saying, "Look at me, look, I'm funny!" It was a bad attempt to make another "Love At First Bite". I like Larry Cohen's movies, but I did not succeed here. I could not wait for the credits to return. Frustrated disappointed.
