In the event that half of the movie's record looks strangely familiar, it means you're looking at that cruel Italian crap! You see, the well-known demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, but he also freely re-used the most sinister sequences of killing in his own (and more easily traceable) "Cat in the Brains." An opening scene in which a prostitute is brutally uprooted with an ax is part of Fulci's later film and makes another handful of killings and bloody moments. Andra Bianchi's "Masssacre" is disappointingly disappointed as a giallo, as finding a sadistic murderer among the film crew by shooting a horror movie is just insurmountable and thrilling, but it's still a good fun if you get into cheap waste. The uncompromising screenplay features a host of rebellious characters who are all potential maniacs, but none of the red actors that Biachi is coming up with is acceptable and you can immediately alert the killer. Whatever you need to enjoy, there are really misogynistic make-up effects and horrible scary actor cast performances. Whenever there is no bloodshed on the screen, as between the first and second murders, "Massacre" is slow and almost unbearable with its vicious dialogues and thoroughly exhaustive photographs. Fortunately, in the second half there are women who got on the support, and the men were stabbed repeatedly with rusted tips. Music is dirty and the use of movie places is very unimaginable. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight to the above "Cat in the Brain". He has all the great moments of "massacre" and then some.
