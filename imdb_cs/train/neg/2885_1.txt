I can not really say what I think about this film, its instructions, I've watched a lot of movies and this has to be the worst, extremely low budget, I guess that all the money went cave scenes, because I was able to do better work with the 8mm black and white camera and the crew monkey. It was so bad that I only registered to comment, because I had to tell someone there was not enough room to borrow the movie. But that's my two cents worth, I propose to borrow it from some lean juice that she rented and looked at herself. Because I would certainly not waste money on it again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you did not find a place to rent when it does not pay you money. =)
