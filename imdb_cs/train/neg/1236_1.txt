What ever happened to one of the most innovative and great narrators of our time? Well, he did the typical summer feeding that could be managed by any of the movie schools ... and in fact they would probably have done a better job. At least they would have put half the thoughts in the horrible scenario. Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through a wormhole and landed on a planted controlled apes. (except that people rely on dialogue, meaningless rendering, and spectacular special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could be allocated to about ten independent films that would be considered a "masterpiece" beside this trips. Just as I like the excellent acting talent of Tim Roth, his performance as the leader of the ominous Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of stupidity and heavy breathing. Luckily for him, makeup allows him to retain some dignity as actor, and most of the crap- the dialogue is hidden behind its moaning and sniffles.And unfortunately, always reliable Hollywood tradition as a man and a woman leads and connects them at the end without any relationship of development or cause.And "haha, are we so smart that?" so that Hollywood it goes to this link from the original POTA. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing it, spend the night and call your friends and to rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman' or, to a lesser extent, 'Sleepy Hollow' and remember the days when Tim Burton was a man of sight and originality ... not shame and mockery.
