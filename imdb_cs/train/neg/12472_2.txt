Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Take a few cute animals, some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you will find that you are with almost such a replica of this movie. I remember seeing it when I was younger; I gave my mother rento from a video rental store about five times. The story itself is not too bad, but every Marxist who is following should certainly complain. If you do not like America, you will not enjoy this movie.
