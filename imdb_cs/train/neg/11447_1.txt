Perhaps the worst film I've ever seen; After the first ten minutes, I was ready to leave. The only people laughing at the theater were tweens. Do not get me wrong, I love stupid, stupid movies just like any other gal, but the whole assumption, writing and humor has faded away. It seemed to me that the concept of "Napoleon Dynamite" was going to be a strange and random scene that would lead to a cult audience. Instead it ended up being forced, unpleasant and weird. The only clear light was Isle Fisher, and I felt totally terrible that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this terrible thing. /> <br /> Thank you for not paying for it.
