I am 17 and I still like most of Scooby Doo and old episodes. I like movies from the nineties, and recently we were treated to one of Scooby Doo's best direct trips this decade, Scooby Doo and the goblin king I did not expect to be as good as he was. Anyway, back to help you! I was looking at some episodes and I was expecting something very good, but from what I saw I did not even experience it. First I hated the animation. It was a flat, deflated and very Saturday morning - cardboard - the standard, easy worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hated were a bit better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma, and Daphne when they added a lot of old episodes when Scooby Doo was positive. I also hated character changes because it seemed that instead of solving the mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were playing a superhero, something they would never do in movies or in Scooby-Doo. Where are you? show. The melody theme was not very good, I can not remember it, and the jokes were lame and sad. Still, I admit that there is a very talented voice, if they had a better material and it was not said to sound different from the original voices that are humanly possible, which I would do. Finally, I personally thought it was awful and I did not try to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
