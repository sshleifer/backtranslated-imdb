Our teacher showed us this movie in the first class. I have not seen it since then. I just watched the trailer. Does it look like the first movie? I think yes. I was so horrified with this film, I could barely watch it. It was mainly a scene when Shirley McClain sliced ​​the girl in half and then he was a ketchup boy! I was terrified by this film. Now that I was 20 years old, I would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and the idea that maybe young children would not see this movie, even though it is PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes that children should show. I do not even remember what it was, once it was enough!
