If you did not know what this movie was going to do during the first five minutes, do it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She stayed too long on the shelf and wanted to explode. She has a teenage daughter who only points out that he is not younger. When checking her daughter, she finds a world that never dared ... a cabaret where the belly dancing in a scaly twisted outfit while the men throw money on her. The film is a very misogamist. The depiction of men is grim. Which is somewhat weird as Lilia tries to walk around and not for money, but just for hell. When they wake up, she again feels like a woman. He does not want to join them, but depends on attention. Other dancers are mostly aging women who look like men in a turn and realize that their time in the reflector is short-lived. That's not enough. She found romance, no matter how brief, you realized that ... No surprise we saw. Although the end is good, you realize that it could not end in any other way. Perhaps the film just does not focus on my demographic - 30 men
