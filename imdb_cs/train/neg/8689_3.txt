The main problem in "Power" is that it's also that they can be insignificant characters and subplots that do not add anything to the movie. After a while he is bored, sitting around waiting for scenes that will not join and find something that would move the movie forward. You could probably omit it as a character's evolution, but they're all either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie, or they're just plain and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to leave a supporting cast flower. He had to cut off several characters (hackman, wife) and concentrate on the others (Billings). It could have been a big, heavy political thriller, instead of being a messy mess that loses some message in the sea of ​​bad writing and acting, which amazed me when I was considering casting. Even the performance of Gene Hackman was not up to par. Denzel Washington is the only real actor here. Gere and others have done much better performances elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet has to return to the wild one man he did in the 1970s (Serpico) and has stopped trying to regain his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe." Sidney has not worked yet, and most likely it will never be. leave the Altman drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
