The title was "Walker". But he was walking. <br /> <br /> The film was nothing good. The film's description does not really correspond to the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a little life a terrible man. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry to spend money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I stayed hoping it would be better ... what a mistake. I was worse. If there is a suggestion that I can make the producer move his life to another field because filming is definitely not his cup of tea
