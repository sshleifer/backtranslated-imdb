I started out for several years who are lying on these boards because of the total lack of intelligence that is communicated through reviews that regularly appear on the IMDb space of this film. I saw this movie with the New York Asian Metro Film Festival (which this year had an otherwise excellent selection of films, seeing the vital snake in June, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and every day regretted that the scene from this film will turn away from the back of my mind and becomes a living memory. I'm sure you can read the censorship of the film from Subway Cinema, which is probably why I made the mistake of pulling my friend into the movie. This description has created the kind of horror film I longed for for a while, which is more of a horror than a cheap fear. P was actually different. He relied on cheap laughter. An incredibly annoying announcer described this film as "Lesbians to fight monsters." Totally untrue. In this movie, a subplot is created to make it appear that the relationship between the girl and the Pookie is somewhere else. More lies. This movie looks like an abbreviation for "Are you afraid of the darkness?" The story is ridiculous and managed to make a laugh and confusion from the audience after eventually canceling their attempt to view this film with any seriousness and trying to forget the $ 9 they lost behind the door. I almost wished Paul Spurrier to become an audience and ask him why he had lost 5 years in Thailand to make a bad softcore horror-cum porn that belonged to the root channel that won the actress excommunicated from her family, and aroused a little stir at the Belgian film festival. The only stirring that he had was in the lower part of his stomach because he could not get away from what he was. Anyway, I hope I can distract someone who would make a serious mistake in this movie, it was really one of my best 3 worst movie experiences and I was eliminating the soul to number two.
