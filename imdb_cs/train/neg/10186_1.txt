Where's Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the many MST3K seasons, but this precious first season (K-20 episode) is one of the worst movies he ever did. The three stars, Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, are fighting the worst cinematographs in history, and they deliver lines that had to be written by a Dick Cheney-based secret group composed of Exxon and GM lawyers who are trying to cut funds for mass transit and energy efficiency research. It looks like it was shot in almost complete darkness, maybe on Super 8. Logan's run looks like a film Sistine Chapel crossed by Shakespeare. I can not imagine it without commenting on Crow and the Servos, for it is also inconsistent with it. Obviously, what is needed in Hollywood is a kind of 401K that prevents actors from getting to such bad movies to pay for their health care. With my "Pollution and Control Rights" topic by the end of the half, I expect to see the Charlton Heston camera, where it gives "frosty hands". Lee, could I forgive you in 1989, but in 1981?
