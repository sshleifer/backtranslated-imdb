A rather stupid attempt at a secret-thriller like Hitchcock, who probably exchanged spy for archeology and based Robin Cook's novel; by the way, I recently received another adaptation of my work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmar. Of note, director Schaffner has just produced BRAZILS (1978) - a similarly spectacular but much more eye-catching suspicion, and unfortunately SPHINX was a false move from which his impressive career has not recovered. <br /> <br /> Despite its size and reasonably decent cast, however, it turned out to be a critical and commercial flop - mainly because narration is simply not very exciting: in fact, it is quite terrible (weak attempts at horror - the archaeological heroine is dealing with disgust, rotting corpses and even attacking the bats of bats - in spite of that). Lesley Anne-Down is a beautiful front lady who is struggling with the lost treasure - it's actually hidden in the local sector to prevent it from getting into the hands of foreigners who have appropriated much of the land's heritage (under the guise of culture) for too long. Sir John Gielgud soon emerges as a stepless antique dealership that paves the way down and pays for his "betrayal of betrayal" with his life. It is usually shown that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so seemingly allies (for example, Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, whom I saw in London at the beginning of 2007 in a performance West End "Frost / Nixon," which has now become a movie), goes from Down's antagonist to her lover and back because he has decided to keep the wealth of Egyptian Grand Duke Menephta's national treasure.
