I watched for about 30 minutes in this film before I finally got into pain to get into this movie. Soundtrack, the so-called 'fence' and every actor. It's as if everyone thought they were the main part of the film and screaming "NOTICE ME!" again and again. The bad guy has his bad music and he says ominous bad things like you did not quite get. Good man does brave and noble things only if you did not know he's a good guy. And, oh, the airplane scene. "My husband is wrong, he is a god! He is imperceptible to get to his feet or go to the toilet or something, he must have gone!" (And yes, I know, his dress is still there, but honestly, she woke up and started panic until she had time to look at the goddamn place she was in.) <br /> <br /> A religious girl, I would apologize to his loss of the film that was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want to come back for 30 minutes.
