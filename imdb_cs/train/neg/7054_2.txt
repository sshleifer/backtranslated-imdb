This movie was totally pathetic. The pious scenario and the lack of any story left me watching the three fools flush the bikini. Sometimes I felt I was watching Beavisa and Butthead. I could not sit with the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints and Hrshitta Bhatt does not act at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only useful part of the film is spoof Anu Malik and his obsession with shayaris. It was quite funny. The songs "Sini Ne" and his remix version were really good. You can always count on the Emran closure and tap. Overall, Emran does not seem to have a good script from Bhatta who would support this one.
