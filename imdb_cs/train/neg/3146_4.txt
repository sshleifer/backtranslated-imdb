the author of the book with the same title should not let his name be used for this movie. if you read a book, this film has such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have little in common except for the title and some superficial details. the film does not provide anything in terms of artistic merit, the literary success of the book. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. not only that the story moves incredibly slowly but does not offer anything more when it moves slowly (for example, character development). some viewers might have fun with some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later in the movie, but you can also watch the showtime special for the things they show in therese and isabelle - its rather tedious and at all imaginative.
