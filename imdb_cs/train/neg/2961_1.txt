I was watching a family of three little children for the night and their mother gave me this to show them they were just caught on Wal-Mart earlier in the week. All three children are really ill while watching. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all picked up from school, but it really could be the movie. Absolutely disgusting. How can someone produce this caliber of waste is outside of me. Fortunately, I turned off the film when I noticed that the children did not react and act strangely. For all parents, I strongly recommend that you refrain from allowing this film to small children.
