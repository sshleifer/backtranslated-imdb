Battle scenes play as slow as Jackie Chan, and joke attempts are pathetic (the worst quarrel far, "Guess what, this time I've heard you come"). Stars are inadequate: Brandon Lee, in spite of the terrible lines he calls himself, actually shows the traces of charisma and charm on the screen - things Dolph Lundgren completely freed (at least in this film). Note to the director: In the future, please keep away from all the love scenes, especially when your main actress will not make any nakedness and you have to rely on the body twice. (* 1/2)
