I saw a capsule comment that said "great acting." In my opinion, there are two great actors who make tremendous performances and zero chemistry amongst themselves, as a great director in his worst worst effort. Robert De Niro must be the most important and most important illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance is inconveniently moving across the map because he obviously has no role in this character, mainly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses would be too fast adjectives for this unbearable stimulation. Although the intention of the film is to be an uplifting story about the treatment of illiteracy, watching it is a true "bummer". I give it 1 in 10, which is really one of the worst 20 films for the budget I've ever seen.
