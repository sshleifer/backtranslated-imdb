Or listen. Even a soundtrack is a hole. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this is not the worst gay movie I've seen (which would have been Billy's), but it's very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing stretches, stretches and trains. It's not that the conspiracy is sad - in the hands of a good writer it could work. . . it could definitely be much more fun. There is no land that you could not see arriving ten kilometers down the road. Dialog is flat. Jokes are old. To add an insult to injury, it is full of one-dimensional stereotyped homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or relationship of both leads is possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact no evidence of why the leaders love each other. . . we are only informed that they are in love. It's hard to guess if they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. Do they have the same book? Play? It is not bad at all, but the movement is unbearably slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch - slow but not Jarmusch's quality. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, avoid this.
