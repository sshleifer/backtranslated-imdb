First of all, it seems Jon Bon Jovi is not in the movie of vampires. Together with other not so interesting characters and a bad story, the film is predictable. If you remember it and you are a fan of vampires, you can have some fun with some scenes. Do not expect any Tarantino-style chapters or Anna Rice's story. (I expect tomorrow to forget the whole movie;)
