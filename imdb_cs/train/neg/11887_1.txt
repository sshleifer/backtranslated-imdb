The world may end. Unfortunately, this film survived as another proof of the Canadian inability to shoot films that are ominous. Maybe it's because all our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short et al.) Go to Hollywood.) In fact, it's too bad. Short film was not occupied in this tremendously demanding and banal film. He could give him credibility. The Canadian government should realize - and this film is a magnificent example - that shoveling money into a trough does not lead to a good cinema. If people who overcame these public funds had to compete, they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile. Just like they caused another mistake.
