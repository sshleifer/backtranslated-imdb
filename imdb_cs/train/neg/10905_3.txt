Guy is defeated. I can not get girls, they have to build, they are picked by stronger, more successful boys, etc. You saw it, they saw it, they went on. I have to say that Rob has to pass Adam Sandler's life. And get out of the grounds Adam Sandler. There are two fun parts throughout the movie. I could not finish the last 5 minutes. It bored me. The "Animal" is all right. I usually like Adam Sandler movies that have the same conspiracy. But it tried to impress powerfully. Jokes are very old. So believe me. It's not a movie that most people really could get. But some of them did, so I'll be nice. 3/10
