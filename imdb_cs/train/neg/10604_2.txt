This time, the hero of the first film became a human, and this time he uses flip-flops and legs against super-universal soldiers and a computer that has gone mad and is willing to take over the world. I'm pretty sure it was a Double Team that convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing observable actions. However, it was that his credibility scratched forever. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as boring as the Double Team or The Quest, it's still quite horrible, with no style and taste original and no stellar pairing. This sequel is simply done for children who have a professional match. When I look back, even the action sequences were not so exciting, so this movie is a worthless fool. In other words, another clunker in the Van Damme assembly line. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (bad)
