That was the far and the worst movie I've ever seen all my life. It was slow, boring, not frightening, fun, not dramatic, and not fun. Sarah Michelle Gellar was in her old show of empty expressions of fear and shock. She could not sell her figure, nor could she have any more in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought the grudge was "okay," then do not look for it if you do not get time and your life. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for free by not wanting it to come as a hurray from a man who lost $ 8 to a terrible movie. It was free, it was still sucking, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
