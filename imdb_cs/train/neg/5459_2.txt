This is a very short episode that appeared in 1971 in one of the "Night Galleries" performances. The episode was played by Sue Lyon (Lolita's film fame) and Joseph Campanella, who play a baby sitter and a vampire. The vampire hires a child who looks at his child (who looks like a werewolf or monster) while he is walking for the blood at night. The baby sitter remembers the appearance of the vampire when she first sees her, and only begins to put together two and two when she notices that she does not have a reflection in the mirror, has a special book in the occult library, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes with the baby. He realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought was originally. She leaves the door, the vampire looks confused and the episode is over. I do not know what purpose it was to make such a shortened episode that lasted only five minutes. They simply had to extend the earlier episode for the same 5 minutes and skipped this. Total unnecessary effort.
