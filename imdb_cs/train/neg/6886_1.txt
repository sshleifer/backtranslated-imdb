John Heder was absolutely scary in this movie. I felt like watching a bad college actor for the first time in a cold movie. Anna Farris was par for this course, she's not good, but she's not terrible (plus she's cute). Diane Keaton was supposed to know better. Jeff Daniels was the only rescue ploy in this film (though it was also a bad judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> Overall, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm just glad I did not see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder hangs forever in rolls of the "Drop Cat" role unless he does some SERIOUS work on his cats.
