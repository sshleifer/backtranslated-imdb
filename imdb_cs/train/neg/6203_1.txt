I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was terrible! Every clich√©, violent rich creative imagination was on display, she knew how it would end up with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl. The worst part was Questions and Answers with a director / writer and writer / producer trying to meet as intellectuals, but you could say that they are the ones who get into violence. I bet on anything that makes brothels more and makes drugs. Do not waste time. I had to keep my friend away from him.
