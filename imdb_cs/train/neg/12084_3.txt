<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> in the 1st <br /> <br /> 4th actor for leadership - who does not feel like playing a role And you get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark" I listened to the radio play "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell Hamlet and I disappointment. I was hoping the filmed version would be better that Schell would have at least the body language that would underline what he says - nothing. Then set ... the minimalist design is not everybody's taste, but I usually like it when there's enough on stage to make clear what is setting up and nothing more. Unfortunately, it's on the stage, in the theater. It will not work in a game based movie that really has a credible setting. That the idea of ​​the set was copied from the theatrical production in which Schell played Hamlet anymore ... let's say if it was the only thing I was complaining about ... I ask myself how Schell could get part of Hamlet anywhere in the first place and how could someone let Hamlet play for the second time. If you have the chance to view any of the sixty Hamlet-based movies, do not look at it unless you are a masochist or really a hardcore or enjoy playing fun on unstable actors.
