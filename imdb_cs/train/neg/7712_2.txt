<br /> <br /> Attack of murderous tomatoes is a "parody" of bad movies, ending worse than movies that spoofs. (Very modest) The story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them poorly. It basically rotates and grows up (yes, they grow up) and another thing you know is covered with ketchup. Actors are non-names that never make films after movies, so there was no point in naming them. There is one guy who is hired by the government to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black guy who is the master of disguise and a girl and a guy who gets immersed. Anyway, there is another woman spying on the first person who works for the government. If it does not make sense to you, you understand. This movie would never be very good, but it lacks the fun of laughing on stupid scenes of the attack. The movie is terribly glamorous, which, though it's all, really hurts what could (sensibly) be a fun movie. At one point, huge waxy tomatoes "slip" on an uncovered wooden plank with wheels on it! Maybe I would recommend the movie if it had a nice value in the camp, but it even lacked this horrible movie. 2/10
