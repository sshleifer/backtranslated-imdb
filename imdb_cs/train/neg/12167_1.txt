Despite being a stronger original, it is rather a comical remake on Friday, the 13th week, which involved another explosion of psychopathic Angela, who killed more juvenile adolescents for "immorality" in the camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (sister Bruce) looks great. There are some pretty sex scenes with some pretty scary girls, but the movie is (unintentionally) comical rather than thrilling, it's a smell. <br /> <br /> * from ****. <BR/> <br /> MPAA: R rated for graphic violence and gore, nudity and for some sexuality, language and drug use.
