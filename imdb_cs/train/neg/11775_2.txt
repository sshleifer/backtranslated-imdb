Watching "Step" I'd like to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this film: flat main characters - absolutely no development, for example, Kroko's metaphorical German problem child remains a pure metaphor without the ability to engage positively, although it has rather a few false chances. Unprivileged actors, not growing conspiracy. I think the film tried to research the environment, but it did not succeed: the camera appeared shaken rather than motivated. Images were low - contrasting, gray and dark - I'm sure they deliberately, but the ingredients did not reach a convincing impression of the social environment. The story had some potential but could become a good story.
