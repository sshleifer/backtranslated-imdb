Someone edited this movie? Or was it just a DVD release that had a huge thirty-second gap between the scenes? It's okay, even though I fell asleep for the first time. Then I fell asleep for the second time and a third time. The plot is not really the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's close. Acting is not the worst thing I've ever seen ... but it's close. Production ... well, I can honestly say that was the worst I've ever seen in my life! He did not try to be malicious, but Unhinged could use some other production. Please do not think I'm hating horror films or even I did not like this movie. I just felt like laughing at the film much more than I felt like laughing at him. The terrible moments were not too bad, but they could have been even better, even with a big budget. <br /> <br /> The characters looked awkwardly developed or ignored together, the twisting of the end was pretty bad and the exposure lasted forever without revealing so much. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this film be avoided. <br /> <br /> 1/10
