I'm not sure how they are related, but I'm pretty sure Lost and Delirious are the remake of this movie (or the story on which it's based). Very similar phrases and even some scenes and files seem very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so look at it instead. <br /> <br /> One moves very slowly, but it is a French film from the late 1960s. He said from feedback from one of the girls who attended school. Editing memories with current scenes is initially somewhat unclear, especially because of the sound of each overlap (ie, Hearing Samples while viewing the presence and vice versa). Also "girls" are a little old to think they are in a boarding school. Finally, there are not so many characters that even get you to the movie.
