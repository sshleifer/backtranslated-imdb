I will be so short because such a film does not deserve a complete review. <br /> <br /> Because of the setting, this movie could be something special. It could be another "28 days later" or even "The Blair Witch Project" <br /> <br /> I was really excited about the first 20 minutes of films, directer did a decent job of cinematography and tension even though I do not think he managed to capture the true enthusiasm of the empty London Underground. <br /> <br /> The characters were large. Our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece of bullshit and really does not matter if it dies or not. As many people have said earlier, I was rooted for homeless and black boys who managed to laugh or two (whether intentionally or not). The main villain, staying in the dark for the first half of the film, but when he was exposed, I was really disappointed. I do not want to spoil it, but let's just say my 10 year old sister would probably beat him in a match for the match. Overall, it's just another average horror film that falls into the trap of the simple Hollywood pattern. This film had a lot of potential, but it really did not hit it. Just to emphasize how horrible the film was, the characters in this film had to finish at least five times and kill the main villain. YOU ENTER THAT YOU ARE REMOVED.
