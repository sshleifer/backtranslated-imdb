I appreciate the need to hire strangers for such "horror" films, but they should hire at least some good actors. In particular, the sergeant is guilty of using his monotone on the bulldozer every line he has. But tell me, lines are not really important. There is no truly conspicuous plot, so most of the writing involves the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r, and another varied bad language instead of proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> "The story", as it is, is mostly formed by a seemingly random gore and death, with some "surprises" that happen about ten minutes after you see exactly what you are about to become. Not only this, but there are a few sharp holes and mistakes of continuity (Why does he go there? He did not have a gun? Was not he dead?) So, it seems like the whole movie looks like it's been trimming for several hours, which will take time to fix it. Another movie that simply relies on blood and gore instead of some real movie experience.
