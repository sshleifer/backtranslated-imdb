... but I regret seeing it. Since the IMDb ratings are relatively high (and had to be relatively high on Netflix), I think I put it in the queue as it is advertised as a fine comedy from the UK, a category that produced many films that I they loved it immensely. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls into the category of laughing comedies, usually occupied by Hollywood movies, which produce and control impassive. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress and I loved her in other movies. Concept - a gardener who grows marijuana to overcome the loss she encounters in confronting her husband's death - does not offend me. Despite the strenuous effort made by the cast to produce humor, the film falls flat on his face (crashing on the ass could be more fun) as far as me and my wife are concerned. Be warned in advance, oh gentle reader, not all uncompromising British comedians will succeed. This is crazy.
