By the end of the movie, I felt it was too technical. It seemed like I was in a classroom that watched our navy carry out a rescue at sea. I enjoyed the engines with fire extinguishers. I think I had to think of it before, but I never thought about it. Using 747 to transport valuable old images with very little certainty is odd and unrealistic. The game was pretty good, as they are mostly experienced professionals, but if you are so far from what would most likely have happened, it should be fantasy, comic, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the film had Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, a night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The film was filled with familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood has to make a little bit of a drama, but it worsens the quality of the movie when a serious object becomes a cartoon. That's why I said it should be comic. My pet is frantic with movies about airline travel is that everyone just moves informally. He passes around with drinks, writes them and picks them up 5 minutes later, as if they were in the building or something, and they behaved as if the turbulence simply did not exist. I also know it's a catastrophic film, but the tension after what has hit does not have to involve a 30-second crash. However, experienced actors and actresses maintain this weak scenario from a film that has been preserved after the first speech. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch how a psychotic man is hiding ... :)
