The scientist and his girlfriend are out when his acceleration causes a car crash. Escape undamaged, but it is barked. Saves her head, brings her to her house and keeps her alive (!!!!). Then it continues searching for models and remover for the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant looks over his head, who starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathic) connection to the deformed monster in the closet .... As you can see, it's pretty stupid things, but I had a certain love for it. When I grew up in the late 1970s, local TV stations viewed this movie about 20 times a year (without exaggeration). They showed it on Saturday afternoon television - uncut. Seeing it on TV was great then! Explicit blood and gore along with terrible monster and bad sexploitation - who cares if it was good? I see it now, I realize how bad it is. The effects are totally unfortunate, production values ​​do not exist, the script is pretty stupid and (except that it's still a really nasty gore) it's boring stuff. There is also a slight cat fight between two women and certainly a great monster at the end. Also add to the end that leaves tons of free ends. This is an interesting example of the film exploitation of the 1960s. On the other hand, it is total waste. Either way, it's not a good movie, but it's necessarily-seen (only once) for fans of horror and gore. <br /> <br /> And laughing head is pretty scary. Make a note of the end credits that got the wrong name TITLE (called "HEAD that would not die")!
