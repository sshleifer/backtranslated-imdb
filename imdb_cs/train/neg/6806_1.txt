Except for all technical mistakes .... And what a female stewardess who is able to kill, by itself, 4 out of 7 terrorists (including ex-marines), 2 of which without a gun. Then the plane lands perfectly. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about regular, frightened, yet very well-composed flight service. : D The leader of the assault / rescue team has full proof (according to the logic of the script) the plan of the burned people and someone in his team to fly the plane. Only he decides when he changes the plans and instead leads to the terrorist attack, the weapons light, do not know where the terrorists are or how much, and they do not provide an advantage so that the whole team gets easily destroyed. Yeah, it uses old noggin. Only later decided to use the sleeping gas. And it is useless for all intense purposes. <br /> <br /> Bad because this movie was, although I could not stop watching and thinking, what next? : D I can not imagine that all the excellent, unemployed scriptwriters think it's not fair. lol! : D
