My headline says everything. Let me make it clear. If you've seen the BBC "Planet Earth", which I'm sure most of you have, then you will not love this movie. And I own all the "Planet Earth" disks I've seen that the rating of this movie is very high and I read about it with good reviews. I was excited to check it out. Unfortunately, I went to the theater and started the movie, I saw that it was Disney film with production companies that featured BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scene of the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs in the "Planet Earth" house. The film went on and went on and on, and me and my friends on the scene recognition were all of the "Earth Planet". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed because I think 90% of the shooting comes from the "planet Earth". I say 90% because some of the scenes I did not recognize. I feel like I just did not remember them. So finally what this movie really is is compilation of various records from different discs "Earth Planets", with children's storytelling. Yes, the narrative is pretty scary. Let me give you an example. When they point out that the polar pups leave their mother, the narrator says: "Polar chicks are not like human children, they do not always listen to their mothers" (I do not remember the exact words, but that's how it is) So in a nutshell. It's condensed "Planet Earth" for kids!
