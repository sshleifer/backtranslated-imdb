I liked the first movie but it is a textbook example of a sequel that would be better on the left side of the drawing board. The general idea in the first film was, if not great, at least interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and characters of the first film, and although Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel, the whole thought is a little ridiculous. If you have not recorded any of these films, then you get into the first movie and forget to continue, they can make all the joy of the original movie.
