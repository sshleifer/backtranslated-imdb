I love Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie because I know he admired Alan King and they would be amused together. I thought I saw all Billy's movies, but he could not remember this, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√©s and false emotions; you can feel every scene coming (and going!). Billy is not really fun. He is too busy trying to cry false tears, or he calms down how much his father left him. Alan King himself is quite sympathetic, just like the subplot about being extra in movies. But what is the coincidence that Billy is only visiting his father when a major health crisis occurs, etc. Atd. Or that two busy doctors can only close their practices to the moon in LA. And when the end comes, boy, it will come quickly! Almost as the writers realized they were shooting in the corner and the only way out was to make death. Mostly disappointing with some flashes of good humor.
