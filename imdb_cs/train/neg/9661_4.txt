I mean, acting is bad, but I guess it was driving. I never thought much about Highlander (the same director), but he could be blamed in the 1980s. This time, however, there are no excuses. People are shot when they leave trenches with the man in front of you! These mistakes, along with an unclear line, strange combat tactics, slicing cuts and bad visual effects, make this movie sub-par. <br /> <br /> Like many others, he commented on all these American bulls. The German general is practically afraid of his captured American private. Be prepared to swallow a lot, though in small doses. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, it was not a terrible, but certainly a sub-war war movie in all respects.
