This is the second time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These notes come from someone who finds Kane and Amberson as amazing, good movies. But the rest of the Welles career is, unfortunately, scuffed with material that is not worthy of his talent and too fragile to resist his film embroidery. And when a diver such as Shanghai is going to have a lack of something essential to block his movie tricks, he's a little sad. I could not tell you what he was doing here. It's all that has been preserved as Welle's crazy Irish brogue; which requires a lot of effort, but adds zero to the movie. Several Welles projects have become overcrowded and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (select version, any version) is a similarly weakened project. The material is insignificant. It just can not bear the weight of the whole noodling. For a director who deals with reality (as here), he never feels any effort to connect his bundle of mental relationships with reality; or a contiguous story. The murder of the lease is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Welles, however, because of Hayworth's cut hair, and get it out of it. The camera loves her. It's the most classic, most upscale, sad, and fascinating femme fatale ever shot. But her treachery comes so late in the movie that she feels like some desperate decision, so the movie will have some kind of genre to fit in. The movie can not be saved with the noir convention applied over the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done in L.F.S., are convolutions for what? to convince you that you have seen something thoughtful? to make Welles do more? to wipe your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the story or story. One is interested in what Shanghai is supposed to say to anyone who is not a criminalized billionaire, arranging a fourfold murder scheme for rent, or a fan in the love of film habits without meaning or substance. <br /> <br /> Twisted, absurd, unengaging.
