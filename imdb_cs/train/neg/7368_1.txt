I had the misfortune to waste 10 quizzes on a new DVD movie: Attack Force. Now, I can usually stop my faith watching movies like this. The pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching the noisy late evening shooting is perfect for a single alpha man like me. I bought this movie when I thought I would see great martial arts and shoot them. Segal is old and bloated, the conspiracy was ridiculous even under SS standards, and it was terribly terrible. In fact, so terrible that half of his voice was nicknamed by a man who sounded like NICHOL. Even the SS cant no longer performed (point of interest) of the crew was so terrible that they could not record the sound correctly. The voice will move back and forth between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man who makes the voice request for Honda ads! Plot wise is not a problem because most action movies work alongside the same assumption as this, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters that will terribly die like gunpowder and stereotypical bad guys waiting for bleeding. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if you were avoiding walking in front of a fast train or a flu shot of H5N1 flu. <br /> <br /> This was a public health alert.
