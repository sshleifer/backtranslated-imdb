I can not say anything wrong or good about this. Her characters are quite sympathetic, capable of producing and designing and professionally looking (except for a monster monster suit). It does not have originality, no ideas, and nothing you've seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, a cookie cutter, "dirty corporate drones in a deep space versus an unstoppable monster." Quite a waste of time.
