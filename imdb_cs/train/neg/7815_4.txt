As a long-time comedian comedian Superman, through the 1950 series, the first two Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark films and finally Smallville I really hoped "something" with "Superman Returns". <br /> Instead we got Lex Luthor, who he tried to convert real estate, another sequence of kryptonites in the superman, and at the same time inherent inconsistency: could not stop the ocean when it stuck 6 "kryptonite, but when Lois breaks 3" of it, * leaves the remainder recessed in it *, it can raise the * continent * to space? Indeed, the only hero in the story was Lois's partner - I can not remember his name from his hand. He did all sorts of rescue, heroic things with nothing but senses and skills - without the superpowers, without the invulnerability ... of a normal person. Still making Superman so small. Why can not Superman fight Brainiac or fight for space saving by general Zod instead of Lex's little schemes. Oh, I forgot it ... they're doing it in Smallville. Yeah ... I think I'm holding Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You probably should, too ...
