Nowadays it's a bit of a tendency to look at all the shows from the beginning of the nineties as classics (people are so easily blinded to nostalgia these days) and while some of these shows are undoubtedly good, it's just a bullshit. I've been watching this show a lot back in those days since there have been plenty of repetitions on TV and I did not like it even as a child. Even an 8-year-old man can figure out how many people in the Power Rangers are crossing and how much a special-FX sucked back then. When the show does not use painfully bad "combat" scenes, it threatens the audience with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers and has little social problems at all times. I do not know about you, but I could not do the rats, basically filling until they had to "fight again" some guy in a very clich√© of an extraterrestrial costume with a firework or a toy-robot. You are never interested in this show in any way, and the fact that most actors behave as if there really was no interest in them, except that they are a wallet, only increases the lack of feelings. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing unforgettable at this show and it's quite surprising to have so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). Everything is just a quick way to make some money. I urge any "fan" to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that should be so good, because I could not find anything that is even tempting for children. My guess is that most "fans" of the Power Rangers tell me that "I just do not get it" or something like that. I really do not care; this was bullshit and it's still dirty.
