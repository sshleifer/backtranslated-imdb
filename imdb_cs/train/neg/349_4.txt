Boiler - boiler, if I ever saw him. The anticipated thriller who borrowed "time to kill", "silence of the lambs", even reversed "at night" with a small backward murder, and "aliens on the train" where all of the above has largely succeeded. In particular, when providing excitement. The conspiracy seems to come from a larger book, making conspiracy development apparent and uninterested, while the direction is lacking in tempo and spindle. Damnation in any foolishness had to be given the main step and here it neglects. Connery is slowly slowing down at his old age, barely bothered by his attempt at American accent and, in addition, seems too old to be Hope Lange's husband and father of those crazy children out of his. Even a father who looks younger than he does. Laurence Fishburne has hardly a chance to occupy his role, and you're confused from the start if he's a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said flashbacky should not lie - they make it messy here. The rest of the game is just average and appropriately occupied in signed stereotypical roles. The supposed climax also managed to lean by leaving me firmly rooted in her back, not as if it were a goal, the front edge of the seat. Mediocre, unconvincing Hollywood movie is sure.
