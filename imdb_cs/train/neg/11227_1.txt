This movie was a bad belief. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before it started, the theater owner stood up and told us how half of the audience left the theater the night before, which became his "world premiere." I do not think anybody in the theater would understand how bad the movie is at this moment. We all eventually understood. <br /> <br /> This is not a documentary film that has been sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and a tribute to Bettie Paige, in which half of the film is actually only remakes of old films by Bettie Paige. The film is only 90 minutes long, and the content of these 90 minutes is the smallest. The scene would start to go, then someone would say, "Wow, you're so great Bettie, why do not we make another movie?" this should be followed by a 5 minute Bettie Paige remake that was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring than) the normal part of the movie. By the end of the movie, people laughed each time Bettie Paige's next film remake came. it was so absurd. In this theater I heard a lot of laughter, but people laughed with the filmmaker, laughing at the film and its poor content and structure. That was easy to say, because the parts that might laugh most were those that were to be serious or revealed. <br /> <br /> I know movies are expensive. I've seen a lot of cheaply produced independent films, but definitely cinematography and the quality of this movie is different from anything else I've ever seen. The movie looks like it was made for $ 12. Shortening, granularity, and lack of sensory conspiracy meant an unforgettable experience. This movie makes "Dude where is my car?" look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the theater feeling that we just paid $ 8 to be tortured. The only redeemed part of this experience was that we had to laugh that someone actually shot this movie and thought it was good. Apparently the previous night, the "world premiere" night, the director / writer / producer was in the audience and got to witness the laughing people and going to the film. Bettie Paige's films were destroyed. They should also destroy this movie.
