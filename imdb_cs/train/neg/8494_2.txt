Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc. I was disappointed with this unreasonable film pseudoscience and a mixture of real and wonderful history. It implies that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real knowledge of mathematics, technology or history that is the subject of the film, but instead works on some fuzzy artistic impression from them. This is going to hit a painful place with me because I've long ago excited the tendency for art to conceal and terribly misappropriate scientific concepts and thoughts to confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "Information waves have a half-time," Ada: "I'm not sure, that half the life is better than no life at all. "This film is worse than it fails - that's wrong. The only ingenious value I can imagine is that it attracts the viewer to learn about an object that is so badly disturbed. It is likely that I support the superstitious perceptions of science and technology of any degree of progress as inseparable from magic.
