Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this film before laying an egg-sized emu. Based on the classic TV series, Phil Silvers bombed it because: A) It was updated in the 1990s, and B) The simple assumption of the TV series has changed into a confusing, weak and stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray love figures that emerge from simple but merry jokes. Extending this assumption into the film of the 1990s demanded problems and shows it. No one could pay enough to sit for a second time.
