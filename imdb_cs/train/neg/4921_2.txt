Bring the blame for executive producer Wes Crane and Weinstein's financiers for this debacle with a big budget: the thrash-metal update "Dracula", with a beneficial verbal blow to Bram Stoker (who would not want his name on that) and nothing for others, in addition to slamming strokes and blood. Christopher Plummer looks like Van Helsing today - not only the descendant of Van Helsing, but the real thing; he continues with the leeches obtained from the corpse of Count Dracula, who is exhumed from his coffin after being stolen from the van Helsing cage and flew to New Orleans. That's exactly what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The movie, well produced, but without a single original thought (except for more racial victims), is repellent and lazy, and after about an hour begins to repeat. * z ****
