to be honest, I did not see all the original "screaming," but the scenes I saw showed that the first scream was a great movie. so great it was necessary to do seven horrible sequels. they started with "Howling II: Your Sister is a werewolf." I have this film on VHS from my uncle, when he gave away a lot of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new. I just watched him last night and it was not really BAD, it was just weird. that the whole thing when Sybil Danning went with three ways with two werewolves was just in place and quite disturbing (but a bit hot), Christopher lee was about to stab a dead karen as if she were a vampire, etc., this movie was in fact like some mish-mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except for werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (played by Dracula himself) was talking about werewolves who were really ripped off every other vampire movie in the heart, garlic, night creatures must die at night, and the ruler of the werewolves lives in Transylvania). not much for acting, but the worst of it comes from Anna McEnroe. I swear that at some point in the movie I found myself in roots for werewolves to tear her throat because that damn neck had always been called SUCCESS. In any case, the story is quite stupid and clich√©, so it is not true that you should say it, you could read it on Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that really worries me is that it is the only film of all seven sequels, which is in any way related to the original (no matter how Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words a continuation based on the same novel). so you can not see this movie. there is no real horror, just a few werewolves and just a terrible special fx. 3/10
