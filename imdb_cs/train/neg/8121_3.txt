Time is precious. This movie is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who are arguing about small films like Fargo and about this total waste of time. The theater was charged and they all went with the same response: Is it a film that critics criticize? What a crap! The hook of this movie is the upward mobile black daughter who looks for and finds her white shirt. Get it? <br /> <br /> Actor is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps over 60 minutes of story. Characters are shallow and unintelligent. I was offended by the fact that these people could not figure out what was obvious to viewers; viewers winked at the screen, what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun doing the laundry.
