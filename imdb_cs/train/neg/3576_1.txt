Even when I saw this movie with a teenager, I wondered how ironic it was that Pius Zadora played in the film about the artist who slept to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Madame Zador is, she could not rescue this justification for the filming movie. Even her Penthouse photos, in which "The Lonely Lady" was promoted "back in the day," could keep this film from refueling. The only thing that could save this movie? A completely different scenario. Give him this.
