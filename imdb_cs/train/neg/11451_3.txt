Well, friends, serious film fans are expected to watch all kinds of movies, bad and good, and this movie is testing me. I will not speak the words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The game was bad. Always amazing Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Did I really ask myself why did I even bother to see this rotten scary film? Why did I waste time and money on something I thought was wrong? The answer is, of course, that I am a film fan and therefore I can not avoid what else should be avoided. I will not waste time explaining exactly what was wrong with this amateur film, except that the quality of acting was, politely, subpaar. A serious movie fan may want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. Stay at home, do not waste time, read a book, do not forget to work or have a good sandwich.
