This movie began with a very promising story about the director who is losing sight, and the blind woman to help him. But somewhere in the middle, it seemed that script writers did not know where they were from. One incredible event followed by another (Russia must be very small because they all interfere with each other all the time), the motivation of female lead is understandable (why, after getting out of the boat, she still says it? Why do not they try to borrow a cell phone on ship to call someone?), side stories were totally ridiculous (was the story of a mother and a friend considered funny, and what was the story with a younger sister?). Still with all the seemingly random events of this film, the film managed to be completely predictable. The saddest thing is that there is plenty of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the pictures and the scores were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were also good. So it could be a really good movie ... but it was not.
