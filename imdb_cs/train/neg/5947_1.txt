This is one of the most hateful and cruel films I've ever seen. Unfortunately, I was in touch with this, because Donald Sutherland's presence gave him false credit. [This is the last one to happen.] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren's character was unpleasantly whimpering and as silly as they came. They were smarter figures than hers who were killed in the movie. That's just one of the many things in this movie, from which I asked, "Where is justice?" Why is the stone late at night so filled with sadistic litter full of pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a specific problem with women, and they seem to be focusing on being terrorized and murdered. This film could be totally tense without being sick and twisted. All he does in the end is to turn the viewer's belly with his illness and offend the intelligence of the viewer. Cast is misleading. I think they first attacked Sutherland and used it to attract others as lemmings into it. <br /> <br /> I'm copying that I wasted time and I was lucky.
