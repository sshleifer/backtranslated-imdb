It's not a horror movie, a boring sex movie. A very bad movie that some serious horror fans have to avoid. No plot, horrible acting and annoying music. If you only look at the trailer, you will know enough ... It's a shame that such a thing is available on VHS or Video, while so many good movies are not available. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions instead or Italian Gothic from Mario Bavy and Antonio Margheriti. These are masterpieces if you compare it with this waste. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this view.
