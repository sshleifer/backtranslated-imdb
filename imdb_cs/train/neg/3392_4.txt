What about Indonesian music movies? I have never seen Indonesian musical films such as Bollywood films. They lack the spirit of the story and only a bunch of "what they call" poetic lines. This story of the love of two children, who are separated and then meet again after several years of change, has no special remarks. It's a simple story of a plot (but it's quite focused though) with "wanting to be" a musical story line up and down. Confused characters, which should be saved by brilliant behavior, are neglected. The main actress can try to revive the characters, but it is the best he can do, he tries. As for casting, I do not feel the need to put this Balinese student into this story, and of course it's not the only unnecessary character. What is special about why I want to watch this movie? Maybe due to mango ...
