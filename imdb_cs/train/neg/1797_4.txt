This film has a very demanding assumption, even by genre standards. We are asked to accept not only that the record played back can bring the dead back to life but that the record also contains hidden reports SPECIFICALLY targeting one child when the singer had no connection with the boy when he was alive and of course no way to find out on whom hand the record would end. The film is fun for a moment, but ultimately it is the stupidity and absurdity. If they were really trying to create a new Freddy-like horror icon, they were so far: the villain has no personality, no motivation, no variety. (* 1/2)
