... may seem far-fetched ... but it really was a real story about the life of a man who had a relationship with a woman who found out where he and his new wife lived and she killed her husband, so it looks like a murderous rape. ...... in her deceptive story everyone told her that the man asked her to marry him ... so she stopped working in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> Last I heard she was in psychiatric facilities, Prison Safety .... <br /> <br /> She was still wearing a "engagement ring". she bought it for herself ... and everyone said she bought her for her. The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,,, and the murder happened in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> In the magazine People even appeared a story ... Spring of 1988, I want tell on page 39. I remember it as a college at the time, and my colleague met a unit in a security hospital ....
