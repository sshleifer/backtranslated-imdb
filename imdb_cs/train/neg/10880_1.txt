This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I'm pretty fond of horrible (and good) movies. It could (just) handle some adolescent humor if it was consistently-la-la-ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really fun. Other films, such as PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, can be funny while (seemingly) trying to be serious. As for acting, it seems that they cover the brain-dead teenagers and asked them to ad-lib the whole production. Compared with them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one decent interpretation - the older ghoul-busting wide on the motorcycle.
