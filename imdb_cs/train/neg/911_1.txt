It must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> <br /> It's embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and showed up in cinemas as early as 2006. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie. That should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why so many famous actors even thought the idea was even visible in a movie like this one. If I had some respect for some of the famous actors in this movie before I saw the movie, it's now quite certain. <br /> <br /> I have heard that this movie will be a follow-up film and I do not understand how it is possible.
