Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny - it summarizes this movie up to one word. What the hell was that "thing," because she could kill me to use the word "movie" !!! I hope the director, the writer and the producer did not mean to do it well, because it certainly is not! A scientist who turns his son into a shark hammer and shark kills a bunch of scientists who invited the island! I hate that movie so that when I watched it, I laughed at all the serious parts because they were so cruel and unprofessional ... and they could not have made the shark look unrealistic, even though this "thing" had a slightly larger budget than most low-budget movies. All I have to say is watching the movie that expects to laugh at all the bad acting and silly dialing, because if you expect a good movie, you will be very disappointed.
