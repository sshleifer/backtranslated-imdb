Who in the right mind plays a lyrical song and simultaneously displays an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his sick woman in the cloakroom, a song sung with lyrical content is as loud as dialogue, so it can not be heard without any emotional impact of the scene being heard. The scenes that Annabella got her father with his fists, a lamp, and then the belt was so cartoon that it was absurd. This whole movie is a cartoon, uncompromising prejudices against white beings are literally overwhelming. The discussion of black women after the wife's fins finds her cheating on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion of the Oxford debate team, is ridiculous. Permanent racism may persist, but the audio accompaniment and the mix of sound during this movie is too much. It was a technically badly shot movie. There is no understanding of the basic craft of film making, soundtracks, adaptations, and the desperate attempt of big actors who are trying to keep the film above water. I really liked Anthony Quinn, and I wondered why he played a role in this film - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I've seen with this director and it will be my last.
