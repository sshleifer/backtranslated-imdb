A horrible movie from the budget of about $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature kits used, bad gambling and a terrible story about foreigners who use discarded meat from the butchery as a fuel for their spaceship. The film contains some blood (not enough to disturb) and the figure with an egg replacing one of his hands. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < m heat is looking for a rocket. "In addition, it is not worth your time, nor the level" so bad it's good. "Watch out if you're in cheese foreign movies, but someone else should avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
