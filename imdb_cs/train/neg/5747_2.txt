I love zombie-movies and I love amateur productions. And the mass market 2 is really promising, with a nice honors to Fulc's Classic "Zombie". <br /> <br /> So I leaned and waited until I was stunned. Well, some makeups are great for such a budget and some actors (vampires and chefs) really stand out, but otherwise there is nothing. I did not expect Romero here, but there is no sequence in the whole movie that has even a little strain or tension. The director certainly knows how to imagine a strange body and interesting eating habits, but now (in two parts) it's time to learn something more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with holes - it's not enough for me - sorry. <br /> <br />
