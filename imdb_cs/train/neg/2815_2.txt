Bad Robert Englund is making another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually does quite good horror movies, but he did not. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade, who was enrolled in the 17th century for his obsession with pain and the pleasure of bringing pain to himself and observing others also in pain. The story is so confused with the flip flop from one century to the other, and I was confused about what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. Everything I saw was a young lady caught by a strange lesbian who wanted to hold her for herself, and that young lady fascinated the Arab with a lot of money and found her to kill her, then Englund from her one century to another claims to be a descendant of Sade and attempts to kill her because she reminded Mrs Momoselle (it was misspelled) or who was in the picture above the De Sades wall. The film was terrible, and Hooper was surprised that Englund hired Englund in this film, and the special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially on the eyes. Englund tries to make a comeback from his "Nightmare on Elm St." use these needles to pull and pull people's eyes. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
