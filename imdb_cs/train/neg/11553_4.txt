Does Francis Ford Coppola have any brain aneurysm following his "Apocalypse Now", which made him totally incapable of making a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what director "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" said when he made this fake movie. Gives Kathleen Turner a stellar vehicle, plays a woman who returns back in time and reaches her teenage age again when she knows all the things taught her adult life, and Turner, the soldier who is, is doing what this movie can not do saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> He does not have any style and because of his director, one could expect that even if he had nothing else, it should be. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
