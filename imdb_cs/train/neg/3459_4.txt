"Cut" is a movie about some film students. It's a lot of "Scream," an ironic, self-referential horror that's falling for me at least because it's still just a horror film for all of her irony, just like the movies she's referencing. br /> <br /> But it was not spellless. Well, one spell. Molly Ringwald was fantastic because the spoiled, frightened American actress hated every minute of working with amateur Australian film crew. She was so persuasive that it was tempting to believe it was no act, though everyone who participated in it said she was beautiful with him. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her dwarves, cuddling or crackling was great. Others, however, are afraid of being fine and scary in wood. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the "Cut" has some laughter, a couple of gore buckets (some of them are surprisingly scary) and finally it's another bad horror movie.
