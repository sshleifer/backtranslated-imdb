Now this movie will not scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reasons and one smaller - that's three reasons, no. <br /> <br /> The first reason why special effects are interesting. I found them quite interesting and a little spectacular. Seeing hair growth on Marsh A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was spooky, especially when they participated in the ménage à trois. Interestingly, this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown Sugar" from the Rolling Stones, and she was on the unheard nude scene in the London cast of rock musicals. In addition to the special effects, two more points appeared in this movie, and they were retired during the final credits. I have lost counting, but I swear that Sybil Danning has exposed the points for us in the final credits at least ten times and perhaps many more. They were the most striking feature of the film.
