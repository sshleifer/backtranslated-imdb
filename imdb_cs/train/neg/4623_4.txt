If you have not seen the gong show TV series, you will not enjoy this movie, not that the series you know makes this great movie. <br /> <br /> I give her 5 out of 10 because a few things are a bit of fun to help solve my obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It's a funny picture of the era that was made, the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get lots of fun portraits of the people you saw on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (host) when he does not make his personality on air television. 4) You will see a lot of bizarre people who are doing all sorts of insults as you saw in a TV show. I will not get to know all the bad things because there are plenty of them, but here are some of the most important. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show has lots of real video clips that get tired of the film. 2) The film story outside the clip segments is very weak and basically consists of a single point. 3) Chuck is halfway as an actor, but most of the other actors are making a typical trip over the seventy. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie that can be watched when you do not have the hour and a half you want to watch at one go. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But it is not so good either. ;)
