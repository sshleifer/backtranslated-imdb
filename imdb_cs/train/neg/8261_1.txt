I look forward to watching this movie, and then I realized that all the hopes of a continuous dialogue between the actors were overwhelmed by unnecessary talent. Now I'm not violent, but shouting obscenities is not a good movie. Ewan Bremner is probably one of the worst actors in the world at this time (testifying to his performance in God's terrible Life of Stuff) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many other "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," "Beautiful Creatures," we must suffer before movie makers realize that f-word, word, etc. It does not replace the right dialogue.
