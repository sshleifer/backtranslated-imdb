Please, even if you're in the worst mood, stay watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think there was anything wrong with this movie. According to my friend's recommendations, I followed and I literally flushed 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life through the closet. Weak acting, silly direction, weak story and pathetic action - and when you join together, you get "Double Impact". Even the least expectation was not met. <br /> <br /> I think I've learned one thing - Never look at Van Damme's action moves. It's a waste of time!
