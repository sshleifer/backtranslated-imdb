"Do not bother to watch this movie" would be better advice if you love Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a huge disappointment due to the big cast, not just Marilyn. The story was nothing, of course nothing to describe on the VHS box. There was simply no tension, expensive little excitement and too many dull points, most of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so upset. It was not a good role for Monroe, even though I did not need to see this figure to know she could act. "Something like done" was enough proof for me. But this role simply did not fit her, and it was no surprise that it was not one of her favorite movies. It is also a bad thing that the film lost talents such as Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not fun and fun is the name of the game.
