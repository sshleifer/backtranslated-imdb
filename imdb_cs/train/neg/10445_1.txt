This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous and the script is pathetic, and the biggest question is how this modest script got through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies from deep dramas to male orientations killing everything you see the type of movie so I can not say I'm choosy. I tried to find something that could be compared, but I just could not think of anything that matched it, maybe about the star soldiers 2. The witches, in my opinion, do the movie gods weep and I thought I was he has discarded his DVD player, but in comparison his effects are great. Excellent acting and script should be valued. You know, when the film is the wrong way, but people this is not one of those that kills your soul minutes per minute.
