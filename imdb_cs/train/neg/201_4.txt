Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see it in the silver screen? Lots of dance and music. If you love classical music or modern dance, it can be your movie. But otherwise one and a half hours is too long. If you like handy dances in the silver screen, it is better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath dance with long film. Director Carlos Saura knows how to dance from old experience. And from time to time it looks really good. but when the film is one and an hour, it should be at least interesting. There are many kinds of art, not everything is bigger than life and this film is not too big.
