I have read all the comments on this movie. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this film was based. The film is ugly and humiliating fiction of truth. I do not criticize him for changing small details or events for dramatic purposes; it is not a documentary document. Scenario CHANGES the impact, response, reality, and changes in ANY MAIN CHARACTER. It greatly alters the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the absurd rivalry for the Tibetan woman (which humiliates the culture of Tibet) to Harra's gift to the music box, Harrar's change <br /> <br /> heart, all about this movie is fake - except <br /> <br /> for a great photo. I understand that the Potal shots were transported from Tibet. Changing the real story about the relationship between two people <br /> <br /> One of them is very important for this world, /> movie star is sad
