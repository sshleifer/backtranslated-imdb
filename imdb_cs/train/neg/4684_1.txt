This film is an insult to all submarines. It was stupid. They seemed to be written in monkeys. The game was absurd. If this is the opinion most people have from the navy, then we cry for our defense. This movie was terrible. I put it under "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" when it comes to submarines. Gene Hackman had to really need the money to borrow to this bullshit. Denzel Washington had to be tall. The little thing makes sense. And the end. Do you want the rebellious to be rewarded for your crime? Only Hollywood would have thought that would have happened. If you have not found it yet, I did not like it. And if it was not for all the comments for, I would not bother the post.
