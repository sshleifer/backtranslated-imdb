I'm watching CBS "Surrender, Dorothy", wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it's a television movie - with a lack of tempting roles for slightly older actresses, no wonder why the Academy Award won by artists like Keaton turns on TV - but because Keaton will not give any glare opportunities). The unmarried mother, mourning the sudden death of her daughter, who has become twelve, sets up - and gradually becomes friends - a group of young people whose daughter was close at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of personal absorbers that one would have crossed the street to avoid. Besides being crude and dark, they are incredibly unconvincing, as well as a clean scenario and beach bungalow where children live (one young man wearing a muscle shirt to tell us he's gay, he can hear Diane Keaton says, "It's giving up, Dorothy," and in fact he asks, "That's from" The Wizard of Oz ", right?" No, genius, it's from "Citizen Kane!") Keaton might have wanted to make this material based on the subject of a confrontation of death.This tries to transform this distinctly inappropriate woman into the shadow of her own personality (a lot of tie suits), but the viewer does not fit well because Keaton was always warm and kindly flexible.This is a crazy harp, the way of self-discovery does not teach many lessons (the film will quickly forget that it is a dead young woman and becomes a odyssey for a nerve wreck of a mother who seems to be exaggerated by the hippie who has never lost a loved one. who promotes the actors on a talk show with a warning: "It should help a lot of mother who is in trouble". I can not imagine that it helps someone because it is basically useless, confused and confused. It's upset.
