I just had proof that confirmed my suspicion. A lot of children aged 14 to 22 on the DVD "Titanic" at the fantastic state of the mega screen deal with home entertainment. Only two of them saw it before. Everyone saw Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epics began, they became restless, some of them left the other - "Call us when a glacier comes up." For over an hour and a half in the movie, only two girls were still there. They started shouting: glacier, glacier. Then he followed the stampede, all returned to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat with their open mouth, radiating Ohs and far out. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is it? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink, but for the rest. For example, Dr. Zivagho had a similar time, but he thinks about how much the film takes place in the same time period. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands allegedly kreme de la creme in the first-class mess hall. See historical details if you find them. The story is so thin that it has to put weapons and fire on the ship to dive. Real sinking is film standards. Every effort focuses on special effects and the beginning of the week. The film has become the highest filming of all time, so what do I know?
