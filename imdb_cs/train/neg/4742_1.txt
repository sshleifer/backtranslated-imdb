Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I followed the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, a favorite girl with a hot jock boyfriend, and sticks to friends who are determined to be the Queen's Home. She's supposed to save the world as a warrior and Shin comes to help her to help her with her martial arts. Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, a tiger, etc. And she has to learn some techniques to save the world. This movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture, but acting and shooting was terrible. Brenda Song is a comedic actress and I do not see her playing a serious role. She laughed and laughed loudly as she watched her shout over Shin. Shin could not act, and everything was absolutely unbelievable. I was looking at this movie and I was trying to think about something similar, and the thing that I came up with was a missile guard. This movie is so fake, and stunt stunts were Power Ranger-esquire that it was just cruel and stupid. The characters were not sympathetic and I could not stand to look at it. Disney really needs time to do some decent movies. High School Musical is the only film that deserves to be on the Disney Channel, along with other films such as Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go figure, Read and Cry, and Stuck in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> You love action and adventure jokes, you will love this movie.
