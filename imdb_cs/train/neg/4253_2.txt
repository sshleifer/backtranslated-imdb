This has to make me one of the worst vampires people think. How can you turn such a charming object into a totally uninterested story? Naturally, it is not such a difficult task ... First of all, the condition of sine qua non of any vampire movie is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks all these things .. Too much light - stains! Oh, my god, why was it in the name of Christ / Judy? Each time Dracula came in, he was absorbed in the light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak). There was only one scene that was almost worth watching, near the end of the movie (beautiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest) . I really like first, Judas-Twist was original, but this is not just good, in any case. Hopefully the third will mean a vampire signature that I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppol's Dracula, or even the Vampire Interview.
