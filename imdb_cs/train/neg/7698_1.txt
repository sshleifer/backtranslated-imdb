Can I give it a minus rating? No? Well, let me say this is the worst movie I've ever watched. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I leased the movie with a friend, and after thirty minutes when they hoped it would be better, we decided to "move forward" a little to see if something improved. It never improves. This movie about a dude who has kidnapped these two girls sounds interesting, but in fact it's just a hole. Nothing is going to happen at all. If you ever have the chance to watch it, do a favor, instead try "PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE".
