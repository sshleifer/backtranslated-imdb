The movie was "OK". It's not bad, not good, just fine. If there was anything else in the theater, it would be far away. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 are also stunning, but I'd rather see it than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for a harrison brod or another young punk, it will be a "cute" movie for you. Personally I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
