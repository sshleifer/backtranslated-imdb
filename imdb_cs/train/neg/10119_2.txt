The animation in this performance, Petra and Vlka, is great, but in 29 minutes the movie is sleeping. They should call it "Peter and Snails" because everything moves at the speed of snails. I could not even watch the movie in one place - I had to watch it for 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save 30 minutes - do not watch this movie - and I will thank you. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee only watched the first minutes of the candidates. Unfortunately, for the winner in the category Best Animated short (short!) Voters will have to possess the whole thing. I'm sorry - and have to predict that this film is nearing victory.
