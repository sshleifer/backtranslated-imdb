It should be a mix of both, with a dose of parody that was soakable. Unfortunately, it looks very early. <br /> <br /> You do not have to take this movie seriously, I realize that, but you "I think it's funny that, I found only a few jokes or the situation was funny (ie Secondary phone interviews, Russian Olympic spy , consuming steroid cereals, Superman going through Lois, etc.) "The attack on murderous tomatoes" is trying to be a classical culture, but it does not do it: Cult classic is a film that is so different that only a select group of people (or a similar description) "There's one good actress all the way: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild." She is a good actress, and she's a good guy. but she has a cute personality, she loves to overcome and it's a natural comedy. Unfortunately, it's bad to use. <br /> <br /> "The Killer Tomatoes Attack" is not as fun as "The Amazons on the Moon or "or" Kentucky Fried Movie, "but it does have a few funny moments, so I would again recommend seeing it. Avoid the director's cut, the film producer's interruption and some allegedly "lost" shots called in the pretentious African dialect (English song).
