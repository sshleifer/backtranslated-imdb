This film, which has sublime music, impressed me impressively and lasted only 40 minutes. Thank God, because I fell asleep. I do a great use of time-limited photography to display the time of moving light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's it. <br /> <br /> My preference is for his predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 for 87 minutes and proving that the sequel may be better than the original, Powaqqatsi made in 1988 runs 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try them both.
