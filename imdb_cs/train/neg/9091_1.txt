Seriously, I've read some reviews of this movie and I have to ask if you were watching the same movie. Yes, I give many directors a lot of appreciation for being able to restore the 1930s to the Los Angeles vintage, but what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are sympathetic, the story seems to be aimless, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just shit. (and his character "Homer Simpson" draws me to the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had a scary child actor, creepier Billy Barty and so on. those movies love movie lovers and others look at each other and go, "What the hell!"
