Watching this movie was always thinking about me; why are they doing such a problem with some broken brakes? There are a million ways to slow down the car! In Speed, writers at least thought of a good reason why the car was unable to stop ... There are not many good things that could be said about this film; all the usual narrative clich√©s appear, the actors are very bad, the story is like a leak like a screen, etc. This makes this film a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
