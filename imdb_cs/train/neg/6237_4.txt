The statistics in this movie have been well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no surprise that this film has received the praise he has gained. Al Gore is definitely quite an actor. Sounds so worried. But the action speaks louder than words! Throughout the film, political pieces and links to his political career are sprinkled throughout the film. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only speaks, but also walks after a walk. When Carter thought we needed to save energy, he refused the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and claim to create global warming while he travels on his private plane. How much energy does his nozzle use and how much pollution does its current cause? How much energy does it need to heat the Gore pool behind its mansion? It would be nice if we could save electricity with smaller appliances and do it to shut down all that is not being used. But if so, the energy company would respond to a 50% reduction in energy consumption by calling it a "50% loss of revenue" and reducing its losses by raising the rate by 50%. So "just turning it off" would not be a very good idea. This movie is a shrouded challenge that allows Big Goivernment to take control of everyone in the name of saving the planet Earth, that is.
