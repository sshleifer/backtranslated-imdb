I was glad when the actress grew up with millions more. So I got into this movie and wondered if it was good, it could be a bit dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> LOCATION! Just wondering if Charlie's angels are really boring at the end of the day? It seems to me that I do not remember her as such. But this movie, as bad as movies of this type, may be, little resembling the excitement of this period and show. I saw it all, despite the negatives it was not indivisible. It was, however, very harsh, which I did not even blame for artists, especially women who played angels as they did. The movie was not so interesting. He tried to make every angel a "character". (One angel is feisty, one is "a good girl", one is in her husband ....), all the characters have been portrayed with one main characteristic that defines them and a small depth for stereotypes. The excitement of the show was missing and the dialogue was ... dialog. That's almost so. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible. It's not the worst TV movies. But missing.
