There is something sad when I see someone who is so good that he is doing something, trying to do something very different ... and finally he's average. I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. This movie is reasonably effective and overhead, but the script is stinking. Martin has done a great job adapting the classic story to a comedy in "Roxanne," but this effort to bring Victorian drama to the current scene falls directly into the wall of inscrutability. If you want to see the old story updated with some style, best to rent "Great Expectation".
