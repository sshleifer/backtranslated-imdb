This insipid mini operetta, representing the Eddy-McDonald's prototype in the Valentino script, is so bad that it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. It is stupid to see how this briefness opens to two military men who discuss the lack of manhood in the son of one of the officers. Within one minute he is packed in Morrocca, where he lives a double life like the Red Shadow; the leader of the Arab tribe, who sings rather than fights. Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have fine operatic voices (with little acting skills) and there is also a decent bass, but acting is so random a scene so poorly prepared, you get the feeling they're doing things when they go. <br /> <br /> This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that features six writers. With more spoof and warble the show can have some fun values, but it disturbs the quickie is just more than an insult to the audience waiting for a feature presentation.
