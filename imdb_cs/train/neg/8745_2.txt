One of the extremely unprofessional films about computer programmers. It seems that the authors of this film do not know the real specific programmer's site. <br /> <br /> Top 20 programmers in the world, a program that has its own satellites (for what?), a program that uses satellite freq., somebody kills someone to steal the codes (why?) and a lot more stupid moments in this movie. People who are not programmers will see something horrible in the movie because this is not a professional. But people will not see the real thing. Programmers find that the film is odd and terrible - because many moments within the movie are not related to real life (why the film is not a scifi?).
