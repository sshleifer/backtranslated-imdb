I was expecting comedy, such as Big Mama. Instead, the film was a bizarre combination of comedy, drama and love story. This film has three plots: The first concerns Madey and her children. The second involves a woman who is employed by a rich man who abuses her. The third involves the relationship between a mother with two children and one father. In fact, the film is a very small comedy. There's also a lot of twisted news in the movie. For example, Madea defeats a child with a strap (in a comic way) to persuade the child to straighten. The baby is actually turning. He seems to pay the children. <br /> <br /> There are plots that deal with the rape of children (with the mother's consent). There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (Osking takes place during a family meeting.) The movie jumps from the fence to the plot so that you are always in balance. Is it comedy, love story or drama? It's nothing ... except for waste of time and money.
