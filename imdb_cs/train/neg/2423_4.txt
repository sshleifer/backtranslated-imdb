I got this movie from a private collector and I was very curious about it. In IMDb he had only 7.8 votes and some external notes were nice. But I have to say it's a very common and unimportant giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well controlled but never scared me. It starts well, but even though I'm even bored, the story is so common, and the stuff that happens so normally I did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can do some laughs. And you can see some small breasts. But if you like such a giallos that I like (bizarre, surrealistic, absurd, bloody, atmospheric, brutal murder ...), you will not appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> Good direction and editing and final operations that make a fun movie. But it could be much better.
