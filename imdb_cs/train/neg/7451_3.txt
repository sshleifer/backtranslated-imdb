Sorry, it's not good. <br /> <br /> It's going to be interesting, but it's losing its way for a few minutes to the movie. It does not help that any of the normally great actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) brings really good performance. <br /> <br /> It could be due to the fact that I saw a dubbed version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was especially wooden and annoying and Danny Glover really did not strive for a credible villain. In addition, the character of Jared Leto really does not contribute to the story at all (save the life of one main person at one point, but this scene is just as necessary as a windscreen wiper on a submarine ;-) <br /> <br /> When we talk about unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is a really tangled and clich√© story: Detective (of course!) He has to solve a personal affair with a villain and is (of course!) Suspended from his official duty with kind permission of his personal involvement. The killer (of course!) * He wants to be watched and playing with his opponent a game of cats and mice for many years ... I do not know how many films build on a similar conspiracy - most of them are better <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> exciting, but completely fails in these respects. We saw * much * better finales with a similar type of ultimate-bite-on-a-train-in-a-ruin-winter-landscape setting ... Finally, it is supposedly a moving reunion of parent and child ... hokey, at least.
