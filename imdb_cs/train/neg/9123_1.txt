I have nothing to say about this movie. It could have been a great tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but it's one of the most tragic events in the history of the movie. That it was the ultimate film for the vendor, it's even more painful. Striking scenario, direction, and shocking woody performances all horrified to become one of the most important films, <br /> I wish I could find even laughing or laughing somewhere in a pile of ugly blubbers, but it is unmanageable and humorous catastrophe. Truth hurts. Peter, why could not you stop being there?
