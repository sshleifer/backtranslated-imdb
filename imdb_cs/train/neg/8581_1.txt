This excuse for the film is absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths needed money. The film had to be made at a very low budget because the lighting did not exist. I made a promise that if I ever saw Pete Postlesumthingor, I'd commit suicide. I would like to know if there is 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret is that I spend my time watching this waste.
