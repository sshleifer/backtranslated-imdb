This movie is made for television smells all over. Though it started with great intentions, featuring great-looking sets and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly plunged into a terrible dialogue with his nose and set off on sappy television melodramatic acting. The characters were so mutilated that I sometimes thought they were about to break into a crazy pool, and the action was so intricate and badly cut that it seemed that soldiers were just standing and alternately shooting at each other. The Germans were so unrealistically plotted to be painful to watch. The only thing the German officers spoke about was how great the Americans were. Please ask for it. I'm a huge fan of the war genre and this movie is bullshit. However, this DVD has an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the front lines of the First World War, so this rental is not a complete waste of my time.
