The film is terribly terrible and humiliating to the victims of rape. On the surface it can be a brave film about rape, but if you dig under the surface, what lies is not so positive a report of rape. Aishwarya's victim of rape is shown as a helpless victim who can not solve all because she is WOMAN. He needs MAN to help her. When the company farewell to her and comments on her, she will not be alone. It's all left to Anil Kapoor to talk everything while Aishwarya is doing all the cry. The director (Satish Kaushik) went the wrong way by portraying the rape victim as weak and compliant. What would be more effective is the depiction of a strong woman revolting against her enemies. The director is known to be a chauvinist. His films are usually filled with weak women but try to hide them in controversial roles. He has to learn that precisely because the role is controversial does not mean that the character itself is strong. The most humiliating scene in the movie is when Aishwarya "cleanses" after being raped. He does it for the pleasure of his father, who thinks he's dirty now. Although it is commendable that Shah shows stigma against the victims of rape in such a strong light, what he does not show is whether Asha's father was wrong to do so to his daughter. So we are left with the confusing report of rape. <br /> <br /> Comedy is also not needed in a strong movie like this. Even more, the comedy is simply not funny. Ash is in his role as Wood, while Anil Kapoor does nothing but scream. Music is average, with the exception of the title track, which is beautifully rendered (the only clear point in this movie). Sonali Bendra's role is disappointing and unnecessary. Overall, he could be a great movie he remembered, and it is a terrible mish-mash that will cause serious discomfort to some audiences.
