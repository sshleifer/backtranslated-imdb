In the story of a photographer who has dreams of killing his models, he has cast eighty television films and guest television series (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel, and others). Of course, models and other people are starting to be dead, which causes a variety of complications. While he is not a very good thriller, he has enough nudity and violence to get a rating of R, but he does not have enough good material, interest. This is best described as the kind of film that gave the Cinemax cable the alternative name Skinamax. I really do not see the reason to watch this if you do not have to see every dirty thriller out there. (I must also remember that this film is filled with smoking to the extent that it becomes ridiculous when someone lights up)
