This film is one of the most unintentionally bad action movies ever shot. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is fun, but a really dirty friend, an eccentric and supernatural villain, a love clich√© and one of the worst endings of all time, has been added to the mix and you've got quite a small suicide treatment for people who enjoy their lives and until the "Showdown" they never thought about killing a blower. I do not know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is not too subtle. There are constant links to male genitalia, and not to women. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about male parts, and in fact, before he goes to suicide, Brandon tells Dolphy: "If we do not, I want to tell you that you have the biggest d- I've ever seen." So this normal did the man tell another man? In ACTION not less? And would you like them to be your words? <br /> <br /> Later, this jewel: <br /> <br /> Dolph (as for the villain): "I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy." Brandon: "Man, you have a fixation." <br /> <br /> As the man said at RuthlessReviews.com, "Unfortunately, Dolph does not answer," Do I have a fixation? Do I have a fix? he decided that his last words should concern my private people! I was just mowing his ears and nose, man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is tirelessly stupid stuff and great fun if you are someone with root canals from unlicensed dentists without novocaine.It is on par Great fun for the whole family!
