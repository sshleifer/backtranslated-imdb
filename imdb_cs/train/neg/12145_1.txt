As you may have gathered from the title, overall, I believe this movie is the worst zombie movie of all time. Acting, cinematographic, writing, special effects, and anything else related to this film was inspiring. People said that while this film is terribly effective and terribly productive, it comes with a humorous intelligent letter. Wow. This thing has more holes than I or someone else could count on. To begin with, why would the government tell everyone to come back to work when it's not safe? I know the government is going to be bad, but it does not get it by killing the entire population of the country. No one will rule! Another thing I was thinking about, even if the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the streets were filled with zombies? Would the zombies be hiding in the bushes and flood any unsuspecting people to help the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet? And what the end? This silly, furry Torch sacrifices his life to get a pair of zombies close up. He has probably forgotten that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom function. And one more thing why Hindenburg says before he dies. Hindenburg was a rare event that very few people saw. The zombie threat will be seen by everyone in the land, perhaps in the world. Do not you think someone would put some pictures? They also managed to destroy the only half in the movie when a soldier watches exotic dancers. Why did the zombies hide behind the curtain five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could come through the door. It's probably just something that an unintelligent zombie fan like I did not understand. Every day I pray that God will increase my brain capacity enough to find out all the delicate nuances in mass feeding. Anywho, I think it is interesting that this is the first film that has given me the desire to physically harm the people who are involved in the production. Hey Trent Hague, I'm calling you!
