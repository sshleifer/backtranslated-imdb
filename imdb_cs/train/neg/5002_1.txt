How did such a terrible script succeed in attracting this cast? Amazing, predictable and absolutely unbelievable, it's well done and gentle, but the material is so bad that it still qualifies as one of the worst thrillers I have seen for years. Amazingly bad and not fun. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
