The only possible way to benefit from this film is to head against the wall, allow some internal bleeding from the brain, let a lot of brain cells die and as soon as you are mentally retarded, maybe you CAN * enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The only saving mercy was the story between Raja and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of cab driver and so was the Brit. Perhaps if they made a whole movie about their escapades in India and how they finally fell in love, they would make it a much more enjoyable movie. The only reason I gave him 3 ratings is that Govida and his ability as an actor in terms of comedy. Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were unnecessarily useless. Moreover, the rehearsal scene on Heathrow was too big to spend. Being an international traveler in the world after Sept. 11, Anil Kapoor would have been shot long before he even reached the bridge of the sky to confess his true love :) But then again the film's goal was to resist logic, gravity, physics and throw eggs on his face * GENERAL * Audiences. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. At least I know I've been scarred all my life :(
