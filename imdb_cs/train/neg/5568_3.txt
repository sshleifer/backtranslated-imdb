Dolph Lundgren plays as a former cop / boxer who is looking for Boston's Princess scene to find out who killed his brother who was well-thinking in the community, but on the way he learns how his brother likes quizzical sex and that the serial killer should blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact, based on his performance, he has forgotten Lundgren's rise to the glory of the action role. This means that Lundgren has nothing to do with it, in fact Lundgren is completely omitted to dry in a terrible thriller that is predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the movie works best when it concentrates on chemistry Lundgren and Brett, indeed the film took the time to explore their relationship the film would be decent. However, the film is insignificant, the action does not exist, the conspiracy has not been sufficiently investigated (too boring by B. Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily cruel and ridiculous. Lundgren is really really good (just like the newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film only makes wood from one sequence to another, making this film a particularly disappointing one. If nothing else, it shows how undervalued Lundgren is like an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4 (bad)
