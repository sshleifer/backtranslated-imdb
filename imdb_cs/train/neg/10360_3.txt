I was so excited to see ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. However, the film did not meet my expectations. When I read the book, I recently prepared for big losses, as often happens when the stories are translated into movies. This book does not seem to fit. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was happening. The dialogue does not sufficiently explain what is going on. It seemed they were glued together and passed. Overall, I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you did not read the book, it could be fine in itself. At the very least, you might be tempted to read a book that is likely to be more enjoyable. <br /> <br />
