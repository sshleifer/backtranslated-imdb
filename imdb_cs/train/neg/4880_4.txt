After "Central City" loses its murder boss, Robert Armstrong (as "Doctor Rogers") decides to take drastic measures. To preserve criminal continuity, he joined Richard Cromwell's love son (like Edward "Baby Face" Morgan) to run a family business. The naive Mr. Cromwell is taken to the city and installed as president of the Tatna Agency "Acme Protection Agency", a gangsta queue. While Cromwell sells innocently to insurance, his "employees" lead an extortion missile. Cromwell falls into pretty client Mary Carlisle (like Virginia Clark); and the duo was in great danger? "Baby Face Morgan" captures Cromwell's star and Mrs. Carlisle, who is approaching the end of her "promising" film career. It is a quick, easy and harmless little crime. <br /> <br /> **** Baby Face Morgan (1942) Arthur Dreifuss ~ Richard Cromwell, Mary Carlisle, Robert Armstrong
