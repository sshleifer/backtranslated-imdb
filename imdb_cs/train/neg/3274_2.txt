Again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, the TV series turns into a feature film and destroys all hundreds of people watching. In fact, duke cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time in "The General Lee". But they need their joint action to stop, and their family farm has been destroyed together with almost the entire city by the ugly Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (Razzie named Burt Reynolds) to make room for a huge coal mine. They get help on their way from their sexy cousin Daisy (nomination for Razzie Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) while being chased in the same way as Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M. Gainey) and the police. Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I'm adding another star is because of some impressive stunts and of course the beautiful body of Simpson (I admit her legs are not entirely Catherine Bach but still!) But besides, it's pretty boring. He was nominated for Razzies for the Worst Picture, the worst director for Jay Chandrasekhar, the worst remake or sequence, the worst screen couple for Simpson and her "Daisy Dukes" and the worst screenplay. Pretty poor!
