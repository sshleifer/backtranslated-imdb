This person listens back to matinee days, when children with no one else go out to take the data to the balcony after they made their younger siblings down. It did not matter what is on the screen - little children would sit down and the big kids would ignore it. Adults, of course, will never see it. But they bet them on the video, like most other gruesome, low-budget "B" horrific moves of golden age. from television. This inherent and unintentional humor of this film is derived from an outdated ideology ("bad girls" harvested to replace the poor John's crushed body - they had it), an overused conspiracy (a mad scientist trying to play God), a violent and conscientious monster whose presence in the village the laboratory of a seemingly normal seeming scientist is not entirely explicable), and acting that polarizes on wood or over the top. This is a great movie for a party, provided your guests like to add dialogs and commentaries to otherwise misleading film abuse. In fact, if you or your guests prefer passive entertainment, this movie is also available in a video at Mystery Science Theater 3000, where TV hosts and puppets make the right accessories for you.
