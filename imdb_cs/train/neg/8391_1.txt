Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his "House of 1,000 Corpses," I can now rest in peace. Nothing about a somnambulistic performance or a trite script would raise the dead in the "House of the Seven Corpses," but groovie ghoulie comes out of his conspiracy (ha!), Anyway, killing bloody amateurs to make low rent horror movements in his former residence! In the hellish house (I apologize, I do not remember the real name of the residence), a lot of mysterious, inexplicable deaths have taken place long ago; Some, like the arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose little role the film provides is the only useful moments), assign to the supernatural; film director John Ireland rejects him as a superstitious hokum. The result appears as "Satan's School for Girls" (a catchy title produced for TV production values, interesting plot) crossed out as "Children Do not Play With Dead Things" (low-rent film about low-rent movie makers to wake the dead); The problem is, it's not as close as fun or fun. "The House of the Seven Dead" is dead in the first picture and spent the rest of its 89 minutes rigor mortis, stretching us after each painful second ...
