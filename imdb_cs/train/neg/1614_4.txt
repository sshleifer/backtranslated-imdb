The second half of Revolutionary Biology by Steven Soderberg about Che Guevara deals with his latest campaign to export the Revolution to Bolivia. To maintain the holy appearance of Che Soderberg, he jumped comfortably with the mass executions he led after the revolution in Cuba and the foolishness of his Congolese adventure ("This is a history of failure," writes in his Congolese journal preface) to concentrate fully on Che's attempt to gain support to oppose the government in Bolivia. That would prove to be a disaster and Guevara's final act. <br /> <br /> What struck the first chapter is adapted here when Soderbergh slows down his film to crawl to study the blissful face of contemplative Guevara, which is played again like James Dean in the eastern part of Eden Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in converting and soon finds himself and his hungry comrades are swallowed in the heart of the dark Bolivian jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent Aguirre, God's anger Soderbergh does not take advantage of the metaphorical jungle possibilities to reinforce the desperation of partisans. He seems to be more concerned with keeping Chemo nimbus over his head than to find out how panic is in dead gifts. There is one Herzogian moment when Che is sitting on a difficult horse to kick and scream to get in motion, but overall Soderbergh's mission en scene remains flat, careless and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In both of his films Soderbergh shows that he is clearly a Che groupie and because of that his focus remains myopic and narrow. He spent too much time building his Che memorial and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his sister, especially Fidel Castro. It aggravates it by doing it with a slow and unobtrusive approach that will never endanger. One would think he was pleased enough with Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that the vast change is much better displayed in a sparkling style.
