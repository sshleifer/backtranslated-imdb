I was looking at the whole movie that recognized William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I did not know Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie I said, "Was that Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for great performance. Weller played the main character and his performance was such that I did not even know him. Overall, the conspiracy was bad, the writing was bad, and the performances, besides Nosbusch and Weller, were below. The scenery and setting were interesting and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, of which 10 are possible.
