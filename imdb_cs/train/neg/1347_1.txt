Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite 80s cartoon. I enjoyed both the first and second season series, as well as in 1992 the Christmas Specialty "Inspector Gadget Savings Christmas". Some Gadget fans quickly criticize the second season (1985), but they need to compare it with DiC in the 2002 edition of "Last Inspector Gadget's Case: Claw's Revenge" for then, they find the second season be absolute gold. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Gadget, I could not resist the possibility of seeing Animated Inspector Gadget in something that was not about Gadget Boy. I bought the film and swore to be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic freedoms would be taken from the original series. I was not even ready for what I wanted to watch. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seemed to be that the original show has not touched yet. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of just some drawbacks for this movie: * humor does not exist from the original series. * Penny and Brain (originally having almost the same part in the series as the Gadget) are missing from the action in fifteen to twenty minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * Original music from Saban & Levy does not exist and the score that exists is sub-par. (He found that Saban had his own production company, but at least "Inspector Gadget saves Christmas" had good music, even without Saban.) Do not expect to see some Gadget gadgets that have made the show as cute as the gadget -copter, gadget- brella, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (which was actually used but was not even called the same thing) as well as its standard other hats and hand gadgets. In this film, the legs of the gadget were telescopic instead of springs. Such things harass the real supporters of the show and simply do not have to change. <br /> <br /> * The Gadgetmobil from the original series is now a fast, supposedly "hip" convertible. All the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobilu, which turned into a van and vice versa. Quimba's boss is now very short-tempered and even thinking of Gadget. In the original series he was always ugly, but he's moving the situation a bit. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. Are there any positives of this movie? Ok, here it is ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche is doing a good job of taking the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Quimby's boss mentions the real villain of the cartoon series: Big Wambini (the classic "Gadget" villain of the second season, expressed by Louis Nye). Are you looking for additional redemption factors for this movie? Well, you're not lucky. Life is about choice and life with these possibilities. Most situations in life have their purpose, even if they are to teach lessons. Here's how: keep the original formula! "If it is not broken, do not correct it." True Gadget fans should avoid this movie; you will surely be disappointed. Hopefully, DiC and Shout! The factory will continue to release more original series after the 2006 edition of "Inspector Gadget: Original Series, Volume 1", containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true Gadget fan, a lover of the 80th animation and many DiC programs, I invite you to buy the DVD "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs that are excellent and will certainly bring back good memories.
