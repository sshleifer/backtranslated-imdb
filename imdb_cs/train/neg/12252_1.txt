** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. Seriously. Effective in a very terrible situation, FX is frightening and the conspiracy is rightly terrible. But hey, he's so bad he's looking at fun! The script is so bad that it's nice! You just have to feed and laugh at the lines like "I think what you say CROCTEASING." because the women in their crocodiles were flashing their breasts. I mean COME ON that's funny because it's so bad! It has so bad jokes that they are fun! But after a while it just happens to be a lot of how the film changes. I really started falling asleep. Trust me, however, that the plastic leg that presses on the leaves and the constant passage of the tail canines long laughs for a long time. Although I have to say that it has one cold part, when Croc stretched that mate in half and just hanged there for a while when he found out what to do. Heh heh ruthless movie that must be nominated on the MST3K line!
