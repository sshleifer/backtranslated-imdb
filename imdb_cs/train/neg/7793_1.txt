It really is one of the worst movies he ever did. I consider myself a huge zombie fan and usually tolerate bad acting, lame "special effects", a silly story and everything you can meet in movies of the second outlook, AS LONG because the movie has a good atmosphere / story / pause or what it offers. This one has essentially no positive aspect and is third or fourth, maybe worse. Some of my and my friends made a small film during weekends and certainly had a better job (no zombie movie though). This effect is not funny nor about anything else. Really bad and superfluous special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except the white extra skin torn over their faces), ways of a lot of fake blood (I really like realism, the combination of realism and Zombie movies is debatable but presented by gore is just stupid). The camera remains relatively long with screaming scenes, it's boring and you can not just wonder why zombies use DEVICES (!) To kill their prey. They will not go into the details of dubbing (others did). Although I'm from Germany myself and I'm a little curious about the original version, I NEVER waste more time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Keep it as close as possible.
