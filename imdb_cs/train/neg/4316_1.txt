I'm not usually exaggerated, but after seeing the Academy Awards for two decades, I can honestly say that this year's awards show was the worst example of the wrong direction, the complete cruelty and the stupidity that I have ever had witnesses' misfortune. I do not talk about prizes themselves - as is usual, there is a lot of what we can guess when you deal, who won, who lost and who never got to the nomination, but the process is as it always was and is just as just as it is it is likely to be. What is terribly irregular is the treatment of both "stars" and "stars" that Cates and Horvitz have received in the name of "reducing boredom." It's bad enough that in the last few years someone who is not Al Pacino was "determined" for 45 seconds, no matter what he said, and what kind of emotion he was talking about. There is nothing more than a complete lack of respect for nominated herds on the stage like cattle without paying the honor of showing their faces when their names are read to quietly disappear when they lose, to deny them the excitement of walking on the stage and to force them to read their claims with the back of the audience. All these things were done on the "incomprehensible" mind that movies did not exist at all without the artists and that most of them had only one chance to face their peers and their listeners. <br /> <br /> The stars did not leave much better. It becomes sadder than funny when the Calibre winners Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to ask a few seconds for their speeches. Chris Rock, as a host, was not as negative and controversial as he hoped the academy, nor was he as entertaining as he could be. His opening remarks were almost (but not totally) as strenuous as Sean Penn did, and his comments during the show were harmless rather than interesting. Of course, he could not be blamed when it was clear that he was held as a short leash as any host. Eventually, Chris Rock was something he'd never been before: a non-entity. <br /> <br /> Music numbers have not been treated badly. Beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should be featured in three of the five songs. Another example of utter disrespect for the artist was the nomination of Jorge Drexler to Antonio Banderas - although Drexler was present and apparently did not intend to sing his own song on the basis of his winning "speech." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The effort of Cates and Horvitz to make an exhibition shorter and faster could work to a certain extent, We all screamed over the long speeches given by people we do not know about over-production, about the quality of self-service. But this is their Night - not ours. What is to be celebrated has become an insult to people who are celebrated. Cates and Horvitz should be ashamed of it.
