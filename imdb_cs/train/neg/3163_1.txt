So this is the first post I've ever commented on IMDb. You get it, this movie has brought me and warned all the good souls who stop experimenting with movies. Because most of them that I watched this film because it seemed to have some decent actors (although reading the worst criticism against this film), I thought experimenting it assuming it was some comic movie., Well it all started well with some poems, a comedy ... then it all began to be pathetic ... one can believe my self, you feel as if you were going and banging your head every time a poor woman called the movie hero became helpless. ..Huh ~ ~ Well, how much can a man spend the sick all the POSSIBLE wizard little spirit that is trying to do everything he can to irritate you and stop you from what you do. the movie is "ZOMBIE" a hero, yes, when he loses his fiance, he is born around like a goat, with black marks under his eyes. and a heroine "terribly stupid" sister .. you bleed from head to toe if you try and succeed by watching this movie ~!
