Are you wondering why the Islanders Patients seem to take the humor of black Americans automatically? regardless of their ethnic origin? This film does not provide any answer to this often-considered question - but it will be an excellent case study. Since its inception, this film has been working as a "old school" for the Pacific Island of New Zealand, which immediately raises the question of exactly what is the point of such a task. Does it mean keeping the deep stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? or is it intended to use this potential market? The story is weak, the jokes are humorless and the end is expected. This film did nothing new in New Zealand, because it's just an attractive romantic comedy that has no merit.
