The proverb "Never evaluate the book on its cover" has been created as a warning to those who are not underwater. <br /> <br /> When I was looking at a work of art on "King of ants," I immediately thought HORROR! The archaic images, which appeared proudly on the cover and back, spoke of a dark vision, the synopse promised a story of murder, betrayal, and theft. Instead, what I found beneath this surface was less interesting than what you find below your average role. The "King of Ants" is Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average boy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. In addition to Sean Crawley, there's someone you do not care about, I've never felt any compassion or sympathy for that character. In fact, he is totally unmanageable, but not like Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who becomes the worst in an unmistakable performance in a totally ridiculous dialogue that he is forced to lecture. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a mourning widow who obviously has unconditional confidence (especially in the homeless) and little to any common sense and George Wendt as the Duke, which is basically a sober Norm of Cheers but MEAN! <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> He prefers bombing with unmotivated characters, poor dialogue, and unlikely events after unlikely events. Oh, horror!
