When I read my opinion on IMPORTANT HOUSE, many may assume that I am about 14 years old who think SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. That's not the case since I'm 30 years old and watching most of my life for horror movies. But surely, I am a child of the 80s who grew up on slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. ... types of horror films - so I usually prefer horror movies that are more graphic and faster. Just like someone who can appreciate other music, painting or in this case movie - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people can have this kind of movie ... I just do not have ... <br /> THE HOUSE TO KNOW is an extremely boring and lengthy film about a school for disturbed girls. A happy school mistress controls an iron hand (or, in some cases, a whip ...) to keep the girls in line. She has a young son who creeps around and looks at the girls as they shower (in their nocturnal shirts no less (!!) ...), and meanwhile the girls from the school disappear because they are the victims of the murderer lurking around the campus ... I see why IMPORTANT HOUSE is often compared to SUSPIRE (which is, in my opinion, the masterpiece of the film ...) as far as the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and insignificant, that I could hardly stay awake. I am for "tension" and "tension" in horror films - but this film has not kept me either. Fortunately, I did not expect to get a lot of it, so I can not say that I was really disappointed - IMPORTANT HOUSE, which reinforced the fact that most of the horror films mostly older than 70 years. This is not a hard and quick rule, but the ones I've enjoyed certainly look like an exception. Probably "must-see" for horror fans who have more underestimated and suggestive horror films - but as I really do not know too many fans of this kind of material, I can not really recommend ... 4/10
