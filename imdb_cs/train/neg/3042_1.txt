I'm allowed to write about 1000 words about this movie, but one word could be enough: bizarre. Hubby and I did not mix as if we were watching this really horrible movie. We were still looking at each other with our best "What ...?" expressions. There is no way to describe this film adequately. Killer tomatoes are funny, but that's just bad. What kind of mind does such images produce, and then they make it to the film to see others? What kind of mind involves innocent children in this weird, weird film and then packs it as if it were good for kids? Parents, no matter what you do if your child still believes in Santa, do not let him see this movie. Preteens can watch it - probably with "What ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to make this movie to others, you might want to cure their egg. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst movie he ever did.
