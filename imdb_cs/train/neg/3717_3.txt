Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a cozy stellar vehicle to overcome his appeal to the white and main black audiences, updates the hit comedy "Heaven Can Wait" in 1978 with an urban agenda. He plays a comedic comedian who is involved in a car accident that has too soon his soul taken away from his body - and that is why his angels must find another body that could place him and he could only come with the white trader. Overwriting the movie as motionless and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" only points out that Rock's eye was at the box office (that's exactly the business step organized by Hollywood's most mercenary player). Why do not you try something outrageous or more unforgettable than the stupid reincarnation comedy that culminates in Apollo's evening? Amazing support for the cast (including the usually-reliable Regina King, gorgeous Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and Amazing Frankie Faison) doing what they can but Rock seems embarrassing and self-confident. * 1/2 from ****
