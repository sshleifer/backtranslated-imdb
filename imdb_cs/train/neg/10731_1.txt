The film is basically the story of a Russian prostitute returning to her home village for a nurse and friend funeral. There are a few other little stories that could be really more interesting than those that were taken but not fully explored. The core of the film is funeral, waking and later controversy over the future of the doll making community and selling them to buy vodka, but now there is no artist who made his dolls on the market. Apparently the film is not modified. The path of a prostitute from town to town is an unbearably endless train ride and muddy trap. Perhaps it should impress us on the immense Russian landscape. The village itself is inhabited by a legion of widows and one man, the birth of a dead girl. Continuing business with dolls is problematic for all involved and ultimately seems impossible. Most of the film is shot by a handheld camera that could cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the headlines do not include songs and crones laments. Do not go into this movie unless you speak fluent Russian.
