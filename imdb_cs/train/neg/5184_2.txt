I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy about Hip Hop but was disappointed at many levels. Above all, the story is so badly recycled that it is almost unbearable. Second, settings, acting and story are not too authentic or credible. Third, there are far more good black actors to choose than these standard picks. And what about some originality? Third, very few hip hops were played in entirity - if any. None looks really central. Overall, the film was a big disappointment, but the editorial style was very interesting and almost shot the film.
