Warning: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note: "Nearly". It is nothing more than a lot of random scenes that have joined together in a relaxed attempt at the story. Protagonists (you CAN NOT call them "heroes") will shoot the innocent surrounding audience for their food and also for similar reasons to get rid of them. There are also tons of homoeroticism, which for me was for me. (SPOILER: Murder seems to be only naked and not naked, as other reviews suggest) is soon killed, but miraculously recovers and adds an additional 70 minutes of audience - torture.) I can not shake feelings in this film abomination many times discovered abuse. If you are in the mood of MST3K, you can find this observable, but you can for the most part forget it. Bring instead the original DVD Conan.
