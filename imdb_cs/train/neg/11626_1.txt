This can be the worst show I've ever seen. Beyond the carelessness to have a sitcom about Hitler, it's simply not fun or entertaining. It is very similar to the 1950 sit-in series, which in its game with cornball and fancy situations, but although it can be done well as in I Love Lucy, it's not just fun. I think this show was based on the news "look, it's Hitler like a gloomy sitcom picture," but it just falls in every respect. The guy playing Hitler is so greedy that it's hard to sit alone. I wonder what the network could do that is a good idea. I thought America had some tasty show, but the British beat us this time. America would never have played a sitcom about Hitler, even though we had the show about Lincoln's slave, the mysterious diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. It is likely that you will never see this show because it only broadcast one episode and probably will never be released on DVD.
