I just did not like this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in the city and was pampered by talking about animal movies that are exceptionally well done in every direction. The animals were not pleasant. Everybody was irritating mainly Chris Chrisa, but then what can I expect is Chris Rock. I believe I smiled once or twice on some cute lines, but that's all.
