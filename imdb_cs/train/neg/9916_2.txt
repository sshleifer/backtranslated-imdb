Justin leaves home and lives with his rigorous police detective, but Dad seems to have turned up on three levels of temporary apartments, each of which had bizarre tenants. The spooky idealist Justin is directed to the world of occult, murderous, bad drinking and other daunting things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, I saw the same movie that almost every other reviewer here saw ??? Smart, convincing, original, intense, smart, genius ???? !!? None of these things was a witness. What I saw was an uninteresting, fearless, tortuous, extremely clich√© low-budget thriller that was mature with uncertainties and least tension, as the assassin is telegraphed as soon as possible into the film when he gives his monologue / discussion / discussion. And where are these humorous laughs? I never even smiled, perhaps because I was too busy trying to sleep to sleep. <br /> <br /> My rating: D Extra DVD: Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield; Second commentary with different contributors as well as isolated musical compositions; 4 featurettes (Creating, On Set, Rotating 1 Room to 4, & Inside Black Circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould and Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; bloopers; music video for "addiction"; Trailer for this movie; And trailers for Shock-o-rama, Chainsaw Sally, Skin Crawl, Sinful, Bacterium, Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon,
