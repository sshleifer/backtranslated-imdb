I doubt Jigsaw was when the whole LSD theme got married to the mystery of murder, a clear attempt to grab a young audience of the time without actually showing any understanding of the sixteenth-century culture. The reason is that Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including predominant gambling, silly and curved dialogue, LSD obstacles that last infinitely long even after the point was dropped home in the first 60 seconds, failure to create a real tension in the real plot is great on paper the tool that does it, and the end that is so complex and predictable (not to mention many bad TV shows) that the climax is in fact an anti-climax. If it was a better film, we could stop mistrust on a few things to help with joy, but the weaknesses are so spectacular that they only serve to point out the improbability that the viewers otherwise oversaw. I saw Jigsaw on TV, and it is definitely a late night TV ticket designed to fill the airspace and extend the time to kill some insomnia rather than nothing anyone should be actively looking for. Best, three out of ten.
