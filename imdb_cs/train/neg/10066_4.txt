I recently watched it and there is one version that is shorter. I feel like they're the same movie, but I'd like to know the difference. One of them is Japanese and no pikachu short is all it can come. Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Ivy was pretty tedious. It sounded as if she were almost asleep, with no expression at all, with the few lines she had. It was nice, but it was not very much at all. <br /> <br /> The collector (who has no intention of destroying the world after Lugui) and the usual characters trying to stop him because the attempt to capture Lugia causes a lot of ruin. <br /> <br /> Pokemon the movies that follow are a little better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, no. 8 almost here.
