<br /> <br /> Burn master. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> The totally and the worst film ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces the "Pluto Nash Adventure" as the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this totally idle, unadulterated, unencrypted, fearless, unproductive mess of what is called Robot Jox - and I just found out - THERE ARE EXPOSED! I apologize to Adm Sandler (Zohar Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their movies. This confusion of things makes the films just bad - not terribly horrible and grotesque like this thing. It's the only movie I've ever said - DELETE FROM NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10 out of 10 people considered this comment helpful.
