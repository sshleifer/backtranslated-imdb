I have seen this movie many years ago in a group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals, where we decided to rent a lot of B movies and vote for the one who chose the worst. At night we watched it, it was chosen the best because of the plot and entertainment costuming. This is definitely a stupid, kitschy movie, being watched under the full understanding that you are looking at low-budget fluff. Personally, I would not recommend other substances ... this movie will leave you. <br /> <br /> I got the impression that I was really trying to get my hands on the copy for several years. <br /> <br /> Good choice if you are going to watch bad movies. This is fun and I remember bouncing music ...
