Although I reevaluated the film in two years, I remember exactly what I thought, how it happened. Since I loved the original Little Mermaid and was obsessed with the seas of the sea, I decided that I would have time to sit down and watch the sequel. Disney, I have a small message for you. If you do not have the original direction and the actor handy ... you just try to play your ass. <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with a little older Ariel and her daughter, Melodie. My first big problem was that Eric and the other crew were singing. Yes, I understand that Disney is great for singer and dance figures, but it really is what makes Eric my favorite prince. He was a calm, gathered and real master who knew how to have fun. And he did. NO. SING. <br /> <br /> And then there is a villain. Oh, how can we forget about the glitter that has fallen on our thorns every time Ursula slammed on the screen, terrifyingly like Ariel and the audience all over the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not transferred to her seemingly useless sister, Morgan. Nothing was ever, EVER told Morgan in the first film; she just jumps out of nothing, trying to steal a child. Oh, how cute. The younger sister is checked and instead of going to the trident she decides to kidnap a lunar baby. Gag me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The same plan as her sister, the same guides (who, by the way, did not scare anyone, I had three years on my lap when watching this movie, and she laughed hysterically.) She had no purpose there; I would like to see that mom is a villain. I'm sure she'd do a better job than Little Miss Tish. King Triton made no respect for me in the first film and did not even get started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a stern, but loving father in the first film, and in the second, it almost seemed to have lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, a once comic shock that laughed everyone with their "dingle-hopper" (yes, I admit it, I still called my fork and dingle-hopper). In this movie, Scuttle is forgotten. The supporting character, even in the first, at least added something to the film. He was rich with the taste that others did not have, and in the end he was completely discharged. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as disturbing as before. Disney, do not do it. Do not even try to kill our favorite crabs. Or our favorite small fat fish that become a father and have a lot of very annoying children. He is fat and is vague and looks like he's going for any second. Walrus and penguin were not needed, and after a while you started to contradict everyone. Especially Melody, which has no depth. And one of those days, Disney, I dig out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I did not love your originals so much.
