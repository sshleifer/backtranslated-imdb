Just a horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and a "thing" in the basement that they are still feeding people who leave the street. Of course, it's more than he says, but let's say it more. <br /> <br /> It just did not come for me because it tries to have two ways both as a family drama as a horror film. the film is trying very hard to go through the belly between these two genres, but it seems to be more trying all over the place to try to be shocking, something that is never. It does not help that the final revelation is less spooky than "oh" like "Oh that's it?" Perhaps if I had watched so many horror movies recently, it might be better, or it may have seemed because I would not have compared it so much. <br /> <br />
