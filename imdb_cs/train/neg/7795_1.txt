First of all, I'm not a fan of all the "things going body in disgusting new ways" movie genre, but I'm a bad film afficionado, so my neighbor next to him said he had the worst movie ever. This. So we'll start watching. First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder without a tripod! The second voice of a lean white doctor calls a big black man! Thirdly, none of the dialogues make sense. Fourthly, zombie scenes, though unconvincing and dirty with delicious make-up and tomato paste, make me believe that the director (and my neighboring neighbor) need psychological help. It's funny about 5 minutes, but it's aging fast. It's so amateur that it's like watching badly called high school videotapes ... with zombies. Note for everyone involved in this movie - I want to spend 20 minutes of my life watching this before I fall asleep, back.
