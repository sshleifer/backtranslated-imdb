The idea was amazing, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was bad and there was no depth. I could not really get into this movie. I could not feel the characters, there was a lot of torrents and the film just ended very strangely. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad ending? Again I do not know. You let the theater feel dissatisfied. The film had enough to give, but he could not. Just because you can modify does not mean you should, right? I really would not recommend this movie because you just can not say you left the movie and felt it was done. You will be confused. Trust me, you'll thank me if you do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
