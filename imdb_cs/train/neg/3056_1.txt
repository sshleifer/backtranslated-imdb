Before I saw it, I saw some bad Christmas movies. But as soon as I saw it, "Jingle all the way" looked better than "The Godfather." "Santa Claus" is a funny film about Santa helping children, but almost feels demonic watching. Santa's joyful ho-ho-ho replaces him with an evil, devilish laugh that I'm sure I've turned many kids out of Christmas. The story of this massacre is very strange that fits together with all the performances and the dialogue. Santa lives high above the ground at the North Pole where he prepares for Christmas and children from all over the world. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa's Christmas by making three boys naughty and making diversions like moving the chimney and making a hot flap. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, Santa's helper, Pedro and Merlin, is a sorcerer to get Santa out of this apricot. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is just as bizarre. Satan is dancing a lot, and in fact, he looks much happier than Santa. Santa talks about giving gifts to all boys and girls, yet it appears to deliver only 5 children's homes in Mexico. The reindeer is a toy, and when she laughs, I'm amazed that it does not tear the eyes of the kids ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are just Santa playing the organ while the children are singing. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa Shooting Pitch in the ass with a mini-cannon and indignantly laughs while Pitch is dancing around the pain. I think parents should better tell their little children about where the children come from before they show them. The only positive thing is that you will be hysterical if you appreciate a bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
