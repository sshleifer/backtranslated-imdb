I'm oh, so glad I did not spend money to go to the cinema on it :-). It's no more than compilation of the elements of a few other classic titles such as The Case, Final Fantasy, Abyss, etc. Placed in a rather boring and pointless scenario. I really can not figure out the purpose of creating this film - there is nothing new in its venue, which is also pointless. And there's nothing to watch - FX looks like it's second-hand, you've all seen them in other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
