Film and acting are not bad, and Jay Hernandez does a good job when playing Calito Brigante, but the film forgets it's a prerequisite for a hit. Manufacturers of this prequel clearly did not see the original Carlit's path, or at least not interested. This film is a prequel, which means that the original film has created some history for us and this film should end where the original begins or at least lead to it. No one of the close old friends of Carlito from the original film is appearing in this film, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie, but plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Since this film takes less than five years ago, do not you think one of Carlit's long-time friends appears? In the original, Carlito starts being released from prison after spending five years in prison. This is only a few months between the end of the season and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** Known since the beginning of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so when the predecessor gives us this happy ending of Hollywood, it is an insult to the intelligence of the original fan. What happened to Gail? It's a lack of continuity that makes this movie come directly to release the video.
