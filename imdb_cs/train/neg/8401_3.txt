When I just saw it on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. Obviously, while the stars are stars, they do not actually perform the show. First, they are divided into two groups - Moe, "Shorty," and Larry and Curly as a pair of rogue, so there's not a lot of full team work. The love story that drives the story is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability, there is another group of musical stooges that are unfortunate if you do not consider their attempts to be funny to be sadly crazy. Music is tiring, driving cars on a ranch, and then relying on horses, western clothing is silly and there's so much a movie that does not have a camera. By the way, this is, of course, Curley's first stroke, and his lowered energy level is clear. Vernon Dent emerges soon in an unresolved role. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all those not in Curley, but that little dog is pretty bad.
