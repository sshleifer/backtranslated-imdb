I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in film material can be done as an oboe. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, probably the most amazing character of the season. Frank James has never been mentioned, Cole Young, Ditto and Bloody Bill Anderson, who would cry for his murdered sister every time he went to battle, was completely absent in the script. Instead, we were forced to watch fictional figures that never evolved into someone we cared for. how sad. The costumes were wonderful, just like Missouri. I hope Ang Lee creates another movie from this period and tries it again, or someone else's filmmaker looks at the huge amount of material that writes the screen.
