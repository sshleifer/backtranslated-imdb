If you are under 6 or 7 years of age, you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is attached to the TV when she watches her. As an adult, I can not stand it! I'm fine to continue ... when they have a good story. But it is not far from standard. Please forgive me that I sold what is ultimately a childhood movie, but when you have to sit almost every day, when children who love so much, you will understand why. My daughter would watch this movie over and over again the same day if we left it. </ P> <p> <p> </ p> <p>
