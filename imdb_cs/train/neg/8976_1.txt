The first point that calls attention to "For All Mozart" is the absence of a summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple because there is no story, scenario, plot, or anything that could cause a minimal film structure. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and demanding directors of the cinematographic industry and this pointless bullshit is one of his most hermetic films. I believe he has not even understood what this story is about; but there are intellectuals who explain themselves to justify or explain this dirty movie, and it's funny to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. Name (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
