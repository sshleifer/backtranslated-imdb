If there was a strange reversed Oscar Academy, this movie would win everything. He has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects associated with extremely good acting skills and, of course, in every role is the celebrity superstar. Well, that could be a scenario if the world were reversed, but not. Instead, it's the worst horror movie ever to have done, not just bad actors who seem to read teleprinter scripts with bad dyslexia, but also very little on special effects. For example, the costume of the devil (which by the way is to be seen) is one of the most joyous I've ever seen. Whenever I saw the red-brown so-called Monstrum on the screen, I could not laugh. And at the height of things it seemed that the funny being was transported by a conveyor. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. To check that the IMDB film was released in 2003, he had less than five votes and he thought, "Well, it's worth shooting, it can not be that bad." Yes. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
