Let's just be honest: the only reason someone bought it is the only reason someone has reviewed it, and the only reason anyone could say they enjoy it is that David Lynch did it and because you want the children of David Lynch . But guess what? Even David Lynch can make a piece of crap. Perhaps Lynch wanted you to overcome normality and experienced the absurdity of itself as a pure thing. Perhaps the creepy, cacophonic sounds and visual chicken scratches should mean something about the place of humanity in the world, about our relationship with Real, about the absurdity of everything. Instead it just tells me one thing: I just lost $ 20. If I wanted to be offensive because of the attack, I could raise Hansen to the height and let my ears bleed. If I wanted absurd because of the absurd, I could just take the dump on the plate and watch it for 33 minutes. There is only one redemption of the quality of Dumbland - that's meta, meta funny. That means it's so bad it's not funny, because it's so bad. But this is a bit funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If it is not, save agony.
