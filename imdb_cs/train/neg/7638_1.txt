I did not even even dream of watching the film until the end. I can not comment on the story because I did not watch the whole movie and the reason I could not watch it was because of the "actors." First of all, for the most part, they looked stiff and I'm sure their scenarios are in their hands only out of the box - but that's a minor problem. The main problem I have with the actors is not really their fault ... it's the one who made the movie! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought the departure of people in their late twenties to play teenagers came out of fashion with a new wave? I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines, from an older man older than me, is "I'm 17!" How can someone take seriously ????? Do not forget about this movie, go for a walk for 90 minutes, and get a lot more than this movie could give.
