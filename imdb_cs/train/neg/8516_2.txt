Last week, I looked at the Nielsen weekly review and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you can not see". <br /> <br /> Well, they're right you're not following it. It has been sent twice and ranged between 147 and 145 out of 147. Translation: This is the least rated show on every national broadcaster ... and deserves it. I tried to watch her several times because of all the news that you know it is a "great" show, a "realistic view" of life and all that nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Mars is a drill. It's as unreal as it gets, and it deserves to be canceled. The only secret is why CW felt compelled to deploy its inaugural plan for the smallest evaluation after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure.
