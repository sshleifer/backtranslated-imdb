Lies talks about an affair between an 18-year-old woman and a married 38-year-old married man with a pair of protags who spent about half of the time on the naked sex and hockey screen, and the other half is meandered through a pathetic naive story that seems to be just a justification for sexual scenes. With very poor production value, including obvious sanitary appliances and fake softcore sex with a story that is a dirty combination of comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes superfluous and nauseam. With nearly two hours of running, subtitles and so little stuff, "Lies" is simply not recommended. (C-)
