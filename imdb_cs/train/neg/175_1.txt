I saw this afternoon cabin at the lake of the USA. Since this film was made for television, it was quite interesting to follow the sequel. So tonight I was tuned to the broadcast and I was very disappointed. I knew I would not like the movie, but I did not expect to be concerned about DV (digital video). The film would be acceptable if it were not for these side-by-side digital images that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the conspiracy line to be associated with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: FOLLOWING YOU CAN SPOILER !!!!) The open end in the lake cabin was acceptable, but the open end to the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee a return to a lake cabin that is able to watch if the film is shown against anything but infomercials at 4am.
