The sample is average. I do not have to laugh separately. But I think Courtney really does. It does not look naturally. It has these three ways to talk, all robotic. He speaks silently (without intonation), speaks normally (without intonation), or does the thing where he normally starts talking, and starts screaming gradually. However, her scream is like "Pretend to shout because I should not be too loud on the set". <br /> <br /> She always realizes that this cute actress is doing this fun thing. It is annoying. You can not really get her personality because she really does not make emotions and will not get angry. She has that husband who does all the stupid things, and there is no response. Very dry and clean.
