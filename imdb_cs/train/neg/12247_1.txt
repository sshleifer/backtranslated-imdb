This movie is really terrible. horrible as it is a loss of 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are so terrible. Effectiveness was not convincing. His crocodile, who attacks tourists when filming a document about "surfing the blood". Blood Surfing is when surfing around sharks, but it happens terribly wrong when a crocodile step 31 breaks down there vacation. Sharks do not really look. The crocodile is even worse and is even better when they escape from the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and the two women light it. Deaths are counterfeited and pirates are just enough to fill the time. <br /> <br /> An unnecessary, terrible movie that is not worth seeing!
