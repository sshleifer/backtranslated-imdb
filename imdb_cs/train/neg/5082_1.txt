It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop filming. They always get worse. Niki and Flo (2003) are depressing stings in the camera. It is unfortunate that many of the films that take place annually in Romania will get the worst of them abroad (eg the Chicago International Film Festival). This film without plot, acting or script is a waste of time and money. Score: 0.02 out of 10.
