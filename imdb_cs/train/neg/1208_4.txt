OK, if you are a woman who has problems with aggression, you can enjoy this movie. Do you hate your important others? This movie is for you. For boys it will be a laughing bag. It's sad when the former award-winning actresses have to make movies at a reduced speed. <br /> <br /> The only really good part is the last 10 seconds. It was Hall. <br /> <br /> My wife has been choosing the worst movies lately. That's what you get (me) when I let a woman pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites.
