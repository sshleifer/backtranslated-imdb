I have never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime", I'm crazy to visit this city! Several times I was in NY and I love the city and its neighborhood. I was obviously expecting to touch this movie, I'll be afraid of the plane, and I'll go out there immediately, but lo and behold, I regret the time and money I spent with him. There are no love stories between people or a person and a city. There are a lot of dysfunctional encounters and relationships or people who know each other and it just does not work well. Maybe it reflects the characteristic features of the city, where thousands of people say that they live on their own. Can not you find love in New York?
