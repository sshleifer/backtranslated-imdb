How would 4 out of the 16 previous voters give this movie 10? How could more than half of the previous voters give 7 or more? Who is voting? I can only assume that they are especially children - very young children. The fact is, it's a bad film in every direction. The story is stupid; acting is hard to even think of as acting; characters are without letters; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw one rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that is sometimes broadcast, I recommend reading the book instead.
