I did not expect to come back a lot, but I was disappointed. It was my favorite Halestorm production I saw. I thought it was going to be a comedy, but I was just shaking for three or four jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat kid eat donuts and fall over and over again? What happened to a listener in heaven? Fred Willard was cheerful with some of his coworkers Christopher Guest, but it did not work. They had to spend all the budget to get the "known" actors who came here because there was no budget for lighting. It looked like it was shot with a video camera and most of the scenes were very dark. Is it really so many films that show someone actually shooting and producing a basket, as opposed to how to cut and adjust the ball that jumps through the basket? I'm trying to be too critical about low budget comedy, but if you want to see something funny going to true church basketball game instead of this movie.
