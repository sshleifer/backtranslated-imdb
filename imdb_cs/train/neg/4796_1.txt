I love John Saxon in whatever he is. Once he takes over the camera, he directs a movie that should be more appropriately called "Please do not look at this movie called: Zombie Death House." $ 1,000 Dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is dear Fred Olen Ray is a delicate way to spend $ 14 on a filmed listing fired by the main 70 legend cheese. Ray is the leading RetroMedia man. By the way, Ray makes Charles Band look hotter than the Ford Falcon stucco ceilings. Just bad, both - and boring. It's great that Ray digs this old thing and in some cases it's a public domain like other dollar video projectors, but in the case of Zombie Death House - (the word "Zombie" that is exaggerated to add ownership and interest in part of FORF) The only way to do this is to make it available on the dollar market for frantic collectors and SAXON fans! If you want to see real Saxony, pick up Black Christmas, Elm Street Nightmare or Glove.
