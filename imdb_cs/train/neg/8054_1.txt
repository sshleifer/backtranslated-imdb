Oh, dear, what a terrible movie. Production was so cheap and unpleasant ... Do you remember the shot of "natural" where the lightning strikes the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from? But the producers of this film used the same scene to pre-connect the scene where the tree branch hit the house. I wonder if they paid for using the record of The Natural, or did they just hope that nobody who would watch the movie would pick it up? Then at the end, trying to get off the truck. Such excessive work in the cabin. <br /> <br /> Really bad movie, really bad movie.
