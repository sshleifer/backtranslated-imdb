I'm a nice guy and I like to think of myself as a tolerant genre. And I mean by trying to consider the film in the context of the genre in which it lives. If nothing else, it saves me from feeling like I should say really ugly things about people or movies that I do not like. <br /> <br /> The task in this was clearly evident, the production values ​​are very low and they set, uhm, simplistic. The game has risen from time to time to the area "good for high school". My feeling was that this was done in a day - please tell me it was. Worst of all, sex, though rich enough, was quite secular, at least in my copy of "sound-over" that was inconsistent with the action (climax moaning and yelling while lying on the bed undo bra ???). Surely there was no "margin" at all - nothing different or interesting and surprisingly quick cuts. My voice is "1" and then with the following summary statement: Better if the fill filler material in the club was expanded and the rest of the film condensed.
