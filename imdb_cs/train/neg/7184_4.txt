It was not really a good movie. There were lots of unpredictable and predictable things in the film ... but I think most reviewers lack the reason why this movie should have a wide audience. THIS MAGIC JOHNSON CREATED THIS FILM! Is it not that we all inspired us to look at this film? The movie produced by the former NBA star is not coming everyday, you know. Beautifully stupid kids in a big house that crashed with an ax-controlled psycho. Every clich√© stepped out to stop. Teen sex. And everything produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Teen drug use! College Hijinx! And everything produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
