This is an interesting idea that has become bad. Hidden meanings in art remaining as a serial killer are interesting, but executions in "Anamorph" are unbearably slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe a movie except boring. Capturing tracks are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is boring. Willem Dafoe gives credible performances as an investigator, but has little to do with a script that is shot to the limit. Several supporting characters are unnecessary, including Peter Stormare as artistic expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a medical explorer, and most notably Deborah Harry, who is on the back of the DVD case but has only a few lines spoken through a cracked door . Not recommended. - MERK
