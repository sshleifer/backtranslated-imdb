***** WARNING: May contain SPOILERS ********* My huge problem with this movie is how a totally self-centered and self-consuming woman adultery is! After one evening with a dirty mood, he is persecuted. He constantly calls her and threatens her and even sends the video from their night together. He is VERY Crazy and Very Dangerous. The problem is she just thinks she's dangerous to HER (and reveals her secret). She had never been interested in her husband for a second. Did she even think for a moment that she might be at risk from this psychotic? Once she realized how to be mental, she should warn her husband no matter what the consequences she had. Maybe there would not be a movie, but there was really no such thing as a difference.
