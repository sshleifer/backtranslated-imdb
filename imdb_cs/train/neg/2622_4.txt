102 Dalmatians (2000, Director Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> He believes he is cured, Cruella de Vil is released from prison and strives for a new life. Things are doing well for Cruella, who is busy helping homeless street dogs. When Big Ben throws, things get worse. Hypnotic treatment is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she's decided to do the dirty coat she always wanted. Glenn Close will meet the role of Cruel de Vil again and again will be the top film. Every scene with her is worth watching in this blunt sequel that feels more than repeating the previous movie, rather than a new story. It has changed. ??? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
