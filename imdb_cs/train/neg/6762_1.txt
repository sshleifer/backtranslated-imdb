This is the kind of film everyone should be interested in. Bad overhead, over-the-top and conspiracy that stretches for no other reason than to show violence. I thought when I first saw that it might be a media satire and how it shows violence, it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver's Stone has its worst directing at all. From scenes where Woody Harrelson's face for no reason or the terrible appearance of Robert Downey Jr as Wayne Gale, who is a reporter who seems to be absolutely crazy, this film is just a mess.
