I think I saw all of the Grisham movies and they're all very poor except The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad that it's unbelievable <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where the character is making stupid irrational things that no one would ever do. He's a lawyer for Christ. Why, when his children disappeared, he does not call the police. Yes, it's because all the police hate lawyers, so they simply ignore him and let him be attacked. When he was arrested for murder, he just let him go free, locked up in the cell until the bail was heard. <br /> <br /> Why would you drag your children across the country if you could easily protect them at home. Police are not bothered to try to find the escape of a mental patient, they do not bother interviewing his daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous end ?. <br /> <br /> Overall, a stupid, very unrealistic and complete waste of time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies he ever did.
