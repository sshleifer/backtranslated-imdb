Is rich, tricky Elizabeth Taylor, who adorns the Angel of Death on her Mediterranean forts, or is it over-exaggerated - or more accurately, overcomes - as usual? In fact, they are both usable in the traveling, meandering mess of the Roman director Joseph Losey, called "Boom," appropriately named because the temptations in a lush, luxurious environment are almost ready for an explosion. Richard Burton unleashed Taylor's mountain; dressed him with a samurai jacket with a saber. Although it's great in a wide format, the picture is otherwise deadly, even Liz'n Dick-philes should be lost ("What the hell!" The attitude to their later 60s career has reached ego-crazy nadir here). Painless, confused and insane, "Boom" is a disaster - although scriptwriter Tennessee Williams, who has adapted his own unsuccessful play, "The Train for Milk does not stop there," they say he is quite happy! * z ****
