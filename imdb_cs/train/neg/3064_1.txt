The original "Vanishing Point" was a great movie. Small motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. Remake was terrible. Preachas, obviously obvious; he missed why the original was a classic. The black charger was cool, but it could not even save that. Why to hold the white Challenger? I did not think it was the best choice in the year 71. Some parts of the movie were inadvertently cheerful. Just as Vigo stood on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian friend stood beside him. Vigo had only white panties. I'm sorry - it was just stupid - and he was looking at the sight of his fruit. Another scene was at the end - after an explosive bulldozer crash - a healer said the impact was rated at 180 mph. Then he mentioned that the police said that his remains were not found because he had vanished, but some people believe he rescued and was hidden friends in the crowd. It then shows him that he is in the car at 180 km / h! First of all, you could not open the car door at 180 km / h. Secondly, the car will not go straight for 100 yds. with anyone who runs it. Instantly, it would be about 30 times. Third, if you encounter pavement at 180 km / h, you will go into several shattered pieces. It does not matter that we finally see him with his daughter. Overall, it's a movie that would offend someone's intelligence.
