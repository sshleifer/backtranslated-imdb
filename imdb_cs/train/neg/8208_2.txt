"Hello everyone, I have an idea, we found an eggs in the shape of an egg out of the universe, so why would we thunder it and open it?" "Yes, I know it will be the most powerful thing the scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to the earth and could potentially destroy the human race, but hey, I want to know what's in it." "And no one will tell NASA, they could take us from us." "Wow this thing is vibrating!" "Yes, really strong in touch, so do not touch it, but it's okay to open it." "Hello there, look at my nips". (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN" !!!!! Uh, we have to go all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we do not have telephones, radios or intercoms, even though we have other dollar equipment here. "I've never seen such organic technologies!" "Yeah, let's take this stick and punch it." "From there I can get out of here, I do not care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one will steal me!" "Look, they're friendly aliens from the" abyss, "they want us to come with them." END
