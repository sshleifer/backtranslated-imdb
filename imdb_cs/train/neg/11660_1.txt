Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear she has no real knowledge of how to make movies. he made a brilliant film and it is a haunting movie. the scary film 2 was fine, but everything Keenan has done is a real disaster. avoid such titles as you would not endanger the central south while drinking juice in the hood ..... I know what title! of course, this movie, everything that has the name Keenans in credits. It was an hour and half an hour of stupid nonsense that had never been for me. just believe me maybe this movie a bit like women because of some things that happened, but overall this movie will never love someone with good taste in movies ........ 1/10 ..... .. jd Seaton
