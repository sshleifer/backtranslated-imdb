Here are some of the most problematic issues with this movie: 1) Clichés are full. Seriously, terrible "twists" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The story jumps in time, which would be fine if it was good but not. <br /> <br /> 3) that do not develop so much that they either remain static or drastically change for no reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big: HORRIBLE ACTING. Over the top of almost every person. <br /> <br /> Below are some of the best points in the movie: 1) Leadership is damn good looking. <br /> <br /> As I can see, there are only two kinds of people who would be in this movie: a) People who can sit over 90 minutes rumble simply because the leadership is attractive. b) People who often think of themselves, "I like Hollywood stockings with clichés and passers-by, but if I can only watch it in Korean ..." There is a lot of good Korean cinema, so why waste time with garbage?
