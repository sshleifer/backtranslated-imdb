I think I heard that I had heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and I did not really believe it. I was laughing at what was the worst writing and acting in people's history, I was really afraid I might have a heart attack and die right in the theater. So this is the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched his brother crash and his car brothers exploded just a few steps from him (the hero). "The hero" threw the expected "fit" to see something so tragic and people were trying to keep him from running into a burning car. In the middle of his wearing and his uncontrollable rage / emotional decay, he says, "I'm so sad," he said so? I am a fool?
