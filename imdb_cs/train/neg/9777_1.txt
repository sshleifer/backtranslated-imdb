I was attracted to this film and I'm curious about how she adapted to the brutal novel by Hubert Shelby. I thought a literary piece of such depth, with rich tapestry, terrible situations and social criticism, could not be translated into a bad movie. I was wrong. This movie is a horrible movie experience, not for its content, but for its form. Director Ulrich Edel, in my frank opinion, is doing a terrible directorial work that does not recommend the original book. No wonder Edel is the TV director; this movie looks and looks like a bad movie "made for television". Some of my opinions on this bomb (** spoilers ahead **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of overhead creativity. The scenes are slow, they feel slow, they look bad and they move from the anchored position. The only freedom they can take is in a cinematic space with a pleasant dark tone. In addition, the film has the same technical creativity as a television soap opera. <br /> <br /> - All the actors do a great job of displaying these poor characters. The problem is that adaptation does not include the basic element of land development: MOTIVATION. All of these characters move like robots without a clear motivation to act. They seem to do things blue, like robots, for no reason. Edel lacks any opportunity to enrich the character's evolution by ignoring the character's motivation and avoiding the development of the personality of each character in its full range. This lack of character development is flamboyant at Tralal. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this absurd prostitute, but her decision to let the seafarers disrupt it is not explained. It looks immensely stupid, because we see that this character makes it blue. This is a clear example of bad character development. The film also has many secondary characters that will not do anything, feel nothing, and add nothing to the story. I'd like to learn more about Harry's wife and the interaction between them. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel is approaching the character's development with Harry and his fixation with his homosexual lover, just to skip him at the end without explaining clearly his motivation. Fools are also a joke in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Striking work by Mark Knopfler. I was really looking forward to the former director of Dire Straits, but his work in this film is really missing. Sometimes, as in the battle between trade unionists and the police, it seems that music is completely disconnected from the film. They also feel completely poor and anachronistic; I could swear that the whole soundtrack was made with the Casio keyboard. It distracts from a real action. <br /> <br /> - The book of Desmond Nakano's adaptation is so literal that it eliminates the story's point. They feel as if they were trying so hard in the book to keep action on the scene, forgetting to really develop characters and re-explain their actions and motivations. this film can not be recommended by a fan of Shelby as it can destroy the original book. It is a very inconspicuous effort to adapt the novel and shows very little creative input.
