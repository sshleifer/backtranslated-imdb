I got this movie as a gift, as I knew from the DVD cover, this movie would be bad. After seeing him for more than a year I finally watched him. what am a furious movie ?. <br /> <br /> I almost did not stop watching this bad movie, but it would be unfair to write a review without watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say that 'this film is upset' I'm really shocked that some bad filmmaker gets a bee even funded to make this pathetic movie but it could not cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this film. All you need is an inexpensive camcorder or a camera for cell phones. About 15 people who do not have acting skills, a script written by a few drunk people. In the first part of this very poor motion, the reporter (Tara Woodley) says she needs to be drunk on the way to report a persecuted city. It is completely undamaged. They went to the house to be abandoned, but fortunately it is almost completely furnished and there is a bottle of liqueur on the staircase. just to be drunk, but it's not what it seems. <br /> <br /> Then the assumed drunken man began telling Tara stories about the spiritual / zombie. <br /> <br /> The fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Its story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die completely exhausted (I think it happened) when he let the poor soldier of private Wilson sit down, kick his grave and then crumble soldier Ben Draper bury him in a shallow tomb. But Sgt. Ben Draper is a big surprise. his wife / girl knows about it, and she and her lover kill Sgt. Ben Draper to avenge private Wilson (beside the soldier's grave he dragged away) The soldier wakes up from the tomb in the form of a zombie and kills them for revenge revenge. <br /> <br /> The end of the curvature was so poor. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, do not look at this movie
