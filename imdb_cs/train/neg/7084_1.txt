As many others have said, it is a terrible film from every aspect of film making. How ever it came to some well-known names of actors involved in this project is amazing. Many people complained that it was shot at "cheap" camcorders. Yes, it was shot on video but not "cheap" video. What was wrong was lighting, white balance, shooting and editing techniques. <br /> <br /> We used so many different ways to shoot and edit that it was a manufacturing mess. Rough, inconsistent lighting, despite the use of manual photography (ala Woody Allen), torn editing (another Allen technique), but badly executed, without a real purpose. Lack of white balance in the kitchen of the scene restaurant is embarrassing; very amateur. <br /> <br /> Simulated sex scenes have no value at any level. <br /> <br /> How did this video print out is out of my reach. It is worthwhile to see if it is just wondering how bad it is.
