I am very surprised by the positive comments because we were four who saw it in one show and we all left. We personally felt it was painfully slow to watch and could not sit with the whole movie. And we really tried to stick with it. Especially those who really liked the group because of their personal experiences with the scenario of alienation of sexual orientation in school years did not like it or did not even know it at all. :( <br /> <br /> It is great to see that this movie really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and reviewers, that's the beauty of the subjective artistic form of the film.
