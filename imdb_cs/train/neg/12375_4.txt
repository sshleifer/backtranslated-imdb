A good thing that is at least fresh: almost no films about dance music and club scene (if they are even doing) hit cinemas. And it radiates plenty of energy from music to Ibiza. But the main problem is that he can not decide what he wants to be. Though it certainly likes to be mockumentary consistent with It's Spinal Tap, the creators also realized they would not want to play copycat. However, jokes do not work well, because they are not well written and most characters are under-developed. And he does not have a script in his script and controls it for 90 minutes, so why not fix it for 75? The production department and cinematography are still trying to save the day (eg Paul's home). Strangely and unexpectedly it's all gone Pete Tong works much better than a simple drama in the Almost Famous line. Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer some acting. Conclusion: It's a mess, a little fun at the basic level, but better to spend in your favorite night club.
