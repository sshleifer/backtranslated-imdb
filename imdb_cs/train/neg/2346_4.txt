I first saw this movie for too long on TCM's "Essentials" series. The eye of the clich√© observer was never more. This observer saw little value in this. I was confused by the endless attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) had. It was rumored that Mrs. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character is based on more mousy than attractive. I would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would probably ignore Lucy before they immediately fall in love with her. In the defense of Bacalla, this film was shot at the time of the last Humphreya Bogart disease and the weight of his worsening health could have affected her performance. Of course, Lucy's part of this wisdom was to contrast her with the ugly Maryle who played the grip on Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she engages in wild sensual dance while her father tired of stairs to a fatal heart attack is the best scene in the movie ever since. Malone's performance gets rid of the rest, though Jasper Hadley's fatigue on the disappointment of his two children's behavior is famously portrayed by Robert Keith. In general, however, I must say that I am not a fan of melodrama. The cartoonistic behavior of the characters makes my story too uncomfortable for my taste.
