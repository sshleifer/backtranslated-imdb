My complaints relate to film stimulation and material. With the use of archive film and letters, this film attracts a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material that is chosen to emphasize is simply not very interesting (for example when Goebbels complains about this disease or illness, etc. a small German city). Also, the film goes together in cover of c. In the years 1920-1939 and then the war years. In short, the film is a little bit better than the documentary film History Channel, except that the filmmaker has a little more sense than your average documentary editor, so he can better organize the details of Goebbels' life. I still wanted to.
