Well, it's stupid, they say they will not make another Nightmare movie, it's the "last" movie ... And what do they do? They do more, not that the other (part 7) was BAD, but why they play us. In any case, this movie had no meaning what it always was, it was extremely boring, the characters were very one-dimensional, Freddy was another joker who was very stupid for such a good series. The story is very, very bad and it's even worse than part 2 and 5. I did not make the movie, its stupid story in 3-D, useless! I hated that movie so much that I still saw all the parts I did not like, which was basically the whole movie. It's so different from the ancestors, trying and trying, but this one tried most and got on the face. There were some deadly scenes, though different, they were exhausted. As they managed to get this far, they did not see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5, but they do it, and that's all for the money, you do not know this Noodmare SERIES sale. /> I am NIGHTMARE at ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS FILM: He had potential with land. <br /> <br /> BAD POINTS OF THE FILM: Terrible act / lack of death / Too fun to be classified as horror / very confusing.
