A horrific and lascivious wolf. Young "Red" is wearing full make-up and extremely short shorts and cloak. It took about 20 minutes to realize that it could become a dream of pedophiles. "Up-beat" music sounds a lot like something I heard in a strip club. I think this movie is a bad joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, glad to watch with my daughter, I do not want her to think it's normal for families to see grandparents porn fuck together. Very bad, very sad that it is sold as a family film, Joey Fatone is probably going to be embarrassed to be in it. And what about advertising as "special effects magnificent" ??? The effects look like a low budget, they are horrible.
