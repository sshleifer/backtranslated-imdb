Final Score: 1.8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> When I saw "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," I had to be a big kick by Eliza Dushka when I borrowed the movie. "Soul Survivors" is an unsolicited "psychological thriller" dressed as a haunted teen slasher - even when a camouflage killer has a cast of young people like Dushka, Wes Bentley (American Beauty), Casey Affleck (Drowning Mona) and a nice star Melissa Sagemiller. Luke Wilson is also there, ridiculously miscast like a priest. The film, the idea of ​​writer / director Stephen Carpenter, appears to be a mutant offspring of "Open your Eyes" or "Vanilla Sky" and films where the character (and audience) is captured in a world of accidents / deaths. The film preserves the disturbing images and leaves the state in turmoil until the alternative reality finally resolves. I do not think these movies are so fun - by their nature - but "SS" is the cheap truck you like. Visuals, script, acting, and attempt of any originality are for all movies as such. Plus, it's PG-13, so it does not even provide gore or T & A to keep it guilty (even the unrated version is twisted). I heard the film contained some "hot" shower scene between Dushka and Sagemiller. When the film fell apart and all other entertainment seemed lost, I found myself patiently waiting for the shower scene - at least I would miss something. Then comes: the two girls get the color of their shirt, jump into the shower fully dressed and cleanse. And it is done. Did people think it was hot? "Soul Survivors" is one of those endless boring films that are so weak and awkward that it's hard to have any feelings about it. It does not recognize anything and is hardly worth writing. Finally he leaves us empty. Carpenter's final is a clutter of flashing light and sounds, and it is probably the most lively part. It will undoubtedly make bikes like the late night staple on the US or Sci-Fi Channel, due to the low cost and PG-13 rating - and that's probably the best.
