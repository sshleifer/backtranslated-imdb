This should be renamed "The Special Thing of Unsolicited Creators Distorting the Horror As a Shocking Movie." It's one long, boring story of fraternity, so transparent that it could be seen by Flounder from Delta House. Jeff East, a tax-paying actor, can be forgiven for doing any job he could get. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who previously acted as a cinematographic heavyweights like George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once it's available on tape, but fortunately it's not on DVD. Incorrect trash as it belongs to the landfill and nowhere else.
