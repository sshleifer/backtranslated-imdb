Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an unpleasant Indian movie at the age of 14.I need to write another eight lines? Ana de la Reguera to look at like a Mexican nun who will stand up for more and a harder backup of Jack Black. This film is PG 13 version of indie film. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores Mexican culture- deeply. I just suffocated my cultural harshness: Jack Black is so rough. A white person like Jack Black is not my most precious envoy to Mexican culture, as it was. The Wrestling Mexican culture is not the most favorite place for a white boy to look for. I suspect that Mexico is culturally opaque than Jack Black that I introduced here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb changed my review. Should anyone else change?
