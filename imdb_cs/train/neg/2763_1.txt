I started seeing D-War on whims and very low expectations. The film did not make it to me. <br /> <br /> I do not mind stories that touch fidelity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect they will be internally consistent. This film jumped from the desert to the desert without a breath-pause, all scattered by special effects that lag behind LOTR, or even Godzilla. A creative, mysterious warrior from Korea, who has changed shape, has turned curiously into a Caucasian antique dealer and jumping like a deus ex machina to lose the unfortunate protagonists from their latest clutter. A special agent from the FBI, which seems to be totally bloated in ancient Korean folklore due to the excellent "paranormal partition" of the Fed, which has not appeared until that moment. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one cried: "I never wanted it to happen." A reincarnated couple of long dead Koreans who "died as star lovers". Mysterious pendants, ruthless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owes much to the orcs from Peter Jackson), and a snake that loses so much time when he peeks out that whenever his chosen prey is within reach, something comes and turns it off. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is scary, the acting actor effect and the effect of the whole, was sincere, boring. But for me, it was the end, after the final, when the music for the final credits was - Arirang! This is more like Akira Kurosawa, who closes "Ran" with a karaoke by My Way - and let me tell you clearly that I will not, in any case, combine director Shim and Kurosawa. In short, a clumsy collection of clich√©s and narrative non-followers who can appeal to melodramatic and predominant sense in Koran's popular culture, but they should not be worth the ticket for some serious movies that are interested - or even not so seriously. I would suggest that these shops go around and go straight to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth it.
