I love movies about morally corrupt attitudes, but it was too much. The acting was not great, but it was not a real problem. The problem was the diving feeling I got into my stomach about 20 minutes into the movie. These characters were empty. They had almost no depth, and little that was devoted to the cruelty they displayed in the form of friendship. Examining the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give these characters real characters or they are just cardboard cutouts. These figures were cardboard and the painting they gave was just ugly.
