I watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 pairs. It's a parsley every 5 minutes. Seriously, this film is living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not need fixin. A spooky, yet vulnerable heroine, a hard-faced former gold medal martial arts master and a serial killer with "problems". Pure spell.
