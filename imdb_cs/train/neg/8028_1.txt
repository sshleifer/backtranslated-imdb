Please! Do not waste money on this movie. It really is nothing but a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school students. I could not really watch it and I usually like to watch all kinds of B-movies. How could they find a distributor in the world? Funny however: See Wikipedia for "dark area". The boy who wrote the record must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. Money to be spent on actors, camera and editing. Even that would not help because there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, the "dark area" is already receiving too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, STOP filming such films ... you are not doing a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
