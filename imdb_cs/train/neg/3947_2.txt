The humor is modest in comics. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesta Blaise, looks more like an anorexic model. He has neither the morality nor the personality that Modesta has in a comic book. Modesty would never give the woman advice to show more skin to get more money. I do not see any similarities with my comics with Modesta and this movie. His film Mission Impossible would have been that Ethan Hunt was locked in high school jail and talked to a guardian when he went to high school and Hunt would play DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). Soo, if you're a fan of Modesta, you do not see a movie that's just angry. If you do not know much about comic book comics borrowing another movie, do not waste your time with this. I can not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I'll ask for a refund on my DVD store tomorrow.
