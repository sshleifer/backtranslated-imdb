This movie had an IMDB rating of 8.1, so I was expecting much more. It starts to be fun and loving with energy that feels spontaneous. But before the film is in the middle of the road, it starts to pull and everything becomes unpredictable. The characters in the office were wonderful in the first third of the movie, but we know them a little bit well; they become cartoons, not real people. It's the same story I've seen a hundred times, with only somewhat different circumstances here. The point is, I could have another predictable love story, if only the dialogue was not so obsolete! The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivation, and unfortunately that was also the Case Dead Letter Office. Let's hope this movie ends soon in the Dead Movie Office.
