At first, this film reminded me of old films I had to watch in the class of religion at school. That's not a good thing. In essence, it's just a pretentious and demanding piece of dirt, just like the terrible "Left Behind" series. They are not offended by religious films ... but I am offended when these religious movies are very horrible. I just want to say beautiful things about Christian film, but it does not seem like that will happen soon. I bet that if you gave the biblical idiots a decent budget, they would still not be able to do anything good. Just avoid this. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically the rebels of Reverend Wildmon) brings this movie to their website is another reason why I hate myself. In fact, when I saw it, I went home and watched my copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 rating "Crash". Forgive my father because I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
