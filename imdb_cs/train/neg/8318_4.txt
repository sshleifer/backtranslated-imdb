I have seen fantastic stories, but the spaces of this are incredible that they are very close to being ridiculous. A rich and young person undergoes a heart transplant one day after the wedding and he is in some way witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for this phenomenon what will happen then is a mixture of dialogue between ... say ... soul? ... maybe a real life when the chosen mother will do everything to save the life of her son. There is no shade of tension or excitement, just a combination of a bad and simplified plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. That does not mean that the film is totally inadequate - indeed, for the first time, director Joby Harold does a decent job directed by a good team of actors, including Hayden Christensen in his first major role after taking Costume Anakin Skywalker, Jessica Alba, and gifted Lena Olin. Everything would deserve a better story.
