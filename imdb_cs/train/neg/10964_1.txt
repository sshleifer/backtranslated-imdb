I had the bad luck of seeing it at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The walkway as a whole was disappointing and this film was the last nail in the coffin. Being a faithful fan of Leicester's "Alice" books, I was very excited about the predecessor of this film, which only made it much more uncomfortable to watch. Under normal circumstances, I am thrilled with modern changes when treated well. It is usually interesting to see the parallels between the past and the present in the familiar story. Unfortunately, this film was more of a modern play and more than a perverse pop culture. Personalization of the original characters looked like teenage and usually turned out to be terribly annoying. It probably did not help that even actors were not very good. Most of the performances were ridiculously over the top, which I suppose is either the wrong direction or the effort to compensate for the bad scenario. Once I did not smile for the duration of the movie. All jokes were obsolete links to not so current events that will surely lose their poignancy as time passes. Indeed, the only peak of the film was the initial sequence in which the white rabbit is on the way to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of the work of Danny Elfman. I would also have to say that the transformation of the croquet game into the swing dance was terrible. It was undoubtedly at the lowest point of the film. What a joke. You do not see this movie. After I finished, I was really angry.
