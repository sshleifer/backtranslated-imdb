Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a teenage gamin ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies released in years, which is a clear disaster in which two men went into the frenetic exposure of their business tiks in an effort to offset a bad scenario and a bad routing scenario. This thing should be destroyed at birth. I hope John Cleese has paid much for his name to be associated with this catastrophe. He is the only artist who has gone through this messy mess more or less unhurt, his only mistake being that he did not realize that the rest of the cast would reduce the image.
