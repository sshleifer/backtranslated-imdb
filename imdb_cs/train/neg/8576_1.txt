Solid comedy fun, with musical interludes, creates a fast pace that brings about a frantic pace over the maze of humorous complications of the cooler. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong ominous irritation. The script contains all standard mysterious movie props - sliding panels, secret corridors, thunder and lightning, and poisoned arrows. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre are considered heavy gentlemen and the obvious melodrama of the shallow era. Kay Kyser and his band offer great entertainment to people living in the 1940s who have been trying to forget the horrors of World War II.
