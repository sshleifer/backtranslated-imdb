I think if you're in science fiction and horror, it might be interesting. The game was fine, but not great. Two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen, but they are obviously older actresses who at that time were twenty-one. The plot is fine, but the story gets a little bit leapfrogging and letting you wonder if you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the warp speed between the two. The Catholic Church is portrayed as a secret sect to investigate the events that have only occurred to those from this belief. What if the two girls were Protestant? Would Catholics Want Care? So some of what happened. Who knows that sometimes the Catholic Church even learns what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, do not feel that you have lost anything.
