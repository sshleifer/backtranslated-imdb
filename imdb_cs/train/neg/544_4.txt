PROS: The performance of Akshay Kumar (it's just me or does this guy always manage to top AB in their films together?). Several touch scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> CONS: The first hour (jokes were the smallest). Each scene includes Rajpal Yadav. Big stupidity when deciding AB. Let me do it straight, he is convinced that the brutal insult of the soul of a son is in all possible ways (which probably destroys their relationship out of correction) is a better way for him to make Akshay eventually assume some responsibility, and then he really tells him the truth ? WTF? He thinks Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father will die soon because of cancer, but does he think the insult will make him stronger? Am I the only one who does not see logic here? It's easy to make it the biggest film defect. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a stuntman. LMAO !! They told us that he graduated from the first year of college and had an MBA degree. But when the time comes to support himself and his pregnant women, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How to abt really ask for a normal job in ur? Or Heck, anywhere else where life is not threatened? This is incredibly stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - Exit. I hate such melodramatic bullshit. Everything is pushed down to apologize for the character AB that I could not. The whole thing reminded me a bit of Srk in KHNH (which I hate). This "please apologize for the guy with the illness" that the bulls run. I felt rather than fighting than the old man's sympathy. You can not watch the last 20 or so minutes, because of that, so he had to fast FWD. the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Waqt is just too stupid to call a good movie. His prominent director, Vipul Shah, focused on emotionally fragile chicas and old people who might be less concerned with the story that really makes sense. Give them some decent songs, fantastic outfits, lots of glycerin full of scenes, and some stellar power, and they'll happily snap like that.
