Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is an atmospheric story about terrorism that carries supernatural phenomena in an old manor. The atmosphere is well-off and the chills are well organized. An amazing work. <br /> <br /> The 1963 The Haunting Refrigerator remains close to the book, but it also adds its details to the conspiracy. Fortunately, there are very few people, so book terror and chills are even better on the screen. Black and white photographs only contribute to the crawling of the film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And Jan de Bont did it. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting in cinemas - if you could call it a remake. Why did they have to remake the 1963 film is a secret in itself, but for the moment we look at the film itself. <br /> <br /> It usually starts like most horror movies. The set used for Hill House is beautiful and strangely mysterious and for a few minutes it seems that the film will actually be realistic. And then the first fear comes: the harp harness breaks the face of a woman (Dr. Marrow's assistant). That's funny and the truth is that I almost got tears. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film has just spirals down. It seems that acting becomes somewhat wooden while the film continues, with the character of Owen Wilson being particularly irritating (so it's so relieved when it's exhaled by smoke). Special effects actually make this movie, which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. There are many examples of them, so I will not bother. <br /> <br /> So, along with hundreds of others, I strongly recommend you to view the original cooling unit or, alternatively, buy a novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, hold on to it. And if you choose to watch this, watch it on the TV (because many channels love displaying this movie rather than the original) or you rent it cheaply, but please do not buy it whatever you do. Do not waste money! <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
