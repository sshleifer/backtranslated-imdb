and it does not help rohmer that a few years later Syberberg came and did a tremendously great work on the same topic (with little help from Wagner). Maybe this movie was not so obvious when he came out without comparing a Syberberg film that was probably shot down on an even smaller sound scene with fewer sources. Actually, I can not remember at the moment whether the Syberberg movie is a horse. what I know is that the German version is pure magic while it looks like some high production documented on film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> music ... la musique ... is not even credited here on IMDb ... but somebody based it on "12th-14th century air" or something like that ... well it's not great movie help. It looks like a neautentic and cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher !!! <br /> <br /> rohmer is one of those French authors who like their male lead in general quite unattractive and it does not help. Syberberg Parsifal was adorable and today it is seen on German TV to sell some kind of special bike that he invented ... <br /> <br /> I'm worried to think what is watching syberberg on the video is .. I remember when the last time I saw a movie in the theater, the press was so bad that the experience was an incredible 5-hour travesty, but it would still have to overcome what this version offers, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> It points to seriousness for the chuck, but ... this film just needed a beau-coup for more money. It does not look like a medieval handwriting looks CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! oh yeah, it ends up very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this cheese horror is hit ... blah!
