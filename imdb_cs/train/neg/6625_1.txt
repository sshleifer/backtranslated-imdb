this is the first time I write a comment on the IMDb movie. but I had to write for him. his three hours of irreversible torture. from the beginning you get the idea that the movie will be bad. acting is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (he loved him in bhagat singh), but he's in his worst film. it seemed that Amitabh was working hard on this, but somehow fear was missing. prashant paradise is an ineffective actor. and the most irritated part of the film is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director took it in this movie. background score is repeated. somehow I felt that the frame was trying to repeat the sarkar, the color, the background, the camera, but it did not work. PLEASE DO NOT CONFIRM
