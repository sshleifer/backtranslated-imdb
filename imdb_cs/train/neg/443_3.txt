Overall, it's a very disappointed picture. Very, very slowly, they build on the basic story. Marie Schrader's role is looking for her family's secret past. (It seems that every pastime lasts forever, there is no real rhythm in the movie.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazi by a German woman played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is both one-dimensional and stereotyped. *** SPOILERS END *** The film alternates between New York and Berlin and Berlin today. If you do, give the audience information about the time the story takes place. Is there never a clear indication of time? very annoying. The worst part is over. *** SPOILS *** The whole show and the jabber about Jews who are so terribly tortured, just a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. So did the Jews get out of Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews is NEVER answering. Was it Goebels who freed them? Lean Fischer slept with Goebels? In Venice, he received a performance by K. Riemann, why? ??? I have no idea. Is it a Jewish subject?
