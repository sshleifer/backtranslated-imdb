Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a male-villain who seems to have escaped from the WWF has a terrible target with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first boy shoots catches in the fire, but when shooting someone else they just disappear) and it takes some time for a pet for a deer. Then you got unprescribed characters, 30-year-old students, a humble attempt at a surprising end, and lots of others. Avoid at all costs.
