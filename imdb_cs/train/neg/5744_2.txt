This movie was horrible, he just gave it. It was so bad that I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. I'm a film horror film expert myself. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my stomach. And I know this movie is upset. Three-quarters of the film consists of frightened individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not triggered, they are tenacious non-continuous lines without emotion or motivation. When the actors become acceptable, the direction falls into pieces. There were so many jarring shots at a low angle; I thought Leif Jonker had a 3 foot high stand. He used what I say "Leif Maneuver" a few million times: that is, distance from the subject of interest as an amateur. Apparently, the movie crew could not get up early to shoot the sun, shoot the sunset ... and play it back. In the direction of this lazy you are really overwhelmed by the last bloody screenplay. The only thing you can do is that the last five minutes were shot before the first eighty-five minutes. If you want a good (bad) horror film, rent "Riki-Oh" or "Dead Dead" basics. If you are a schub buff, and you are looking for a challenge, give "Darkness" to go. <br /> <br /> Quote about 'movie- <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's time to die!
