The return begins to look promising, with a brutal deadly scene using a mask with a killer. The mask itself is also pretty cool and looks almost identical to the mask used in the 1990 slasher movie "Granny". Since then, the film has been mostly boring. We get a few more deaths, which are good again, but they are not enough. The reason why death is so good is that it's furious and bloody. The story behind the movie is really interesting and it would work very well if it was not boring. <br /> <br /> I would avoid it if you are not a persistent collector - here is not enough to make it an average flicker.
