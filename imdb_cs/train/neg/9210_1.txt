I have completely forgotten on this film. It was the worst and worst attempt to demonize the hobby I've ever seen. It seemed to be a message: "Do not use teenagers for their imagination, they can take games seriously, crazy, and hurt people." I can only guess that the unspeakable writers of this work thought that D & D style games are a form of evil ritual or secret worship.
