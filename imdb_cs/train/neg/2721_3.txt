I'm a big sci-fi fan since the 1950s, but that's not one of my favorites. While the concept of the film was a natural vehicle for sci-fi movies of classic teen barking, the director was too focused on him to make a film. It is clear that he works without money because the whole movie is full of bloated dialogue, which continues and forever. I've never seen so much time in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" and most other people are pretty much in a badly written, runtime dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good skies ... how could casting think that someone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?
