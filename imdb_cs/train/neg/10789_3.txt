If you expect to see a lot in the Alt覺oklar bath, as promised by the brand, you will be very disappointed when you see that the film consists only of the populist style of Alt覺oklar, which concerns the most famous issues such as sex, marriage and cheating. The big nakedness, which apparently looks nowhere and has no relation to the mystery, proves that Alt覺oklar unsuccessfully "tried something new", he quoted. Jokes that focus on sex seem to show that Alt覺oklar has fallen for the famous saying "sex sells". I was hoping to see a very good story with a very good narrative. However, in the end, I found myself seated for 90 minutes and watched Altioklar's experimental, yet still a lot of popularity work.
