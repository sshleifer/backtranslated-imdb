I could not say if Screaming Skull is trying to be a Hitchcock split or a modernized hold of Edgar Allen Poe. Nowadays, somebody would cut them off and introduce it as one of the episodes of television anthologies from the old "Dark Side Stories" ... but only after extensive overwriting. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is, it seems like it's a nice, ugly little story trying to get out of the wreckage of this movie and the actors of course do the best they can, both with their talent and with the material they are to work with. But the director simply did not know how to replace or take a dramatic scene; special effects simply did not work; the scenario telegraphed its dirty fence points so clearly that the fog could see that they were coming; and the soundtrack played the German "oompah band" music when trying to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried really hard. But that's only interesting as a period. I suppose someone very young who would not see a lot of strain or fear could get a "The Screaming Skull" fee, but someone that youngsters probably will not have much of a subtext or motive. ("Mom, why is this pretty man trying to scare the intricate face of a haunted cat?")
