... at least in the first half. If it had begun with the three Navy buddies and focused on the maritime action scene, it would be a much better and stricter film. The second half of the film is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close upships of early 20th century ships, but it's like a blunt tooth. Also, do not look at this movie just because it's Ginger Rogers. It plays an important role, but it is small. The film begins to show three New York City buddies working in the tourist business, as well as the good-nature of the Sally (Ginger Rogers), a contender along the streets. World War One vanishes, all three friends seem totally indifferent to the fight, yet they have signed up to the Navy. One of the three, with the smallest industry civilian (Bill Boyd as Baltimore), finishes the commanding officer for the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make things more complicated, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but she does not have a chance to tell him until the three have gone to war. The film is somewhat more interesting on board the ship, mainly due to the close-ups we have from our own ship, and also because it's true chemistry among the three buddies. However, James Gleason at the age of 49 looks a bit long in his tooth to be shabby, especially when a sign in the clerk's office has stated that you must be between 17 and 35 being eligible. One real obvious flaw in the movie that made me believe that everything outside the nautical scene was celebrated along with minimal care for the costume design, or I should say it was not. In the scenes in New York shortly before the WWI, we all dressed in fashion in 1931 and all the 1931s driving cars - no effort was made to bring this film into season. look at a few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes of a maritime suicide mission, you've seen everything that's worth seeing. The rest is padding.
