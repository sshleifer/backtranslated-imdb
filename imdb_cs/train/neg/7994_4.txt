And quite worthless for a television movie, which is to a large extent called killer insect script. Ants are mysteriously transformed into killers near the hotel. I think it's from the hotel's food, because the waste water from the hotel's kitchen goes directly to the ant's bed. There is a lack of tension in this movie and it's not even scary. Tracking a pile of ants destroying their victims is not too scary. <br /> <br /> The Spoilers section The stupid hero is almost incredible. He told him the health inspector that the ants could not be a hero. It must be a mysterious virus. As the inspector says, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys a huge colony of ants. It removes millions of ants and captures people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> The end of the spoilers Overall, this film is extremely chilly. I do not understand why a DVD was released when it does not have so many deserving movies. My only argument for the DVD is that Suzanne Summers is in the movie. This is a movie to be avoided.
