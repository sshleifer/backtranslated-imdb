I almost drowned in the cheese watching this movie. In fact, I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of Hollywood's poor attempts to come up with a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. He should give Nic Cage a hat and a bull whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in the rise of Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas takes this "lemon". People who are completely and completely on the market (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie was animated, I would take it more seriously. I would rather pay to see a completely stupid film that she did not try to hide. In my opinion, it was an incredibly silly movie and made an incredibly sad attempt to try to hide this fact. <br /> <br /> It seems, of course, that he loves it all.
