If there are derived and predictable thrillers of rape and revenge, then you are in precious treatment ... I really do not like it so I could not find any thing that would buy this special story. It seems to be something from the eighties, another age when it would be directly on the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work well with a weak screenplay and a boring screenplay. But what does Gillian Anderson do with a movie that resembles this situation after having received a brilliant performance like Lady Locklock last year for BBC television adaptation Bleak House? The director says he was influenced by almost rape witnesses and his work on documentary films, but that is not a justification for a bizarre scene where a bunch of rural boys defeated Dyera. I do not think I'm the only person in the laughing cinema. What I do not understand is the involvement of companies for the film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in large independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed by Bullet Boy, code 46 and Red Road - Straighthead do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve note: is it really the best you can do? What will British independent creators do for your artistic judgment? It's a big blot on your reputation. Listen carefully: do you hear thousands of independent British movie fans crying in despair?
