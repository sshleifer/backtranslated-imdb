This could be a very good movie if I could watch it. The camera was very jumping. I was afraid of the introductory credits. Several of us seemed to feel very uncomfortable until the end. But we stayed to the end because it was such a charming and interesting film that gave some insight into young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film intensified the artistic feeling. The effect appeared to be very authentic. Some of the dialogues were a bit difficult to understand, but the theater that is full of Africans of South Africa seemed most fun. But if you get a movement sickness, you can seriously think about skipping this movie. It's typical, but it's not worth the vomiting.
