I did not think it was possible, but I found the film worse than "body melt". This movie is really really bad! What makes it worse is his next Australian movie ... Shot on what looks like VHS, and with a terrible 80s rock soundtrack it's just getting worse, which makes it hard to see how bad the beginning is (a man with a leather up- down in a white tomato sauce spraying someone?). And why are their accents still changing? From bad New York, to drinking English, then pure Aussie! And it's going to be all over! This film also claims to have won a film festival on the cover (I believe it was the Utah Film Festival). It must be a lie, because no one in their true mind would think of anything (maybe Golden Raspers, but I think it's too bad). This movie must be number 1 at bottom 100 !!! It must be ten times as bad as those movies that are already there. <br /> <br /> Good work with movie makers of this waste, proving there's reason not to see movies ..... 0/10
