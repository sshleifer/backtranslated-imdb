The monster of Enemy Mine somehow got into a small mountain community where he stayed. She is about to chase a female doctor - an invisible observer who wants to destroy him. This female murder, who looks like a fugitive from the Motley Crue video, rides on a motorcycle and tries to save a lot of kids who have decided to have a big childe weekend right in the middle of the monster lawn. Decapitations and plenty of blood are primarily in place to grab attention from the story, crouching like the bad version of Dr. Island. Moreau (yes, it's worse than Val Kilmer).
