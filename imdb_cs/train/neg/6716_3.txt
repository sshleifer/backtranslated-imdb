Fluffer can have strong elements of porn the industry's truth - but it does not recommend that it is quite shabbily controlled and acted - and with a very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> B levels from the beginning to the extra-hard finish. <br /> <br /> It would be a shame to think that this example is being offered to the public as an example of the latest generation of gay films. Hopefully, it has a limited life in the gay movie festival and can die with a natural death in video. This film opens the Queen Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think his success will be heavily influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the previous cocktail party - they will need it.
