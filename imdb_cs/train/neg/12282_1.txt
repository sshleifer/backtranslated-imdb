It was one of the most boring films of "horror" I've ever seen. The College child has a nightmare epidemic in Alcatraz that includes roaming spirits. He's trying to deliver the "Elm Street Nightmare" mix and the standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80-year music video, this movie is stuck full of bad acting and exhausting slow-moving story. Although it's such a bad and often ridiculous movie (kick those balls and horrible dialogue), it would be good to cheat on the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the pride of mentioning the film in 1987 won the Silver Scroll Award from Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil plays in the movie. It is a huge catastrophe, although one with a small cult follows (see other IMDb comments for this film).
