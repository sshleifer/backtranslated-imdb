Elvis left the building and was lucky because he did not have to look at this unfortunate arsonist. Scene by scene by director Joel Zwick finds a way to make the unfortunate scenario even less fun. It results from unsuccessful deaths, trite gay characteristics and jokes, this film is more desperate than fun. This is the kind of movie that makes one hope, Kim Basinger watches Doris Day into early retirement. Remember her as she was (talented) and not what she happened to be. David Leisure, the delicious Dennis Richards and others are all unnecessary talents. Zwick will find a way to minimize your talent at every step. The boy who plays Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the king. The only really good bite is a young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like she and she's pretty good. The only other reason why this film ever looks is to look for a portrait of Tom Hanks. The portrait is not so fun, but at least it's not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick has a charge from Hank or something that would do him.
