This is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way. Sure, we'd love to know what happened 12 years after the last movie, and it works on some level. But new characters are not just interesting. Baby Melody is terribly awful! Unfortunately, while the logic that people can not remain underwater forever is preserved, other basic physical logic is ignored. It's cool if you do not have cold clothes if you're in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the comments here on Return of Jafar are worse, I thought it was worse.
