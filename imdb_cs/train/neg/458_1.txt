What the hell is that? My little cousin obviously chose it because of an exaggerated girl and a title ... I decided to follow her so she was bored and I was terribly horrified at the terrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was terrible. They look like amateur acting readers. The delivery is partial and very formal. Cutting the scene was terrible. It looks like they took it straight out of the story if there was one. <br /> <br /> Secondly, jokes and stereotypes were not at all original or well played - again, very formic. I can not count the times when I was able to predict another joke. I smiled a moment from the gentle "soft" sexual cues. Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. come on! Just ... stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not stupid - funny. It's just stupid - stupid. It's like a childish PG movie with unnecessary sexual pressure, vulgarity and violence that threatens MPAA ratings. STEY AWAY <br /> <br /> "Would you like to go to the yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Do you call it that way?" <br /> <br /> "You could ride my ding." "Oh, I think I got blood on a stool!" <br /> <br /> It was bad to play, sir.
