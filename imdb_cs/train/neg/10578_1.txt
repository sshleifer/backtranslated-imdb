Horror fans (I speak for over 12 years, even if you are under 12 years of age, I'm sorry for what you might consider to be an insult): In short, if you appreciate your fantasy being disturbed by a well-written and original narrative narrative unpredictable well-groomed horror and delivered over convincing performances, then I can cordially recommend - avoiding these steamers - from directors who have apparently long delayed sales by date. It's no coincidence that almost every episode feels like it was in the 1980s. It should not be directly on the shoulders of some old boys (or even the 80s) because where we would have been without certain films such as Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (actually Clive, WTF you do that I like to see that Romero had a good sense to give him a miss, because I'm sure he was asked to participate ...). Maybe we should point our finger to Michel Garris' creator, whose mandate includes logic that is reflected and depressively badly recommended television remake of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece "The Shining". Perhaps it is a sign of state television today. Are we so hungry about good TV horror, that we applaud some old sloppy discourse that excludes networks into our files? Unfortunately, maybe so. <br /> <br /> Under normal circumstances, I would not see a reason to add a comment that would not support mistakes and merits of production. However, since this series lacks any merit (perhaps with the only exception of the theme melody), I write it as a warning rather than a review: DO NOT USE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. If you disagree with me, it is more than likely that you have not seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start, but if these "Masters of Horror" were evaluated on these works themselves, they were never allowed to take a bachelor study either. If, of course, they were studying at the University of S ** t.
