Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and obviously big thumbs) who stops running, eventually finding her true spot among a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch dedicated to preserving The Whooping Crane; Rain (Bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, a thumb or no. Gus Van Sant directed and edited the book Tom Robbins, but his satire does not have a primary goal and just jumps across the map like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but that does not include the audience). The notorious box-office flop was not as spectacular as it was ignored, and it is to be seen why: it's a number of sketches in the search for storyline and performances, direction and cinematography are changing. Thurman is a stitch who, alongside the highway, is trying to get into the drive but it has to a great extent given kibosh to Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write, but perhaps have it) gives the most assured performance as a doctor who works on one of those inches. <br /> <br /> Two inches down.
