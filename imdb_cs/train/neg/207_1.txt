This film is a 90-minute Ramones concert with a short period of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is that so? <br /> <br /> If you are not the main fan of Ramones, DO NOT MISS AND REPEAT NEVER spend time like me. It is totally indivisible from beginning to end. This film should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone likes this movie. There is no suggestion in this image. As for the teenage comedy, you scratch the bottom of the barrel with this.
