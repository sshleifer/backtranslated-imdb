This version is pretty insipid, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books since childhood, but William Hurt is tired, determined acting style is totally unsuitable for the courageous passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, hopeless teenager whose tooth stomach hurt! I can not even believe that since the end of the book, Edward has eliminated a great scene for marriage, which is one of the most interesting moments in literature. I appreciate that they eventually used such a young, ordinary woman to play Jane, which should be a secular 18, but if you want to see a version that portrays the personality and passion of the novel, look at the 70 versions with George C. Scott and Susanna York. York was too old, tall and handsome to play Jane, but no one touched Rochester's character as Scott did.
