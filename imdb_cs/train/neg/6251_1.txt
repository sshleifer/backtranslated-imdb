I only managed to keep the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie. The most obvious absurdity was that while Americans in the North Korean prison camp are reportedly suffering from a serious lack of food and medicine, they go swimming without swimming, shaking in fragile and dirty parks, and sleeping on bare floors, and - remember permanent torture - they can always perfect their hair. With the exception of the suitably austere Harry Morgan as commander of the army, casting and acting, they are just terrible. It seems that Ronald Regan does not serve to portray one character and rather instead creates schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. Mostly a Caucasian actress who depicted North Korean camp officers could be forgiven, but when Russian officers who advised the Koreans wore Nazi uniforms with iodpurs and jackboots (apparent costume-recycling departments from WWII flicks) and speak accented by General Burkhalter of Hogan's heroes, well, that's only six kinds of stupidity. Do not waste time on this.
