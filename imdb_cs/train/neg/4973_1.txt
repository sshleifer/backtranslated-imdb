I stopped five minutes when Beowulf got a double, automatic crossbow with a focus on him. Not only do the crossbows have no telescopic sights, but Beowulf defeated Grendel in the fight against his hands. The dreadful, wooden actress and the everlasting darkness that affects all sci-fi original films did not help. When I got only a few minutes before I felt my bile climb and decided to watch my love of Lucy instead of it, it really is all I have to say. But you can just realize that it's a movie made for television and skip it right there. <br /> <br /> And travesty.
