What I can say is the theft of my time that I was admitted to see this movie and I have to say what a terrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this film. Larryjoe76 is probably a shill reviewer. It seems the story is the smallest, but the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. See this movie at your own risk. David Tang of Shanghai Tang should be after the film for little or no income to generate this movie. The banner fence tries to compete with other rom-koms there, and only mixes into the scenery. It was like watching a dry color. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on youtube.
