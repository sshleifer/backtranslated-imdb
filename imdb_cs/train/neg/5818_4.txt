--- what happened to these unlike people. Alan Arkin was as unhappy as usual, and he simply went through the roles. Children are a mess. Mariesa Tome wishes her role never to have started. And what do Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno do in this really bad movie? If you like watching the losers in their dysfunction and not trying better, it's your movie. Everybody else, walk through, read a book, or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
