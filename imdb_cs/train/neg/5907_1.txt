Yeah, it sums it up. This movie was frightening. In two minutes I wanted to earn my eyes. This was recognized as an "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not good for the members of this church! I do not think any human being should be so sacrificed to watch a film of this low quality. First of all, you can say that no effort has been made in this movie. It seems as if the horrible, glib, trite's conspiracy was throwing two crazy lasers that were somewhat impregnated with a gift for a coherent (at least half-thought) idea. Then there is an acting that is stupid from all involved. Even buddies can not do anything. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow blockbuster that we would like to believe he can change but this journey is full of embarrassing bad dialogue, terribly ominous "gags" and many Mormon "jokes" that someone in their right mind, LDS or not, should consider pure * stupid *! It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
