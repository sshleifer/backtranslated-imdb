I do not know why, but for some sick reasons I think that since I was on Disney's sequel, I decided to go further and see 102 Dalmatians. The first movie, which was a remake of the classic Disney cartoon, played by Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, looked like a hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason these movies do not work is that 101 Dalmatia, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more attractive for both children and adults. It was not so fun, because adults who want to act like cartoons instead of just real people, I understand they're trying to make it appealing to kids, but it's ridiculous to see the way these actors act in the movie. And the tale of 102 Dalmatians is not really that good. Cruella De Vil is in jail for a while, but things are changing when it is proven that he now loves animals and is a pleasant human being. But her reputation is now damaged as puppies, but she buys a male dog harness and suddenly everyone is loved and seems to have changed. But when they see the Dalmatians of their probation officer, they go crazy and start to see the stains and lose it. She's back to revenge on puppies and she's still determined to get that tiled coat she always wanted. Glenn Close is such a wonderful actress, very rated, but her takeover of Cruella De Vil is good, but we do, this movie has become a funny villain just a silly case of nuts. As cute as puppets, it works more for animation, it sounds silly, but it's not so credible without the cartoon and their personality being in the mix. I do not really recommend 102 Dalmatians, it's okay, but if you agree that the first movie is just a waste of time, it's just the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
