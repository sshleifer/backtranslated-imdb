I will give the writer / director William Gove for finding someone to fund this miserable "thriller." A good argument for not spending the money that HBO has subscribed to, let alone buy DVD based on packaging and blurb. Children's pawn Dennis Hopper and Richard Grieco do not add anything significant to their biographies, though the artistic direction is not absolutely bad. Dialogue lets you admire with delight in his conceit; that's the story in his worst. No tension, no tension, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no. Several attractive and often naked women spice into boredom, but it is definitely the movie that is best considered as a trailer. I apologize for the guy who impressed this thing. Good for late nights, only zonal viewing. You were warned.
