What is the cost of Leftist Hollywood Cliff. This film celebrates the revolt as brave and noble as far as pacifist principles are concerned. The tale ends with a pacifist character played by Danzel Washington, who has in fact been elevated to his betrayal. What's with these Hollywood tools? Is it still a return for McCarthyism? If it sounds cynical, it's because I'm afraid of films that defend the political agenda. Military bronze in this movie is portrayed as what else? Gung-warriors. Does it sound familiar? Do you ever see a movie where the CIA or some government agency is not bad? Think about it. Nevertheless, Crimson Tide again emphasizes. Hackman's character, Captain U-boat Ramsey, strikes like a furious fool until the very end, of course, when he comes to his senses, finishes 360, renounces his bloody lust, proposes support for the betrayed Ron Hunter, and repents of leaving the service. The boy revolts, takes command of your boat, exposes US to a serious risk of getting the first nuclear attack and you support it ??? What a pig!
