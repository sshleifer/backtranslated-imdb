I'm a Christian ... and I feel like this movie is terrible. Nobody other than a hard Christian, Bible Christians will love this movie. The message is on the face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be much finer. You can not have a dad to worship the bible around and carry him with him on every scene. RIDICULOUS! <br /> <br /> Bad direction. Revealing the missing people was scary, but it was ridiculous. They leave their clothes on the floor? It reminded me of the old films Ed Wood: "Oh, God! People are missing!" The scene in the plane is simply stupid. Think about it: If you have found your relatives' clothes next to you, do not just cry "Oh, God, they disappeared, it is missing!" and start crying and shouting. At first you would be denied ... you simply would not have reached this conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster at FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite image is a dog sitting on a lawn with a pile of clothes and shoes sitting next to him. I fell from the couch as I laughed. <br /> <br /> Music was so bad and distracting. It was as if the composer was in his own world and recorded his own films. "Here's my chance to make a thriller", "Here's my chance to do something!" STOP TELING ME HOW TO CREATE JAMES COVELL! A good score supports what's happening on the screen ... this movie needed more UNDER scores, instead it was just as good as the news. <br /> <br /> The writing was not clear. Also, Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was worse: "you do not understand, people are missing!". Brad Johnson was ridiculous. Two performing performances come from Anti-Christ and the older guy (I apologize, I can not remember their names). While watching "making" (to answer my question "what did they think ???"), producers and filmmakers and actors are just deceiving ... they say: "we reach a wide audience," and "brother Johnson is amazing" and "it's like Hollywood film ". I came to the conclusion that they just do not know what they're doing "heck". <br /> <br /> I praise this effort. Getting a message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best possible means to do that. Watch movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNY, CONTACT, PASION OF CHRIST, AND O'BROTHER, WHERE IS ART? As a result, the film needs people who have talent and vision. Unfortunately it was not.
