1975 MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE is a wonderful and wonderful movie you can watch. This is not because the fight is especially inspired or because the movie makes sense at all. It's because the movie is so stupid and so over the top it's a classic camp - bad, but pleasantly bad. Star blind film guy who has a frisbee-like device on a chain that's skin from human heads when he professionally throws it on his enemies! Who cares that it's physically impossible, or that the movie contains such stupid things as a 12-foot paper-mache fighter or that guy was blind! It's just a sphere that can be watched from start to finish - and one of my favorite "bad" movies and a great view with friends. Thanks to this movie, I was very happy to see GILLOTINE (1977), but unfortunately it turned out not to be a sequel but a bit of a knock - to take many of the ideas from the original, but to neglect making the film cohesive or observable. Sure, it's silly fun, but it never approaches the MASTER OF FLYING GUILLOTINE in entertainment value. Just like the original film, there are those strange flying machines that separate heads, but they are quite different - with circular saw blades and almost self-minded. There is no blind guy, but instead there are a lot of baddies who do not really have depth, nor do the audiences understand exactly what is in this English dubbed version because the fence is completely incomprehensible. At the same time, however, some martial arts events are very good. Though this is not in line with the high standards of most of Bruce Lee's and Sonny Chiba's films, this action is worthwhile despite the absurd and often mocking conspiracy. Overall, it's a movie that martial artists can (despite many, many, many, many flaws), but also that others probably turn off or laugh hysterically instead of enjoying the action because the movie is so ridiculous. But, most importantly, it can never be as fun or observable as the MASTER OF FLYING GUILLOTINE. Very bad.
