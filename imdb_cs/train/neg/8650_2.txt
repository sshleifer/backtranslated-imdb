If it was not for some immature grateful idiot, I know I insist on looking at this "documentary," I would never have seen this comedy! This movie is full of bad scripts and ridiculous moments. Especially this is where Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming in the streets while allowing the cameraman to continue filming his arrest and then leave, still shooting probably in his luxury hotel. Then there is a scene where the car hits another car that has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without the evidence of being in a crash or explosion. I am surprised at the current rating (5,8 / 10). I thought IMDb users were more meaningful.
