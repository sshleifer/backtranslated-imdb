Do not let the name of this movie be deceived, in fact Jake Speed ​​character is quite possibly the most powerful action hero ever known film. When Jake Speed ​​does not save the virgin girl from evil madmen, which is often not, she is seriously relaxing. Maybe it adds his charm, but in my opinion, the action hero is not chill out whenever he gets a chance. In addition, unlike other brave heroes who usually have an impressive talent list, this man does not have any unless you can not learn to sleep. In any case, this movie is essentially worthless, writing under parables, and the action, if any, is very chubby. (Machine gun on the jeep was not bad, but that's probably so) So if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then it's perfect for you - It's a hero not only sleeps but also his audience.
