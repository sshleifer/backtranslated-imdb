:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Arno is a really good guy, . He escaped, but after a short while he was caught again. This time he ends up in a wild real estate show where he should run for a moment from a pile of hardcore boys with different motives and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know it's harder than the hardest of the hard guys. I really wanted to like this movie, be a fan of Arnie and everyone. However, "Running Man" contains too many shortcomings, which really bother me. E.g. Reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where a shocked audience is shown a brief summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different angles of the camera. This means that the military helicopter Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras that were shooting crew members, one of which was spotted by one of Arnie's crew. There are other mistakes, and a conspiracy that, in theory, seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a moment, then it creates a bit of stupidity and unrealism in which it drowns. be said to be something better than under the par, with Arnie in the lead role, making an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast gets out without being particularly good or bad. The special effects are fine without being impressive. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: 3/10
