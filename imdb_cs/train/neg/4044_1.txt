In terms of conspiracy and movement, this film was horrible. I found out that I was looking at the clock in the theater and I hope it will end and relieve the 80 minutes long that it has done mercifully. In essence, five characters appear in the film: Son and father, sonfriend, and two male characters of the age of a son who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to indicate homo-eroticism, but nothing like that was or did not happen. There were some great scenes. At the beginning of the movie, a boyfriend's son appears at the window next to her room and takes part in a special conversation. Photography and acting gave an incredible seduction to the interaction between the two, which ended with admitting having another man who was "older". The end of this story.
