I was talking to watch this movie by a friend who blubbered about what a cute story it was. Yuck. I want my two hours back, how could I have done so much more productive things with my time ... like a shake of thumbs. I do not see anything that would ever be redeemed about this movie, except for the aspect of eye and candy ... 3/10 (and that's generous)
