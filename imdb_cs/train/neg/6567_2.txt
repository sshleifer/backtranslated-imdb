I went to this film and hoped it would be best. I like war musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball have done a good job with their roles; the writers gave them a boring dialogue. The love-interest between the two did not have any real growth; it was just that. I do not think I have the power of music. the best figure was the snippet we heard about Spike Jones' Der Fuhrer's Face. One complete number that Spike Jones had little of his great musical comedy; pretty things, even with monkeys. Bert Lahr's comedy was endless. <br /> <br /> There were parts you can look forward to: Lucille Ball was pretty good looking, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on the screen.
