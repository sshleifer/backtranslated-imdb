How wonderful. One more film about America, someone who visited here probably half a dozen, one day a piece and believes he is an "expert" on the ground. Sheesh. I should travel to Germany in a week and then go back and make a film about Germany as a "Nazi country" or something like that. Wim IL guy, you and Lars von Trier should do the ULTIMATE movie about the Americans. Of course, we all know that this requires a demanding leftist "we are a world" European to create a "real" film about America. Yeah, right. For a continent that has not only begun two world wars, Europe certainly has a lot of views on America's bad "foreign policy". <br /> <br /> Do not worry, Wim IL boy, there are a lot of UC-Berkeley Americans who just love your movie. Of course, these people are the same people who think George W. Bush is the worst of Hitler, and that the image of a can of soup is a "pure genius"!
