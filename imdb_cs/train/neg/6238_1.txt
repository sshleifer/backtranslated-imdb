Oh, man, it's amazing how one can say that global warming is science, well, I think this elusive nonsense now replaces the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to complicate this issue, though she simply needs common sense to see that the whole thing is a big scam for a man who has his own earnings agenda! How did scientists estimate the historical temperatures of this planet? Estimation of solar radiation activity. Nobody has ever questioned whether this method was accurate? No, not even Gore! So how would it not be right to predict future temperature with solar radiation if it was accurate in the past? According to the solar radiation spots, the temperature is now completely in line with what it should be. Why has the temperature in the whole universe increased (relatively) just like on Earth? Does our SUV cause the temperature on Jupiter to rise? Use some common sense! You do not have to be a rocket scientist to find that it's nothing but HOAX. Try it yourself. What did Al Gore and his elite friends like Rothschild (the banking family who organized a live Earth event) get out of it? Well, the new World Bank will be based on carbon credits, that's a tax on everything that gives CO2, so it's easier to get rid of these taxes if people are tempted to think it's saving the world when it's just about money, centralized control, and greater power to elite bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Is not it noble to pay volunteer carbon credits to save the world, especially when it comes to own business? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and use my own common sense and I'm sure you will come to the right conclusion!
