Yes, I was sitting all over, God knows why. It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was a bit cold out there, okay, they're all chaotic excuses, but they're all I have. I gave The Darkling four stars out of 10 - I saw worse movies, but this is definitely right in the old bad bin - poor script, bad acting, bad lighting and cheese special effects. A story that never makes sense revolves around this simple little family, daddy, mum and little girl - which I suppose the viewer is to be "identified", all three were lengthy and annoying. You just want the dark side to get each one of them. <br /> <br /> Daddy is a cook whose hobby is car. Dad meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also the holder of a being he bought in a "mysterious" Orient. Rubin holds him in the cage and calls him "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> Darkling explains about three or four different things during the movie: a shadow without a human, the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the devil. So choose any of these explanations to fit your imagination - because believe me, it does not matter. The main problem with Darkling seems to be that he desires to have a companion - it gets a human companion - and ultimately is dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to the enormous wealth followed by the disaster for the man who has teamed up with The Darkling. And for others - it only leads to a very long, tiring movie. <br /> <br />
