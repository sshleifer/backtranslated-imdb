I have to recover on my back as she watched the whole movie because it was really painful. The incapable painter becomes a full-fledged hitman? This movie was full of absurdity if I mentioned everything I would give the film. Norma Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in the dorm that he has agreed to this film. The hearing was offensive and the story was even worse. As a reasonable and rational person, I could not understand where the writer came from or where he was going with this film. It was the inconvenience of every major figure, there were a number of unfortunate and ridiculous events, then the film ended. One absurd act after the other does not create a movie, it does just a witty train wreck.
