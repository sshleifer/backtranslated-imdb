I thought this movie was terrible. I am a Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many facts were incorrect. The only thing that was true about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the battle scenes were very raw and fake. Many actors and actresses were not too big. Some of the jokes that were supposedly "fun" were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst possible rating it could get. Disney really has to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant film. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste time.
