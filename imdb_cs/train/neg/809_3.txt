I was expecting something from "K-911", I think it looked like a cute movie I can get in. I've always loved dog comedy movies. But it seemed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee. The conspiracy was nice and two love affairs did not have the beginning of chemistry. Not to mention that James seemed to have a completely sexist look in the movie, despite the fact that the writer would not go that way. James really checked me for more than half of the movie. Dogs were real stars and it is quite sad that they radiated actors. I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees it's a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James realizes that it was his brother Jim, who was talented, no offense, but not everyone can be their stellar star. Do not you want Ashlee Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
