This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. The only other bizarre is his SATYRICON. This is a two-and-a-half-hour trip through the strange nightmare of the world of decadence, wealth and sexual challenges. Sutherland makes a curious, unmistakable Casanova and strange transitions in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the autobiography of a great lover do not engage the viewer. However, the artistic direction and design of the costume are INCIDENTAL. The Academy was absent even when nominating the former, but it has done justice by rewarding OSCAR for the second. Also nominated (strangely) was a discontinuous, unnecessary and almost unexpected scenario. Go find out !! The video on the video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes smaller than the original run time. This viewer was grateful.
