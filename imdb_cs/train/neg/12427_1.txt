I hated the movie. It was totally terrible, poor, poor, PITIFUL acting, REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals who were not even LEAST BIT funny (unlike the first two home movies that were very good). all boobie traps are weak, poor justification for badly copied ideas from the first two, which only meant that the people who wrote this movie were just lazy because their payout did not exceed 20 bucks a week. This movie is totally miserable, not worth renting. You do not even see him on TV! Go with your eyes much more useful when you see the first two! BARELY will give this 1 star (out of 10). Just believe me when I say if you like the first two, and you are not a complete silly person, you will not enjoy this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
