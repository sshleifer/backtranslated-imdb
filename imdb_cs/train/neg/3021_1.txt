Tony Scott was never a very good director, but every film he made after "Crimson Tide" seemed to be a step closer to the worst of today's worst job (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least his big, stupid, delusional epics have fun at some primary perverse level). And like other surprised Hollywood biopicets ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," for example) that record the lives of demanding, overstated or utterly shallow ciphers that give the aura of "mysticism" to a society that is thriving on the backstage details, "Domino" is a movie that starts with little potential, and dashes that are infinite in number sixty minutes ago. With an extended duration of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long and spends time with characters incomprehensibly superficial and forgotten (as opposed to superior "Rules of Attraction," Scott's attempts to ironize the process with irony over the dominating self-confident, self-confident rich girl's voice draws attention to the inexperience of film hammers) becomes an act that masochists can find joy. Story? Top-crunchy-babe Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in ersatz-badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous appearance) is sick from the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and accosts gruff lovers reward Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez learn the exciting business ; along the way are double crosses, shootings, media attention (courtesy of Christopher Walken, phoning in his trademark sleazebag) and ridiculous hints of romance. Scott shot the film together in parts that rarely last for more than a few seconds, a shattered resolution to make the film a neonemic nightmare that is frankly uncomfortable watching - if Scott got the chance to shake the picture or misinterpret it; but all this attractive stylistic overload overcomes what has a small plot, characterization and tension in the movie (not to mention its, er, "entertainment" value). Most of the characters appear to be contemptuous or stereotypical, often both (observe an intolerable, several-minute segment when the African-American will introduce a new list of racial categorizations to "Jerry Springer") and I wanted everyone to end the coin's end. "Domino" is a complete, undeniable waste - any interest in this individual that Scott hoped to inspire in his audiences is lost in the sea of ​​migraine causing neon preload for several minutes.
