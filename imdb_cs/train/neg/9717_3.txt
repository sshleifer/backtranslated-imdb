It's a pretty obvious thriller-by-numbers, in which the only possible shout turns out to be hidden for nothing. I looked mainly at Isabelle Huppert's performance in English. It was not great, but then it was a special role. I would not be surprised if half of her contribution turned out to be left on the floor in the ax along with some last minute scripts. <br /> <br /> Actor is the least appealing on this movie. Steve Guttenburg seems to be trying to bathe his role with the spell that everyone has told him to have. There is a sensationally stupid sequence in which it is suggested that his sexual ability will help treat PTSD. It's an unimaginative performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with original charm and character, but it's a little comfort. 3/10
