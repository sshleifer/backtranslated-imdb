ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> When searching for a literally " in the middle of nowhere, "a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a sober hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories about a zombie called" scary ". <br /> <br /> The ABSOLUTE time loss, defending the beginning of Haggerty's painfully amateur performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories that make up most of the run are totally routine, aggravated by strenuous performance, and Brad Sykes, who was previously responsible for CAMP BLOOD (1999). It's not a "funny" movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are "fun" (at least he believed what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts despite the lack of talent); Sykes home movies are in fact aggravating, boring and almost completely free of any redemption of virtue, and most of the audience will feel right angry and cheated by such unimaginable, poorly crafted junk. The 3-D format is completely useless here.
