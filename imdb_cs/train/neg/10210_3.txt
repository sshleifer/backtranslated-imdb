Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once made the majestic and very funny Maitres (1976), and now seems to be making "numbers" of Hollywood thrillers. This is a very lightweight material by John Grisham, crossed with a TV movie plot. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a feisty and independent crime detective specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her dedicated police partner Sam Kennedy and together they make an inconvenient duo. It's not good when two unbalanced college students (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them to a wild geese of persecution - the privilege of very clever and misleading forensic evidence at the scene of the crime. Being good enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin can not make sparks, we must also endure some boring, overly melodramatic shows that illustrate an important event in Cass history. Of course there are frequent shots from the hut on the cliff where there is no doubt that the end of the OTT will be set. Oooh ... atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Look at every CSI episode. It's quite interesting.
