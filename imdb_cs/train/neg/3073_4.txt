The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page is playing in this movie. She will not even appear until two thirds of the film stops, and then its smaller role. I do not consider it a supporting role, but rather a "little" part. Also, the plot has many unexplained features. Some examples are: why does the main character reject her eldest son? Why is her youngest son headed for a train? He says it's a bet that does not say anything. Apparently the writer does not know the definition of a betting bet. This movie is not, in my opinion, worth the rent. Save money and watch them for free on TV if you think you need to see it.
