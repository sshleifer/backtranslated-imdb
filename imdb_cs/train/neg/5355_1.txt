Now I hate cheap movies. I just do not see why you should waste money on a movie you could shoot with your father's camcorder. If I borrow a movie, I want it to be a movie, not a lot of people who thought it would be a good idea to empty some MiniDV tapes. Maybe I hate this much because the guy at the video rental shop said it was great and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, has the stupidest EVER plot, the most unrealistic EVER characters and really, really, really, really BEST SHOWDOWN in the history of EVER movies. Even Tom Savini can not save it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
