I was watching a movie about a love project. please tell Nicolas Cage to see how his character is, and read the lines he says. My life can not continue ... by accident I cut off my own hand ... my brother was close. It's obviously his fault. And because they have a happy ending, he's a handsome guy who cares about Mommy sadly and alone. No closure, bad script, and not enough extension of small characters. Save yourself if you do not get it. The costumes were done appropriately, and the extras did a wonderful job. I'm sure it would be a fun movie, but to make it more about the genre, I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know because it's not an intellectual movie. She is not a cat. It's not a strict romance. And I can not show the children because of gender and the issues to follow. Overall, it's just not a good movie.
