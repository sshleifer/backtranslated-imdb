I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (eg Good Will Hunting, Fisher King, The World According to Garp). These are my favorite films Robin Williams. But taking the day, even if she is doing well, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and certainly the worst film Robin Williams (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> <br /> Every good story will have its ups and downs. This film is huge. I do not need a Hollywood Cheese Fest, but I have to have something other than 90 minutes complete and total hopelessness. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point in the movie is to find out to what extent one person may fall. Answer? Who cares.
