I'm not sure how to start describing how bad this movie is. I like bad movies because they are often the most fun. I like bad special effects, bad gaming, bad music and bad direction. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this film had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> Special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes you can watch include Thunderchild, the woman is crushed by a mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the wreck of a train ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, however, some scenes of alien pedestrians are well done. The game was as bad as it could be because it was based directly on the book by H. G. Wells. Because they have such a good source of material, it's almost as if the actors were trying so hard to make it ridiculous. And then there's the mustache, the most popular piece of hair on my face that I've seen long ago. Of course, only half of the movie contains gaming. The rest are characters that pass around aimlessly and badly done effects. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an unordered director, it would be an injustice to unfortunate directors. With the use of different color filters between the images for no reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds even for indoor scenes, poor green projection, it is amazing how this person ever received permission to direct the film. I could not imagine that it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice for anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did: have some friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker while watching, drinking and maybe you go through it all the way. It makes for an excellent bad movie, so having fun and laughing stupidly with this disaster.
