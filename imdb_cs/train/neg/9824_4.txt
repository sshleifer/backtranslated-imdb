Since I did not know American TV stations when I looked at the cable of my in-law, I first thought it was just a low-budget science fiction movie, then after a few minutes I thought it could be a smart satire on the worst excesses of a Christian fundamentalist, and then I hear it - good sorrow, these people are serious! It's a moment I've seen something so inadvertently cheerful. I hesitated to write caution about it from the fear of offensive believers, but then I saw more reviews and I thought, hey, they could take it. A hard philosophical puzzle: how do you make movies criticizing movies without really showing what you're criticizing? Answer: Make it the only people they appreciate are people who hate movies that you criticize. I suppose some liberals (ugh! Spit when you say that!) Could be offended at the contempt of the creators of those who are not obsessed by the myth of J **** C ***** but I do not mind - it was so sad !
