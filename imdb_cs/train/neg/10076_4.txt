The cruel connection between this film and the first grease occurred at the start of the film, when Didi Conn, one of the four cast members who recurped, approached Maxwell Caulfield, the young student of the exchange. Although in Olivia Newton's previous film there is no foreign language of St. Jana explained, explaining Caulfield's cousin here. What Conn still does at school, I think she just likes hanging around Rydell High, though she's a beautician now. Caulfield is a smart guy, so of course the hood types led by Adrien Zmed call him a joke. And that's especially bad when Zmed's friend decides she likes Caulfield. But be boring, he just will not say it. <br /> <br /> This is when Caulfield decides to act on a modern poetic act. He gets junk on a bicycle, puts it back and learns to ride. He got a leather biker suit with a set of glasses to cover his face. If Michelle Pheiffer does not get cards, Caulfield will not have any trouble with friends on any gay men's leather lane as he is equipped. Lubricant 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and began their successful careers. If you saw the first Mazivo film, a much better film than you would ever have thought of how this film will appear. In addition to Conn, Eva Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all members of the faculty from the original return of the lubricant in their roles. The musical score is not as good as the songs from the original. It's not like Grease 2 is bad, it's not all that great.
