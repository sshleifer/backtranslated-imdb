It seems difficult to understand why this piece of waste was repackaged. The only rescue grace in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in a sexy uniform. Her humor is also to be appreciated. It's a clear plus, but unfortunately a magician would be needed to save this waste. But she has to be positively recognized for her heroic efforts and real professionalism. I can not say the same thing about her star Lilith with a gruff voice that grows on the nervous system. He appeared uninterested and gave the impression that just being on the set was all he needed. All of them, in addition to the Ariaun's performances, were absolutely wasteful.
