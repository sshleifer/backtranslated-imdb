There's a girl and she's running in the woods but ends up in this female clinic and she wants to abort. Her dad's out in the van and he's upset about it. The whole episode takes place in and out of this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice, but I wanted to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw that the baby went out and went into the corner. The part that makes ultra sounds was also quite fun. I was really sorry for the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I could not really blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too much and I would suggest watching "Place Me" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode, but it was not so great.
