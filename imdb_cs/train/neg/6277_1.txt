this movie is really trying. if you are going to make a horror movie, at least give him a reason to believe in closing the viewer. <br /> <br /> You will wait and wait until the movie expects some great explanation, but not. Instead, he tries to be too clever and does not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the movie? where does it actually go? and more importantly, what the hell is going on. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how did it relate to something? just another weak science fiction horror. I like fake reviews of IMDb that say how great it is through related press releases that hit the movie (either, or people have low horizons). it does not cost in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the movie is better than fragile, but at least it gave you reasons and why things happened and have the end result. it does not apply and it's just a snowflake with plenty of pillows to make it all terribly frightening. this movie is as low as when a stranger calls. God, who was also lame. <br /> <br /> A great tip, if you're going to make a horror, you'll make it believable with reflections and explain to the audience what's going on so they have a hook in your story. because if there is no reason or credibility there is nothing solid and can not be scary. no disrespect for the cast or crew because they did a good job. it's just a bad writing.
