This is an incomprehensible awful low budget piece of scary. I do not even have a vocabulary to say how terrible, turgid, boring, confusing, and just strange that this effort is (Hey, what do you know I'm doing ....) In post-Apocalyptic America, some boys meet for beach and killing and chaos - it was so incomprehensible that I could not do any of them. <br /> Seriously, as this one raised National Lampoon will completely defeat me: it's really terrible. And not in his so bad is a good culture. <br /> <br /> It's terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me, then watch her with the intention of loving it, then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbils on acid can not hope to understand. <br /> <br /> Avoid or even better destroy ...
