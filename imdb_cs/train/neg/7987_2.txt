I'm sure it was one of those "WOAH!" Interests in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's simply stupid. The film report is a clich√©. Circle-Vision is disoriented. And the horrible song at the end is a grate. And I really want to install the seats. After so many walks, just a few minutes. And when you hear the movie, it sounds pretty charming! You enjoy sitting, are not you? POORLY! You stand 18 or more minutes and lean on a short railing. Disney should create a newer Maelstrom as an attraction to revive things and replace this boring, insignificant film. It is not good. Skip it. In fact, skip Canada completely if you do not eat there. Go directly to the UK.
