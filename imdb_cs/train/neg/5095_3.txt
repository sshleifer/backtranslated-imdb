Tonight I sat down and forced myself to stick to it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because both the lead, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were the main movie stars of their time, and I wanted to see them in "something else," which certainly was. Both gave fine performances but unfortunate characters. In fact, the whole film is about a shabby town in Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly unpleasant characters (physician is of course the main exception). What Michèle Morgan sometimes sees in Philippe's film to fall in love with him is never said. This is supposedly based on the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. The only thing I could think of is that if Sartro's work is something like that, it must be a very slow attempt to imitate Camus's masterpiece, The Plague, which dealt with the death in North Africa. <br /> <br /> And a well-played, but unimportant movie.
