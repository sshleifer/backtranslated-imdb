And Oscar for the most underestimated classic heroic actor goes - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be given the same respect as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. Her character Herman was one of two reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave it somewhat more than a slightly disturbed loss that we liked, but a spooky behavior that led you to hope for a larger role of the whole movie. The second reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. I myself in the medical profession have to give the professional performance of a self-perceived hypochondriac. Although other "medical errors" gave short moments, especially when a good doctor samples his doctors' medic medic colleagues ... "Well keep on giving it" Unfortunately these two excellent performances could not keep up waking up with three attempts to sit through this unbearably slow film. The conspiracy is predictable only with a few minor changes. Shooting when she drew a legitimate scary atmosphere was much more productive when I was yawning - yes, you can use too much shade. My recommendation - watch it once and see Fryea and Eburne - and lots of caffeine.
