I think there could be a variety of remarks on this topic. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the number of people who like this movie who want it to be "mandatory" or "mandatory". <br /> <br /> I think that gives us some insight into the reasons why this film and the problem it poses is so polarizing. The issue of global warming attracts many people who want to force others to "do right". He refers in particular to more "liberal" people who rely on the fact that it has nothing to do with morality in dormitories, which is usually what the Conservatives want to force you to "good." film problem. Al Gore is a politician. And very successful. He just can not help appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they please. Political appeal is simply too big. And there we remain with a scientific question that can be of immense importance, limited to a political affair that attracts those who are in the political body, with the preference for violence to "do right". Another interesting question is how did these people take away the environmental movement?
