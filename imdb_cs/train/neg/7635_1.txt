I fully agree with Variety's review that the movie is never as entertaining, alive or incomprehensible as the creative process seems to be its premise. The story is bad and the lighting really is problematic. If the film is to be character-driven, bad lighting does not improve acting, and sometimes it is difficult to watch the faces of actors. Many non-African Africans will have difficulty watching English speaking in the movie, and some local humor is lost in the process. I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival last year. The comments and responses to the film ranged from an imperfect and careless to a welcome departure from films about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will truly be among our best in our 110 year old film history. It is no surprise that the film disappeared from the cinemas in Cape Town just two weeks after its release and from most of Durban and Gauteng's cinemas. Among the South African viewers there is an apparently limited appeal.
