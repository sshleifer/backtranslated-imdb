If it was not for the performance of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as clueless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend it to anyone. The plot is centered around a ten-year college reunion that takes place at a supposed abandoned high school (it looks more like a 50-year low-cost horror element) and an upset student who has a very traumatic joke. This student wishes to kill the whole class for revenge. John Hughes is too fond of his characters because only one student is killed, just like lunch lady (Anne Ramsey of Goonies). We are convinced that a supernatural killer is killed, but he never sees a ragged thing! This is a terrible film that continued on the downward spiral of National Lampoon during the 1980s and 1990s.
