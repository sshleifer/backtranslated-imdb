I rarely comment on movies, but I read other comments and I can not believe that people are clapping celluloid garbage. I know there are certain people who have their own agenda, but they leave it to their credit; was badly shot, and the story felt like the director was doing it when he was driving. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the film, which includes young children, because filmmakers apparently knew what they wanted and what their viewers wanted. All I can say is a terrible movie, content is poor and offensive, production is amateurish, and I'm glad they could not shoot a movie like this today
