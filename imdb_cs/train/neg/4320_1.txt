First of all, let me tell you that this is not a movie for people who want to watch something cool and joyful on vacation. This movie is cold, brutal and just totally depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a mummy mom who is at Christmas because her husband lost his job, loses his house, can not buy Christmas gifts for kids, etc. You get an idea, happy things for the holidays. So, Harry Dean Stanton is like a Christmas angel like Gideon, who, in his dark hat and long coat, looks more like a pedophile, who all bothers around children and watches them. What a better way to inhale the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill a family and then offer them to return them if they once again believe in Christmas. Santa Claus is an extortionist, and his Christmas workshop looks more like a shelter for Nazi refugees on lam. The film will make everything so strong that you do not care about the happy end when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and incredible. I'm sure this movie wanted to be something like a Capra, but it left the joy and sentiment about what a holiday movie should be.
