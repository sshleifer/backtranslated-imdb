Even though there is a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this "Succubus" is often called Jess Franco's best film. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts Succubus among his personal favorites. Maybe it was me, but I thought it was a terribly boring and too confusing movie. The opening is great and shows that Janine Reynaud is playing on the SM scene. It's unfortunately down there. Reynaud's character is a maneuver that eventually kills its lovers in some trance. Franco had a decent budget with whom he worked and put him well in nice places, a beautiful photo and a fascinating musical score. This COULD was really his biggest film, unless it was for a poor and uninteresting story. It should be psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better term for describing what is shown here. Half the time you have no idea what's going on or what exactly is being said, so even a short runtime of 80 minutes seems to last forever. This is definitely not my best Frank film. I would not even recommend it to fans of heavy exploits. If you're looking for a better title for Jess Franca, try to get into the hands of "Las Vampiras", "Stupid Dr. Orloff" or "Female Vampire".
