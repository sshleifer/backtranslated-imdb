Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is just upsetting the mind. This show is not funny, not handy, not original, it's just a steaming pile of bulls. Let me start with the characters. The characters are one-dimensional fools with loud, exaggerated voices that sound like nails on the blackboard. Voting could be better. Then it's animation. My GOD, my eyes hurt when I look at it. Everything is too flat, too pointed, too bright and too sweet. Then there is humor or its lack. It's totally idiotic! They just take these class B jokes that are not as fun at all, then repeat them to death. It also fits into some senseless night humor that disgusts me. Finally, the last and least, the music. It's just unpleasant. It sounds like it was composed on the child's computer and does not make any emotions. I wish the score was lower than 1, I really do. This show has to be seriously canceled. It's a show I'm trying to avoid, like a plague. Whenever I hear a theme song, I turn off the television immediately. If you've never seen this show, then you do not. Watch high-quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.
