I just watched this DVD at home. We like the west, so my husband is hired. He began to apologize halfway. Saddles, costumes, accents - everything was off. The part that has made me so angry is where the guy did not place his collector with his bow and arrows when he takes the soul of a fat guy. His only apology was that he "had only two arrows." We looked all the way, and as somebody else said ... too many bad things that would explain any reason why it was bloody. I mean the fact that the boy caught the bad stone from the collector in the same month and the day he was found, what does it mean? And why was there a serious courtroom where everyone died on April 25th, but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still around? If you want the film to have fun after a couple of beers, it can be your movie. However, if you want a real West, you hate this movie.
