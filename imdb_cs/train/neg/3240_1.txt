This is Japan's first film and it's the worst, in my opinion. A bunch of boys tortured the girl for several days before she finally killed her. And at this moment I will say that these movies are NOT real! These are fake horror films that try to be as realistic as possible. Scenes are in many cases bad, but also unrealistic. For example, when I kick a girl on the floor, we can clearly see how to kick and tap the floor of a girl! And how stupid it looks! Sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include animal guts that fall on a girl, a girl exposed to noisy sounds for many hours, nail tearing, worms wound in the girl's body, pierced eye, and crippled with terrible details and the like. Very bad and dirty film and has absolutely nothing of value or kinematic significance. This first item is the poorest and most amateur, although it is not as bloody as another part of the Flesh of Flesh and Blood, which is trying to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment is perhaps the worst thing I've seen and as close as possible to happening there. It is still (of course) fake with (n / t) uff, the only difference to the true "snooping film" is that no one dies or hurts the real in this movie. I can not recommend it to anyone because it is so nasty and repulsive. Those who consider it a great horror film do not know anything about the cinema and its true meaning. I saw it as curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how they are insignificant baskets. They work only at the level of shock and this is not a very valuable film success. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the worst movie I've seen, and the Guinea Pig 4 is probably the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. So, in my book, they are extreme extremes, but they are all.
