Who is Bettie Page? I certainly did not find out when watching this movie. From what I have gathered from other sources, Mrs Page was very much wanted in the Second World War as the queen of "naughty" paintings, and that is exactly what this film describes. I never knew Bettie, woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian upbringing and cruel domestic life, which she just mentioned. The film conceals her personal life and comes directly to the film, "naughty" paintings. Characters are introduced and abandoned in several frames, but the frame is Betty in a pointed bra, Bettie in her belt and stockings, Bettie in slavery ... etc. The film slides in black and white every time Mrs. Page visits Miami Beach. Then back to her shades of gray life in New York, we go. Gretchen Mol shows Bettie as one of the saddest young ladies you've ever met. When Bettie entrusts her friend that she missed being your college educator by gaining A - rather than A, she can assume that there are only two students in the Senior class. The most interesting part of this film is how the quaint photos of Mrs. Page appear in 2007 "naughty". It is really sad that seeing a woman cringing like a climbing pig would not even hit My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was written badly, or if a crazy editor cuts this thing apart. I recommend it only as a resource for people studying the history of tiny underwear.
