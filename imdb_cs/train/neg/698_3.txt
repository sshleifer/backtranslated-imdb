An unimaginable addition to the n-slash editing cycle, which dominated the horror genre in the 1980s. It was filmed as Pranks, but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which is the apparent theft from the horror anthology of 1970 The House That Dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognizable face of her cast, and it was her first horror film (also appeared in The Inception and The Fly II).
