Phantom of the Mall is a movie that best suits the "easily forgotten" category. It's a pretty miserable version of the famous story of Gaston Leroux, Phantom of the Opera. It's not a bad idea in itself, but the conspiracy and production of this film is so weak to bring a respectable tribute to this story. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux does not have to return to his grave yet. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many unnecessary flashes and too many boring sequences that can be remembered. Scriptwriters also wanted the story to give too much of it. And although there is a lot of mystery about Eric's character ... the basic plot is common and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** This is a young couple who gets tortured brutally because the boy is killed in a fire. That fire was placed in his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home to make room for a huge shopping mall to be built. The boy survived the fire and hid in the store to avenge himself. Meanwhile, she is guarding her girl who now works in the store and tries to forget about her loss. **** END SPOILERS *** This rather simple - but rather effective - plot is compounded by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. While it should be just a funny horror film, it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are several innovative murders, but they are not satisfactory enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And moreover, Phantom of the Mall could have a bit of humor! All this production - including cast - is too serious in itself. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... Like Ken Foree stars! Die-hard horror fans will surely recognize him as Peter at the dawn of the dead! It is like a horrible milestone that still has to find equality. Although his role in this film is limited and even totally unnecessary ... it was good to see him again. Movie fans also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor, she is a great actress and elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this, but I can not stand it ... so my opinion can be a bit distorted. And finally a little praise by leading actress Kari Whitman. She is an extremely beautiful girl and she has a little talent ... it's bad she never got to the top. Actually, this film is her greatest success and it tells a lot about her career ...
