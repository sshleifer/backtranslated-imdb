"Cobweb" is an example of many of the films that contain powerful, sometimes remarkable performances and high points but are unfortunately dramatically slowed and slowed down by a dark subject and very little interest in the audience. Richard Widmark played as a doctor working in a psychiatric institution whose life is getting worse due to family problems and a rather absurd and overworked conflict that does not seem to match at all. The plot is absurd. It is time for the institution to acquire new covers for the windows of the library. One old woman wants to have covered eyelids, but many patients want to make their own. And in some way, this ridiculous and inadvertently disruptive conflict collapses into a place where lives and families are endangered. It sounds more like a conflict that would arise among very young children. Striking logic of the plot and whether it can actually happen is so massive that it is wondering if it could become just a real fool to buy. Do not get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with acting. Widmark casting consists of other great actors, many of whom are Academy Award winners and winners. And occasionally there is a moment in a movie that works brilliantly, but always avoids a silly plot about window curtains. Unfortunately, too many dog ​​grabs are slowing down. A lot of shots are long and made from one camera point of view, keeping slow stimulation and lack of attention. <br /> <br /> In a short analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized film, and it's obvious why the audience is basically just as the plot gets into the focus, which makes it pretty fast. It does not seem to be really fun to watch and I tell you it's not very fun to watch.
