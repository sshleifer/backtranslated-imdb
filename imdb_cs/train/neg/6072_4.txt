DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love good sports movies {not to baseball so much, but hey, his sporting movies, right? I was expecting much more for this movie. It seems to be starting well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes (which I do not really like) is very good as a broken star. Barkin's role was fine. She's a good actress, but she seemed to have no place in this role. For me, it always seemed to be hurrying for the scenes, and then a little stretched out on the spot. It seemed I was so uneasy! Due to casting and plotting it could have been much better. I rated it "4" and I was generous. I'm hard with numbers!
