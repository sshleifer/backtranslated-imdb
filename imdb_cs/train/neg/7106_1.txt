I'm not a big fan of horror movies and I've seen just a few heroes (and no one from "Halloween" or "Friday thirteenth") - but I can appreciate the horrible horror film not about the gore. And I'm sure it's not scary. What is so scary about a small plastic skull that appears everywhere? All of his performances are remarkable, so there is no real surprise in any of these films. (Not that the skull itself is scary in the same way, but ....) The story is about the third cousin of Claus Von Bulow (John Hudson), who marries Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, who gives one of the worst performances at all) that begins to see the skull and hear the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's husband. Did I mention that her husband lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning? OOOOH !!!! Wonder who did it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To see a well-done version of these things, try "Reversing Happiness". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. MSTing was fine, but nothing special; paired with "Gumby" short, however, it does a good viewing. <br /> <br /> Two stars for The Screaming Skull; eight stars for the MST3K version. And now that Mr. Von Bulow himself paraphrases, "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
