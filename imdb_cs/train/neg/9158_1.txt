Oh my god. I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... the whole ... thing. . . Okay, it'll be okay ... I know I'll be fine for a month or two. Some time soon I hope to get rid of lightning backs. After the movie, I was supposed to eat something, but it just seems to me that I will not have the courage to try to go at that moment. Bad? Yes bad. Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, it seems wrong that the message gets to the right. Hmm ... There is no word that would describe how terrible ... it is not terrible ... Hmm disgusting spooky / done / filmed / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do, but throw it away. Maybe I can burn it, I do not want it to end up in the bottom of the architectural excavation for a thousand years. Worst movie ever since "Hey Happy"
