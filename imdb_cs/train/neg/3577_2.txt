This early Zadar dog followed the well-known Harold Robbins formula: ambitious main characters in decadence while seeking the way to the top of a randomly chosen but fascinating world, in this case the film industry. But even though it is so formal that it is completely predictable, it also directs it to be incredible. Zadora (calling her as inexperienced as an actress to be charitable) is never convinced as a screenwriter. It could be expected that the film about movies will have some insights into the industry and the creative process. But the script does not give her any of the features that make the writer an interesting film character: adherence, skill with words, the relationship of love and hatred with her own creative ability. Her figure is as empty as a donut. And that's just the taste of incompetence on the screen here. Cinematography is so dark that it's sometimes hard to see what's going on. And the scenes never rush together, so everything looks like a sequence of random moments on the wrong Hollywood sides. Avoid.
