I hate this program: not only is it such an absurd concept but it is trying to be that difficult (something that was obvious from a similar "admitting" ending programs like Muder: she wrote). <br /> <br /> Why is it that writers can not be smart enough in this program to come up with the evidence that would hold and win the decision in court? Come on: after the X-YEARS OF YEARS, why must ALL PROMOTE ANY EPISODE * CONFESS * (damn it!) To a murder that would otherwise be unresolved? I bet all the police want the criminals to be such good athletes: "Aw, shucks, officer, you are clear - I think if you have revealed enough to convince yourself that I have done it, I can admit it and lighten you that's just a fair cop. <br /> <br /> Absolute dog ** and insult to those of us with enough brain even heard about IQ
