This movie is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save it. A bad story, an even worse scenario, and just a bad direction makes this really great horror movie, the extraordinary part of it is that it's the only horror movie, frankly, I'd never look back. This garbage makes Plan 9 of outerspace look like oscar material.
