Many people here say that this show is for children only. Um, when I was a kid (about 7-9 years old), I watched this show first. It was disgusting for me. I talked to other kids about this and certainly other shows and knew what? This was a measure of camouflage, whenever we wanted to emphasize something stupid (whether on television or anything else), we said "Uh, like the Power Rangers," and they laughed. <br /> <br /> And before I visited this page, I could not imagine that they were actually MMPR fans. It was so strange to me that I decided to watch again and try to understand why they liked it. He did not like browsing. But it came to me: maybe I do not have enough imagination? It can be. However, this argument is not enough to throw it more than one star.
