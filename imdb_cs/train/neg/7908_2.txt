I did not expect much when I saw it on Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two more films were sold out. I still hoped. It sounded a bit like "Bride and Prejudice" (LA guy falls for Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice film with good laughs and nice characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" had nothing to do with it. The actress seemed to be crazy and has a way to numbers. The characters were so clich√© that the story looked as if it were written by a high school drama student. Technically, I was really worried about the sound. It seemed to be too duplicating the dialogue. I mean a lot. I know it's sometimes necessary, but it sounded like half of the movie was shot in the closet and it was very disturbing. The two stars are somewhat generous.
