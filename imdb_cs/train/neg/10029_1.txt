I did not know what the movie was like before I saw it, because Tashan had only the pendant tags while he was being promoted. So I asked my friends if they did not know about it and they said that "it's the directorial debut Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote the scripts for Dhoom 1 and 2, and the son of Safi Ali Khan Ibrahim makes his debut in the movie by the child in his remembering. "After watching it, I understood why it was not the right trailer because there was nothing in the movie that would turn out to be. The story was immortal, and even a ten-year-old child can come up with a better story. It was hardly an action, and the camera shuddered at every possible angle, and it's hard to see who killed who. Also the action was absolutely unrealistic, eg 1 man with a gun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> While watching Tashan, he reminded me of three films: Sin City: During Koylo's introductory credits: Anil Kapoor is terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyle. Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: Indignant funny jokes that are not funny. <br /> <br /> I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. Anyway, if you do not like Dhoom 2, there's absolutely no chance you'll like Tashan. The race was hot on the heel and it's a million times better. The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in good places in Greece, but what is its use in the waste film? Even the terrible English Anil Kapoor could not save this deficiency.
