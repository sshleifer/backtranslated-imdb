The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play, and so I went to the movies, on a cold, cold and wet day. <br /> <br /> "Cat in the Hat" was the name of the movie, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. Mike Myers played a cat, his humor was chaotic and the kids did not have to see it, humor was not tame. <br /> The film was like poultry milk, so it's fun to have fun, but the creators did not know it. This movie is just horrifying. The game was bad, the story was too refined, and the humor was surprisingly very rough. It starts with Conrad and Sally, the rule and the future sheriff. When their mother has to return to work, she will get Mrs. Kwan to babysit. Perhaps the lonely entertainment part of the film is when Mrs. Kwan watches the Taiwanese courtroom, la C-SPAN. He will soon be asleep and a cat will come here. The film starts to be out of control. The cat came to try to make the kids entertained. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, who suddenly break the house. He improvises TV Infomercial, and accidentally cuts his tail away. And when the cat is full of Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Maybe his only funny disguise is like a hippie activist. And there's a fish that tries to alert kids to cats. It's a pity he warned us that this movie is just as fun as sour milk, The early kids are out there looking for a family dog ​​that has the key on the box on the collar. If the crate is not locked up soon, their house will be home to the cat's universe. Here's a little more interesting, but it's not enough to save the movie. Overall, acting is terrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of incomprehensible humor Austin Powers to the Cat, saying things like "You dirty him," and imagined himself as a woman for the rest of his life after burglary in the testicles while he was imagining pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as a troubled Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is cute like Sally, though they are not enough to rescue this terrible aortal disorder waiting for John Ritter to be killed (an accident awaits to happen). Alec Baldwin is neat and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, sometimes trying to welcome the kids mom who plays Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, the mum boss, and is also the voice of the fish. The latter three are also insignificant. <br /> <br /> Overall, if I were a parent, it would not take my kids who are in night humor because there is plenty and more. Save $ 7.00 and see something different. As late Dr. Seuss said late, it's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore is already in the grave. <br /> <br /> Like my mom always says: "Curiosity killed a cat." - Cat in a hat * of *****
