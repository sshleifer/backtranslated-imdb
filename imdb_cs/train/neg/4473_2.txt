Dan is trying hard and is extreme with all his cries and crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. To many. Calm down, join and laugh. I did not understand his comparison with comics and rock stars. Just because there on stage or something? He said every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really in when he was alive. He had some good jokes, such as the Burger King joke, where people are screaming along the way. I also liked Reese's Pieces joke. If Dane did not act so mentally, it could be more fun and could give me a higher rating, maybe even eight.
