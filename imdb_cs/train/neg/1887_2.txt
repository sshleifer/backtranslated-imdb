Today, I have been arguing why so many people are complaining about modern movies, in which I have encountered a strange statement: "the evolution of the character in newer movies is not as good or as interesting as it used to be." Depending on the movie (s), it can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and conspiratorial Hollywood waste like War of the Worlds, but in the case of exaggerated, uninteresting attempts at social commentary and desperate struggle to " art "back to cinema, these are movies like the days of dogs that are to blame. I usually have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how dull or unnecessary they are (from good, long, such as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those I thought painful to sit on Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I shut down this movie for 45 minutes, which is about 30 minutes longer than I actually should have. I was not interested in any character, and I found nothing essential about the thin veil of shameless pessimism. In an effort to say something about the dots of society, this film is too easy to fall into self-esteem, trick and exploitation in a very honest sense. I promised I saw many worrying films about the same subject, but there are a lot of better movies about depressed and poor people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that really contain characters with great emotional depth and personality. Dog days did not have anything more than eight degrees of abuse, they chose to ignore the real intelligence of how people really were, and instead chose to be a boring, terrible and hopelessly non-original attempt at the art of art. This is not an unknown or a smart observation into the borehole of society, it is just boring and nothing that should not be interested.
