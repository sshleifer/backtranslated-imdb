In the movie that follows the fighting actors, apparently played a fighting actor, it is not good for Chris Klein. It strives to bring a role that is unforgettable for this role, and it passes through a shallow script that has shown what could only be described as the youngest leading man. The story exists, but that's all, and can not show any basic start, middle and end, and the spectator lets his shoulders shrug as if nothing has happened in the last hour and in three quarters. <br /> <br /> One bright light in the middle of it is Fred Durst, who can stand out above his seemingly medium-talented stars and does a half-length work that brings back the legendary nature of Legde to life. Whether Fred can re-create it while working with higher quality cast remains to be seen, but I will observe for him in the future.
