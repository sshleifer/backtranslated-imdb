The "Confidential" section was intended to build on the favorite love of the magazine of the same name, while the question of blackmail was tied to the main survey of Congress of the Day. However, despite the A-grade cast B-film and some good scripting ideas, the film fetches together about 73 minutes. It's a production with a cheap jack. What is needed to make the wrong values ​​of production is some fantasy, especially from the uninitiated director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight shots would, for example, help mitigate the effects of horrified studio sets. A stylish helmsman, like Anthony Mann, could have done something with a loud ear, but Salkow considers it just another paid day. The pity that the typical low key style of Brian Keith does not work here comes just as wooden and lethargic, and at the same time the culture of Elisha Kuchařka goes to the top like a drunken wild boar. It is clear that Salkow is not the director of acting. But you have to give it to that tiny little Beverly Garland who has her role treated with a distinctive dignity and dedication. It was a shame she was not in charge. My advice ... leave it out if you are not in the ridiculous bar-girls who will not do anything else, but they will trip the whiskey in a typical 50th fashion.
