I feel blessed that I own what is known as the worst film Steven Seagal ever was. I knew I was strange when Steven opened his mouth and someone else came out. In the middle of the film, my eyes began to hurt, and I almost fell out of the chair with uncontrollable laughter. Steven is Steven (with a constantly changing voice) and absolutely incredible in his role (as always). Who the hell lets people with bad spider spiders into the Force? It is also always written into absolutely incredible love affairs with women who are at least 20 years younger. Supporting actors look as if they were shot in the dark - btw, filming a movie in the dark with a light pouch? <br /> <br /> This is really hideous in every possible way. Invite all your friends and make them a social event - this is really exceptional.
