That reminded me of Michael Winner's dirty "dirty weekend" with his terrible English low budget. <br /> <br /> First I must say that I am a fan of both exploitation and a serious film. I appreciate, let's say, "Demented" for being a mindlessness and "The Last House on the Left" because it is a total unfortunate brutality. And every number of inventive and still brutal Italian spin-offs. <br /> <br /> This was unnecessary. Something similar to the British Budget Director thought, "Let's get ready to evaporate to my grave," without being too horrible when the horror returns to fashion with the Hostele. The whole thing simply does not see or have a point. What's with the rapist's daughter? Why bothering you have an expert on security cameras? Lousy.
