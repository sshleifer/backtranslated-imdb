This movie was fun sometimes, sometimes it was even funny. The basic message I got from the film was that women are responsible for all human problems. Each time a woman is portrayed in the movie is lazy, irritated or furious with some poor man for no apparent reason. I do not think that what the message is about is good for women or homosexuals. But it's comedy and artwork, so it's simply someone's opinion. Even if I do not agree, they are entitled to it. <br /> <br /> Fun film, but some of the other comments are just stupid. The best movie I've ever made.
