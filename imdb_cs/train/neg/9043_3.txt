I went with my wife and old son at the age of 3. It seemed to me much more than my wife and I. The script is surprisingly bad for a Pixar / Disney trip. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The film looks amazing, but the story becomes so strange and long-lasting that I was hoping my son was sleeping so I could take him and come out. Do not say that the film is not "It's not an interesting concept, it's so strange when we meet the family for the first time. I know we should have the impression that the family is embarrassed, but good sir, they could shorten this sequence by a good 15 minutes seemingly, in fact I did not.) At that moment I scratched my head and looked for the exit.
