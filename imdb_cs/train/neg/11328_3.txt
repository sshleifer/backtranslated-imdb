Every moment I lend action / adventure film as a way to relax and occupy my mind without any important one. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a good movie, but it makes me laugh and lets me relax for a while. One of these days I will probably buy a copy of Princess Bride and several Monty Python films for the same reason. In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to have fun without being attacked. For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot was something similar to the badly written Xena's episode, and Kathy Long's acting was a very community theater (it's not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress). There were several high points on the cyborg side. Somehow they managed to get lots of good actors to play bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die pretty fast. Like most martial arts films, the more you get into the movie, the more emphasis you have on the action, and the fence (which was not strong to start) is getting worse almost as fast as it does. However, the more Kathy Long is fighting, the more time the director spends her ass. By the end of the movie, I seriously considered watching him for the second time counting how many red shorts Kathy Long was the center of. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was not enough meat for the film to give satisfactory curiosity to see the movie a second time. If you are a hard-core Xena fan who needs something to blow away for a couple of hours - just go to the grocery store and spend £ 0.50 on rent. There are strong similarities between the show and this film. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect anything more than just having fun for a few hours. <br /> <br /> If you are not, you like Kathy Long's derrière. Then you can buy a copy.
