This documentary is a reconstruction of the past few years of Betty Page's career (Paige Richards). The Tennessee fucking was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950s and was fetish photography, slavery and fighting cats with "girl movements." Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) in his movie star News instructed Betty what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity on famous photos or "deer films", but Klaw was accused of distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. It is no surprise that Betty was at the top of her career in culture. The girl - beside the jet black-haired door, her blue eyes, and the hour-glass figure dressed in a fetish device or not, she would be fascinated for decades. After all, it was said that more than Marilyn Monroe was photographed and the only one on Elvis Presley's most photographed picture in the world. Betty Page has disappeared and devoted her to the last years of religion. This movie could have been much better; but she's good enough to be interested. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is huge in itself. Bra, panties, garter belt and hoses do not harm her image. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be aware that this movie may change the heart rate.
