Spoilers in this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is eventually raped and shot. And not too soon. I'd shoot the screen myself, but I was afraid I hit James Mason. The original 1943 novel "Life and Death of Wicked Lady Skelton" (I mean, screaming about spoilers at that time) was written by a female English dwarf who was either exhausted or cynical, or both. Her heroine is devastating beauty and she seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things are important, such as the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and only reaction when someone comes in is a murder. He murders three men in five attempts. Serial femme fatale, she has a case of a disocial personality disorder that should land her either in Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays it as a narcissistic vamp, wearing so many makeups I thought it was like a recovering Joan Rivers era (or a revival of Joan Rivers, ha!). However, Lady B. is irresistible to all three of the main male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, all have a good job, like Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers will briefly understand what a psychopathic female Barbara is, but the conspiracy keeps them in its orbit until one of them finally makes a gun down - by accident, in what is supposed to be irony or just dessert. Due to the dramatic death of the whistle that lifted the camera through the windows and the sky, I suppose we had to punch her. But hers is the first corpse we do not care about.
