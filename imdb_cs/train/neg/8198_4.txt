Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: It's me or any movie that starts in Roswell in New Mexico sucking. Take a stranger mixed with Thing, mixed with Contac, mixed with all the things on the beach, the Andromeda trunk, the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Stargate Star throw you can start. <br /> <br /> The derivative does not even begin to describe this movie. Of course, with no original conspiracy wisely reinforce the gore and sex law? Nope gore is a blink and you miss the affair and sex is just an irritation. (James Spader has causally mentioned that he needs a shower and kindly Leslie Stefanson asks to join him, and he is turning her AGGH!) In fact, if the movie ever needed a shower scene, it's up to it. I mean, if you have unbelievably beautiful women in white bathing suits, they are wandering around Antarctica's research base, why not go to break. About 30 seconds of real excitement in Alien Hunter is remarkably serious and slow for sci-fi adventures. He needed a much better plot to get back on, and that the alien himself is a terribly clich√©d scream and has virtually no time on the screen for someone who shares half the title. <br /> <br /> I also questioned what is in the cosmic child in the cosmic motif. (Note that from Jason on Friday, the 13th Glory Pinhead of Hellraiser and the Leprechaun all traveled to the universe to kill bloody teenagers, why not the cornfields?) Corn Field Corn Fields like Logan's Run Extra and I Waited to revive the stalks and attack. <br /> <br /> This would be exciting and seemingly against this film deal. Acting is mostly fine because Spader repeats its role as a stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in beachwear in Antarctica. John Lynch, however, read the entire script and acts like a crazy bad man before the story suggests. Alien Hunter is a disappointment of derivative slog, which makes me a pine for the right children of corn space movie.
