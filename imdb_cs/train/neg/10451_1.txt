I'm sick and tired of all the little addictions that happen about how this movie "rocked". It's a Clean CG Excess CRAP! Do not send the killer, it's far more reasonable to transfer hundreds of brightly colored, aggressive, poisonous snakes to the plane! The only reason why they like this movie because they feel they have to. It's not "so bad that it's good" It's so bad I'd rather go in the eye with a sharp wand, and then I'll take it again. I honestly thought it would be a comedy like an airplane! A spoof! I was wrong. It's all "It's upset, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson shouts "Snakes on the Planet!" Well, I'm sorry I do not understand It looks like a lot of witches gave the movie industry more money to make other movies like Triple X and Die Hard. If you spent money watching a movie in the company of the same people who bought the CD Williamha Hunga, you still live in their maternity basement and smoke the plastic chair from the days on your computer playing online games and watching porn, then let them get in and talk (whether I doubt you have a girlfriend) ticket for snakes on a silly planet . To Hell, movies like a full metal jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 monkeys, officials, etc., irrespective of the irony in watching good movies The True Decline of Western Civilization The cult of this cult movie is an insult to real classical cults like Repo man or even Orgazmo .
