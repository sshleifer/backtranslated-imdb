When he remembers childhood memory, it was a terrifying film; it's a touch and go whether you should visit it again. Anyway, I remembered the horrible scene that involved the homeless and cold villain played by Jeff Kober. "First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It's full of pillows and a very bad script with holes that could ride a truck (along with countless comfortable "twists" to help the story go on). Lou Diamond Phillips is too convincing a dirty policeman who sends Baddie's serial killer Kober to the gas chamber to find himself a satan and now has the power of resurrection along with the power to own all the weak-minded people he encounters. Through the mix very badly realized that the psychic who helps with the case. <br /> <br /> Oh, that's waste. But pleasant as such, especially if you have beautiful memories of it. It scared me like a baby, and that homeless scene is still pretty good. Regarding any logic; forget it, almost every scenario is worthy of good measure, and you end up with the cross between the Steven Segal action and the 70 demoniac film. And who on earth thought it was a good idea for Lou Diamond Phillips to play here? Needless to say, he is not convincing at all, but he is trying the best, and I have never had a problem with the guy who seems to have so many reviewers here. As for Tracy Griffith as a psychic, the less he said, the better. But Kober is pretty good as a murderer; he always liked the actor. <br /> <br /> The first strength may be exactly what the doctor will take after a busy day, and brain shut-off is needed. Beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and I will certainly have a lot of other opportunities. Everything in all; not a good shock, but somewhat a guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily afraid as children. "See you, boy!"
