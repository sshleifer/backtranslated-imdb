This movie was on the second day, and I did not even notice it. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel ... terribly terrible. The new actress and actress, who was to play the lead role, was not at all good, the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot her name), so this movie gets 0 out of 10 ratings, not a movie you can sit and watch and enjoy it, it's a movie that you're going to take to another channel or take it back to the store if you hired it or bought it. It was good to see the Ape Monkey back, but it was not as fun as the first, the new George would have had Georges son grown up, and still had Bredon and (what is her face) in the movie, it would have been "a bit better than it was.
