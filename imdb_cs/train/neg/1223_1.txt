What a weekend. Two days ago, I watched the first half of War Games 2: Dead Code, now "While It Was Out". I'm trying to make a decision that was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching. I think "when she was outside," it was even worse. Everything else has been said in other commentaries: Unrealistic, illogical, etc. - the only thing I really have to say is that at some point I began to feel more for the bad men than for the woman because I would recommend her Darwin's prize if she really died (just watching the first half, so I do not know). Soon I was at two Darwin's prizes (if possible) for her immense stupidity. And hey: Did Kim Basinger do it? So she just did not know the script, but she was also responsible for bringing us a waste of money, people? I consider people who lose a lot of money for bad money because they could feed and dress relatively few people instead of hurting 80% of those who saw it in the cinema and gave 20 percent, idiots, a good opportunity to show how much idiot they are.
