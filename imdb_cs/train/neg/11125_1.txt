Hey, look at it, it's a much better rendering of the incarnation of black America than this. Though I think this story is weak, criticism focuses on the poor realization of the story I have mentioned, strikes. It happened in the mid-1980s and is horrible in music / score departments. It's funny to see Oprah as a second-day day. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger gets into the Elizabeth McGovern incinerator. Clean classic cinema. First, I do not like how drunk you are to react to a flame of 1200 grams (no matter how bad you are doing). But they really got the scene ... it was funny. I'll tell you what if I had the great pleasure of seeing Elizabeth McGovern burn with faux death; she is poisoning me.
