I bought this movie for 1 euro, did not know what it was all about. I thought "hmmm, a movie called a crippling man must be, though not very funny, at least filled with gore." It was not okay. It was disturbing. Very worrying. And I do not mind disturbing movies, but it just does not mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was terrible. The acting actor ... was no actor. Just some fig-up fcker with mutiling more than 90 minutes. This is probably important for the sick to turn to an extreme gore. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it. It is not worth your time. It's scary. I wish I could never get it. <br /> <br /> It should freeze the man who did it
