This is quite ridiculous, I hope that many people are exposed to Muslims living all over the world, in the U.K. and around the world. Religion has over a billion followers. I was born and bread in America, and through my religious classes and teachings I learned how to maintain my country and work to contribute to society. I am very devoted to the consequences and the teachings of my religion have been emphasized in my life in order to educate and prepare for success through education so that I can contribute back to the world. I knew many Muslims from all sides and I traveled to countries like Pakistan. I still have to meet one person who believes we should hurt or accept other religions except the media ... I wonder why ... It is also sad that these extremists are media that represent the whole religion. Its religion of one billion people, and it's less than one percent, I'm sure other people of other religions would not want to be represented by the KKK, the IRA, and many others, a simple percentage of extremists who use obsolete and not literal passages from respected books to perform their own revenge, personal or business affairs through a so-called religion
