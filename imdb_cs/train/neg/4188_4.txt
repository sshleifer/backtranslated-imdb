I am a great mark for Neil Young's music, and with the jealous praise the film has gained in many other Indian press circles, he encountered the first Greendale show I found. My excitement was short-lived, because this story and the weak lyrical moment left most filmmakers, either sleeping or disappointed. Neil says the movie started out as a soundtrack, and the characters lived so much that it just made a soundtrack. The best way to create a story. No character has a real arc, and when "significant" events occur, the viewer does not care about it, because the levels of harassment in film technology are so high at this point. The film is all the song, and for that purpose the characters at the end write the lyrics as they are sung ... the technique works for the first stance that is going on, and after that the nerves go off. Does not feel real or fake, just feels unwelcome. <br /> <br /> Wonderful acting, with characters who find a single mood and play it all. Poor illumination occasionally. The only kudos I can put on a movie are related to several scenes broadcast as news, but the technique is used in the cinema today in such a small film. Good soundtrack, but nothing I quickly bought. Bad film.
