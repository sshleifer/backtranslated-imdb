When a person who does not have Alzheimer's disease can not remember how many movies he has done, he is probably the most powerful director of the world. The man is Jesus Franco, King of the so-called "Eurotrash". His 1980s, Devil Hunter, are equally agile, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the true sense of the word (movie title is misleading) like any other Franco movie I've seen. It sounds pretty horrible and it is ... Still, Franco has some inimitable sensitivity, a generous journey with bald horror, with nudity and dirt and violence, and even with his stupid inexpensive adjustment that is trying to climb the extreme rush with which all were made his films. The blend of all these elements makes you ride your movies out, even if you've been waiting for them to end up because they're so boring. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is almost incomprehensible for the first half hour. The kidnapping of white women, who appears to be a model or a movie star, is associated with a number of indigenous events in South America. There are plenty of naked rings, dances, and endless repetitive zooms on an ugly totem. You have to get used to repeated magnification and cutting technique back to the same shot about three times in a row, because these are the main ways to extend the film to length. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The monster, which looks like a totem pole, is actually a little scary. He has raw bad eyes and his presence is always signaled on a soundtrack using a cacophonic moan, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. He soon chews on a native who is attached to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens, but I think he eats her stomach (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!). , the adventure starts right when a cold guy and his frightened veteran from Vietnam are sent to the island to get a white girl from the kidnappers. The guy has an accent that, as he dubbed, is half Brooklyn-American, half-English-Liverpudlian and all retarded. All dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and ridiculous and makes another layer of film that can somehow take your interest. <br /> <br /> There is not much going on from this place and it's quite slow, with a strange bit of outrage like rape. The fog is milled (haha!) About the acres of 360 Â° nudity from natives and two female wires and even from the monster itself. He walks with the penis he has exposed, struggling with the unexpected prospect for a tough hero, but it has to be done at some point, and it is nice to note that the director will show someone's genitals to the camera. /> The best feature of Devil Hunter is the location of the movie. Franco can be extremely inexpensive due to the structural and storable aspects of the film, but it does not accumulate sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in a wide format. This is something that is really great today when you meet CGI sets and backdrops and ad nauseam. <br /> <br /> Finally, it seems that if you are trying to see all Nasties videos you will have to watch at some point and you will be as uncomfortable as me. If you like Franco, you will follow it all the same. If you fall into any of the above categories, the likelihood that this movie will never be attacked. Copies are not just lying, and I would hardly recommend him to look. It's Franco. Lazy, crazy Franco.
