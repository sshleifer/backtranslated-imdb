OK, I've been a huge fan of Black for a long time, and after watching this movie, DISGUSTED. Let's name the problems ... At first this film has a lot of the same crew as the first two. It was also called PREQUEL to the original black stallion. Why is it that they can not get the name of Shetland Dam right or her color? In The Black Returns we learn that Sagr was a black mother CHESTNUT and in this movie is a gray name Jenny name!!?!?!?! ?? WTF? And that was in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could have been wrong, but the first was set in 1940, when the ship failed. The timeline does not sound right. Also, like a goof, at the beginning of the movie is Frisian to be Shetano's father ... after another warning, it seems to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character left to even make this film seemingly related to the previous two in no way. It could be a cute family film for some, but it's my biggest film disappointment of the year.
