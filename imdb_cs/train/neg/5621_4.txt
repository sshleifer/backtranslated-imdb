I am an irreparable skeptic and agnostic and I expect to enjoy this movie. After what I noticed, I am sincerely convinced that I could have done a better document myself. It seems that his arguments have only four fake sources (despite being listed in IMDb data, I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), it's along with brutal editing of the laughter of amateur computer effects and he does not at all appear impartial at all. The narrative is permeated by the ubiquitous, almost adolescent anti-Christian mood that destroys every possibility that the film can really change one's mind, unlike preaching the chorus (ie I). Although there is some interesting discussion about the historicity of Jesus, the film will hit an unbearable bang when he begins to experience the Christian school that the director has visited as a child, an institution that apparently betrayed him ill-psychologically as he is sitting on that day. <br /> <br /> Though TGWWT apparently had a low budget, there was an opportunity to make a clever comment on the highly debatable roots of Christianity. There is certainly a lack of skeptical thinking on the market, and this film could help fill the void. Instead, the director chose to offend our intelligence with this waste, which ultimately seems to be a therapeutic exercise for him. It is bad that his Christian education traumatized him, but he did not have to subdue the audience to his equalizing mechanism.
