I went to this film because he thought it would be more officials, but the feeling that he left it. The humor was weak and the figures fairly flat. That does not mean that it was all bad, the idea of ​​dating service in the grocery store looked like a fairly fertile material, but the director turned his attention to the cliché of "saving mom and pop business from the evil guy corporation." I had the feeling that if he had just gotten into the history of dating service, he would have come up with a much more memorable film. Now that I manage movie justice, I'm from Rochester and I loved the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best actor Kevin Smith (clerks) here put props in his hometown. Webster, NY is Checkout, what Red Bank, NJ is for clerks. The director wisely threw a meeting with Nick Taha. Believe me, when it comes to things in Rochester, it's top in the list. I was lucky to see this movie at Little in Rochester, so everyone knew when they came to the city and appreciated them.
