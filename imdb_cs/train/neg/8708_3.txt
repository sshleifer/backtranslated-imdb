Like all Carnosaur movies, it's a joke. The way a dinosaur moves reminds me how my sister plays with virgins because they can not be any harder or fake than they are. The conspiracy made no sense. First they are in the bus, then in the warehouse they are on the ship at the same time. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a few dinosaurs can stay together on the van or on the ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. It sounds silly, even if you think about it. The only reason I gave it 3 is that it's still fun. I found it better than the first (they have not yet seen). Just do not borrow it. I saw it on TV and it's a good thing I did because I would not want to borrow money.
