I was not a fan of the 2005 "Hostel" hit, and most of them are so bad or worse - yet "Live Feed" managed to keep me a little fun for the first 30 minutes. It began with a lot of sex and dirty settings, followed by some good death scenes including Chinese organized crime jumping and 7-foot, cut leather ... What made me out of the movie was a hard hero with weapons and a rescue saving day ... I would like to call this film average, at best, because the premise that concerned mainly the unpleasant young people who have been defeated in the broken porn of the theater and doubled as a shelter for the mafia I like. If torture was prolonged enough to be fully effective, then my evaluation would be very different. Unfortunately, most fury is gathered together in one scene, so the rest of the movie ends up as a type of revenge scenario. So, basically, it's just a low-cost "Hostel" that deviates from the redeemed use of gratuitous sex, almost constant during the first half of the movie ... Overall, I would say not worry about it.
