Penn took the time to develop his characters, and we do not matter much about them. But there are some real issues with the story, we do not see any real motivation for the bad brother's behavior, and the timeline is bad. Probably set in 1963, music is late 60s and early 70s. Links and dialogue are 70s / 80s. The potential for a strong climax is left, and Penn lets him disappear. But even with all these difficulties, it is worth noting, but not great.
