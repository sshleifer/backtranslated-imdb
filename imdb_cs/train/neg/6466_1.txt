Marlon Brando has long since lost interest in acting when he made the film. His performance as "Swede" is the worst of his career, and that's exactly what he intended to be. It does not go beyond. Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre way and enjoys his embarrassing enormous circumference. The scene in which Brando rises over the toilet is probably the worst and funniest moment in the history of cinema. As we witness his head fall - first into the toilet, it's hard to believe that we were watching the same actor who played in A Streetcar Named Desire, Na nábřeží and Godfather. the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years. Was he a bad movie? Does it look as if he completely and completely disappeared? I think we never know. But this movie serves as a fascinating study of what is bad acting. On this note, you are looking at the co-soldier of veteran Donald Sutherland as he tries to get his lines, embarrassed to himself, that he has agreed to participate in this travesty.
