As a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can endure any movie that may be running on me, but there is absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> Named "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section and a dreaded "limited look at the sticker" I suppose these are the only methods that Robert Zapton could use to get the movie maker (HA!) to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Damn to you, Robert Napton! Beware of the misuse of these poor Mexican actors that you have probably promised you have been making great success in the American cinema. You're shame! <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this movie that would have the slightest effect. Did you use probes for these people? Oh, look, they have raves in the field! Like all 6 of them. And is not that Asian guy in the background? Why is it always in the day? Why did it take 1/2 of the film to show up ... and, more importantly, why did we watch another 1/2? PS: You owe me 4.50.
