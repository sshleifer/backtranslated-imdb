"Kids like these" could be a decent film about the subject. Instead, it has become a subprime television filter for a week that has not been done, and much has not happened. The game is obsolete, the plot is predictable and the direction does not exist. For a better film on the same topic, try the excellent film "Le Huiti√®me Jour", which really depends on people with Down Syndrome. In "Kids like these" they are used only as a justification for sentimentality. Pretty scary. 1/10
