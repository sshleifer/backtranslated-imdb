First, I want to say that this film is worth more than the four stars I've rated. I gave him four stars, because for me this 86-minute film always looks like two and a half hours and is not good enough to sit down. However, the "Great Alligator River" (the name that I call my DVD) is better than your average character will hit back the movie. The Southeast Asian Jungle Tourist Center is opening and operating natives while trying to manipulate wildlife. Mother Nature looking for revenge comes in the form of the god Kroon, the giant Alligator. But creature is not the only thing that tourists and main characters (photographer and resort staff) have to worry about, the natives get in the wrong direction. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very well done adventure / horror story with good musical score and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is obviously false. Some jaws are good, but that should be all we need to see. Some underwater distant shots make it painfully obvious that what we really deal with is an alligator whistle that you can probably get in a souvenir shop in the zoo. But the natives are credible, if not true. Probably not a movie that will give you uninterrupted excitement, if any, but shot and produced so well that they are well mentioned. And like a lot of movies about shapes, it ends with an extremely high number of people. It also has a lot of good scenery in the jungle. Acting is under par, but who expected to be better, eh? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than his recent American counterpart, "Primeival", but nothing that would be compared to "bonuses". But do not forget that it does not have to be at several points.
