Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a piece of unsolicited clich√©. Comedy in secondary schools in a military training camp. I'm sorry I had to give 1 star I did not deserve. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> HEPO (Military Police) will not come to you if you do not see it, especially on your wedding day. The actors were embarrassed in this scene because the scene did not work because it was very unlikely. You can feel it in your voice. Even if they were not so bad actors, they would not be able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> Then you have to practice in a wedding suit. No, it was not time for him to get his uniform first. Man, that's great cinematography! I remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are girls in the camp - exciting - one of them even a model, even if it does not look great - and the worst actress I've ever seen. I doubt in Hollywood that she will allow her to say one line in movie B. <br /> <br /> Good girls in the army! Now it's starting to have fun. The girls are even placed on the same floor so we can get in their room at night! In fact, they would be located in another building that is about a quarter of a mile away and is separated by two barbed wire fences. <br /> <br /> There are tanks that we can use for a fun ride in our free time that we have a lot of. No, the tanks are not locked and the ignition key is inserted. No one notices the sounds of the engine, especially at night. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of sex scenes and links and all are below the waste line. We need the sexually obsessed Germans to like the movie as well. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Well done! <br /> <br /> One sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Of course, none of these devices are ever blocked. Military routines are just as reckless as they can get. <br /> <br /> At the end of a snappy shoot, mafia strikes men are about to avenge the poor trying to shoot him! Because he left his fiancee! Surely I buy it, so it's the Italians - a jealous bunch (no). <br /> <br /> Thieves try to do it in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in the dark aisle. Again, military training (where it is shooting with live ammunition) is open to the public, everyone can walk freely or go there. There are no things like guards or fences. <br /> <br /> However, the action prevents the good captain, who runs the racquet to the Italian car in time. Explosions hit the legs and an angry fiance. No one at the distance of 40 feet is injured when the car is blown off to smethereens. It's COMEDY, do not forget. It's a comedy, I got it and I can live with it. No realism is needed. Film makers can easily get it if it's funny, side division fun or fun, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately, that's nothing of it. It's just embarrassing. Rip-off from helpless American comedies. This is at least professional, without amateur actors. It's pretty boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially those who sit the whole movie, as I unfortunately did. Yawn.
