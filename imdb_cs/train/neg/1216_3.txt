The genre of suspense movies really sink in this. A major problem is unjustified. I realize that you have to create difficult situations that would cause tension and a tense feeling of what's going to happen, but this movie was so predictable and simply not credible. I find that the more I look at this film, the more I keep telling things to keep them out of danger. Constantly making bad decisions just bordering on being simply stupid. If they had time to make it realistic, maybe I enjoyed it a little. When you said that, you might want to get out of this.
