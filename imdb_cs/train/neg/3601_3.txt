Was it a precursor when Tori complained that her first friend treated her like a robot, and then her new friend (killer) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence? I think yes. Scenes that await you with pleasure: it's a big band, a kimono band (how do you say when you put your clothes seductively instead of taking them?) And the high-pitched battles on skis! Be sure to tune in for the beginning and the end, but during the second session you can catch a sandwich when the whole story is going on. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori ever do in paradise, or even in the snow? No way.
