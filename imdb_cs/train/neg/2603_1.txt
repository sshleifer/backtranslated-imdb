I'm interested in this subject and only fans dancing Drew Barrymore on David Letterman's writing machine will find something interesting about it. OK, she shows some breasts (or possibly a double body). The story is cut off and the acting is terrible. Lead has no material with which he works, because the direction of the film is nowhere. Do not waste time. Check out Donnie Darko if you want the dreadful movie Drew Barrymore, and if you want to see another, skip it and see Darko again. Treatment of the legend of Doppelganger is absolutely criminal. See the Charles Williams novel "Decent into Hell" for something worth taking the place. It's just an excuse for film B to go straight to the video and suck up some life from Blockbuster people. What does any of these people do that the acting is praiseworthy? Give me a break.
