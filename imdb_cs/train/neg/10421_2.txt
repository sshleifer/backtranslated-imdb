I saw this movie as a very young girl (now I'm 27) and it's been horrified for years. I had nightmares on all aspects of this film as it was attracted to music to (of course) violence. My parents are still arguing about who allowed me to watch and both of them say they never let me watch such a movie. I think they only say that they know I have such strong feelings about them, 0) I am currently reading a book (from morbid curiosity and the fact that it is a classic) and it is really a great story. However, I do not think it should become a cartoon. At all. Well, maybe kids today will find it quaint, but it has given me nightmares for weeks and weeks, and I still find it difficult to see rabbits drawn in a similar way. He always gives me a little heart. I'm crazy, but I strongly suggest that every parent who wanted to show this film to his children reads them instead, or first, to make sure he agrees with the content. Not everyone thinks it as disturbing as I am, but we're out there, 0)
