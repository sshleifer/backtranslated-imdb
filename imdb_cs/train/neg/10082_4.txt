I laughed with this whole rotten film. It's so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a disorder in front of a real estate agency. What happened? The head of the office will come out and offer her work! Hilarious! The other thing you know is the two women who are about to. Yeah, these are lesbians! In this movie, "Life with a Woman with Nothing Better" does not mean anything. Inappropriate dialogue like "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling as if I had a chance to be happy and did not take it". There is a rich, distant mother who does not agree with her daughter's new relationship. Scary Black Virgo - Incredible that in 2003 there is a film in which there is a black girl. Hattie McDaniel must turn in the grave. A woman has her husband who has frightened and wants to care for a lot of teenage children. Sheesh! No clich√© is left.
