I love Memoirs of Geisha, so I read the book twice; this is one of the best books I read last year. I was looking forward to the film and was afraid that reading the book would destroy the fun of the film. I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Some of the best parts of the book were omitted from the film and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) being the worst. If I did not read the book, it would be a little confusing and inexplicable. The outline of the film's plot states that "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she crossed her fishing ..." Has anyone seen how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
