A nice attempt and a good idea (redemption of a prostitute, human beings help each other, ...) but a bad result ... The director apparently tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by creating an atmosphere, Vietnam ... The only problem is that this Vietnam is long gone, and when the "Green Para Smell" had a historical background ... trying to project this kind of atmosphere (muted sounds and slow pace of life ...) in modern days leaves a feeling of fake. In addition, it quickly creates a sentiment of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. I can only assume that the event takes place in Saigon or Da Nang, because that's where Harvey Keitel, a former sailor in the movie, was probably stationed during the war ... But in southern Vietnam, nobody or very few people talk with the northern clip accented depicted actors ... Really weird even for the poor Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet with leprosy ... very dubious (not a disease for people of their condition), a peasant girl who can read and write complicated Vietnamese poetry ... even more dubious ... <br / > <br />
