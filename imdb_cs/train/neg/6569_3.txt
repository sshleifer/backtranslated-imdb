Max had the V-8, Trace has a jet engine on the back of his car that allows him unintentionally funny faces when he's rocking around the sixteenth wilderness. To be surprised when Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) splits and joins together as a new film, though filmed in a sloppy way with bad actors and dirty stunts. Why is WoF set up in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? A simple, powerful fighter was! In fact, all questions can be answered: it was in Road Warrior! With the exception of extraterrestrial mutants from the original The Time Machine of the 1960s that make portraits look like they give the audience some inexperienced experience of chewing for a few minutes. 80 modes, all cars driven by bad guys that are straightened or slightly overturned, explode in a huge waves of explosion. Inevitably, all car chases will be near the right bank of cliffs and cars will inevitably fall from them. Along with this 80-year-old cinematic wild ride, it's generally shocking misogyny in this cheap movie style. Generally, I waited for Trace's rocket vehicle to speed up and shoot the flames, so it would be another shot that would scratch his face, as if it were heavy, which turns off more when it looks like constipation. Badly choreographed action associated with bad gambling makes this film a real sail. Unintentional humor even manages to wear a thin layer. Rats: Teru Bruno Mattei's night is better. And that's what it says a lot! This number, the 2020 Texas Gladiators, is a cinematographic work compared to a circle of fire. Poor Road Warrior Bounce that does not have enough cheese factor to make the movie traceable. <br /> <br />
