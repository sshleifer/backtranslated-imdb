Carlo Verdone has once united a great comedy with clever and subtle social analyzes and criticism. Then something happened, and he turned into another boring "holier-than-thou" director. <br /> <Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be more or less summarized in one line: "the working class = kind and warm, while the upper class = snob and perverse, but love ultimately wins." <br /> <br /> Take the clich√© for such a clever director. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the movie about what to talk about. Each character is walking a stereotype: a self-made man who forgets his roots but who will again be a "good" scornful woman, a rebellious rich girl who falls for an honest but poor guy ... barely average. <br /> <br /> It is very disappointing in every respect.
