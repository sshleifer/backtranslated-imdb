Sometimes you have to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones. Well, that's my opinion. This one will always be in the category of bad movies, simply because the performance of Shu Qi was terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel talks about Cat (Shu Qi), professional thief, Lam (Julian Cheung), two years ago. But her past returns to persecute her, because Chi Lam is kidnapped for ransom for security software belonging to Cat. To save him, she called her old friends from her orphan days, another six other women to save the day ... Maybe I sent a synopsis, but it's a good story. In fact, the whole script and direction lacks any quality at all. Much of the dialogue was insignificant and associated with land that was thin in the water like rice paper. If I could sum up, take a bad Jackie Chan movie, remove comedy, remove choreography, destroy your budget and you have Martial Angels: a formal work without imagination at all. <br /> <br /> Be aware that I have to give credit where the loan is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person who did not recover from this terrible event because it was her performance that sparked. Well, you can not say she's excellent - after all, she had absolutely nothing to do with it - but she managed to dig a character out of her role. Besides, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made some other impression - although they were mostly flashes and very short. Elsewhere, the movie just fell apart. Scenes and dialogs were totally unnatural and unbelievable; special effects were, of course, made cheaply without trying to clean the edges between the faces and the blue screen mask, a bad editing involving numerous mismatches in combat scenes, camera angles that were elementary and clumsy, which I saw better than a lost dog. I think this movie was too many chefs. Most likely, the budget blew over the enthusiasm of having seven bucks on the same silver screen. He left nothing else. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the way this movie was made was like a cheap porn movie without porn. Charlie's angels, it's not. In fact, while nurses can do it for themselves, none of that was really so obvious. <br /> <br /> You will definitely forget.
