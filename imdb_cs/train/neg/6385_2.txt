Gayniggers from space are to a large extent summed up by their name. Running only 27 minutes, describes a space-gay gay man who arrives on Earth and frees men from women. While I see little significance for the plot, it is also illogical. Since it was a comedy / spoof about society and science fiction. I found laughter a few times, so I can get there. Special effects are terrible. When a spaceship floats over the Earth, you can see the stars magnified for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning look fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several mistakes in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are dirty; in general, the whole issue is not serious. If you get through all the aspects that make a bad movie, its very accessible and easy to see to the end. Some parts are merry. Overall, the only thing you've remembered is that it was one of the most fun concepts ever. When I see it as a short film and has some funny aspects, it's not the worst thing you see. But it is illogical and has little long-term value. I can not really recommend; if you watch it, do it for a unique concept, not for quality.
