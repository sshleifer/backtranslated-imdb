I understand the jokes quite well, they are simply not good. The show is terrible. I understand that, and that's another terrible thing. The only great character EVER ever came up with was that one episode was a hobo, but then I see another episode including the episode and the show is terrible. It's not funny, no fun! I do not want people to say, "just smart people get it," because if they are so intelligent, why do people judge that they do not even know and do not say they are not smart or intellectual to understand? It's like saying, "Heaven is red," but he never looks outdoors. But in any case it is absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean by understanding them, they're terrible, her controversy is very chrome, her jokes and other jokes about body fluids are really stupid and usually consist of a really bad deal. I'm not sure what these "intelligent" people see in this show, but judging others if they do not even know about any of us, it's not a very clever commentary.
