If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I'd like to know where the money will go. Monkeys could have better CGI effects than what was unnecessary for three hours on this terrible piece of garbage, although I must admit that machines and martians would really look great on the original play-station 1 game and early computer games since mid 90 years if the game was ever created. What amazes me is where the money goes? Pendragon movies could make a great movie with good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled cameras and George Lucas in 1975-83, and actors who really look to take care of what they are doing (or destroy in this case) about the same 20 million. This is perhaps the worst movie EVER! I'd rather sit over Ishtar's repeated 24-hour screening than to watch the film again. I hate it completely! I repeat. I say this is the worst movie EVER because, unlike other bad films such as Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus martial to Martian, they are movies that are so bad that you have a special place in your heart, you love Yippee. There is no love for this movie and no place in my DVD library for it. I sold it for a dollar guy. I bet the money that the film was spent on booze and other habits for cast and crew. Tell your pendragon movies! I want my money back!
