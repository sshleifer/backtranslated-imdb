I think he's one of Kenneth Branagh's youngest shakespearean girls. After such great efforts as Power is about nothing, etc. I thought it was bad. Cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest problem was that they took over the work of Bard and cut out a part of the game to put in the music / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> Just do not do Shakespeare and then play. We're sorry, but that's just bad. I love some Cole Porter as well as another person, but I think you do not have to mess with Shakespeare. Skip it and see "Prosper's Books" if you want to see the brilliant Shakespeare adaptation Tempest.
