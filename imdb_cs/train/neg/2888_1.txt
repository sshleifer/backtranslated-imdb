Comparing this misfortune with the old, low budget porn movie would be an insult to the old, low budget porn flick. Animal scenes have no meaning nor represent this man and his crimes in the broadest sense of abstraction. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case says in part: "Gripping Retelling BTK Killer's Territory of Terror". This is not a transcript. The narrative would suggest that you were told what had happened or how or why. None of these things is true. I'm an enthusiastic study serial killer and I've seen some pretty hideous movies on them, and frankly, it's not one of them. This is not about the BTK killer. Save yourself time and a few bucks, and instead rent Dahmer. That serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you just saw this movie for yourself, check it out for free at the local library and even so you will still feel cheated.
