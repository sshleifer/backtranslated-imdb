The movie was terrible. The theater was silent dead, because everyone was embarrassed to be where he was looking for such waste. I think someone gave Jet Li lobotomy and made him make a screenplay script with a five-year-old diary. Martial arts are "okay," but when they are next to Jackie Chan and "The Matrix," you'd better look at one of them.
