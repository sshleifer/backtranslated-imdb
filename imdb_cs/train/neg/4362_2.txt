A group of human aliens who go to Earth to eat on a planet of prehistoric animals, where everyone is eating mushrooms and is retarded. Padded shots from the "Planet of Dinosuar" and frightening jokes is definitely one. Also acting is terrible and while it's not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can it be?) It's still quite terribly nasty things. It's 90 minutes run, feels like eternity, and you'll probably curse life, so take a great favor and just go on, skip this dirty movie, there's nothing to see. Film makers try to change this model in the MST3K style that makes fun of the movie that he made ten years ago, and it works to the point that it's nothing but observable, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs is pretty an unattractive talking voice. /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Joke Comment, 17 The scenes appear; 7 minutes into black features; Jessica Mills reports; Image gallery; and the original trailer
