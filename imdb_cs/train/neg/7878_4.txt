I am a great fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply wrong. At first, he had problems deciding whether he was a girl or an adult, causing a strange mixture of adult stories and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that initially gives "fun" moments. <br /> But that's hardly important, the movie is just boring, still and not true to the original story. He simply did not pass on the picture all the points Orwell tried to do in his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> The second revolution! Did they teach you something? Who will be the next Napoleon? Benjamin ?!
