This movie left me a little. It seemed like a Jaws movie when Hopper told the Mayor that he closed the parks as if Roy Shider had told the mayor to close the beach. They both did not say their summer! But the box says that Hopper must get into the killer's mind and think like one. But it really does nothing interesting or exciting. I'm not even convinced that he and his partner have some experience with the police when they're in the office and wondering how they handle this case. They just say the cops work and we solve it. And what's happening with all the old men in the pool. I did not even begin to believe they were the bosses of the crowd. And then the guy who doubted the guy who chose the crowd to find a murderer. With his one hundred dollar hairstyle and that he thinks his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come on what's dirty. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat like in other movies. I used this film and did not buy me a new one. I suggest you skip this movie. And it was funny to see the microphone above the scene, where the hopper goes and gets coffee.
