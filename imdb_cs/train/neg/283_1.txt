to the film, this movie felt like one of those after school specials, only a lower budget and lower everything else.I guess it was supposed to be an inspiring movie of some kind, but it did not work for me.yet some how it comes across as a leak .it has very pale shades of Flash Dance, but what? there is no excitement in this movie. dialogue is conceived and cliché to death. Of course, the entire movie feels bad that it's cliché.the fact that the acting was less than stellar, although it has a lot to do with what the actors gave (or in this case not) to work with. At the top there are bad songs, with really bad lyrics. all participating actors. They're all talented, but you can not tell from this movie. Of course this is my opinion, of course, but I have to believe Flying AKA Dream 1/10
