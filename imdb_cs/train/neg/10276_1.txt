So maybe you will read some of the comments posted on this movie and maybe you think about yourself: "Are you sure that the RAVE REVIEWS group was released on December 30." The funny thing is that most of these stupid reviews are that they come from the same person, or preferably from a small, coordinated "Open House" group. The truth, my friends, is that this movie is really inconsistent. Just because it's "independent," it does not mean she gets a free license. If you make a musical instrument, whether on a movie or stage, whether on Broadway or the local community theater, you should probably make sure that (a.) Your actors are singing, (b) your actors can dance, (c) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well written score and (e) you have lyrics that are funny and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can not save this. It's one of those unfortunate movie experiences, where I felt deeply embarrassed to everyone involved.
