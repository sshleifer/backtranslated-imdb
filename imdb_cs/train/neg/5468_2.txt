I absolutely love the "Toxic Avenger" series, but this weak offer from the Troma people did not make any sense, and it kept me yawning. The Escape Nuclear Power Plant (and growing next to it) makes youth from Tromaville High Go Nuts, which causes them to join the gang, have sex, explode and whatever. Also there is some sort of monster breeding in high school ... my god, this movie is a mess. The actors quite stopped their efforts after this and they should. (Invented) exaggeration began to get my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointment. 2/10.
