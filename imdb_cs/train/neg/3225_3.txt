Children love dinosaurs. It's a bit of their culture. But they have The Land Before Time. Original. At least the movie had a heart. This. This movie is simply pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean you can just stick an old story and show it to the kids. This movie has no plot, the whole idea is stupid and it's more numbers. Not like soul sucking like Theodore Rex, but it's light years before being Land Before Time.
