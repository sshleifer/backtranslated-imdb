It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but the Hostel is definitely much worse. This movie is more fun and ridiculous than scary. Most of the time I laughed when I watched him. Low-quality effects (when you watch, understand what I'm talking about and how poor is quality), bad actors (I hear about them for the first time) and it seems to be an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show than a movie). But at least I had the patience to keep an eye on it. Like a comedy? Bach. You want horror? Follow Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movie. If I'm talking about Legend of Diablo, I do not even know if I can classify her into Horror. Just a little budget. <br /> <br /> I like it 3 out of 10
