Why watch it? There is only one reason, and that is for the majesty of John Saxon. I love his acting. My favorite performances are Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 and 7 as Nancy's father policeman, Black Christmas as a policeman and Z Dusk Till Dawn again as a cop. As I walked through my exit to the local shopping mall, I encountered the film Zombie Death House and quickly threw it back but before I moved I noticed that John Saxon was not just an actor in this film but he first heard of the director . It caught me (Also, a cheap price of $ 9.00) and I and I had to have it. When I came home, I realized that this film did not keep Saxon's other work, not even his acting, which could be confused with the added pressure of directing. But it was not just the other actors who slept too. It seemed as though they were all excluded from the recent porn porn and told them you really had to act. The movie even looks like 80th porn. I can not recommend this movie to casual audiences, but if you are a fan of the eighties who have missed a culture that has since come from being born late or a fan of crap movies other than this one. Also when you dig John Saxon like me.
