Before I commented on this film, I just watched YouTube, I must admit that the reason I verified it was to see in 1980 for the first time something I saw for the first time on television commercials: the splitting of Barbara Bach. And because the movie was rated R, I expected to find her naked. Unfortunately, no cube for her or another beautiful actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, who was supposed to be a teenager, but she was actually 20 when she did. Seeing her in her bra and stockings and later in her belly dancer's suit was just as exciting as Mrs. Bach. They provide some of the diffused laughter that this movie offers. In fact, I'm not guilty of Ron Leibman for having his name taken away from credits, because his role as a sober Liceman is quite embarrassing even though I liked the "seduction" scene he did with Mrs. Nelkin. It also becomes a debut by Ralph Macchio, who is lonely among the failures sent to the academic school. The others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother, and Mrs. Bach, an arab woman who worships motor oil, and a son of politics who loves his friend Candy (Nelkin's character) so much, risks being at the girls' school at night. Among the accompanying cast, Tomas Poston plays a sophisticated character called Sisson, which I found to be somewhat fun. Screenplay by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and director Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a career at the beginning of the football scene), the Academy is uneven with politically humorous humor, but if you're not really that harmless comedy Mad Magazine and its trademark include the boy - Alfred E. Newman - would be ashamed, although they once had their name and character captured .. PS One of the "wrong" was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my hometown Chicago, Ill. Starred Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
