The Twilight Zone has reached a certain mythology - just like Star Trek. This is because there are many dedicated show lovers that no matter what they think each episode was the winner. They are the ones who evaluate 10 each scene and can not objectively evaluate the show. That's why I came back to all original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) for the overall rating and reviews were too positive. Now is the time to do the same thing for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I recorded many episodes 10, she gets this 3 just because it was bad. Writing was in fact embarrassingly bad. Two people from enemy parties in the Great War are seen throughout the episode. After some time, it is clear that they are the only two people who have stayed on Earth - how you learn in a really stupid and utterly unconvincing conclusion. The habit of twisting at the end means that the episode is great - he killed it!
