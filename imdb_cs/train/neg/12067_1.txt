You know the movie will not work well when John Carradine tells (aka and reads the script and drawing summary) about the funeral process of his character, just 5 minutes into the movie. Narrative is the last will and the will of his character. He states that his inheritance is divided among 4 children and servants. The children share $ 136 million equally, but if someone died, then this share is split between the remnants. If all the children die, they are divided among servants. To be eligible, he must live in a family home for one week. It sounds like a typical plot of a realistic show. <br /> <br /> There is only a small subtext to the nature of the deans. They are a strong and heavily dysfunctional family, but the real problems start by drowning that dog. From John Carradin's opening voice, you expect this movie to lead to the Machiavellian cat and mouse game with the end of a twist. <br /> <br /> This path is painfully slow and unnecessary. We walk through the minutes of watching people sitting around, playing pool, throwing arrows, using missiles over a fish bowl, dramatic interviews between a silky tie man, constantly throwing, bad circus music, bizarre memories reminiscent of faux-German expressionism, 4th-class horror aesthetics and a dramatic pile overcoming. All of this inevitably leads to the expected and tireless ending. You will be happy to be still alive, but the pain may be too great for you to be alone. Share your children, share. <br /> <br />
