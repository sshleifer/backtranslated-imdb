I've seen Dolemite as well as (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two more great blaxploitation cannons by our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this movie, People Tornado (aka Dolemite 2), will always have a special place in your heart. For utter stupidity, lack of skills in film production and absolute enthusiasm (honestly a little too much), human tornado can not be completed. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemite whips a white woman when some racist local cops chase the house without a good reason and you do not know it! A woman in bed with an ol 'Down is no one other than the sheriff's wife. Her scream when she sees him: "He did me to do it!" Dolemite cry: "& $ * @ $ you are real ???" Subtlety has never been his strong motive. <br /> <br /> Most important? The story of a very young Ernie Hudson, the continuity of error (characters looking for one path in one shot, and next in the next, Dolemite's suit changes the colors in each slide of his nightclub act), and Queen Bee's Daughter is the eyes in her first scene . But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think he looked great in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire the total enthusiasm it has. Whether it's jumping completely naked from a cliff or barking his gang's orders in a rhyme (for example: Quickly, into the cave! I have the plan to leave my mother $ * @ (% and dig her own grave!) The man is committing completely, they definitely go over the deck, never more than ever, he does kung fu. The climate battle is shot at high speed but occasionally slows down to let Rudy pose and tear his teeth. I'm sure if they wanted to look like it would speed up the movie as an effect or if they really wanted, <br /> <br /> The human tornado, like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent film of enormous proportions, but at least it's fun and surely you have to give those people for that effort.
