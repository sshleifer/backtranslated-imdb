If this movie is to be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". Summary, this film is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famous Dodge Charger 1968 around town and countryside, chasing girls and avoiding the law. I was a fan of "Dukes," and what destroyed the film are off-key. The exaggeration of fury, sexual references and drug use has made the reputation of "dukes" in the wastebasket. Compared to a TV show, it was scary. The only actor who did it right was the famous Dodge Charger of 1969, named General Lee. Others have faded the role of the character that damaged the movie. The Duke were another victim of the 21-year-old Hollywood TV tragedy. Skip this movie and just buy a TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My degree: F
