This is the third Errol Morris movie I've seen and his style is more and more miserable. He seems to be looking for very interesting and varied figures, great personalities for documentary films and then with the language adjustment on their faces to make fun of everything they are. It's never their direct cartoon, and Morris seems most of the time saying, "No, no, these people are really fascinating, really!" But there are always these fine tiny angles and not so fine tuning techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking her back. This film follows four people who violate the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man studying African hairless molestas to find that they are amazingly ant, lions, a man who keeps the garden full of animal-shaped shrubs and robot designers. Does the general theme of the film seem to be turning around the question of animal, human and life elements? So, the name Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control really does not seem to be anything about the movie ... right? In addition to Morris, it seems to be just a little disturbed by passionate personalities (they can call them "obsession") and creates synthetic patterns. I do not feel afraid and honestly do not believe that some of Morris's connections in the movie do. But I emphasize his subtlety. Without a voice-telling and a complete omission of words to respondents, it's not as if Morris has ever caught this anxiety on the audience. Instead, it mixes circus and ant images together at times when they are removed from the context of circus and ants, showing a kind of collective absurdity about what all these people are talking about. I found them absurd, I find them all very elegant and interesting individuals. Unless, of course, he was planning such a comparison, which means he's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter. Since none of the movies I've ever seen have particularly impressed me, I really do not care what they are trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
