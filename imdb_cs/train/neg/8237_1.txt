How has the distribution ever been made in this movie? It looks like he's been filmed on a cell phone and takes the crime scene scenario into completely new depths. He literally screams for the entire 90 minutes of the movie. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no characters, and lots of gaming. I just screamed and screamed. After fifteen minutes, I gave up and quickly hurt to see if something happened. That does not mean - of course, except for screaming. He's quite devoted when it's a quick handover, he's talking about another problem - we're not talking about the job. Each shot looks like any other shot - medium distance, one angle, blunt, boring, DULL. It's not so bad that it's good. It's just bad.
