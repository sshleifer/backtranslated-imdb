Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, lives in a broken apartment in NYC and relies on his mother to help make rents. He has beautiful neighbors named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who may or may not be married, but Aldolpho likes to play in his movie. When Al is unexpectedly given the financial promise of funding his movie from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he did it. That means Joe will not come to Adventure to steal Porsche for part of the financial support. Will the film be shot before Aldolpho is completely moral? And will Angelika play in the movie? This is, in the opinion of this viewer, a terrible movie. The script is unbelievable, with a story that wanders inconspicuously. Beals practically repudiates all her ranks and Busce, though sympathetic, is indescribable. There are a lot of awkward material and bad characters that boot. Finally, the production values ​​are too bad, so the film looks like the other. If you have time on hand, it's still a good idea to have no chance with this movie. But if you are a proverb of the arson for punishment, go ahead and look at the darn thing. Beals looks beautiful in the end.
