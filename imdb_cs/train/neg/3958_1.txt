I'm not going to waste a lot of this time because it's not really a movie that could start, just a careless mish-mash of borrowed shots and embarrassing amateur new shots made exclusively for the purpose of inserting the whole clutter and calling it "Boogeyman" sequel. Virtually 80% of this film is stolen from its much better predecessor, "The Boogeyman," a film that probably did not even bother to watch the writers, because Suzanna Love's original name (Lacy) could not even get it. And because the killer is injured, he's invisible and visible in the original shots in his original shots, he probably thinks their audience is just as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I would like the IMDb rating system to go so low, the most important and ambitious attempt to break the money of the people I've even seen you've been warned!
