The main reasons why you can see "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, who adds starry performance, and Jayma Mays, who is great as Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy overcomes that he will become a cartoonist. The rest of the film is covered with holes on which I will process. <br /> <br /> Please do not read if you do not want to know what will happen! <br /> <br /> Here is a synopsis of the plot. Rachel McAdams's character (Lisa) runs the hotel where the new tough director Homeland Security plans to stay this night. Rachel returns to Miami from the funeral, but she calls the assistant's call until the flight. Meanwhile, someone is stationed outside his father's home, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him when he calls Cillian Murphy (Jackson). All that Lisa has to do is call the hotel and move the headquarters to one where Jackson's cohort plans to fire a rocket (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. So, here are some holes of plot or absurd accident: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to call, and in the middle of the phones on the plane loses their connection. Lisa is foolishly trying to call, but by the same token is a guy across the aisle from Jackson, who called and started calling to indicate he was dead. Jackson captures and grabs Lisa's phone. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, Jackson and Lisa will of course win ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson captures Lisa as he writes a note about the mirror in the (extra-large) toilet, and a little bangs her. Miraculously, the only one who hears something is an eleven-year-old girl whose word is, of course, excluded. <br /> <br /> Lisa kicks off Jackson with a pen in his throat when he lands the plane, steals his cell phone and makes a crazy dash to the exit that fits the alley between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite the awareness that there is a throat-jet trap, airliners are obliging Lisa to open the door to the jet. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all are reasonable (if not very improbable). But here's really stupid. Lisa arrives at Miami Airport Terminal and there is no mobile phone signal (every big airport in America has a large reception on the mobile phone). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 6. Running at the airport with Jackson in frightful persecution, and no security officers will escape them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport, while the train from the gates pulled to the terminal, lost part of his voice from his pen in his throat, but still may be somewhat obvious. Nothing bothers to call his man outside Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami airport, but the one he showed looked terrible like Orlando airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals the car and goes out. Of course, this time, when he calls, the cell phone says "low battery" and soon turns off (when does it stop using this clutter?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone still called a "low battery," Lisa reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from the rocket that the fishing boat had driven to the window of the room on the 40th floor where the Director has moved. Of course, we expect not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on three sides by the ocean, so a rocket might be launched in the first suite, which dispelled the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What's the story here? Was the director's first room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a poor look? Still, they all get close to rocket attacks. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa leads Joe to save her father to see the killer outside. Although he runs it (as he shoots at her) by crashing the Jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood can see or bother to stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives in Joe's house and knocks him (we do not know how ... maybe another head butt). He then explains to Lisa that he did not kill his dad because he wanted his father to see Lisa die first (Give me a break, what is it? The Saturday morning cartoon?). For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson is chasing Lisa around the house and inventively fighting him. Of course, the real killer (ie, One who may have played Jason Statham) would do in the first 30 seconds with Lisa (or for anyone who is not a trained killer). During this persecution, Jackson crossed Joe at least once, without bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson prevails and he is about to kill Lisa when you (you guessed it) shot him by Joe. So, here is my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to keep up with horror. Or he should contact Michael Bay (who was driving the same stupid "Island") and created "Red Island".
