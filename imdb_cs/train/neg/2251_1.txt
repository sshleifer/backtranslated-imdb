A really awesome stack of papakes! <br /> <br /> A predictable, slow-moving, devastating soul, a mind-blowing filter that seems to cut your own wrist with a rusty bread knife ... it's almost imperative. <br /> <br /> The event is over for a thin dialogue, each scene is at least twice as long as it must be, the intricate details of how this career decays or that career is rising is just too rough and secular for words. Music would be good if you did not have to sit in the movie, but in fact three good songs are not enough reward for the effort you need to watch in the movie. Watching this movie I prayed God for narcolepsy or someone who shoots me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, never.
