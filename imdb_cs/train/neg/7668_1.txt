The moment she started going, I knew we had problems! The premise is at best ridiculous. The story line was even worse if it was possible. The game was rigid and the actors gave a feeling of inexperience. You expect more from people like Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as from the robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she was very incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a miserable movie to try to outline their returns. <br /> <br /> Continuity was turned off by the whole movie. Creation was not bad, but it was not really good either. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I want to go back nine hundred minutes of my life. They can keep money, but give me time! What a shame.
