OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that I lie because it is. I am conservative, but I leave politics in my opinion on the film. This film was anti-Bush, against the Middle East, against a large oil propaganda, but that's not the reason why it was bad. <br /> <br /> First, I will make a credit where my credit is due. I saw this premiere in the movie because I like such kinds of films and I am a great political science in the collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far away as I did it very well. <br /> <br /> This story was impossible for me to decode. I was tested and IQ 138 but no matter how much I tried, there was no way I could compose the story of the movie and what characters do what you do. The story and scene were completely disorganized and poorly organized. If this is not one of those films to be watched many times to get into the depth of the story, which is very good, I do not have exactly what is going on. Which makes sense, because if you want to make a political argument and get no criticism, then leave your argument impossible to criticize! If you can not dazzle it with brilliance, then suppress Bull S.
