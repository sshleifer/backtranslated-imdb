Ho-hum. The deadly biological weapon of the inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of getting into the wrong hands. Unknowingly, his son (Luke Perry) works on the antedot all the time. Enter the CIA Olivia d'Abo and start car and mouse pursuits. Also in the cast are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to be in a state of disrepute with one of his best efforts. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo is wrong for this role, but it's good to look.
