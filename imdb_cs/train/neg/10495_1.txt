I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I would not have the nerves to go even five meters away. But everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes, people who eat, and jumping about the president make the film one of the worst of all time. <br /> <br /> It's really a bad movie, from which you have to stick on. All the "jokes" are so young that you laugh because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is older than 4 years. I'm surprised Croc Hunter did not ask the crocodile to find out after the meal.
