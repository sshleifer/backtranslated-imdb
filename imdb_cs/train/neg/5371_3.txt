This film was somewhat disappointing. After a very slow, very intense (and fairly cruel) beginning, the movie begins to lose. Too many conspiracies leave too little time for explanation and come out of the theater, I was wondering what it was all about. The characters remain shallow, the story is not convincing at all, most of them are a matter of no-one without parodies, and there are some very raw parts ... As a young policeman he has to dig a body. Of course it's night And it's raining and he has to do it himself ... yawning! Or the manifestation of evil are "Nazis" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, that's really original. But there are some nice pieces, such as a scene with fistfight, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel are doing what they can), it's definitely not worth it.
