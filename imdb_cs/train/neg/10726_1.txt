I agree with the previous comment that the beginning of the movie is pretty good and you get how you wander about what's coming ... ... What is nothing. All open stories remain open; the two characters that initially seemed to have some meaning are totally omitted from the picture, with the exception of 1 or 2 very short scenes. I'm sorry if Ilya did not do better to leave them completely ... With respect to one of the remaining characters, nothing is done with her either. She is just visiting some terrible place and suddenly she is not a movie about it, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days out of bread, drink home vodka, and apparently defy. Some may say that the film is well-off in a company breakdown, such as the IFFR judges, but it's just a bad taste for me, poor camera work, a miserable script, and a terribly wrong direction. Therefore, I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to sorting: 1!
