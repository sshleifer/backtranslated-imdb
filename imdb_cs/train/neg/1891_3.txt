A documentary film about nomadic Persians who make a treacherous passage of massive mountains to gain their herds of grass. Watching this silent, black-and-white feature, partially crumpled by the scenic point of oriental music that could not be used in the original show, is even longer than it sounds. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and is a complete failure to create any plot of plot. I loved Nanook from penguins north and march, but he disdained this film regardless of the similarity of the topic. Physical difficulties are not as interesting in themselves.
