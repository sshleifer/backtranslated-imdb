It seems that the people who wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called "film". They described a "blinding choreography of intrigue and violence". I have not seen any "intrigue". Instead, I saw a poor attempt at dialogue in the supposed kung fu movie. I have not seen any "violence". At least I did not see anything that could cause me to suspend my distrust of what could hurt a man with "impervious" skin - but here I might find out too much "plot". Additionally, as a viewer of many movies (some include occasional kung fu films), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is undetectable. Anything you can choose, I'll always be right <br /> <br /> Right, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> I was not blind with choreography.
