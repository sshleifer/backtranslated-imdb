I usually like comedy. I like it very much. But I really do not mean "Envy". I think it has a boring content / theme, and it's not really fun. Although acting is generally good, it is not enough to make the film at least interesting. Stiller and Black do not talk about their talent in this movie. <br /> <br /> So if you're going to rent a comedy, I suggest you do not really go for it. If you are not bored, and I see that I'm not the only one with this opinion, because even Jack Black has apologized (see Trivia).
