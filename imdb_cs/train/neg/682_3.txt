Note: From various papers, I can see that there was an original silent version and also an audio version of this movie. I saw the sound version and I was curative. Since some people suggest that the original version was LONGERIUM and without miserable dubbing, my review must be read with that in mind. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a beautiful reputation as a filmmaker and Louise Brooks has a little culture too, it is in many ways a poorly made film. While Hollywood had already moved to sound mode until 1929, until the mid-1930s, many famous French films were essentially silent films - with some dialog and sound effects that overwhelmed the film. The movement of the lips in many and especially in this film is not even able to get closer to what is said, and that would explain why an American like Ms. Brooks could make a French film. It's just careless, and I would prefer that they just shot a silent film - and as a silent film it would be an average film - with an excellent camera (occasionally) and a decent, quiet style. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For silent moral play around 1920, it would be fine, but according to the 1930 standards, the conspiracy is a bit muddy (that is, "old" - not "hideous"). The lady wins the beauty contest and her fianc√© can not handle it. It puts it all temporarily, but it draws it back to fantastic life and the spell of its end! Tad melodramatic, huh? And also a little simplifying and underdeveloped. Finally, I felt a very disturbing and unreal nature of a boyfriend's friend (?). He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent most of the film being abused and chosen by a friend and everyone else. When the whole film was filmed and no analysis was made, his character seemed redundant and the treatment he had received was completely deliberate. Should viewers laugh when they were abused? It seems to me that this is what is implied and I do not like it at all. There are better French films of the time (Le Million,) as well as better still films. I can not understand that this movie has a high rating.
