I do not know what you breathe, but please stop. This movie was a complete basket. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was kind, cute, sweet, loving and extremely fun. He had innocence, but he was also strong. This new baby, Alex? It's unpleasant like hell! It is just a spectacular ripoff who tried to fulfill Culkin's charm and grace, and that made him feel weak. <br /> <br /> Scammers, full of crap. Harry and Marv were so entertaining on the screen. They were comedians, they were humorous, and you just wanted to make even more of Culkin, which is a prerequisite to be a good villain. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for these roles. On the other hand, in the third, we have 4 new idiots that are just about to go and again, try to use the charisma and duo the magic of the first villains. Do not say they are horrible, but they were not memorable or really fun. More on what we actually do. <br /> <br /> Then we have real movies. Part 1 and 2, classic. Memorable. It is perfect to watch around Christmas and brings a beautiful Christmas feeling and brings so many emotions. This makes you fall in love with the story and take care of the characters. Simply, unforgettable and close to being a masterpiece. Part 3? Master's bullshit. Enough to say it. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I do not know why people like it. I think people really do not know what a good movie is. Its a bad follow-up with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new hero from the main character that I would like at least to beat burglars. <br /> <br /> Run and run away from this waste. And do not even start with Part 4!
