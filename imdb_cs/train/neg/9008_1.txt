There were a lot of unfamiliar movies or films given by bad reviews that I really like. This was not one of them. He was exaggerated and used camera techniques, making me feel like watching a soap opera. It was absurdly predictable and she took most of the movie to get on, and you asked yourself, "Is that it?" Once I decided that the film would not take too seriously and look at it from a purely corroded view, it became more enjoyable. This is a movie that would end up on the MST3000 if it was still on.
