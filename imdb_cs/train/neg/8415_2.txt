This was longer than the Ten Commandments, The Lord of the Rings, and the Matrix of the Trilogy Together. My oh, my nightmare. This is the only big oversold story of 2006. It's not a moment that is not written and clich√©. Movie musical instruments can be performed great and bring the audience real excitement. Dreamgirls takes the path of Chinese water torture in the form of endless musical montages, dirty acting and poor directorial choices (seriously, Mr. Condon, did you have to do an old billboard countdown? It's on # 58! Look for his ascending charts and here's the past message on Billboard , which will show you again ... and again .... and again)
