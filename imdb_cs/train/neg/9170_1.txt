The question when one sees the film so badly is not necessarily: "How did the film become so bad?" or even, "Why did I see it for the first time?" but "What have I learned from this experience?" Here's what I've learned: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just because the 'rules' of horror films have been cataloged and the Hall countless times in the last ten years does not mean that someone will not go on and shoot the movie uses ALL of them, without it being humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If the movie is to be described as ** ** ** based on a video game, you have a script problem. <br /> <br /> - The black character does not always have to die first, but the Asian character always knows that kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - While you're proud to find out how to make a "Matrix effect" on a budget, it does not necessarily mean you should use it again and again. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - The group offers to write your movie theme for free, politely <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not killing zombies, it's about zombies that kill people as best as possible, which is what makes them frantic. <br /> <br /> - White people who can pay $ 1600 for rave, deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, all you need to know is something else. you will count on your two lines when someone asks, "What was it?" or, "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Extinct breasts are not in elijak√Ωm horror film. <br /> <br /> - Shot helicopter and license agreement with Segou magically transforms your movie from the "student film" to "big studio". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can name all three "Living Dead" films that George Romero does not do to you. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. I saw worse movies, but just because I saw "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
