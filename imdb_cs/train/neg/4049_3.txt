I did not like this vehicle Bill Murray when he was originally released in the 1980s, so I tried to watch him again to find out if my dislike of this film in the 80's dropped to my movie taste or it was "Stripes "is just a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in, and "Stripes" is a bad movie. Now, Stripes can be an innovative comedy in the early 1980s, boasting people who have undergone basic training or who are fans of Bill Murray, but it's still a bad movie. Why is it bad? Mostly because "Stripes" is supposed to be a comedy, but it's just not so funny. Some laugh, but they are very little and far. Most of the film uses a dramatic plot that is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is particularly noticeable when you are accustomed to more contemporary comedies, such as Anchorman, who is trying to laugh in every part of the movie. "Stripes" also suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of ability to act. Bill Murray is a great comic, but at this point his career was not a very impressive dramatic actor, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are simply not enough as actors to wear a dramatic arc of the film. Finally, most of the comedy that is in the "Stripes" revolves around Bill Murray's self-conscious, intelligent ale-man-child character, so if you do not find that character funny (like I'm not) you will not find most of what little comedy is in the "Stripes" funny either. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is actually a film of his time, he did not get well and is not worth it. If you want to look at comedy comedy "friend" from the 1980s, I recommend "Mix fool". Like "Stripes," humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in the current comedy, but unlike "Stripes" it was much better and as a result is still observable.
