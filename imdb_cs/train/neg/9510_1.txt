Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. The film is trying to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw last January, I was so disgusted with the film that I walked and talked about my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. I have heard that the DVD has a director's cut, maybe I will try it, but this PG-13 basket is *** and the worst kind with ***. Perhaps if the film had some T & A it would be okay. But gags are chaotic, and acting is terrible. Worse than the movie Throma.
