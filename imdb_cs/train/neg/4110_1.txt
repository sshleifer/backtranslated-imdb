It's just breathtaking in that awful bankruptcy - you really have to see it! Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either a savior or a problem: because he is the only one on the screen who can actually get his narrative related to something similar to natural cadences and curves, he either destroys the film by pointing to all the mistakes of everyone else, or save it by giving them some context for their horror. I am inclined to look at it later - thanks to it, it works like a high comedy. It's the seventeenth pause in dwarf basketball, his skill is not covered in this context, and his breakthrough is excellent. However, Mrs Eastwood, whose inability to speak in common English is so ubiquitous that I actually saw her, was expecting to know that it was Russian beauty that phonetically expressed her lines without understanding their meaning. But no, it's just a non-talented American who lets you laugh at every line you drop. Whether she knew what it meant must remain an open question.
