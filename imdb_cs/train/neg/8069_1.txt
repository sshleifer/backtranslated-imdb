The disconcerting disorder with a rumbling soundtrack, "Soul Survivors," is the last contribution to the horror film "Who's Dead and Who's Alive." Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie, Matt, and Annabel, are preparing to go to various colleges, but before they say goodbye to Thanksgiving, they take part in one last rave party fling in a burnt-out church, the Annabel sluts Eliza Dushka, aka Faith, the second vampire murder). Painless scary guys will pay too much attention to Cassie (generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained and before the quartet leaves the party. They were on SUVs, persecuted, and then traveled to heartless guys who immediately and inexplicably carried intentional 180 into the highway, causing an ugly and fatal accident when the SUV flew across the waterfront and plunged into the river. Sean is killed (and is that?) And Cassie spends the rest of the film, which coincides with loneliness and guilt, when it is not pursued by Duke Sean or persecuted by those gruesome spooky boys. Very inexplicable incoherence follows when Cassie's mental state degenerates further until we reach the foreseeable conclusion. Who is dead and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who does she really care for?
