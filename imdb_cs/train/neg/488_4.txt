A terrible movie! It had to be against some real arsonists who were nominated for the Golden Globe. They have accepted the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and masked him for recognition. My complaint does not mean that they have taken their liberties with their facts; if the story was good, it would be perfectly fine. But it's just bizarre - the true story of this artist would seem to have made a much better film, so why did they come up with this dirty scene? I suppose there are not enough naked people in the actual version. At the end, it is quickly ended by a collective artistic life - we could save a few hours if we were to benefit the rest of the film with the same brevity.
