One of the worst movies I've seen in working with an awkward camera, dirty film use, the movie was grainy, the script was horrible, I guess come as predictable as a big battle at the end ..... <br /> <br /> some of the battle scenes were fine, I think .... Some scenes were so bad that it was comic ... like Sorbo getting horses and riding at the end ... LOL I mean really ... horses? Oh, I can not forget how bad killers are murdered all over the movie in the same vehicle .. he would think that after the killing of key witnesses and federal agents would be watched ... ETC really do not bother to watch ...
