Redundant, but again case. If you like a former SNL comedian and his antics (in this case Schneider), then you should go. Basic comedy, the life of man is saved by transplanting various animal organs into it. Unfortunately, he took on every animal characteristic. Former Survivor Colleen looks pretty good now that she does not have bumps on her legs and a little make-up on her face! D
