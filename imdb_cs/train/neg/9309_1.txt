Hello everyone ... <br /> <br /> In fact, there is not much to say about this movie at all. The basic plot is that a man (Brandon) takes several friends to take a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend off-campus vacation. After picking up a girl on the way things start to do wrong for all of them. The story itself (written by an actor who plays Brandon, I believe, even though he is wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing. The "Clown Slayer" is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious but especially intelligent predator, we are instead offered a somewhat clumsy, motherly drummer singer who seems to be going through a small life crisis. The only thing that motivated me to write this comment was sexual scenes and anything else that appeared in the film (the quality of the film made me take a little of those things). , this movie drops below every possible set standard. True, when I watched this, I shared a couple of beers with a close friend, so we got some relative value of entertainment from this film, so it's only fair to mention that S.I.C.K only got paid two ratings. In fact (and with the benefit of a retrospective estimate), the one-hour rating for this movie is more than legitimate. <br /> <br /> One of the ten.
