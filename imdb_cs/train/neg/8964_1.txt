Those who are familiar with these two previous Cube movies basically know what they can expect: a small group of people trapped in a pile of catchy rooms, paranoia, bad acting ... This is a bit different. About half of the film takes place outside the cube, where people watching people who are watching people inside the cube (or at least five of them). I think Cube Zero is trying to explain what to do with the dice, but you really do not know more than what was contained in the first two films. Sure, there is some explanation, but it is quite lame compared to what was suggested in the first film. Cube Zero looks quite inexpensive (just like its predecessors) and the fact that it shows more than just a few empty places just emphasizes this feeling. I was quite sure when he said there was no risk that any of the actors would win any prizes in the foreseeable future. They brought back traps from Cube 1, though (I think they are almost the same, which is a bit of shame). I know that many people appreciate this movie and its links to the first one, but I feel it is an absolutely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was not so great to start. [1/10]
