Well, maybe I have a bad run with Hindi movies lately. I asked the video guy for Apharan (Prakash Jha), but it's a new version that has not been available yet. So I had to deal with this. It turned out to be the deepest Hindi movie I've seen (and I've seen a lot). No wonder BoLlywood is laughing all over the world! If IMDb had a negative rating, I would give Garam Masala -10. I remember seeing a television show about the jazz premiere they had to release in Mumbai. All usual celebrities and their hips appeared. For some special reason, people expect good things from Piyadarashan. I did not like Hulchul, Hungam or other movies. Hulchul, probably dubbed from Tamil or Telugu, came across a very loud, in your face, a ticket that did not make much sense except Bollywood's movie. This last piece of complete CXXP proved that this guy does not have NO BRAINS. Who made him a director, even director Bollywood? <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie now. What begins as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensual female hunt. Two fashion photographers working for the magazine share an apartment (it's not like No Entry, where two guys are working on a magazine about chalks and share an office - Jesus Christ, now copying their own stories!) Some chefs or chefs who try to help one gifts in his quest for multilateral tastes (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). What finally happened, I have no idea. I turned off half way. What a ridiculous waste. I can not believe they even let him go. And how sadistic they are in their own dirt rolls! Why did the audience do this - poor illiterate Indian masses (700 Miles last calculated) or well-backed NRI desis staying in Phoenix? It does not matter. Neither group has a clue about what makes a good movie and probably deserves such goddesses of terrible things. It's a short review because nothing is involved, but the usual bag of class F. garbage should change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.
