I just saw this movie yesterday. My girlfriend wanted to see it just for Richards Gere. I feel unnecessarily hurting time and money and telling my girlfriend that it's the last time we're going to see the movie just because there's an actor / actress in it. I hope he learned a lesson because I had trouble keeping her in place. While I already paid, I wanted to see the end at least in the hope that something good would appear but I did not hold my breath, and fortunately, I was the victim of the movie just the same. <br /> <br /> It's not a black and white movie, it's black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sexual offenders are portrayed as irrefutable criminals and the bad ones among them were really bad. Talk about clich√©s and the exploitation of a typical American phobia. Richard Gere worked as usual, but the blonde to replace him was at best desired. Completely unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The film tries to use the favorite theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational turn, which is just unreal. They simply use sex offenders as an excuse to commit cheap murderous acts of murder, alertness, rape, and torture - something that seems almost gratuitous. They even have a wolf attacking the people in the movie - how little you get. I found out that the movie will not be released in the US and will go directly to the DVD. It should also remain in other countries, but because they are Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without the film Gere, the film is not even a valuable film of the B series.
