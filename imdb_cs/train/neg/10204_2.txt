It seemed that the movie was good for the first time, it had built profile profiles ... the conspiracy seemed to be in the right direction ... however, as the film progressed, the director seemed to focus on bad things. .. or just a lot of the movie. The identity of the characters changed in the worst part of the film. There also seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they had things in the movie that did not seem to fit into the movie itself. And the title ... not where the movie fits the film ... I suppose the title works for thumbnails .... The actors are doing well with what they had ..... if they had a better direction and a writer, it worked better. But not. So now is the new horrible movie that came out this Friday ... My opinion! ... do not waste time or money.
