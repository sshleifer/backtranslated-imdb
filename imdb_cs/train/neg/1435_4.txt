This movie was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba parks and returned to the world's eye again to what was left of wild western Canada. When Archie began writing his newspaper articles; the idea of ​​that day was to shake the wilderness and transform / absorb people of the first nation. The film shoots and asks; why would a well-educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian? Archie, as an English boy dreams of something happening, but grasping the full meaning of this dream is unique and invaluable - no. It sounds like a famous puppet story or not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw that Archie became my live image of an "Indian Cigar Dealer" of a very wooden character and not at all real - by Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed wild Indian on a dance scene for tourists. His fullness and reality was not accomplished until he met and did not cease to marry Annie's wife. Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the English scene, not like Gray Owl, a Canadian native of the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie, which becomes a noble wild prototype. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Mr. Brosnan as well as the directors are well prepared. I've been watching Gray Owl and I think it's a good big screen movie to add to my collection. Spoiler - I thought the latest Archie scenes to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs were a great moment in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful Canadian lakescape scenery and true Gray Owl locations. <br /> <br />
