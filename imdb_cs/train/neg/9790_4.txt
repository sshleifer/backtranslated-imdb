At least ten years old set remains interesting. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) A small, well-prepared couple who is going to bring a native from a baby brother's new home for his son George (Johnathan Lipnic). They come home with a peculiar new sibling ... a tight-fitting little mouse called Stuart (expressed by Michael J. Fox). Yes, mouse. Stuart is happy to find a sense of belonging, even though he is in a supercomputer world that includes his new family cat Snowbell (pronounced Nathan Lane). Stuart is committed to family-friendliness and overall friendship. George eventually accepts his little new brother when dapper-dressed Stuart rescues embarrassment on the model boat race. Also in cast: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones. And votes: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
