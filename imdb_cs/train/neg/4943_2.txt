I've been watching the 3 episodes of Caveman and I have no idea why I'm going, except waiting for it to improve. <br /> <br /> For me, this show is just exhausting advertising without real humor. When we were sitting around watching these shows, we all speculated about what was going to happen. The episode of female cave-woman with attitude was actually big, yes, right for us. she is rough in the theater and works hard on strangers and the truth is that she needs slap <br /> <br /> I find myself a pretty good reviewer, I'll take everything but I must say that the caves are comparable to the old show, mother, car. I give it 2 just because she deserves 1 better than 1 because she really spent money on her.
