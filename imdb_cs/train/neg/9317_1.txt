I bought it from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said the reason why it was so cheap was that the disk was scratched, but he did not mention that the reason why it was so cheap was that the film was a bad effort he took harder than Paris Hilton in hotel room home video. When we talk about home videos, when it's a fair play that would have been released to them as movies - I mean movies are using actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - no more than that - just collect your friends and shuffle ideas together in the weekend, you will produce a budget of £ 8.00 and get someone to fall down the stairs with the Casio keyboard - then stick it on the shelves, for some poor juice (me) to make yourself lonely at home. But here's the pliers - I quickly crossed over most of it and threw it on one side, ready for the hammers ... until the next night while watching Darren Day's horror 'Hellbreed' (£ ​​1.99 to take home and keep from another Blockbuster). Now this movie shot "Grim Weekend" like The Exorcist, so I hit the Grim Weekend again to catch up with some of the moments in the wonderful IMDb panels that viewers say they are gay. Sure, as soon as I got over the misery, the pain and the horror that I realized it was Grim Weekend, it was a complete toast, I could enjoy, enjoy and go to sad things. And there's plenty. Check the boards. Then check the movement. Hell, it may even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
