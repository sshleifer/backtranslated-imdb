This movie had what sounded like a good assumption: 9 people who are afraid of winning a million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not look like a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really meaningless as a dance scene. Several scenes are just a pretext for showing the camera to parts of the female body. The game is bad, but some of them are fun in their horror. What is really strange is that at the end of the film it will change to 5 minutes western and, in the end, twists, of which there are several, do not make sense with the rest of the film. The director seemed to have just added things because he thought it would look great while comfortably ignoring the story of the movie up to that point. It simply did not make much sense. The only scary thing was that the dancers were dancing along the corridor, but they did not even manage to avoid the rest of this mess.
