This movie is a terrible act, writing, direction, and production. But it is so scary that it is in fact partly observable. This is SEMI observable. The story (which is little) has virtually no meaning at all. Barney Drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and it gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian supported casts are in TV commercials. None of them did anything else I knew. And of course even less talented brother Sly Stallone ..... = \ <br /> <br /> Trivia: He was shot almost entirely in the small village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles along Toronto) I have recognized many local landmarks / crossroads / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed on the now-destroyed "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was destroyed.
