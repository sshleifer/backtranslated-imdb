I do not know who he is accused of, shy writers or a crazy director. It seemed to be one of those films, where the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna, and Jon) were paid a lot, that the film really is not enough. It could have been very fun, but there was grief in every scene, even cowardice. Since she was rated R, why was the ubiquitous bubble balls shot by a 70-year-old woman rather than Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen Sleep experience potentially horrible relationships with the world's two most beautiful and powerful acres? If they just wanted to laugh, why do not they throw in Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? It was so predictable. I was surprised that the director was not five years old. What waste, not only for the audience but also for the actors.
