It is not obvious from viewing this film (and I therefore recommend to the audience to explore the people who present their case) but this presentation of the realities of Islam and its support for violence and intolerance towards all non-Muslims is inadequate objectivity and also fails to affect the human condition . One thing is to prove that the Qur'an tells many things about how a wise Muslim requires mutual interaction with non-Muslims, but every realist is able to realize that not every person who feels to be a follower of Islam agrees with all the principles of this belief, and system and follow them. There is a reason why many speakers question a lot, so audiences need to see a presentation with healthy skepticism; Do not use it all, hook, line, and platinum without anyone thinking. <br /> <br /> One particular examines Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who committed terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe in either of these claims. I am not and I have never been a Muslim. I have never read the Quran. I am neither a Christian nor a member of the faith. But I'm an intelligent and demanding person. While the film is quite disturbing, in its performance, as some Muslims see their duty towards Islam; I recall that Islam is more than the views of fundamentalists. Just as fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, there are also differences in the intensity of faith and commitment between Jews and Muslims. When you look at this movie, you have to have a salty shake hand. One grain is not enough, you need more. Use your own mind and think about yourself, explore what is being presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how it is covered by Islam, based on what is stated in the 98 minutes of the video. There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who have combined this film that suggests some bias. Be your own brain.
