OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie a little bit. I'm aged in the demographic, and I'm a little bit identifiable with some stories. Even sometimes an unpleasant and meaningful dialogue seems to be half-realistic, and in another film it would be forgiven. I'm trying as hard as I can to destroy this movie, like the others, but it's not easy if the filmmakers did not at all try. <br /> <br /> Editing in this movie is terrible! Perhaps the worst editing I've ever seen in the movie! There are things you do not have to go to film school to learn, tilting with good editing is not one of them, but identifying the bad ones. Also shot ... Oh, my God shot, just terrible! I can not even get acquainted with the details, but sometimes we see that random things appear, and this together with editing will give you the most painful viewing experience. to a low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not a justification as well. I've seen short movies on youtube with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what you thought, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your ego. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this film is similar to what an amateur pornographic movie would be really lazy if it was filled with three or four miserable sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation. If it is not your thing, avoid it at all costs!
