I wondered why John Wood did not play Dr. Falken while watching the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting, and bad movie overall. Please do not watch this movie. Rent original "war games" if you feel nostalgic. I did not like bending a conspiracy to try terrorist attacks. In the first film, W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1,000 American warheads focused on the United States. In this movie, the idea behind a computer was to kill terrorists in training before they were a threat. Politics aside, one of the good things in the first film, was to emphasize that even a stupid computer could eventually understand the idea of ​​the useless war. There is no such view in this movie.
