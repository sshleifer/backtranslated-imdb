Gradually I followed these films, so maybe I was a little awaited. I think Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they are doing, and they wanted to see what Dan Reed could come up with, but unfortunately it just did not work for me. the fact that the movie really does not seem to understand the genre that is falling and as such does not make dramatic, horrifying and thriller elements, because rather than concentrating on one of them and doing it well, it's a bit bloated all the shops and championship. The premise (as with most of the revenge of the films) is simple, the couple meet and go out, something bad happens and they revenge, it's a simple formula and the fact that many directors have mastered professionally over the years. In this case, it is unfortunate as if Dan Reed thought: "It would be great to do one of those vengeance films that will deepen a little by showing man more characters and becoming more subject to their mental state ..." ! There are also a few key elements missing, in this type of movie there is generally some kind of warning. Do not worry, or it could be a cause that increases tension, but there is nothing like that. It just happens, then nothing happens in an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. There are a lot of really hard competition in this genre and Dan Reed's hats for the try, I have no problem with his directorial abilities but the deadline for writing ... I think next time he should stick to the type of film he's doing instead of he tried to be too smart and he would have a good film on his hands.
