I saw the original German version that was not dubbed, and I was surprised how this movie is really bad. I was thinking about seeing my share in bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabin Grannies, Zombie Lake and so on, nothing for me could prepare for me! It was really a pain if you listened to this movie because there is no plot, no good gaming, and even special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called Zombies, carrying nothing more than white makeup and their old clothes, so their good set would was not destroyed by ketchup and marmalade stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to destroy 90 minutes of your life, then let's look at it for everyone else, do not do it because you will be sorry!
