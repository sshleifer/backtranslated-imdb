When this game was introduced for the first time more than thirty years ago by the BBC, it would be something completely different for them. So, would some people think it was terribly frightening, and they could have some special effect on them? Looking at the game today, it does not seem to be scary, and even special effects can leave a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Would the train really be allowed to pass RED LIGHT into a dark tunnel? I think so ...... but if you look at this game again, you will find that the first train that enters the tunnel moves directly RED LIGHT! (maybe it was at the time of the dickens)? You will also notice that the footpath leading down to Signal Box is very steep and in poor condition. Certainly there would be a number of appropriate steps with handles to make Signalman come up or down to the cut. (I can not notice that) <br /> <br /> I do not understand anything from acting as Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (traveler) gave a wonderful performance. > <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I thought it was a ghost to the passengers or what? Does anyone really really understand this rather confusing story ??? (maybe I'm the only one who does not) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The game has a wonderful atmosphere throughout. It suffers from the fact that today it is not scary and little, if not too confusing, and has some unusual signaling practices .... Thanks for reading my review.
