This little show is of course some stupid little prequel / spin off from the original series. <br /> <br /> In comparison with the live action series this show is a bullshit. The live action show had intelligent jokes and stories. While the animated series is basically toned down the sweeter version for the younger audience they spend, but I think maybe the kids are rejecting this stupidity. The story in each episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and useless dillemma and she uses magic to repair. This is the basic idea of ​​each episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina used the spell to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes Harves to become her slave. This leads to the bizarre but rather interesting scene that Gem says: "Just love me now," and Harvey gets on her hands and knees and starts kissing her legs like that god. (which is perfectly correct because she is her subordinate slave manager). But this silly split is not worth time or effort.
