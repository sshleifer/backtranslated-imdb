Ye Lou's Purple Butterfly film sets up a secret organization (Violet Butterfly) against Japanese forces in a torn Shanghai war. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on the opposite sides of the conflict after a random encounter. I agree with the Paris Quartet. The film replaces an intricate, semi-historical conspiracy conflict without giving the viewer the only reason to look after the characters or their causes. A sudden change of time will not help, because it seems totally unjustified and unnecessary. Normally, I do not mind dark movies, but the absence of light, bone shots that shake the bones, and generally poor shooting techniques really do this heavy movie that she could watch and stay interested in. I agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film "has a chaotic style of adaptation and claustrophobic cinematography," but I do not think it helps the film. The background of the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century and I do not think you could do any justice by modifying it like it was Michael Bay movie. Too melodramatic moments do not contribute to her observability. Actors are all melancholy. Zhang Ziyi again shows that he has an extremely limited acting performance because he spends the entire movie and does what he seems to be most fond of in all his films. However, at least, it adds to this role a variety of chords and engaging in the worst loving scene of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. Overall, this is a very disappointed film, especially as it comes from director Suzhou He. 2/10
