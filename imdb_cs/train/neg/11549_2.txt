Though there were some fun moments, I thought the movie was quite chaotic. The longer he ran, the worse it was. Once the action came to Monument Valley, I found myself looking at beautiful niches more than the ever more stupid and unconvincing interaction of the characters. The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. First, she's on the deal, then she finds out the truth, and she's going to cry. Then he is back, then leaves them again. Then he's back. There is no obvious motivation for her decision. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and many missed options. I have to say that the pictures were much smaller than the sum of its parts. It seems that people who like Repo Man liked it. Searchers 2.0 is not a match for the searcher.
