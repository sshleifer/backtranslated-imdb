F * ck Me! In my time I've seen some incredibly terrible movies, Ss! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I can not say how the film is really bad. In addition to the conspiracies that do not really exist there, the comic bulls that behave, terrible excuses for the zombies; You know what, I can go all day. Every little thing in this movie is either stupid, unnecessary, dirty or embarrassing. Anyone who wants to watch this movie ... no! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that I have it on my stand. It's hidden right on the damn bottom of a huge pile. I could not even give this horse-excuse for the movie off. It is bad.
