This movie was sold for one dollar at Wal-Mart on DVD, so I do not feel like I lost anything to watch this movie, except for my TIME. He enjoyed acting by Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and looked great because it was a terrible script. The story is about college students who have chosen to play Mazes & Monsters in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has had problems playing this game in other universities in the past, and recommends that his parents leave the game and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice girl and has a romantic fling with her and once she starts playing the game, stops loving her and acts like a Monk. There are some scenes in the movie that are taken running around the former World Trade Center and also in the observation and roof areas. It is rather sad to watch this part of the movie where so many human beings have died because of the evil in the world. This is not a good film, except Tom Hanks is trying to keep the film above the diving level of fun.
