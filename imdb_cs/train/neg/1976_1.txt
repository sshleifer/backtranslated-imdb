How is it possible that a movie can be so bad? Bad behavior. Bad script. Just embarrassment all around. This is just one bad clich√© after another. <br /> <br /> This movie has some great star names. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This film did not make any money for good reason. The recall of black cowboy movies is simply not. It's a shame they did not have a good story. <br /> <br /> This movie has some great star names.
