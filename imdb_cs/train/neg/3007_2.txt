Well, on an endless search for horror, we come across this movie, which seems to have been released on DVD recently for some unwise reason. The conversion is terrible and the quality is just upset. I do not think it's because of a bad remaster or anything, I just think the movie is badly done. Apparently filmed in an abandoned school with a budget that was undoubtedly lost to cheap beer and no talent hacks, "Slaughter High" begins slowly and does not increase the pace for an hour or so. First, we look at the "nerd" when the group chooses him ... Actually, I do not even know, He does not even know what should be ... jockeys? The top leader, with his ultra hooknose, is so ugly that he should definitely be busy as a jerk. Then there is a "big guy" and a couple of stupid losers and youngsters who are supposed to be "hot" but they are not. It's a mystery why this group of rejections chooses one of their own, but I think the viewer is supposed to be "cool kids" picking on dweeb. Pouring options are terrible because most colleges are playing for thirty years. As other reviewers have highlighted, actors (if you can say it) are a lot of British, whose accents are many times hiding through this crap. We have to assume that this group of "children" was the only pupil of this school, because their "assembly" is only at school, which is now shown to be abandoned, it is they. <br /> <br /> Kills are lame, gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; such as "This place gives me the lungs ..." and "Somebody give a beer" are emphasized ... It's simply not good. Skip this if you do not meet some friends and want to laugh at a really poor slasher attempt. If you want to see well, get Bav's "bay of blood" done 14 years ago and much better. To see a good duck, check out "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10 children.
