The "fatal look of love" is basically a "fatal attraction" with a few bangs added to the back half. The end will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies a week. It's another warning story about temptation, and it's nothing new to this genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) deals with a beautiful woman who has only a great trust fund. Though he has everything, he risks losing everything by starting a crazy stance with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, the Cedar Falls blonde woman who is in sight, hardly tells Brett, and she does not enjoy it particularly well when it comes to his engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett appeared in the main bedroom of a large and luxurious home she shared with her new husband. When the police ask Brett's question, he immediately points to Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to have come to her face in the past - not because it was the idea of ​​stability. Her lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and hell is determined to prove it. Did she do it or not? How does it end? You can find answers to these questions the next time you see the "Deadly View of Love" on the local station. And do not forget the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
