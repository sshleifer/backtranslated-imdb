The first in the series was great, easily one of the best horror movies of all time. That's the rarest. When I sat down to look at it, I really thought how bad is the fourth and fifth, that would be good after the previous terrible. The boy was wrong. Unbelievably bad. When I watched the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to turn it off, but I thought not, maybe it would improve. Not that. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a terrible movie in itself, it did not need another sequel because the last two (the fourth and fifth) were already terrible! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back? It was TERRIBLE, the story line was predictable and annoying, and it also had mistakes. The way Springwood was doing was totally wrong. He has no respect for the first at all. To add to that, the whole thing seemed really over-top-top. Some people say this movie was "funny". This movie is not "fun" at all. Since when should Freddy Krueger be "funny"? I think this is funny. This film is a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, they would not have such information as in the first one! The end was just stupid and cheese as well as the others. It completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the former. It just shows up. <br /> <br /> Such a pity that Wes Craven has created something so good at first, but he has to be dragged down because of this waste that belongs to the trash. They should not even bother filming this movie. Not one of the following, except the third one. The third is the only decent of all sequels. If it was a DVD in its own right and it was not part of DVD Nightmare On Elm Street that I got, I would want it if I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: An amazing and bad attempt to continue. <br /> <br /> - Complete MOCKERY of the first movie <br /> <br /> So please do not waste time on this worthless waste.
