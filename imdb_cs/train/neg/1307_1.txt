It was really a very bad movie. I'm a huge fan of Italian horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two demo movies that were very fun - they were so bad they were great, but it's so bad that it's really bad. It's extremely boring, the story never comes and I hate those characters-the wife who slapped her husband and the buzzing pain screaming and the pain in her husband *** absorbed me, it was not enough of a story dedicated to Ogre, who was probably the best actor in the whole movie . I turned around three quarters of the way because I was very, very busy! Do not bother.
