I was looking at this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, it seemed strange and totally useless ... so I decided to bit a bit and got my hands on his 70th copy. Wow. what is the difference. The original was much better. I want you all to know that it originally makes a statement that existence has a purpose. It was really a Christian public who expressed her fear of paganism. If you delve deeper into it, it also makes notes on life, but I do not want to go into detail, just tell if you were disappointed and you would like to know how it should look, do not hesitate to watch the 70s version, a bit older but much better .
