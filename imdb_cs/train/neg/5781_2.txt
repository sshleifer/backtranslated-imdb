Roman Polanski has made many, many films that are incredible. His glory confused me. Nothing expresses itself as a climax, except in Chinatown (I have not seen "Knife in the Water" or "Tess"). Any contribution made more than 20 years ago; his work is just awkward, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, Ninth Gate, Pirates). R's Baby must end the device at the time she came out. It's a luxuriously produced and fairly high concept of the 1968 horror film (never to show the child). But this is just a miserable horror. Everything is okay that the conspiracy line is hopelessly clear very soon (Um, thanks for the title that destroyed the final), and on a clear day you can see that the end of twist is coming days. He did not keep my interest. I find that no matter what this movie might be, it is a total derailment of the sixties version of femininity. Farrow is such a chronically scattered, helpless woman / housewife. Her fragility is exaggerated ... in the extreme of an irritation. There are no real thoughts ... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. Dakota is barely exploited for this full potential.
