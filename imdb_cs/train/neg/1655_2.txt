This film really shows its age. The print I saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints. This was not a major problem with the film. The problem was that, although the film was shot in 1933, it was basically a silent film, which had the most popular way in the film, only scattered dialogues (just a few sentences). Sometimes the back of the figure turned or talked with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to cover their lips and "spasmodically" (?) They concealed the fact that the film was nicknamed. Well, its true that this Czech film will have to be dubbed in many languages, but this was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap. The film overall looked like a low budget and stupidity. It's really shame because there was a grain of a good story - a young woman who marries an elderly man who is either homosexual and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit up with this archaic mess. Although with a few naked (and somewhat dense) Hedy Lamarrys, this is not the reason why the film debuted when it debuted. Even under the 1933 standards, this film was a poorly made mud. The only interesting thing about the film is to find out how different Lamarr looked in 1933 when compared to the charming image Hollywood created when it came to America - it looks like a total of 2 completely different people. an incomplete, handsome and technically bad movie, I do not see how such ugly reviews have gone. Only for technical problems can the film not evaluate 10 or something similar.
