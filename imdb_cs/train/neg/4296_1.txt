I wanted to say that it was the worst gay movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say it's the worst movie if any genre I've ever seen. when the film starts with a "personal remark" from the director, and asks for the audience to "understand" the "many challenges" they face for the first time under the director's direction. The soundtrack is so bad in many scenes that it is almost impossible to watch a dialogue from a DVD version. Poor illumination, bad sets, bad photos, poor scenario, generally bad behavior are added to prevent this "film" from happening. After several attempts, I got to the wrong end and I immediately gave the DVD that I was fooling about. I'm sure there's a need to face the First Director. Do not, however, attempt this humble attempt at the final product. From IMDb details, I see it was not only Richard Natale's first attempt but also the only one. This is one positive thing I can say about this alleged "film."
