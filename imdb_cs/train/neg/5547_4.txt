REVOLT ZOMBIES (2 out of 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost predecessor of classical George A. Romer zombie flicks. This is a low-budget potboiler from 1936, which probably seems to be very cool for the audience of time ... but it seems to be routine today. In fact, it's a pretty good scene at the beginning of a soldier who fired a gun into a horda of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a close-up of the balls that entered the bare chest of one of them. The effect seems hopelessly fake today, but in 1936 I'm sure the story is about seeking mystery of mind control ... seemingly creating an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for one character to win the woman she loves. The film is barely an hour long, but it moves at the pace of a snail, so it seems to be a feature, believe me! It really is not much to recommend ... you can have some fun with the fake studio shot of the star "wading" over the "swamp". The end is interesting ... so I would say the movie is worth seeing at least once. More than likely to see this in addition to some cheap compilation "4 Movies on 1 DVD" at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth the money ...
