This unpleasant film has little recommendation. Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than this script or its other action movies allow. And there are occasional snippets of dialogue that suggest that the film might be able to provide some insight into the bizarre subculture. But not. The motives are either dark or sad. Most acting is partial. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director is an unnecessary fascination, focusing on the gore is disturbing. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who's the audience for this movie.
