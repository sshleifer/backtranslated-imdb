Dewaana, as a film, goes through the usual clich√©s. Man and woman fall in love and marry, husband is reportedly killed by a family friend who wants their family happiness, marriage, and surprising husband No.1 to reappear. The film reminds Chandni Yash Chopra and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan are doing well. Amrish Puri as a villain moves and is nothing but a standard villain from Bollywood. Nadeem Shravan's music is great, all the songs were great. My favorite are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi on koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that moves through.
