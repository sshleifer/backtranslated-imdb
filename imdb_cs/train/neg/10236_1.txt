Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before the legions of film purists crash into the latte, let me do it. Just as I enjoyed it, it's simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's certainly the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema (impressive assertion I remember when I saw Daredevil on the big screen). The two stories (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were, at best, totally unconvincing and absolutely horrible. Of course, they did not help with a scenario that had the same emotional depth as Daphne and Celeste's single, and a characterization that was as convincing as the defense in the Official Journal. The drawing (slightly expanded term) was thin to nonexistent, and the gore scenes, although undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculous. What conspiracy revolves around a twenty-man model (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, trapped and exposed to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The scenes of torture feel like disconnected sets, and the emphasis was placed directly on shocking rather than audacious shame. While this movie is really very little positive, its redeemed features are a lot of mistakes that make it such a terrible movie. I never heard a louder audience in the cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in the stitch and stayed all the way. From my side, I came out of a laugh, flooded with a movie that had risen to the top of an awful movie. No matter how you look at it, it's really a film success and a plan for future director wannabe, which details how to make a movie. <br /> <br /> I did not forget that I got into the movie for free ... so I can afford to laugh at it. I was still tempted to ask for the money back ... it was really bad.
