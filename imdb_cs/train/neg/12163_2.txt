Absolutely destroyed movie slasher has no redemption. She has a Angela camp nominee (Pamela Anderson, who is like a murderer, her jokes when leaving people, is not even fun) on a war journey that kills teenagers who behave the least bitterly, or defends her with a request for good behavior. We run a whole series of boring, killing clich√©s such as breaking a throat on one child looking for his Freddy clawed glove, a boy who gets a chain saw, a girl who is bumping, the one who puts it in the cloak (full of leeches), roasted , etc. <br /> <br /> He has no original idea to offer, and it's just a waste of time. That's unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's rings (playing Ally). Most violence is out of the screen, so it will not even satisfy you.
