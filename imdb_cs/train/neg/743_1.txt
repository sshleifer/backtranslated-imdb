Holy God omnipresent - powerful. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. Badly ... Mirror figure is the poorest thing I've seen a long time ago. This movie was more like Lord G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the film seemed to be done on a terrible green screen. My favorite part was when they were in a carriage, and you can say he's not a horse. They run from strange creatures and go around the same speed as fast jogging. Then he switches to a distant shot with an absurd CG horse. And CG generally seems to be under-par 1992 on "Outside the Eye". I mean, all the time, really. It seemed like a terrifying episode of Hercules, but without Kevin Sorbo to save the day. Worst. Film. At all.
