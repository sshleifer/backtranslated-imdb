Except for people who are probably buying into this waste! As the "Moral Eagle" shows, it turned out that even if you were trying to make the most outrageous, supernatural parody of evangelization that you might think would not be close to the joy of this show. It's hard to say what's going on when you watch it. Is this a news show? Talk show? Who knows!? They start by reporting different international stories, but in seemingly random places the message is interrupted by this special troll as a small man with a face larger than the whole face, mumbles and laughs, and is generally scary. > <br /> <br /> <br /> Pat Robertson does not even look at it at first glance. It looks like a senile but innocuous old kittens, which, in its archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents), is stored. But this is an assassin who did not care about his friends and gave no help to anyone but two murderous dictators who illegally used money for gifts for diamond mines that SUPPORTS forced abortion in China and which regularly implies that Caucasians (especially Americans of Caucasian Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races. Still, it would be funny, except that he seems to have a big fan base to keep his little show 40 years later (either that or enough money to bribe some TV directors who do not blame what they show ). The stupidity of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere have to watch and hang on to every word. Even though Robertson repeatedly showed how corrupt, people still listen to him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I think it's a healthy mixture of both.
