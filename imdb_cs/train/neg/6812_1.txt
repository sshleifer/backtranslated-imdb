from the beginning of this movie you will soon realize that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself because it would watch the naked woman the people are haunting in silly masks, the servants who run in the worst clothes I've ever seen and all in the headlines makes this kind of movie that you should think twice about seeing and as the film moves slowly after you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire, you have to wonder where the title comes from some parts of the movie a little sense with Pierre and he's the father, but as the film gets to its really stupid end, you have to think about why the film ended in this way and the unbelievers have a better end, although only there the head is not a movie,
