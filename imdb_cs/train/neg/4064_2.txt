This movie is extremely dull, tells the story of the petrol station owner and her life. Nothing ever happened. The director really "keeps it real" and feels like a camera around the woman around when he lives his life. I had to watch other films of this director on the class, others were not that boring. This movie was also watched for the task ... it is better to be boring with a good grade !! Overall, if not necessary, do not watch the movie. But do not reflect other films of this director because they are not so bad ... and do not recognize other discount films about Africa, they are usually good, especially when it's done by a Western director.
