for all the subtle charm that this student film can contain, was someone else bored of death waiting for WENDINGO to show his paper facial macho? <br /> <br /> Anti-climax has largely destroyed any kind of momentum, to develop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm all trying to explore America's Dark Underbelly, but it's a turd-and-flame that nods only observable for the fact that Mr. Clarkson looks crazy. <br /> <br /> Sadly, from the guy from the wings. <br /> <br /> The best 2 minutes movie offers. <br /> <br /> I felt as if DELIVERANCE had disappeared, you could do better.
