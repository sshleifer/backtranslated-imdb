I saw a trailer on this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, acting is laughter, strange effects (if you could say it), look like something that would not be outside the school game. Some characters are so stupid in this movie that you will find yourself on the screen for a while, which is unfortunately everywhere. As for the story, forget it. That's a warning, nothing to collect anything on this movie, it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If for some reason you like this movie watch Troll 2, you'll probably enjoy it as well.
