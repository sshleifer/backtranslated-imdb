This false path never comes close to responding to the joke and foolishness of the great adventure these guys have taken in their first film. This payment attempts to withdraw from its predecessor to capture some new blood from the joke, but it is a poor dexterity and does not go anywhere interesting or entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's almost half an hour to lose the guys doing a rock concert (and a lot of people watching the "free TV" - when did it happen?) The script writer could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied together and brought together with a scientific presentation. Not in this movie, which ended with a Bill & Ted license. The joke was over. Grim Reaper is worthy of mix for any reason. This infusion, as well as the whole plot, is done badly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement. There is a ZZ Top impression that is for no reason whatsoever. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
