While acting and directing could be argued as some merit - the story is a very bad wannabe film with Vietnam called Country simply changed. At least, for the film to hold some credibility, try to have some form of accuracy in devices, weapons and tactics. Do not forget the rough distortion of the soldiers' behavior as a standard. In addition to limited use as a stupid propaganda about South African Defense Force, it serves little purpose - certainly no value of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Aspirational filmmakers - this is a way to make a war movie. Do some research and you are proud of your product.
