This film is about a group of extra-terrestrial homosexual men smashing women on Earth to create a cosmic universe. I watched it with the intention of seeing how bad it was. Still, I was shocked by how bad she was. It looked more like a movie 50 years ago. The act, if any, is very bad. Sets and props are so ridiculously fake, so any college film looks like a mega budget. The special effects are ridiculously simple, and indeed the jaw drops as others have commented, but the jaw looks embarrassed. One must be heavily drunk or altered in consciousness to appreciate this film. If I were from Denmark, I would be very embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen had created such a dreadfully bad film.
