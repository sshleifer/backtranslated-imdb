I saw this movie two weeks ago at the des nouvelles images du japon festival in Paris. Although I did not expect much from this, I must say that I was disappointed just like many people in the audience ... If I wanted to summarize how I felt, I would say I compared it to the princess mononoke and nausikaa from start to finish. Of course it's stupid. But I could not help him. Stories are totally different, but the worlds in the picture are very similar. And from this point of view, the "palm tree" certainly can not stand in comparison with the masterpiece of Miyazaki. Even if it's technically good enough, it's boring ... eventually a complete lack of originality will make me advise you not to look at it. I rated 2 out of 10 (a bit rough, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
