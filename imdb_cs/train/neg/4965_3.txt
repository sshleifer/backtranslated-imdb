For such a great classic story, environment (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame a scenario that was totally devoid of dramatic tension. The story of the club story is useful and gave a new look to literary classics. For some strange reason, the rubric was launched early. To know that it was shot in 21 days, she tells me "hurled" and unfortunately it shows. Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I'm talking about FX, I can tolerate a really miserable CGI, but the script has to rock and this was too slow, spartan and lacking drama. I would blame it on the actors, but ... because I know I'm writing more than playing, I'm choosing my colleague.
