I do not think this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I expected something good, but Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this one. It was very old-fashioned. At every stage of this film I was hoping for some surgery and what to get? The girl gets burned and her love aunt wins. <br /> <br /> Despite being involved, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so shameful after so many meetings. I expected my aunt to be much brutal than that. All she did was madness. <br /> <br /> Hey, we also have kids, but we do not watch them and we always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. A happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws, and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride and now it's the opposite. And I knew somehow that Mohn Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I'm convinced that I'm a waste of time. I give it 2/10.
