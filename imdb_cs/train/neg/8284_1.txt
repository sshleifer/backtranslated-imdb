Who wrote that? Some guy named John Cohen. I think this was the first scenario he ever worked on. Someone should tell him that you are going to write a dialogue that sounds like something somebody could say. And who did it? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut fell far from the tree. Someone might want to announce that you can actually shoot a New York taxi scene and it will look real and you will not have to fake the blue screen for no reason. She would also like to know that she should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully she learned this lesson. And Jessica Simpson ... of course she can not act. Hell, Jessica Alba looks like Audry Hepburn, and still plays in this movie. Oh wait, she was her father. Okay, so she got some. That's really the only reason I think. So I should be surprised that it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would be if they saw as much as I did. I think you expect the movie with Jessica Simpson to be bad, but ... it's not just bad, it's the opposite of the classic movie. Think of Woody Allen's great movie, this movie is just as bad as the movie is good. It's Anti-Annie Hall. I'm so glad I did not see it, I stopped watching for ten minutes because I could not go on. I have no doubt to leave the theater earlier. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it at the theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts ridiculously wrong, and then it goes so badly to become some kind of Chinese water torture. And then, when the first act ends, you realize that it will only get worse, and that is when you either have to leave or be killed. In the end, this movie gets into the category that it would be bad, it should be instead of the Guantanamo Bay Reservoir. Although some prefer a water tank.
