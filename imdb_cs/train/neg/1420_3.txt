[I saw this movie one late at a public television station so I do not know if it's on video or not.] This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple in the early 1930s. It's hard to believe that someone would let their daughter be in this tiny little movie that could be considered as a "child porn" today. Shirley Temple plays in a movie that is likely to have a mean age of 5 years. They are all in their diapers and are in a salon where milk serves instead of alcohol. "Cash" is a lollipop. Shirley plays "femme fatale", talking to the bar and talking about soldiers talking about her (!). But Shirley does not really need their lollipops / cash because her wallet is full of those from other "men." Meanwhile, a tiny black boy makes suggestive dance on a nearby table (!). </ br /> <br /> What a strange movie. . . infants using a deliberate dialogue playing adult roles in the lounge. Who did these things think in any way?
