It was over 80 minutes partly unexpected boredom. First, I wondered how it could be done. Then I reached the 70th minute and I convinced it was only a few minutes and I lasted until the very end, which I am very proud of when I consider this film to be a great test for human patience and tolerance. Was it really worth watching it? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test, try to try it out, and if you have a strong will, you can even endure to the end ... The film lacks coherence and the characters apparently have no common sense. All the stuff in the movie, you can be sure you've seen somewhere and it seems that they are only included for filming this film.
