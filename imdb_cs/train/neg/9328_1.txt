I am happy! I got a full peak in this miserable short film shooting in Texas's "horror" flaw from Artisan Entertainment a week before getting into the shelf and letting me tell you ... I rarely laughed as gently as I watched this cruel megabombo leave the railing and steal the title of "the worst clowning clown movie ever made" from an unbearably stupid fiasco Full Moon KILLJOY (I'm sure many of us fans of horror have suffered this!) Of all the data it was filmed on DV it really does not "look" all bad quality for digital, but the boy sometimes fails in every other area where it counts! The story (mild (Ken Hebert, who also wrote and collaborated with the director), takes the skeptical collaborator Tracy (Amanda Watson) and the horny married couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) together with a weekend escape into a secluded cabin 12 kilometers from the nearest town (Melissa Bale), which ends at a place where a night story about murderous clown camps appears, which haunts the same forested area when each of the pot-smokin "friends" disappears one after The clown killer does not appear in the movie until the end and it does not look like a demonic display on the camcorder (except morbidly obese), basically spending an hour in the woods, chopping wood and crazy I can not say enough bad stuff about casting, especially about two guys and hitchhikers who either deliver their neu orderly dialogue with a minimum of enthusiasm, or moving in the worst of times. It does not really help the script to be totally and completely rid of tension, originality, intelligence, general consistency or humor. I could continue the days after this film is awkward, how many mistakes of continuity it is, and how amateur the whole production is, but I simply nod to point out that the whole package is quite a revolt in Boy-This- It's going too. <br /> <br /> I also note that the movie was released in the US as SICK (INSANE CLOWN KILLER). Currently it is cataloged under its (formerly named) GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
