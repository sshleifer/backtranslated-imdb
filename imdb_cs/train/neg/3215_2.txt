The film has one boring scene: The man sitting on the edge of the bed with his exposed genitals in the middle of the screen. It's a pretty long scene. What was the reason? I almost suppose it was funny, but we watched it with my mother and it was not fun to have us look at what looked like a minute. The film is cold. None of the characters ever feel. Audrey Tatou is of course cute, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> This film did not really recommend. I expected it to be charming and fresh, but it was depressing. I wondered if the director came from the very top bark, educates the French family and looks at these figures. <br /> <br />
