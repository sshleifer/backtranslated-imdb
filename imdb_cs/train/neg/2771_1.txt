The film was to be featured here in Bangkok with all fans and even in the theater, it failed unsuccessfully. It seems the story writer simply does not hold water. Something was missing. In my view, people have to have a reason why they look at it other than a historical view of the past. The accuracy of history is not what we are looking for in entertainment. The film simply lacks any substance. The only way to make this film right was to change in some way where it is like a legend instead of just a story. And the legend will have some elements that will try to say something people have forgotten for a long time, such as the meaning of the victim, nationalism, etc. This is called the central theme. The movie will fail to watch it? At least some strange legendary flying elephants, a psychic king, or an eccentric king like "King and I" would be beautiful, something would add to the appeal of the film. I think there is no other appeal than plain vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you get an appeal, then the story is another thing to focus on. From a marketing point of view, we call it "must see". When listening to the title of the film, people would say, "Oh, I have to see it Now, where is the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just repeat the title and call it" How can not you be a king? "And make a black comedy of old Siamese days, . Strangelove. "It would be much more interesting, stories similar to those of the King from the first people would be fun to the movies. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have to" see "appeals such as Spiderman, these titles speak for themselves.If they do not have any known letters, some other films, such as the Island, have themselves appealed when they ask, "Do you still believe there is an island?" or for film , entitled "How Can not Be a King", could ask the question: "So you still want to be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
