Years ago, I saw the Godfather, and it worked on me for the first time, the atmosphere of the film was first class, acting and classical. I recently bought the Trilogy, and after watching Part 1 I was nervously looking at Part 2 ...... I was so glad I realized that he knew at the beginning of the second part he was perfect and could not wait until I see the Godfather III ........ OVERHEAD! I wish I stopped at II. The story was not good, it seemed like a story that was created just to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacin's protected person was a weak character who would be alive at Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes like Corleone were invested with all the heads of the Catholic church with full choir, a horse killer going to sunset, an invisible helicopter, a machine gun sitting (where " goodies "get away and everyone else is shot) daughter and 1st cousin rings on pasta overboard, pathetic shootings on stairs ..... Corleone fills sweets with him orange juice for diabetes (man of his intelligence and guille is not ready for an emergency situation?) ... NO, it was not good and with the best will in the world that it would no longer be able to track it again. But I will follow 1 and 2 many times after years.
