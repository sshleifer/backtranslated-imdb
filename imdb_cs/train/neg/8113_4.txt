POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE MOTOR COMPANY **; RECEIVING COPIES POPEYE ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I walk like a kid but catch an episode of a series of three cartoons back and forth, ie, a few years later (preceded by the theater screening of the pirated yarn RAIDERY SEVEN SEAS [1953] ), I see how they can not keep it all! The character of Popeye is not exactly sympathetic, Olive Oyle is clearly exaggerated, and Blut's anger has not caused much interest. In short, the scripts were disturbingly thin, rather awful and generally not working for booting. They are strictly juvenile, but I doubt that today's children will suffer from sticking to them! Moreover, the animation style is unattractive. Every short one in itself, I think it has improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, did one adapt to its average quality as it was, so the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the plot? Popeye is in charge of a Maskot army goat, whose enormous appetite causes him no evil extinction (somewhat original, I know, but always fun). One interesting feature was that the shorts were conserved with Popey, who made moralistic bits of wisdom for children in the audience.
