Ok, so here is the basic graph. It's 1933, Peter Sellers is Doctor Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who lives for quite a while. The film opens with a birthday party where he celebrates drinking a special elixir, which (although he never mentioned the movie) prolongs his life. On this occasion, the elixir is overwhelmed by an assistant (Kato if you remember Pink Panther movies) and ordering his guides to find 6 rare things to give them an elixir. This creates a global hunt for a man in which his henchmen chop off the diamond museums and drove to London to meet dr. Fu's nemisisem, officer detective Scotland Yard Nayland Smith, who also starred Sellers, who is trying to stop what he supposes to be a funny comic adventure. This was probably Sellers's last feature-length feature film that he did before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Retailers who are such a talented comic and have unforgettable "fun" roles in Panther and partly in the movie "Party" are something that is in this movie. This movie was absolutely tortuous and I could not finish it. He completely dies and I kept myself watching the Sellers performance. After the great work "Be there" a year ago, how do I know how it can do and how did this matter even get? As one person mentioned the first 10..15 minutes are fine, but then it is ALL DOWNHILL ... <br /> <br /> Avoid an epidemic. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 out of 10.
