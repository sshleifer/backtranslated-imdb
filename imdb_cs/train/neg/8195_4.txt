Every Christmas Eve I make my children hold on to another show that it's a beautiful life. I also enjoyed Bad Santa. So judge me. I admit it. I like harsh, rocky movies. I also like excellent, intelligent, but like so many things, the variety is a good thing. What will be the Christmas season without an annual film ka-ching ka-ching Santa in all its forms, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus no one will forget about Bedford Falls, but I do not believe that the Christmas film would have to reach iconic characters to succeed. "Fred" is a perfectly blank film with enough adult humor and enough charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, although most of the humor was obvious and Vince was Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top santa who helped a lot. It's not a big movie and it's unlikely to become a necessity for every annual Christmas tradition. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was, a holiday schmaltz with a little spice spread. There is nothing wrong with it.
