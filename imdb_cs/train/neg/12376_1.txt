This collection is really upset! <br /> <br /> I rented it because I thought I'd really enjoy some good fighting. Man suck! Fast crazy cuts, extremely annoying loudspeaker, and fighting against each other have been heavily modified and truncated (I think above all to fight Jet Li in leg fists and fight with Jackie Chan from drunken Master 2). > <br /> And what is the deal with those guards with street guards? What's so cool about it? I saw more interesting fighting against Marshal law! <br /> <br /> This stupid collection of cuts for silly people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not encourage people who have done these bulls to make more of it crap! Instead, go buy movies that fought and fought in their outstanding glory!
