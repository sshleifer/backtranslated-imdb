You have to be kidding !!!! Let's realize that Parker Posey is actually an actress, and not just an admission to the actors' mooncloth. Indeed, if that did not mean that David Mamet - a sharp dialogue that was delivered alternately at the speed of a machine gun or monotonous (thinks that Ben Stein) is not clear - or a flat dry comedy; this film must go to the Rotten Tomato - or worse. <br /> <br /> As if Posey's rigid and inconvenient was not enough, we have the harder and more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There's more wood in this movie than a tooth factory. <br /> <br /> Adding to this already bizarre casting are a few other roles that are populated by unforgettable actors who look or sound like an escape from the American Model Next Top Model, Don Pardo or even a boy who pronounces the word "was" as a "bean" that brings our attention to the fact that there is so little about this film, we analyze its accent to see whether it is Canadian or not !! I think I laughed heartily at the places to be serious and took seriously the troops to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like the Alarik Jans cartoon for Mamet "The House of Games." If it is taken as a spoof, the film is almost droll; if it is taken seriously, only self-conscious screaming.
