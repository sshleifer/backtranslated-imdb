When Stanwyck's husband is deserted on the eve of their wedding, he retreats to a mountain cabin where he slides off the cliff and is rescued by rich lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, which leads to a uniquely unmarried marriage, spent at a gigantic headquarters in Chicago (which appears to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted to crash Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan, in a very subdued and unconvincing story. This movie has a great acting acting career (especially Morgan is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is meandered and seems unnecessary at times. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but in the end I was disappointed. It's still worth watching the cast and it's good for anyone who likes movies in 1930.
