"Stella", which plays Bette Midler in the title role, is an incredible tearjerker. Stella Claire, located in northern New York, works as a nightclub, pours and dancing in a work salon. One night when it comes to the falling intern, Stephen Dallas, who has Stella inside, and impregnates her during her affair. She rejects both his marriage offerings and abortion, sends her pack to a lucrative medical career, and raises her daughter near poverty. Flashing forward for 16 years and her daughter grew into a beautiful loving young lady. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, he still keeps a tiny but caring relationship with his daughter and ... I'm harsh and even worse, making the movie sound somewhat interesting. The acting and screenwriting films are so convincing that you will go out in almost every scene. The main offender is Bette Midler, but John Goodman is her as her alcoholic. Each scene looks much more than the previous one to the final, which is really a horn. This image is considered a dramatic bit, but does not apply as a D grade, but as a camp is an unintentional B + score. <br /> <br />
