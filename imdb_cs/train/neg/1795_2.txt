I had the opportunity to see this movie as a test audience and the only thing that kept me in place was the opportunity to complete the survey. I felt the biggest problem with the film was the lack of a major conspiracy. Instead, it was composed of (too) many sub-areas that compete for on-screen time. As a result, this is not the only character that is sufficiently developed to create any kind of attachment for the audience. What the director and the producer could not do was to show us why we should take care of what happens to the characters. In fact, some sub-plot and characters associated with it could be completely removed without serious damage to the film. (The time allowed would allow for the much needed development of the remaining partial charts and characters.) Simply put, the board of the Hungry Bachelors Club is crowded with attachments and appetizers when an entre is required.
