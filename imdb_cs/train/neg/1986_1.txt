Must agree with other reviewers. This must be the BEST movie, let alone the west I've ever seen. Scary acting, a dialogue that was unthinkable and miserable (let alone totally inappropriate for allegedly in the 1800s), and oh, did I mention the accumulator that is visibly visible on the back of one of the characters? I waited for the microphone to fall into the scene. And the end? At least I can say it was in line with the rest of the movie ... absolutely terrible. And yes, it contained every cliche in the book from a slow walk on an empty dusty path to a "remember when" laugh when the main character dies. Fortunately, I saw it on free TV. Do not waste time.
