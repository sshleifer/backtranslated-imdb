This is a really horrible movie. I only write it in a way that some people postpone some observation somewhere. If I stopped one person to lose part of my precious life watching this movie, I will die happily. <br /> <br /> Unusually boring, though since the stars of Al Pacino disappointed me, I thought that at any moment something interesting is going to happen. Then the credits unfolded, and I realized that I had completely deceived myself to watch this incredible sound. I can not believe that this movie has achieved the same high score as IMDb (more than 5 stars when I last saw the vote). Are you people who vote ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please do not search for this movie!
