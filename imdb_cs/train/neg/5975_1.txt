I never wanted to see this movie, then one day, the joke that I watched to see how bad it was; my prejudices have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> I'd like to start by questioning the politics of the movie. This is hidden behind the mask of women who are big in the city, "but the only way women can do it is to hide their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills.This women are no more girls, they are a little less attractive girls it is not the only right-wing message of the film, there are hundreds of footage of American flags and a huge amount of money.A good example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and something of spiritual, moral or artistic value can not even look at this The director of the bar says he does not allow the drug user in his bar and then goes to the poor gallons of hard liqueur his own neck and then the necks of his employees and customers Anyone who knows anything about the narcotics will know that alcohol can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most people Finally, why are the scenes in which the main character is the point of sexual interest in the audience (when she undresses or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We look at her as she stretches her camera to practically stroke her legs while she is the phone for her father. He will buy his father just as he "buys" his friend. I think it is most strange. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is immortal, fascist, degrading to women, and genuinely disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
