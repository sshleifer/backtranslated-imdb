It is clear that Ride (1998) from Hideo Nakato and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (2002), with the hints of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but cruelly doing a gore (a green corpse with red eyes! a weak motif (I find it very difficult to find scary picture messages). In this movie, I had two moments that shook me, both of which contained an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, one this time in 1999) kept throwing me after hours when I saw it and all the movies this stealing from I was really scary, I can not see this movie as anything but to sell the western popularity of the great Japanese horror films. Two out of ten.
