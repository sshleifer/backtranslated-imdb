The fifth "black Emanuelle" I've been watching has the potentially most interesting imagination that deals with what she does with a fearless reporter investigating a white slave / prostitution missile that takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macau and back to her own hometown , New York! The film is filled with the past veterans of the series, who inexplicably play very different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (as a member of the Third World Committee of the UN Committee), Karin Shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (as Rassimov's chauffeur). Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite being depicted in the dead days), it is heavily modified and in particular a graphic scene (described in Stracultr), in which an Asian slave businessman receives his flavors by being sodomized by a dog , but it is not to be seen here anyway, but the horrific sequence is late in the movie when a dirty politician is tricing a couple of girls (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert) in a midnight meeting under a new bridge in New York with a group of burns (that's the way they get their voices , you get it!) - with top pals looking at him - looks quite intact. The most advanced element of this entry - besides Gems It's her excursion to India to talk to the queen / guru (George Eastman made to look very much like Christ!) who found the way to get into the house (even before the perfect aliens) to prolong the coitus for an indefinite period; apparently, when Emanuelle calls him, he will end up with premature ejaculation ... !!
