Please do not waste your time. This film reflects on the worst of Dracula Bram Stoker (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and silly biblical references), and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like Vampire movies and novels, and there are many there that are very good. But not this glowing. Even the soundtrack does not help, mostly because the film decides rather funny classical music than "metal downhill". Just a few times I heard some metal; they were mostly tortured violins. Avoid it as a garlic and a cross.
