He has a bad dialogue wrong done in a meandering and terrible story. <br /> <br /> As well as disappointing as art, it's even worse as a business. Who could be the target market for this target? What age group? What interest group? Someone should make a film about how and why he made the film. That I would pay for seeing it. I saw thousands of bad movies, and it ranks with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choice as the three most unbearably bad films I've ever seen. Everyone connected with him should be forced to talk to VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I invite you. Watch this movie and do the academic exercise - how could you do it and get worse? I can not think of one way.
