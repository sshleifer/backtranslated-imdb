In the days before the Avenger Toxicity, the low-camp kings in Troma Films tried to take a high (OK, a bit less-low) path to producing straight-line slideshows. I'd like to think that when you look at the results, it's what persuaded them to give up all the prejudices and go for a confident parody. <br /> <br /> Splatter University is another movie for masochists in the audience. Turning around two separate casts and countless unnecessary subplots is really painful to watch. Let's see if I can summarize. <br /> <br /> After I discovered that a dangerous psychopath escaped from a local hospital, it is a Catholic university (I do not remember the name, but in honor of the title, we call it St. Splatter). Students are carefree and sorry and quarrels with others, prematurely premature. Meanwhile, the new professor, Julie Parker, proves to be completely incompetent. Children deal with relationships, unbelief, undesirable pregnancies, condescending priests and how to avoid working in class; Julie deals with a spooky friend, inflexible control of St. Splatter, counseling the immodest mothers, and the empty, blunt view of her students. None of this means that it would be a sad thing, or it would solve in a meaningful way. And every moment the POV comes shot and kills one of the girls to death, but do not hold the breath waiting for it. There's a Red Herring Killer, and then a sad anti-climatic confrontation with Real Killer, then back to credit and credit. The slow pace and many inhaled subplots seem almost to be calculated, frustration in the viewer, who helped them along with torn adjustments, the quality of coffee sound, and a dialogue that simply makes no sense. And the most painful thing about this movie is murderous fixation on women - the men in this movie are just deserving. I got some good money to see someone from a madman with a pregnant girlfriend or a puppetman Lotharior who crazy around with a roommate or a spooky priest. There is no justice.
