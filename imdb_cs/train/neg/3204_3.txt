While not as bad as it was that I (I've seen much worse), it's still a very lame movie. Basically, it's Reog Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff," with the main difference that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than Joe Don Baker, an unpleasant actor if there was one. Venantino Venantini is great (and great fun) as a bad guy, like a budget Vittorio Gassman. It is the main reason why this steampilik is sitting because the rest of the cast gives the most horrible acting, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe that once he was a romantic guy (watch "Mondo Cane" to see him run away from women). We look here as the second layer of Ben Gazzar, but nothing can be done. It's all the show Joe Don, unfortunately. And it all came into generic 80 "action movies" that could not be boring. Greydon Clark can do good B-movies ("No Warning"), but here he travels, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the places in Malta were nice and Venantini is trying to save the day. 3/10.
