Alone in the Dark is one of my most popular roles. I remember spending the whole night in front of the computer screen, trying to escape from the castle and really surprised at the time when the monsters were surprisingly charging. Now, you think - I'm tired of "computer-generated" movies. I do not remember a story of success in this new Hollywood genre, though some are fun enough to be observable. And yet I'm such a big fan of the game that I could not resist. My reasoning was that if the film had a plot that resembled the game, it would be okay. <br /> <br /> Man, it was 90 minutes (which seemed to me 300) of my life that I would never come back. If I had the chance, I'd rather let them edit my drawer instead. It's not even in the "so bad it's fun" category. You think Christian Slater had a little more sense than to join this crazy bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I did not complain about her presence. However, if this cat is to play a major role in having a sexual scene - I fully understand and support (hey, I am a guy!) - I've seen more of her body at a press conference. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to talk about. You will not waste your time by throwing it. The credibility of the story drops below "I did not want sex with Mrs. Lewinsky." These are a few cuts over "Street Fighter", which is by the way one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I would recommend this. <br /> <br /> Children I recommend Video game. He has a much better story, acting and much more excitement. As for the movie, here is the spoiler - it STINKS! Wait for the porn version.
