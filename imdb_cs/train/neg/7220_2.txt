Where do they get the money to shoot such movies? I think there is nothing to buy about this movie. None of the actors are known, the writing is horrible, the photo is blurred, the story stretches between the bad version of the repo man and western nicklodeon, and the acting is incredible. For someone watching all sorts of movies, good and bad, I have to admit that this movie is the worst thing I've seen since the attack of eye people in the 1950s. I really do not like to destroy the efforts of people trying to create some fun or heaven to ban art, but it seems like this film does not like anyone. The story bends with the mystical contamination of a man who is the wrong version of the Celtic soul, though it works more like a male succubus without a sexual subtext. Thieves have to get in touch with good people in the city, from where they can not escape. Take it from here, and it is unfortunately the best. My advice is that if you are not in bad mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing acting and boring settings, you'll best serve by leaving this on a shelf when you hire a rental of videos.
