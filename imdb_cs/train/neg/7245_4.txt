I'm not interested in The Pallbearer, it's not bad, but at that time it's pretty slow. As the film continues, it's a bit more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a huge fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but sometimes I do not mind and she's okay. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the lead, you can enjoy it.
