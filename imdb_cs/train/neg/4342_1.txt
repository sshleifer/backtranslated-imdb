I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a pretty good story, but he went on so badly. At first, casting everything is wrong, where does the van peeble (crazy actor btw) and swollen dad come from? Looks like Carlito has come out of his hood and used to some real idiots. This film does not make "Carlitos Way" any justice. I'm so happy that the Carlito's Way first went on, if I first saw this waste, I would never let the pacino version come true. And anyway, pacino is supposed to read this story, thinking it was stupid, and then went on. Carlit's Way: Rise to Power - 1 of 10. Carlit's Way - 9 of 10.
