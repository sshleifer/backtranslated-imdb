I love Alec Guinness. That's what he's been saying a lot after this movie. Actually, it's not bad. It seems to stand aside, it's urban and its usual gorgeous self, but it invests bounty. It is obvious that the girl she meets is full, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sire Alec would not have chosen her when he was young and obviously not happy now. An interesting figure is the born brother of the strange "Suzanne", another twitch. "Donald" is trying to be French Heathcliffe, and I was awfully sorry for the source of his secret. What deep dark secret was hiding behind? Was he in love with his father's lord? Why did Suzanne uproot her hair by trying to transfer the disparate parts of this turkey to a country house? Or maybe he had enough of his unpleasant behavior. The film would be charming with Guiness and the "older woman" who remembers and visits Paris together. That would be a great story! Two dear experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why did not someone come up with it? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in "The Card", which is a little-known movie that's worth it.
