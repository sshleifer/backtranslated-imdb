Dreyfuss plays the boss of the crowd, who has lost his mind but is now "repaired". Lane is his girlfriend who is just struggling with her first number (Goldblum), which has something to do with Lara's sister (Barkin). (Burt) Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan, and even Richard Pryor's performance) can not help this conspiracy because Dreyfuss proves he is not "fixed" and tries to kill just about everything in sight. , it's not like you do not know what's coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what he's worth when Dreyfuss gets, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie. this movie is because I recently went to Diane Lane and tried to see all of her films. The real celebrations for me were not just a terrible plot, but also the fact that it did not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the film (although we hear about it all). Even a fan of more than half a shot can not help me enjoy this movie. The parts to which the wall unit was to be mounted caused me to see what was happening. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 stars.
