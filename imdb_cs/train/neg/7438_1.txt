This movie is a complete waste of time, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is terrible. The acting performance is fine, but the actors have absolutely no record or script to work with. Photos and some special effects are fine, but it's not interesting to watch again in this movie again. There is no logical progression to the story, the story line is utter nonsense. It's not scary. For the film to be frightening, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This movie has no credibility. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Every character is shallow and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most special effects and make-up work are both poorly made or at least average. I hope you read it and do not waste your time on this movie if you are curious to see a really horrible movie.
