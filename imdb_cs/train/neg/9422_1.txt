This film describes the experiences of a couple of men (one of them Burt Reynolds), prostitutes and two drag queens in a few hours a night in Miami. Conversing stories eventually bring all people to one place and time. The film was fun, but the big problem was that everything happened at night, and many scenes were virtually underexposed to the point where it was impossible to see what was going on. In several scenes you can actually see where they were trying to "stretch" the development process for storing pictures. Someone did not know how to operate the camcorder. Amazing that this movie was even released!
