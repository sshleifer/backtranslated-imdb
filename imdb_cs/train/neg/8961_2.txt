This movie was another waste of time ... Why then, why do I have to accumulate like this? ... someone please tell me ... * Say * Oh, okay. back to the movie: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie (just like me) and I wanted to look at what is happening in the last (perhaps) movie, the actors and screenwriters are working, then of course movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie with a good actor and a fantastic plot ... * bad smile * then this movie is for you definitely :-D .... OK lie ... Best of the movie is upset. OK, I have to admit that some of the elements were great .. well .. coolish ... and I laughed a few times, they went through the wrong things, but I was amused. :-) But in all the few things that hardly make the category "ok", it's not enough for the film to be worth it at all. If you do not count "Manos - the Hand of Destiny," one of ten best EVER movies!
