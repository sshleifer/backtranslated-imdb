This film proves that good acting comes from a good direction, and it did not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor, but he is a teenager. Donald Sutherland encounters an amateur. Why? Because the script is horrible, the adaptation is awful and the actors seem to be bored and half heart. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it's over and I turned it off in half. The director did a very bad job, and although I did not read the novel, it's definitely a missed chance. The atmosphere that this movie tries to evoke, and the message and never will never reach the audience. In a word, it's a TERRIBLE movie.
