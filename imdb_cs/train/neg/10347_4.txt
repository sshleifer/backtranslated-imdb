I just saw that Adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that I believed that the model of Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons was being used. They were about the same age as the four guys in this movie. Warner Baxter, in his painting, Adam Stoddard, talked about the same values ​​and family traditions you would have heard from our 26th President, without realizing some of the more peculiar aspects of the TR character. Like TR, all of Stoddard's sons are serving in World War I, in this case even if the youngest one just loses his eye instead of killing him. <br /> <br /> But what if a woman minx gets into this all male households and breaks things up? That's Susan Hayward's job. In one of her most important roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son, has a relationship with another and starts playing the third. She is soon ancestor of such a part that later brought her an Oscar. "" I suppose that with such a powerful model of decore as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter's portraits, everyone is afraid the father will tell what is going on. Sons and their governor, Ingrid Bergman. Here's where some stupid things happen. Bergman will introduce us as an educator hired by Baxter and his wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray died and Baxter suffered some financial reversals in business. Bergman must be released. She goes back to France, and years later she returns to her family when her children grow up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but I can not believe that children now need a governess. Hayward is absolutely right when she comes up with her that the children did not come back. Under normal circumstances, Bergman would get to life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the movie I had was edited. Maybe it may be the reason for the many holes that we have. <br /> <br /> It is wrong that Ingrid and Susan could not make another movie together in the 1950s when Hayward was at its height and Bergman just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason why Adam had four sons. And I'm willing to believe that a lot of Ingrid remained in the bed of the bed.
