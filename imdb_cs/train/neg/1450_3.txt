If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, read the WWI history, not the history of the Second World War. Find out what happened during the war, how the soldiers had to live dead bodies. How so many soldiers went crazy, what they saw during World War I, when they called them "shells," now called post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the real horrors of World War I, you will begin to understand Hitler. You understand how a human being can be despondent to death, not because it's bad, but because it's the only way to deal with the horrors around him. Unfortunately, this movie lost it, because so many more. Read some books on this topic and you should look at the movie "The Way of Fame", the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in this film, the sense of helplessness and the total devaluation of human life, as nothing more than bullets. <br /> <br /> What this film lacks is really the key to pointing to Germany's understanding. The loss of war, when millions and millions of Germans have lost their lives, without a real reason. Then comes the complete economic collapse after the war. These are the factors that create extremism. Loss of family members and massive poverty always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors and just became another throwing piece of crap that threw a pile. With really no real value there are fictional films based on fictional characters that would give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than about it. They just threw Hitler's name to sell more.
