I will not move with the obvious peterbogdanic deficiencies of the TLPS. Instead, I look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygm of the film. 1. Peter Bogdanoviƒç managed to make a film that can be fully exploited. This fact itself will put the film high up and all the way to the top of its lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich showed how amazingly generous to be some happy friends when sharing a fabulous body and breasts with Cybill Shepherd's (his pak-gal) with his male audience - and not just one but on two occasions. Brave! The undisputable peaks of this cinematographic fiesta del siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. The TLPS barely has a scene without stereotyped country music in the background. (Peter tried to point out that the movie is located in the American Deep South (as if it were not clear), so he did it, and how can it be an advantage? Ask When the film finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases to massage your tired ear drum, you start experiencing a special thrill: "The movie is finally over!" It's pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives hope to all women who look like Cloris Leachman. one day to get a much younger and perhaps a nice looking friend Cologis Leachman's biography (which I realize is not technically a part of the TLPS) gives hope to all women who look like that they can one day win the Miss Beauty contest. (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, which saved us the sight of Cloris Leachman's face in his original, natural immobility.
