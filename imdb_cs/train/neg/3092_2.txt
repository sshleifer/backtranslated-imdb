If the films like Ghoulies tear away from the Gremlins, then the Hobgoblins sink into a new cliff where garbage is thrown like Ghoulies. These barely animated furbies have some way of fulfilling fantasies (which include sexual dreams of essentially grotesque characters - oh joy), but what has to do with anything is to guess, except that the director has made his kinky hobby for erotic. They point it out in the 8th circle of hell, one has suspicions. There is no real plot - just "throttles - kill!" and humorous attempts at humor and a mild attempt to challenge spectators.
