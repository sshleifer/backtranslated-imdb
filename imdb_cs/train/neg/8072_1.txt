(Possible Spoiler or Two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is quite possibly the worst theatrical release movie ever. Nothing makes sense, there's some plot about a girl who has strange ideas about people who may or may not be dead. The entire movie is just a lot of random shots of things that do not get involved in the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There's no acting, working with the camera is jerky and the script is so confused that it just makes the movie even harder to watch. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to connect the movie together, but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
