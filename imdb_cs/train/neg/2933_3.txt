If you read a book - do not set your hopes high if you do not - read it and never watch the movie. It is strange to learn that Toby Young really did a lot of writing scripts (as he says in the post-graduate book). Because the film is very different from the book. It seems that the film seems to be trying to think more of a provocative and entertaining work that combines philosophical thoughts with simple funny sarcasm and simplifies it so to understand it - it achieves with perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suited to the sitcom and lost some meaningful message he could have. You're better than not to see.
