I can not tell you how angry I was when I saw this movie. Characters are not the least interesting and there is no action. So, after waiting for the lives of these people, they hoped that the last two and a half hours would lead to some important goal, what would we get ??? Frog Storm. Now, I understand the references to the Exodus and the basic subject, but first there was absolutely no solution, and the second would be lost to anyone who did not read the Bible (a significant part of the population) or Charles Fort (much more). As a somewhat well-read person, I thought this film was obviously a bad imitation of the Seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Do not collect time. It would be better to spend reading ... <br /> <br /> ... nothing to think about being honest
