Ouch! They do not come much worse than the terrible adaptation of the beloved C. S. Lewis novel. While adaptation is very true to the novel, acting is simply horrible, and sets and special effects are the equivalent of school games. I read that the budget for this miniseries was the largest that the BBC ever put at that time, but certainly could put together a bit more than $ 2 that it looks like it was shot. The worst effect is Mr. Beaver. I know that computer effects were not at the level necessary or even cost-effective at the time, but the costume business in the suit was scary. It is better if you just reduced the figure out of the movie than that role! Avoid it at all costs.
