I saw all four movies in this series. Everybody gets rid of books. That's the worst yet. My problem is that it does not touch a book that is named after a way! The directors and producers should have named something other than "Love is joyful joy". The only thing about this movie remotely resembles the book is the names of some characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Names / age groups / children's gender are incorrect. The whole story line is not where it's in the book. I find it very damaging that Janette Oke, her books and her fans produce a film under her name, which is by no means the right one. Music is too loud. Actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, it can do it. It's clean. But do not look at it if you are hoping for the shortened version of the book. I hope it will be the last movie in this series, but I doubt it. If there are more films, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others come close to the original stories and stories. Books are excellent and, if carefully watched, they will make great movies!
