I just picked up this movie for a short while at the National Wholesale Liquidators and after watching it, I feel like I was torn. I do not know I saw a worse movie than this one. Honestly. And I would never describe a negative review of the film if I did not have so much respect for the subject, that's Stephen Foster and his music. First, what is it? Is it a musical biography? Yeah, a lot of Foster's melodies then scattered here and there are those pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kernov numbers that emit more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, someone has been paid to write this disgrace? Second, the real story of Foster is fascinating. Why not join it at all? Thirdly, what did they have to do with Ray Middleton to make him shoot this movie? Photos from him with little boys? With the Communists? What is the loss of great talent. So, friends Foster, true and good fun, either afraid ... be very, very, afraid.
