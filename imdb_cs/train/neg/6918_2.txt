For this film I believed he had a good rating. First, it is ridiculous to release a film originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001, the film looks like it was made on a shoe budget. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to work out how low a budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. Eventually it ends up giving a long monologue to end. If the film had clear sparks during the scene, I missed it when I was asleep. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt is like the Devil. He wears poorly dressed trite clothes and frowns at random children. As for Alec Baldwin, you should not miss the scene they first encounter with Webster. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said, "Come home and write better!"
