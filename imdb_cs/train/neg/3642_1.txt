Unfortunately, the film is more concerned about making a lame social commentary on a real event, but it does not have a ball to legitimize what has happened. The constant rhetoric of how violence on video games can not (implying that Ben Coccio is a passionate player), or how media and music are totally without influence, is a clear message (even we smash the scene of both boys burning all their CDs, talking about subtlety! ), but the movie is just gone because it's "fiction". Nice try. Yes, it's a great idea to get rid of the influence media, but how do we know that the children who actually planned and did the school were not affected by the media? or video games? We dont, and we're used to this movie, because these kids are smart enough to give up the media, but not wise enough to burn the Nazi symbol on earth? haha I'm not somehow. <br /> <br /> The film radiates your head over your head by showing the family's normality, almost doing poor service to think that the family is not a serious mistake in the dynamics of the children who actually came out and shot their classmates. Why are all so concerned that the killers look "normal" when they are so obviously not? Totally false and false display.
