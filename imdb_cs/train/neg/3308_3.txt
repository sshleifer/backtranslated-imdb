When you get your hands on a British film, you expect some quality. And in terms of acting, camera work, lighting, etc .; this film is doing. This is done by highly skilled craftsmen. This alone can give you a pleasant one and a half hours. But if you look under layers of professionalism, you will not find anything. In addition to feeling well and advocating a liberal opinion on drugs, there really is nothing. The script is average, the plot is predictable and the end has to be one of Hollywood's worst exits. In all, it's English comfort, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they shoot this movie? I have no idea, except, of course, I'm making money.
