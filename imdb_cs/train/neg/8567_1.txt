When I rented this movie I had very low expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized the film was a little (much less) than what I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for Disney movie (except for murders), but this is not a comedy, it's a ridiculous piece of stupidity. The title is well chosen except one thing: they could add a silly movie to Dead Husbands! I give it 0 and a half out of 5.
