"Any great document could be" ?? Yeah, if he's deaf, dumb and blind. Everything except meaning, joke, visual style and interesting subject. Addition. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously, call. This is a movie that is totally inappropriate. Adventure documentary without adventure, military doc without feeling of war, camp send-up without a trace of joke. It does not mean anything, it feels like nothing, and it implies an implicit message that it does not matter at all. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, you're in a car, do you know that the film with the main skipper Skip Lipman will have no culture, no intelligence, no joke (no other than teenage teenage jealousy) and no recognizable human emotions? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documents and too little time in life to stay on the toilet like "Darkon".
