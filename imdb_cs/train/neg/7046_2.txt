I saw this fat loss of time on HBO's comedy channel, so I was totally innocent and, of course, assumed it was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing ridiculous here. A good actress is basically unnecessary on the script I could write with my left pressed face - after the martyrs of the 15th century Inquisition killed him. The first half is particularly bad because it has some of the darkest, absurd dialogues I've just met, and a zero conspiracy of the comma I'm talking about. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this movie has less than 1,000 votes on this site should say everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's all about it. This is a movie that is done just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connection, advantage) and / or a lot of money.
