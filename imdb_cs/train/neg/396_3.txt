I saw it when it was in the theater, it started so strong. I thought that in 1980 it was a courageous film and the special effects were excellent at the time. Now you would have to be at least thirty in 1980 to truly understand this point because the study of the film historically lacks the mind set at the time of expectation and other related psychological factors. Now that I said the film is filming a very exciting and very funny movie. It is a perfect climax ... It is the end that I mean the person who described it as a glove in her hand before throwing it except that it is a very poetic description. In my experience, it was not strong enough. My wife and I were fine ... how can I say that? We were excited, I mean by paying the money, we invested time watching a movie that was great. "We both felt we were robbed of the end that convinced us that the two production companies had to run out of money and could not get enough to finish it properly. In fact, the woman said it best, it did not end, WE ARE STOPPED!
