This film is by far the worst movie ever shot. If you have to shoot a movie that plays a guy who plays Larsa in heavyweights than to do a damn movie. I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in space six times before I could watch a trailer for this POS movie. Adam sandler should be restricted from any film after this shame. Watching this movie is like a mixture of listening to Cher and willingly putting a dick in the mixer. Everyone with half the brain cells realizes that this film is not worth the dime. If I had another dollar and had to spend it, I would have supported him by Lorraine Bobbitt before I bought this movie.
