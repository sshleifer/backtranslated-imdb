The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, while Caesar paris is a crossroads. In addition, the Spanish language was untitled. That's why it's hard for me to explore this movie in depth because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, the part is very difficult, and I found out that Leonor Varela is playing well for newcomers. There is a strong will, but also a very supportive, tender soul mate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode. So it's not really a documentary, not a peplum, but a great love story. After the paris comes a new lover (Marc-Antoine), but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. So I found the second episode boring and their tragic fate does not say much. <br /> <br /> However, production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; Moroccan living space exotic and gorgeous gems. Producers certainly have a lot of money, but nothing special does not work. They are so poor (blue screen, ships, Sphinx) that it's funny. Finally, I would like to hear in French or English to finally express these two films.
