Two old men sitting on a park bench. I do not really have a problem with this scene - The only problem is that it's not a scene, it's a whole movie <br /> <br /> Movies in the Yup movie are not a bit of a low concept than this. They will not be boring, not even this, but it's worse to come here because these two old people are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is a Yiddish Communist, while the other is Midge Carter, a former Golden Gloves champion who is also black. Let me now see, a Jew and a black man sitting on a bench in the park, as he is encouraged. Well, I think it's possible, though unlikely, but if this movie has such a dreaded scenario, why does the Jewish stereotype play? Why is it a loud triblic beetle who accepts Hebrew oaths? The slightly ironic that the Jews saw at the beginning of the film are exactly the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s Stereotypes aside can solve the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT it is written for a completely different honey than the cinema, is based on a scenic game and shows it. Walter Matthau is starring in Nat's role as this commentator almost missed the movie
