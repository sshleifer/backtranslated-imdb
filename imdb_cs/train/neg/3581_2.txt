I was not able to decide if this movie is so bad that it's good, or, quoting Enid Coleslaw, "so bad that it was good and bad again." No matter what makes me look like a bunch of special colorful vomiting, it offers a number of scenes that you will not forget even if you want. There's a young Ray Liotta, who says Pia, that her creative trophy looks like a penis. Later Ray is again, bothering Pia, not with a properly shaped trophy, but with a garden hose. There's a very lazy Pius who tells his dominating mother that he wants to go to sleep with Ray's father, Walter. There is an actress on the scene of a cemetery that has the best line ever written by Pius or someone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" It's the garden hose again, as Walter waved his face and said, "It's more to your wishes!" There is Pius and her date so turned on by wiping each other on a salad to begin to tear off each other's clothes. There's Pius showering, but you forget to remove your clothes. Perhaps the best is the Pia typewriter, but instead of the key are the miniature talking heads of those who tortured her the most (then I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, Pia at "The Awards" is displaying Hollywood for the crap that is, and spitting out the second best line at all, "I do not think I'm the only one who ever had to go on his way to the top." I see I've spent more time commenting "The Lonely Lady" before I get on much better shots, and I will stop. Be warned in advance that once you start watching, you probably will not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life disappear forever.
