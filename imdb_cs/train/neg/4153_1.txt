I really do not know how to comment on this movie. The strange effects were bleak, the acting was terrible, and if that were all, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I can remember a movie that has been so bad for so long, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobie! Even the fact that the film could not be saved as just a terrible pretext to pay someone who stands (or was lying in this case) in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of "zombies". Because in this movie, zombies are so common that they run a few over and over and constantly talk about it at the gas station (one with a repair in the interior but without an internal bathroom), the genre of the zombie-film is not even to the end. Even if dozens of zombies stood out of girls' garments, it's not really a zombie movie. For vampires: All zombies seem to be men and all vampires are females, which is all right. I'm not sure how the vampires are out in the daylight, or why the soldier standing in the middle of the road, still holding a gun with a stake over his heart, just waiting for the Queen Vampires to drive him all the way. The last segment in the old monastery did not make sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks for another zealous lesbian vampire, "Do you think we did the right thing?" by killing two apparent heroes in the movie about overtaking it. <br /> <br /> The acting and special effects were still low. You could almost see the hoses from which the fake blood was exhausted while viewing the zombie in detail. When he talked about the general where they found TEN Kenny Rogers similar? You have no idea what the general was, except the generally confusing and misplaced. Overall, look at the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have a strong need to lose $ 3. Just $ 0.02.
