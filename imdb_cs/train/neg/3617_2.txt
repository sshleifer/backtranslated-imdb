Really, really bad movie slasher. A psychic escapes from the asylum facility. Three years later he will kill the professor of sociology, the end of the scene. One semester later (hey, that's what the title card says), the new professor of sociology is at school. He is confronted with another professor of sociology who works there, and starts going with another professor. Students are all bored, just like us. <br /> <br /> There are a number of titles that indicate how much time has elapsed. The scenes are pretty short and drawn to other characters somewhere else, leading to little progress of any kind. Lots of scenes include walking and speaking styles, or sitting and talking, and serve little purpose. Despite the time period, many of the characters are still worn in the same clothing. Sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see the body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long is the body there? And it also seems that at least one of the dead people has not been omitted by others. The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the chest, the other by punching him in the crotch, and the other by having her czech. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The chest of a videotape has a cheerleader: there are none in the movie. The back cover has a photo of someone with a hat and a dress that threatens a group of women in the bedroom. The central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but no one ever cares about such clothes and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one on one.
