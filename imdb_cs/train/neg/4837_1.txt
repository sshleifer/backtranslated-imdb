I went to see this movie simply to find out what it was all about, and I was just as disappointed that I was surprised how it got 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 today's IMDb rating. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be the happiest director who has ever won the best picture and best direction for the Oscar for this really bad movie and wonder why? Was the completely unrealistic story of a "cowboy" bombing - a man mean something for someone I did not see? Why did I get the mental idea that this movie was a remake of some old bad Western film about a cowboy who's doing "bold acts" in wild wild west infected with "evil" red Indians; but only that this time was set on a different background? Was it the Oscars, because the director was ex James Cameron, and made him a pretty scammer (plummet) tale for daily time television shows that have accumulated? Or was it some imperial clothing syndrome - where most people realized that it was junk, but it just did not say it because others apparently did not say it out loud? And finally what was with that sniper scene, where they showed the closet cabinet falling in high resolution-super-slow-mo-how to give a "deep message" or something? Something in the ranks of "EOD guys who find good snipers and they will still suffer from dirty terrorists"? Was it just me who felt there and there were so many pieces of pieces in the film out for no obvious reason? And can you get Oscars for editing and directing for it? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not waste money on tickets. Wait for a few years to go on TV. You will not miss much.
