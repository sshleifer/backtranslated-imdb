This video guide was a masterpiece of 1995. Beautifully done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have the main chemistry on the screen when they talk about what the Start button is doing. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a special DVD with complete deleted scenes, a commentary by Bill Gates, a document on how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP and more! Overall: 10/10 won at least the Golden Globe)
