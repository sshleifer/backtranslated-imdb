In a word, this film was boring. He missed his life and a spark. A big problem is two wires. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry at all. It was boring and she was uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The visuals were interesting but did not improve the scene. If that were the case, the images tended to separate the audience from what was happening on the screen. None of the action scenarios felt real, and the film could not create any real drama or a sense of danger. The film had the potential but needed a better screenplay, better acting and a better director. I still thought the movie would work if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical responses of this movie. Critics think they praise the movie because they * want * to enjoy and want to succeed, although it fails on so many different levels.
