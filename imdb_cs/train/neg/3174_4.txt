Jeff Lowell wrote and directed "Around her dead body" badly. The idea is above all, it's just as stale as my jokes and executions are just cherries on the cake. Minus Eva Longoria Parker is nothing interesting in this movie. Eva looks great as always and brings a nice performance. Paul Rudd looks crazy and has the slightest interest. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. It looks manly and provides a strict average performance. Jason Biggs is unnecessary, so is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more fun from this movie. Unfortunately, I enjoyed it.
