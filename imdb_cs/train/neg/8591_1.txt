I'm trying to decide whether to jump into a wood helicopter much more fun than this blow. It completes the destruction of what was once a classic movie. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas's career. He wants you to swallow that Annakin is Vader nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film justifies these feelings. The story does not work from Phantom Moron, and every new movie just buckles up until the rest of the game was a show of toys. I have to go. I know where some new stones fit. Do you want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is not their Father. Duke Counto should go to the sides as long as he could. Yoda has less vocabulary than Yogi Berra. His advice was never good to anyone. Obi Wan lied for the first two films. Annakin did not create C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mom for putting him together. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole disorder with the Vademer and the Fall of the Republic can be blamed on that stupid bh Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any brains, she should not get into Annie's light year, but she said what George Lucas wrote to her. What drope!
