Dance was probably only an observable film on this film - and it was even disappointing compared to some other movies. My gawd! <br /> <br /> This is the worst kind of movie for me - one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the traces of film art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed but eventually lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film is supposedly surrounded. Tango is teasing, it's hot, my drama is crazy - exactly what this movie is not.
