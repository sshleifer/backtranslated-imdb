A few weeks ago I read a classic George Orwell's novel from 1984. I was fascinated and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. So when I rented a DVD, I was interested in how this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the film did not manage to create an environment or develop characters that Orwell so generously did in his book. The director seems to think that everyone who watches the film read the book because he did not allow himself to prove why the characters behave and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the lead actor, goes all the way, and hardly does any action until the end. We will never find out what he is doing for life or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character longs for rebellion. This book can not be managed in film form without proper narrative and explanation of the political system of the oppressive character and the fact that they are missing is the biggest deficiency of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a terrible choice that looked about 15 years older than the 39-year-old Winston he was supposed to be. More positive, however, was that the rest of the cast was well-chosen. It's simply bad that they were put into such a heavily modified film with an incorrect lead actor. -Brian O.
