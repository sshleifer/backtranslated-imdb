Suffice it to say - despite the strange absurd panegyric about his "abilities" devoted to "acting" abilities - the director of this awkward, courageous tosh has since produced no film. Well that's great news for me. <br /> <br /> A dead baby has all the creatures of her creator, but she lacks wisdom and technical capability, making Martin Amis a novel reader. > When does the British film industry wake up and realize that if it wants to regain the status it once had, should it stop producing such waste and do something that real people really want to watch? <br /> <br /> Avoid being a plague.
