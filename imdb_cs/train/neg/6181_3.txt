If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie could be for you. I live in Nashville and I did not even know about the life of this movie until the day before its release, when the advertising company panicked and covered the Row music with dozens of leaflets and billboards. It barely took two weeks in theaters. Bad misconduct, bad writing and bad work begin to describe just the embarrassment of the film. For beginners, the names are a bit too much: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> Toby's unfortunate slow delivery line makes one wonder what a production assistant is stuck holding a card cue out of the camera. Angel's figure quickly moves from her city slopes to a tie, which after two days on a ranch slides into the South slang. Her wardrobe ranges from a handy to a feminine version of Toby - in fact, they are the same in the final scene of their clothes, so you're wondering if the wardrobe boss has called badly. The sound is inconsistent - perhaps the most striking example is when Toby decides to go swimming and his voice suddenly sounds like he screams at the gym. There is never enough explanation or character development to make enough what happens on the screen. Surprise, irritation, grimaces and moods best describes actors' interpretation and the direction of the terrible scenario. This movie is best enjoyed by having a couple of alcoholic drinks and a company of the most wanted friends. But he does not say much.
