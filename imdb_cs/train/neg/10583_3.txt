I'm sorry to say that, but the acting in this movie is terrible. Dialogue sounds like they would read their lines for the first time. Maybe I have the "dress test" version in error. The director uses slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is quite well written and the combat sequences are actually better than I saw in many action movies. The fight seems to be quite real. But all this is happening while the two leading players over and over again miraculously survive an incredible amount of point-blank automatic fire weapon, grenades, wheel morter, and bazookas. Enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when they have a 30-yard escape car and every shot on the bazooka is at least 50 feet wide. These bazookas need a serious site calibration.
