What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say that I will watch this movie again if I'm mounted on a chair and my eyes are open in an orange style. Robin Dunne's "Star" movie (No, I've never heard of him), whose dreadful impression of Ryan Phillipe has made me do it. In the event of a terrible revelation, Dunne will try (and fail) to play nice, charismatic, magical. Because the actor is not handsome, neither charismatic nor charming, the character is absolutely incredible. Amy Adams (once in a buff episode) tried to highlight where Sarah Michelle Gellar left and brought Katherine's curiosity to life ... However, Adams was not such a good actress, and her performance was flat and lacking any real emotion, she often looked like she was reading cue card just behind the camera. There were two good actors in the film, however Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington at Austion Powers) made a very good and fun show as Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason I named the movie for 2, not for 1. The film itself is a bad version of the original, with minima such as copies of dialogue and imitated scenes that lacked the originality of the previous movie. I think it could work as a TV show, but if it was recapitulated with people who really could act in the main parts.
