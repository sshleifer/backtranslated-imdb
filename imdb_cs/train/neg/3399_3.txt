Birthday Girl does not know what she wants to be - it's a comedy, it's a drama ... she just does not know. What could be a very funny or moving film would end up in the country. The assumption is so original that it has a legitimate scenario filled with interesting scenarios, but hardly comes and ends. It's really shame when you look at the cast - it's very solid, but they do not have a chance to shine. Great disappointment.
