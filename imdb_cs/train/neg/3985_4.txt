Flat, an ordinary thriller about a captivating woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves to raise her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays a devious Tracey, marrying a rough Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old Andy friend named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as a resident surgeon, the problem is not far behind him. Script fails by not diligently developing the promising premise of an effective, tricky thriller and a serious lack of motivating nature, background and development leaving the show. None of the cast is able to provoke interest in their shallow figures, especially Bill Pullman, whose inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe. Poor director Harold Becker tries to resurrect an impossible dead project and is unable to make fun of any of them. At a time when the "mystery" of the conspiracy is revealed, you will not care. <br /> <br /> At least cinematography has Massachusetts look good. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
