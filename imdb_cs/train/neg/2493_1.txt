Great movie. Originally, I did not know it was kiwi-but I soon realized that all the characters talked with unseen kiwi accents under the fake Americans. Why does this have to happen in America? - it could be set in the NZ and then the actors could use their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team heard terrible attempts to talk with American accents? Bad bad movie. I'm surprised it took so long - how did it do from a can? It seemed to be a very bad flick attempt. If there was some TAXPAYER money in this garbage, I would have revolutionized my money back to the box office. I was still winding up (got it - clumsy, winding!) To the absolute rubbish I just saw. Why am I still looking? Well, I'm a film fanatic and I can not help myself!
