My friends and I rented it for a "bad movie night" with great hope, but the brain was something disappointing. Brain himself is gloriously scornful, but he usually just sits on a small platform. Who thought it would be great for a brain to reach just three people in 94 minutes of exhaustion? This film has numerous things first, including the leadership of Estevez-knockoff, who plays the rebellious genius (we are told that his giant intellect is misdirected into his complicated jokes and school pieces, including the placement of a glued glue on someone's chair). He also has some great lines, cheerful out-of-shape and out-of-breath henchman who barely manage to be everywhere, and yeah, some cat is naked. However, the director desperately needs some education in the art of motion. During the last half of the year, things begin to move on and on, with at least 3 or 4 unnecessary, boring scenes of persecution constituting the middle third of the conspiracy. The scenes within the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down in the same staircase. I could fix this thing in half an hour - more cheeses, more gore, more nudes and more brain actions. If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool when I look at how my superhero turns off. Perhaps the director tried to really bring the audience into his movie - I started to feel like one of the zombined burghers until the end of this bullshit.
