Do you want to know the secret that you want to make movies of fame set up in a fitness center? Just make a movie with beautiful ladies in super tight clothes and let them come across and grind the floor like in a gentleman's club. That's what the creators of this haunted Slasher movie made, and that little trick left me to watch until the hot end. This is the worst image I have ever seen, but every time I was ready to switch the channel, I added another scene to the girls and I would stay. As a movie of fame, Killer Workout fails in every category that I think. As a show for the beautiful girls who work, it's a success. A strong recommendation to avoid if you do not want the thought of half the movie, which is a big T & A show, turned to you.
