This film was called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who do not play Need For Speed ​​games, they are mostly hot cars and beautiful women and almost no conspiracy. This is true for Redline. The only thing in this film, which was level A, were cars. Effect was forced and scenario, assuming that at best it was modest and the conspiracy almost did not exist. I really watched this movie to see how bad it was, and when it was pretty bad it could have been worse. And at least it was fun. I just wished to show Eddie Griffin somewhere in Enzo. Overall, do not pay, do not forget to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
