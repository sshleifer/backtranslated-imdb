It seems to me rather unnecessary to comment on this "film" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment on. It's like a spoiled egg that has nothing good about the world that it is rotten as another endless number of eggs have been before it. But because the comments are so obligatory for such magnificent insignificance ... Filth is definitely the right word describing this film created in the same way as any other Romanian "film" by director Lucian Pintilie, who insists on (since 1990 to present day). Under no circumstances is recommended for people outside of Romania, as well as for others (who have recently found amateur cameras, lack of land, lack of quality of directors / actors, etc., noise, etc. as trends and even art): watch and enjoy "movie" (as I know you do), but other well-thought IMDb members favor, write an online review for being badly driving, irritating and eventually losing time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film (among other things) has some value, educational is an example to him: "How do you not make a movie."
