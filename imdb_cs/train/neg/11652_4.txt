The Scary Movie 2 scenario was simply not ready to go. This is a problem with a movie that is obviously obvious to actors and audiences alike. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many actors are entertaining people; so the film is not completely humorous. Because of his experience, the film has several fun moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not as close as it is as clever and entertaining as the original. The first "scary movie" was a laugh in a minute film. He turned the smallest finesse of the film Slasher into comic gold. Humor in the movie "Scary Movie 2" is as hard as it is not original. They even lack open parody opportunities. Two of the movie stars are former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210" and it was a show that begged to be parodied! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened too early. The script needed much more time for the age. 2 stars from 5.
