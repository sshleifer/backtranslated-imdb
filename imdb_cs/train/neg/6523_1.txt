READ THE MINUTE TO READ THE CITY. WE DO NOT HAVE THE FILM SELF - ONLY DVD VERSIONS AVAILABLE. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie two stars. I mean, how could it be just 1 out of 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Here's how: An epic film adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate combat scenes, courtesy of the Red Army, and an extremely faithful scene for the adaptation of the novel would be difficult, sit for seven hours - if you've seen it. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can not see the movie - anywhere, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I try to watch the version of RusCiCo DVD - widely regarded as the best version available since its letter is set and restores scenes that have been cut off from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the worst movie prints I've ever seen transferred to DVD. The image is muddy and inconsistent, often crawling. It's almost tolerable if you improve the brightness, color and image levels to the maximum ... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also a bit inconsistent, loudly loud in parts, virtually inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And as far as languages ​​are concerned, there is a huge problem for English speakers - there are some good actors in the dubbed choice and some really terrible, whose performance grids and parts of the movie are simply not nicknamed to return to Russian and even French at random. <br /> <br /> The caption option is not much better. Subtitles do not appear below the image, but just above it - they cover some beauty (or what's left of it) in the landscape. Subtitles are often a bad translation (a shame that the script tried to get closer to the true words of Tolstoy), and it also seems that the headlines just fall out. <br /> <br /> So, even if you maximize color, brightness and picture settings and change the volume upwards and select subtitles * and * English dubbed, you will still get a movie that is unpleasant to watch and listen to. <br /> <br /> Can it overcome content? Maybe it was possible, but in seven o'clock - who could do it for so long? Maybe sometimes someone comes and returns - and maybe I will see a masterpiece - but for now I can not put more than one star on something I could only watch about the first 12%.
