Okay, I recorded it from TV and it was missing a start. The movie was about 10 seconds in the titles (I suppose), so if something happened before I missed it. A lot of people say Mark Hammill is not seeing him. I've recognized Clive Barker, John Landis and, of course, Stephen King, who is doing really terrible acting. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks beautifully out of scenes where she has a cat face or is completely alien-up. <br /> <br /> Even with the initial titles it never really explains exactly what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the sequence of the title, I suppose they are feline bipedal who live by pulling out the human life force. I suppose they have been living for a long time, and these two are perhaps the last of them. Add a very large dose of incest (yes, I thought it was a little suspicious), shapes, murderous cats and invisibility, and you have Sleepwalkers. It's a very bad story that has no real explanation behind the two main characters and too many portraits to try to divert attention from the simple fact that it's not enough to explain the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
