Unnecessary, eternal shots, unnecessary shots, useless scenes are what you find in this movie. In other words, it seemed technically bad to me. Musical bits are amateur-driven (without synchronization in future dance, bad after synchronization, bad and obvious improvisation of actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. In the end it makes a few points and even less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas. Some comic elements are really effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film worsens and worsens, making it totally unbearable and impossible to the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, it's not true for the movie. This means that the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual movie is something very close to breaking.
