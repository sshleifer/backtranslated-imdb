I can first say that I felt so strongly that I was registered with IMDb to review it. And my reviews? It's simply the worst movie I've ever seen. The synopsis of the film was interesting - the Nazis, the occult, time-dependent paths, etc. But the plot did not manage to transfer all these elements together. Do not forget the South Park episode that featured the Manatees Family Guy with the help of a ball of thought? Did these priests also say of Unholy? Her writer wanted to include all these different ideas but had no clue how to link them together and then make things even less meaningful, including the Donnie Darko-esquire theme of travel time to the end, the chaos of chronology. <br /> <br /> Soon I can say it was a bad movie. Special effects were too low budget for something better than DVD. The acting was not great, but in fairness I saw it worse. I praise the Nazi paintings, they were scary, but the evil Nazi butcher was just funny. I do not have a vendetta against this movie or anything else, but to be honest, I'm not even a horror genre. However, this film can not be described as a thriller or drama. If this story were to be said well, it would be a good movie. But it was exaggerated. Waaaaay despite the encouragement.
