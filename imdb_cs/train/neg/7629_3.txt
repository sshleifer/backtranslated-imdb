I gave this film a great chance and betrayed me. This is little more than a black-and-white excuse that exhausts the audience, even though the egoist Bogdanavič (who has done much better with TARGETS) is winning "great performances" of a ton of ham in their debut. Lots of adolescent sexual clichés come from this film, such as Doing a Teacher's Wife, Impotence, Making a nasty prostitute (which is very awkwardly shot and stirring things totally to stop, not that it really did), and skinny crumbling. <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie is going to be funny because of all sexual nonsense, it was just annoying for me. I was really much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess.
