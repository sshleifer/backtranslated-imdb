I can not believe that people thought this smelly garbage pile was fun. Moving humorous attempts between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There's something about Mary," he has no reason to stay to the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very nice, but it will never be enough to save the movie. Ben Stiller is harsh for conspiracy and apparently very talented, but the movie is lost. <br /> <br /> Once the scenes were not believable. The shots were poorly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be away from the movies at all costs. I'll check IMDB to find out what they're working on, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; the bonus is since I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or myself in my opinion. My wife hated too. The next day we saw "Rush Hour" and we laughed stupidly. This movie was simply amazed.
