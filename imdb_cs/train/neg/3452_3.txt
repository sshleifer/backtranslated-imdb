I decided to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was selected for a prestigious competition at the Cannes Film Festival. I was surprised that Cannes could be so good at quality assessment. The film, some reviewers, noted that it does not have too much fire - but the violence itself is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your young son, or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove fidelity. Some of the contrasts of Corleone's sons in Copol's "Godfather" that appear to appear in this Chinese / Hong Kong film, but the quality of these two is significantly different from chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> The film is only recommended for drug addicts ... there is no big cinema. At best, it could be considered better than Run Run Shaw production for production values.
