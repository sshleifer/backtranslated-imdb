It was Ewan McGregor's first movie I've ever seen outside Star Wars. Since then, I have become a great fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can not forgive the existence of this film. My sister has always been a huge fan of Jane Austen and for this reason I have been exposed to various classics, and Emma is one of them. I always considered them irritable, stupid, and boring. After watching this horrible edition, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was beautiful and charming. Ewan McGregor barely served this purpose when he hackled and crippled part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in a sensual nature, and the rest of the film is incredibly unobtrusive and stupid. My recommendation to anyone who is remotely interested in the English period drama ... check out the originals. If you are a fan of Ewan McGregor ... believe me, by skipping this movie you missed just five minutes of college in a silly hat and a bad haircut.
