Although I heard that this movie was a bit dry, I look at Scott Bakula. At the beginning of this movie I had great hopes for the classic but pleasant Scott-get-girl that ended and up to 20 minutes before the end it would be great. The plot plot was mad, unexpected, and very clever. I held my fingers to make it happen, and it would all be a terrible misunderstanding until the credits unfolded, and I realized it would not be a happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I left the pity that I watched it and rushed to a quantum leap to restore my belief in the good of Great Scott!
