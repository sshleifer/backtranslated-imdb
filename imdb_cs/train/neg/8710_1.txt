I did not see the first two - just the one called Primal Species in England. I do not think I will be troubled to look for them. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. Terrible behavior, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything is so unpleasant. The most compassionate figures die really fast and leave you with annoying, especially one of them named Polchak, who is an incredible jerk. No one would survive for 5 minutes in the army. It lasted for ages, but I was pleased to finally get my head chewing - I had nightmares that he survived. The Colonel was also garbage - all moody and insignificant screams. And the pungent doctor looked and acted like she was from porn. I wait for her to take her glasses, wash her hair and change the vamp, but she did not. It's a pity that it's as if it's revived the film to the end. Roger Corman did not use half the decent films?
