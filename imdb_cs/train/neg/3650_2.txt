No laughter. Yes, I was following this whole train, but only to avoid asking later if Cleese had come to her senses in the last line. (No, no.) It may be interesting for you to see that British "humor" contained black "jokes" like these, thirty years ago. What makes me even more astonished is to read the comments of other reviewers who admit that it is not very good, but then turn around and make high voices. If the vast majority of the comedies you've seen are even worse than this, then I'm sure it was flying its terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The level of humor in this show is aimed at young children, but the subject is not. Who is that? People who have repeated and depleted double shots, pratfalls, jokes about drugs (interesting only as a short journey back to 1977) and another "low" humor. Three Stoogs are still glad and I'm like a kid. They made some effort to make jokes work. This is, however, excluded from the conference. I am afraid that this is the end of civilization, if this thing is actually accepted as useful. You will also tell me that tabloid TV is popular. :(
