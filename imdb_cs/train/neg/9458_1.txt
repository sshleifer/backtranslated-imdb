There are a lot of comments that have already been sent out saying exactly how I felt about this movie so I leave it. "" Grinch "I thought it was amazing - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian, as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion) Mike Myers, on the other hand, laughed at being annoying. in the days of Waynes World and "So I married Ax Murderer" - but I never liked Austin Powers and "Cat In The Hat" just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - gags were terrible unsuitable for children not only in adult content, but in fact, some of them were so dated that they did not have fun for someone for 50 years! The story was messy, dirty, messy! It's a shame because the kids were very nice like was "mummy." They would probably have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have taken it if it was not for Myers's ugly, rebellious image of a cat, even a look at the script - Was it written one? one - but the cat seemed be wings! On the other hand, I would like to mention that sets and props are amazing !!! Unfortunately, we can not save this movie. Poor Dr. Seuss - The man was brilliant! Do not make his reputation fit your work in a lazy, chaotic way! <br /> <br /> 1/10
