OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodies a famous farmer and his marriage. Then you will win this baby on the DVD player and all hope will be lost in less than five minutes. It was a comedy. And I have to admit I laughed about ten minutes before the end. This film has the following features: tortured and abused neighbor beside, boring trial, racism, talking about lynching and death and underworld. Cheerful, huh? No, please, if you never listen to any reviews, please. You can not even force yourself to watch the bullshit. CRAP! I said, CRAP! Whoever puts a name in it should actually sue.
