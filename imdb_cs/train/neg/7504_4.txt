I'm afraid I mostly disagree. I found Spike Lee's latest spores a little boring! Although he tried something else, Not just to document the rise and fall of a serial killer, I do not think it works well. <br /> <br /> It's really a bit too much - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and the relationship of Dion (Mira Sorvino), lifestyle of Ritchie (Adrien Brody) and local mafia. The story is good, but at the end it's all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, would not Mr. Lee give this film more to this side? > <br /> <br /> There are some good points. All the scenes with David Berkowitz's "Son of Sam" look very nice (color saturation, etc.) And the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall, I felt that different stories would work well for themselves or without killing. At the end it was not strong enough. <br /> <br />
