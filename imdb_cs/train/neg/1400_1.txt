Oh, my God ... I thought CBS television shows were the worst things Gerald McRaney had discovered ... Four people are experimenting with the crazy mind control of the computer. That's it, do not lend it. I've seen it under one of many titles - "Gray Matter", and it's probably one of the worst movies the last memory. Other reviews are correct, it's terrible. They never had so much foundation <br /> <br /> The images appeared on the screen, NEVER. The cast is horrible, the direction is awful and the script is awful. I can not stress how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as if you were smallpox. <br /> <br /> This is rated (PG) for physical violence, some violence gun, mild <br /> <br /> gore, and some adult situations
