I only looked for the first 30 minutes, and what I saw was a complete piece of crap. The scenes I saw were just as bad as Ed Wood. No, it was a hundred times. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director at all, but that's not true; the idiot who controlled this unsolicited post is the best director ever. The American policeman has a German accent! "Police station" was a desk in the warehouse with the inscription "Police station" hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight where the punches are clearly missing about ten feet. <br /> <br /> This cop attracts women to their husbands and leads them to the warehouse. He tells his cop to wait in the car. Then he gets out of the warehouse and wears the bag. The policeman says there may not be anything wrong that his partner may be a bad cop who murdered these women, but he is not sure if this is because he's a fool! Dialogue is stupid, acting is horrible, and characters behave the most stupid way I've ever seen on the screen. For police officers, it is obvious that these women illegally kidnap and defend and take them to the warehouse and return to the car with a body bag in the body and yet, a partner who is not there all the time knows what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a complete hack. I stopped the film in 30 minutes because I could not take it anymore. It must be one of the BEST films I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> Absolutely wrong.
