It is certainly not one of Lucio Fulci's better moves in any section of imagination. The plot is pretty bad, the millionaire is murdered and his spirits are calling his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this one (except who killed him in 10 minutes of watching the movie) was wondering why anyone should care? Father says he is really a big jerk to everyone he has encountered (including the daughter he asked to help him), which caused someone to care about who killed him. But nobody really sees how good a story is going to Fuls, which would be like watching porn for incredible writing and playing scenarios. Usually, his films try to compensate by adding excessive gore scenes, but it is even missing in this movie. If you are looking for a good Fulco movie, check out The Beyond.
