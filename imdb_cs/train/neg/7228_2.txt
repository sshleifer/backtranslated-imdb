Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes. The most powerful serial production. Well detailed buildings and CGI vehicles. <br /> <br /> A bad mix of actors with all CGI actors mixes the Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. CGI actors look even worse than video games a few years ago. Bad logic. A giant pyramid appears and no one is examining it, no one even asks about it? And there is no explanation as to why God Horus was even thrown out, and there was no reason why he must do something as trivial as the impregnated Jill? <br /> <br /> Ugly:> Amazing script. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialogue was almost ridiculous at some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Zero characters. Jill is supposed to be this secret, but it seemed to be just a mystery for the writer. There is nothing about it. It's uninteresting and boring. He has no fabric, no texture. Her character has no redemption. In fact, there is no character in any movie that has any purpose, any purpose (except the obvious Horus), any motivation. They are weak and poorly conceived. There are no bets - the key to writing on the screen. Horus does not become immortal, but, a big problem, he's a bad man. It is even impossible to decrypt whether Horus or Jill is the main character. This is a problem: devoting half of the film to each song means that the writer never fully explores one character, never leads to accomplishment. These are cardboard cutouts that go through and talk and do not go through anything but examine fine pieces. The first stimulation of the director. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching the movie when I write it. I can not pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall: <br /> <br /> It is not worth the watch. The story with the thread, the development of the sub-par character, the CGI does not defy a nice serial production.
