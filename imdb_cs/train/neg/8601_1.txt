Ok, where do we start with this little jewel? Mutant slugs begin to take over the small town of New England (?). Only one man can stop them ... and that man ... is Mike Brady! Now, if it was not ridiculous enough, stay tuned. Snapshots of slugs are known as serial footage. No matter who attacks or where they are, the same shot of the thunderstorms is shown everywhere. Keep in mind that this singular shot occupies at least half the film. The movie in the movie was destroyed, pulled out, stole the wallet, hit your girlfriend and killed your dog. I'm sure it's worse, but it's hard to find. The only jewel was ... you thought it ... MIKE BRADY! He had to take a few hours at YMCA because he was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror? This movie can not be taken seriously. It's not horror! They are slugs for calling out loud. It was possible to avoid a rising step with a salt shaker or two. Watch only this movie in an MST3K environment, otherwise I can see some big brain damage.
