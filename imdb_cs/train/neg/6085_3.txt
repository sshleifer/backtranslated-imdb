In this paranoia-driven diver, our reporter hero struggles with obstacles organs, duplicate collaborators, renegade UFO revelations, and silent, skulking aliens. (Although it is capable of controlling the mind and closing objects from a distance, it takes three to control the control panel of about two dozen buttons.) The scenario flashes from event to event, so puzzles are many. Why do strangers blind the dog? Why do they solve the soldiers by irradiating when they only guard the empty landing place? And what is the space guy who is behind their moon cheese denying the worst photographer first instead of his model? The request of the mind wants to know! Writer-director Mario Gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming stack of UFO-themed tabloids, as he took in the Sunn Classics a double feature. (The final screen boasts the fact that it is based on real events ... as well as "Plan 9!") Some may feel burned by a sudden final, but they still should appeal to the plot.
