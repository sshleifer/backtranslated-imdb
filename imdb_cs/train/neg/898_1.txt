Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is totally crude, rough, silly and ludicrous. This is really the only way to describe this awful, clumsy figure. Eddie Murphy is more shocked than laughing to try to win his next. Probably it's fun sometimes, but it's mostly losing conspiracy with obscene language and unfortunate sexual jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! If you do not like Eddie's foul style. I do not think I'm going to bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I very much prefer Eddie as part of the film. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
