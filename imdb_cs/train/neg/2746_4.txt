I was afraid to take my nephew into this movie because I did not think it would be done well. Children aged 6 and 10 looked at her, so I went out. I have to admit it was not as bad as I thought, but it was far from the book. The film seemed to understand this 10-year-old and has a sense of humor. I learned that for six years he knew what was going on, and he was the solution to the problems that were happening. Finally, I had to explain that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to problems, because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make a "stupid" or "stupid" decision.
