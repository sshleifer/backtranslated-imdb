Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who is likely to be remembered as one of Billy Clinton's "bimbo blasts" (now pills!) Is probably the weakest feature of this show. Truly continues the tired formula Highlander Series - a hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks last encountered, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fighting at the end where you have cheap sequences of special effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, this is your typical 90th hero, with a typical "Sexual Tension" story. (Really, why Hollywood creators think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) It was a joint Canadian / French production, so half of the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York and the other half is in Paris ... like the Highlander.
