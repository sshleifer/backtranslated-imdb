This movie was positively the worst movie I've ever watched. I could not sit the whole thing. I also think the writer must have some weird fetish for women as they spin and rage. I mean what it was all about! I can not believe that it was even done and I am disgusted by paying a Â£ 4 rental fee. Image and sound quality is terrible, acting ... does not exist well. It was a bad justification for film and scenes with peege, crap and explosions resembled two girls and a cup. Urghh ....... Avoid all expenses! The girls looked as if they were out of the street and only because they were willing to take their peaks ... While the girls have nice bodies, it certainly does not mean that their scream is terribly unconvincing and painful for my ears. Was it (maybe worse) than amateur school production without any proper direction and hey, do not have to set because it seems to spin around the car? <br /> <br /> Do not buy people. I'm sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I could not find anything positive and I would think I could save someone else who would hurl money like I had.
