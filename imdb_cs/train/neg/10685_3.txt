Predictable, hackneyed & badly written. I fancied that such a prominent actor would not be involved if he had a merit. I think the competition between actors is so intense these days (and will only get worse) that we can no longer choose and choose more. Soon we were given the aid that helped in the assassination, and since then we have accumulated from it. The film lacked intrigues, giving us a small view of the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Some of the discourse was, frankly, embarrassing! It's hard to believe anyone would even think, let alone commit that he spent tens of millions of dollars to make it happen.
