Who in the world told Harrison Ford that it was a good role for him? And Josh Hartnett ... how could he become a 19-year-old who can not shoot a gun by a cop? Despite the clich√©s used plus the zero character development and about 15 insignificant music industry cameras equals surprisingly bad film !!!
