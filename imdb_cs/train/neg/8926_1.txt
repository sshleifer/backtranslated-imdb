I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it first appeared in 1970. I was a healthy 20-year-old who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. Besides, I read the novel by Gore Vidal, on which it was founded, and I thought it was very funny. I saw the movie on a local vehicle, and about halfway around, I was very tempted to turn my car's engine so that I might die of monoxide poisoning, and I did not have to see the rest of the film wreck. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was gross and careless. All the actors were deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Casting Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in the history of the film. As one reviewer said, her role had nothing to do with a movie or a book. Her figure in the book is sexually defeated by a young stallion, which would never be for the legendary Miss West. Oh no, the plot has changed to overcome sexually, very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
