6/10 Director, not big, but some good acting. 4/10 The director, makes a foolish decision for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 The writer, the story does not make sense and has a huge amount of mistakes. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Total score for this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not collect your time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. The characters are so exaggerated than they might be in real life, and some quite inexplicable things happen "incidentally," not in a good sense. Because of the style in which the film was shot, you are bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motion and camera shake and fast forward). It's always good that the movie uses music to make the story look seamless, but there are too many tracks in it. In the first hour there are nearly 50/50 dialogues and musical instruments
