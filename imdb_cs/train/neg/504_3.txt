A particularly sinister example of an Italian cult cinema with a meaningless name on the boot (if anything, the MARK of Satan is even less relevant to plot!), This hybrid of Gothic horror and Giallo (with a heavy dose of Erotica) just creates a flat atmosphere? in fact, corresponds to manipulation that is terrible! Here we get the usual group of people (actor) stuck on an island (to which they were invited by the Earl because he became an enchanted leading lady, dead curious about his missing husband)! The characters are almost stereotypes: middle-aged, but a temperamental hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history carries more than his share of violent tragedy), scared the heroine, dear companion (recalled Mae West and found the most traumatic) a devoted stage manager (forever betrayed by one and all for his impious behavior!), a pair of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi, who once came to action if you know what I mean), a jealous housekeeper (star Femi Benussi, but for what it is worth, it's really a piece of stuff), a religious fanatic of a valet, a comfort valet, etc. While the film does not mean it means denial, shameful dabing, snail tempo, dirty production (with scenes depicting a fierce sea lifted from some black and white film!), and the fact that murders only occur during the final half an hour, do not help and. Besides, the score of Marcello Giombini, although pleasant in itself, seems in such circumstances to be undoubtedly modern; that the revelation turned out to be surprisingly complicated (since there is no doubt about the lack of suspects).
