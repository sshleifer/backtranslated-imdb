The Incredible Melting Man plays as the extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nakedness. I know this movie is a bit crazy, but I found it impossible for him to enjoy it. The acting and screenplay are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of $ 50 - the character of the title takes a long time to actually melt, but when it does it is quite impressive; we also have one devised death scene involving electric current. Notable is the music, it's crazy - a cheese-tastic mixture of nonsense. <br /> <br /> A noteworthy warning: <br /> <br /> * Marvel at a slow nurse who jumps through the glass of glass for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed by one day in the life of the cut head. <br /> <br /> * Beware of the psychotic cannibalistic thaw of humanoid. He called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero disconnects from the hunt of crazy fools to have a bowl of soup and complains about the poor crackers in the kitchen. it's like 70 years to hate him. It's tiny and spooky, but I thought it was a lot of fun. It could be much worse.
