If you can imagine that Mickey Mouse is New York City's pimp, or John Wayne as a Communist spy, then you could trust Pat Boone as a teenage delinquent at his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you could imagine this movie. <br /> <This movie is so stupid that it's not even a sex-free love story camp in the mid-1950s. The problem is that Hollywood has made so much interest in rejecting Pat Boone to kiss a woman not his wife on the screen before her release that the audience knows she will not kiss Shirley Jones so you can not build any expectations for the "picture consumption" of their love. It's like watching the west, in which cowboys do not have weapons. The story is useless. Even the title song sings with painful enthusiasm. April Love is one of the worst film carts with Ishtar and Plan 9 of the universe.
