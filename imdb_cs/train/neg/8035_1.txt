This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror film fan and I borrow some horror film if it's not made for t.v. Looking at the box it says it's rated R for gore and some language ... Where was the gore? Was that their good death scene, where did you really see the gore? I could have overlooked if there was any short nudity or some good dialogue. There was not one remotely funny or fun line in this chrome movie. Sometimes horror movies are amazing because they are so stupid, but it was just sad.
