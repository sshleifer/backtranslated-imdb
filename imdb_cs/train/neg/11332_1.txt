As big as the Texas prairie and as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not swim above this crowded boat. Taylor in fact LOOKS badly - bad wardrobe, bad hair and bad make-up - a unique success in his remarkable career. Hopper gives the only credible performance, and Dean in the top scene shows remarkable talent as something we do not usually remember - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype Barbie Doll Ken and makes what Redford could do with a male lead. There is no recognizable conspiracy that would provide tension up to the last twenty minutes, just pasties of milestones that have little relationship to each other. Apart from Hopper, there is no character development, just a collection of cardboard cutouts that appear regularly, without any obvious reason, such as random targets in the shooting gallery. For his esteem, the film has faced racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects and has a size, so it's a great choice to be out of the house of unwelcome guests. Those who have the DVD version can reserve some of those that start with the second disk. You will miss nothing interesting.
