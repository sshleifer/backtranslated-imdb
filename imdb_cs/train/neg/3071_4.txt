I found these mean characters and the story was uninteresting. I never had to read this book (fortunately) or it would be a painful experience. I got tickets for free, but it was still not good for my time or my friend. I think this story is not worth saying. It's like saying older people have a past before they get worried (no fun). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation not better than the other, to avoid stupid mistakes. But I think the actors did the best they could with the greedy story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I'm writing this review so I do not get a positive rating that unfortunately convicted me to try this movie.
