When I was a child in the 1950s and 1960s, everything that was related to Disney was by definition great. What happened? They are able to get all the actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow Disney will be able to jump over things despite their rich resources. Disney can afford the best writers, best producers and directors, but ... they can do it! This movie is bullshit. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney in their arrogance does not even know when the movie is good or bad. It's just because of the talent of actors that I can even give 3 out of 10.
