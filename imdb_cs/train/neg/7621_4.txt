As has been said, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently by "You Got Mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Pruz Pout" by Ryan. From several versions, it's my favorite. The problem I think is that the studio was rushing into the charisma of the stars, which did not quite cut it here. Chemistry between these two leads will never boil in this film. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of the daily donuts, pleasant, but insignificant. And when the guides are boring, the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. Looks like he does not have a neck! I do not know if she has trouble with a painful or such thing, but it looks like a turtle trying to pull her head into the shell, they all get up and everything. I could not figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot. I would make a bee line for that cute violinist. And even Van was not great. I have always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and doing nothing to dispel him. If you are a fan of stars or early 1900, then you are like this movie. But there are much more fun romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a sponge of sweets.
