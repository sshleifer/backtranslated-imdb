This movie was about as stupid as the Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case story: <br /> <br /> 1. To drown it, Roberts secretly surrenders swimming lessons to the YWCA. After her "death," YWCA calls her husband to give her sympathy. HELLO, how did they get their job number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before she leaves the city, she throws her wedding ring on the toilet. Days or even weeks later her mumbles find it in John. Does that mean that the toilet has never been washed? <br /> <br /> 3. There is no explanation as to how to pay for their mother's care in the retirement home (because she did it for her husband RICH). <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this tiring movie, Roberts suspects that her husband is in the house. Instead of running for his life, he goes to the kitchen to see if the cans are neatly stowed.
