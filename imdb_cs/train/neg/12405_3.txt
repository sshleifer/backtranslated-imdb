Damage! There I was, comfortably in an armchair with beer and a popcorn bag, a thrill in the hope of another wonderful Muppet's fun night. What did I get? Disappointed! How can Muppets go from this noble Christmas seal? The humor was scary, the songs were worse than the Earth and the West (and it says something) and the conspiracy was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they lost power when they attempted to treasure the Island of Treasures. A short story like Christmas Carols is perfect because you can weave Muppet high jinks around it ... here you need to drag the plot along to stop all the fun. Where do muppets go on? And what about the Muppets Wizard from Oz?
