Only one thing could redeem this layout. A healthy shootout between a happy couple, an exotic fashion model in a delicacy, and an old timer from a motel that was (it would turn out) secretly watched out of the woods and aged boys, d shared a rubber house. <br /> <br /> During this process, they could replace the frozen cabin to fight, solving most of the problems; such as the "fucking bitch" on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had no "friends" as well as explaining his coldness under the pressure of a bloody swab, constant phone calls. . . and the swinging space, the elegant thumb and its appeal to a simpler life. Of course a technician with a human body. Ex-diver? Marine nurse? A little heart would be nice. It was fun to watch these people move around, probably, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical, while the manager was too many yoga classes: and the dick, the mind and the pick-up truck that summed it up. I also wished they had a little more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after she put some black underwear in her handy red suitcase and the manager needs a cardboard box in the motel. <br /> <br /> You can say well. I agree, though, the nasty bits simply did not participate in this job. A good owl of deception, and I really felt cold all the way.
