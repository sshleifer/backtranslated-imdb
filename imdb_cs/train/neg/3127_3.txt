The archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally encounters an ancient 40-foot mummy, well preserved underground in the desert of Nevada. They are determined to keep this secret and call the Jewish translator to help with his history. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in those days. To save his son from the devastating flood that had foretold him to kill everything, his son's mummification and, for centuries, he would bury him with several servants-he would wake him up for years. In our present day, fallen angels are always on the ground and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place. Most of the film is slow, which is related to a number of biblical bulls and a few vague, aerial fights. The mummy looks decent but not sufficiently displayed. It had more to do with it, but it attracted a lot ... so. Do not bother.
