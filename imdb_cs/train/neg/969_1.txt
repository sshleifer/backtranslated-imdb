I was rooted in this film because it is a remake of the children's television series "Night Escape" in the 1970s, which, though sometimes chaotic and crazy, was certainly strange, fascinating and disturbing. Playing in "Paperhouse" is a wooden, unintentional joke. The restraint did not bring any tension that only intensified that I was sitting and looking at the shoe. Casting disturbed the sad dialogue that resulted in relationships without heat, chemistry, or conviction. As with most insignificant films, there are several good supporting actions, these people should be consoled, consoled and reassured that they will not be held accountable. Of all possible endings, the most unexpected ... louder than I imagined was chosen. Night escape deserves the right remake written by someone who has experience with life, mind.
