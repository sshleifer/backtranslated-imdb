I must be absolutely frank by first saying that I have been asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a complete view of the film until I see it completely. In essence, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), are going to be lucky to steal the delivery of contraceptive pills from Finisham's maternity hospital. This is where his name is Matron (Hattie Jacques), along with Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and sister Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also nearby, including the pregnant Mrs. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous daddy husband, Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also play Bill Maynard as Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. By the way, this plan is not by the way, because all the employees get in the way. That's almost everything I can say about the movie until I see it again. Good!
