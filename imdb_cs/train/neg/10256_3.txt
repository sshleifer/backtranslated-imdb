Your mind will not be satisfied with this unsupported thriller, but pray who is the will? A young couple spends the real end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens who dress up as church people. A small _apocalyptic trip, END OF THE WORLD, has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style from the similar 50s. And that's not all, but EOTW plays like a hybrid - not just a court day, but a convent. The villain of the film is a well-known character actor. This completely blameless slapdash appears to be part of monastic exploitation, a remarkable genre of the 1970s that looks so obsolete today. But the Secret Laboratory of the Monastery is an ugly piece of futuristic decoration! Christopher Lee is the pride of the end of the world; but the end of the world is not his pride at all!
