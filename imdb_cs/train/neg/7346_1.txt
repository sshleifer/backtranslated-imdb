I feel I've just been watching the snooping movie ... a beautiful, tense, stunning and terrible thing! A two-hour litany of perversion in the most basic and most popular sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live funeral and abuse, abuse and abuse. No redemption. And I enjoyed it. I could not stop watching. What he says about me, about the people who are doing and acting in such matters, and the world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snooping movies will be the norm. And I'm neither Puritan nor humorous, I'm not trying to hide from the existence of darkness and definitely did not lead a protected life, but I'm ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my British cousins ​​pull the objects into the drains as their own trunk does. It does not have to be cozy, but must it be in sadism?
