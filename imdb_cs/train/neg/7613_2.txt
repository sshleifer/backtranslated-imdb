The small Californian city of Diablo suffers a mysterious death after sheriff Robert Lopez uncovers an old box. Legend has the box holding a sixteenth century Mexican demon named Azar.FBI Agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate murders and joins forces with the sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary to fight a bad and bloodthirsty demon. The "Legend of Diablo" is an absolute garbage. The film lacks terror and gore, acting is amateur and direction is bad. Animation is the only aspect of the movie I enjoyed. I'm a big fan of Indian horror, for example, I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" missfire.
