I leased the movie because it falls under the genres of "romance" and "western" with some Grand Canyon scenes that fall in. But if you expect a typical healthy romantic western, forget about it. This movie is pure waste! Romance is among YOUTH GIRL, who did not even show up with puberty and a middle-aged man! The child is also asked by other inbreeding men. It is bad. Peter Fonda is portrayed as virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one who follows the relationship. She tries to drop her off initially, but eventually she sets out and sets off as a happy loving couple. It's rebellious. I do not see how anyone with pedophiles could appeal to this film.
