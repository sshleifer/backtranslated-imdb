I've seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, a lot, but that's no doubt the worst! I usually like stupid movies if they are somewhat fun, but I can not even think of one good thing about this movie. I like "teen witch" for heaven. But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting, lame porn music all over, and even sex scenes soaked! I would have to compare the laxity of this movie with similar "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys" or even "Very Brady Sequel". Even though it is much worse than any of them. Please do not waste your time. Believe me, you will never come back for 2 hours.
