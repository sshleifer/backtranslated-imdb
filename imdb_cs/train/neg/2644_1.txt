Sentinel presents everything about Hollywood homelessness and the fact that in today's films there is an urgent lack of imagination in so many films. I can not think of one good thing, that's all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy that it really exists just as an infomercial about how to make money from unsuspecting, indecent public. <br /> <br /> The plot of a secret service agent planning to murder Preza could be fun. If they are being processed by the right director or caretaker cast, which is. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the first lady with whom he has a matter (an undeveloped, unresolved fence design). Sutherland is the best friend who believes he is guilty because he will not have a movie if not. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with the wealth of Maybellin and ... that's it. I think there are fewer requests for women entering the secret service. As usual in a movie like this, the role of Prez itself is nothing but a tool, a symbol, and it is very badly written. Clark Johnson, the one who gave us as well as the miserable SWAT 2003, the mechanical direction lacks any signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored from a distance and call. Eva Longoria, the most exaggerated woman of the 21st century, is basically just to attract the audience of desperate wives. Her role is 100% unnecessary and does absolutely nothing to continue with the plot or add to the character's development. She just has 2 rows to knock you together. And a real non-profane marketing talent. <br /> <br /> If you are punished for punishment, do not let me stop. But it's time and money that you will not return.
