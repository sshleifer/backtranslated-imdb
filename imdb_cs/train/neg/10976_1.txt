A horrible film to be independent. He needed some addiction to something. <br /> <br /> This completely unfortunate film deals with the interaction between Irish people. They tried to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this movie crashed completely. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of work that will culminate with a little bracelet running around and throwing stones into buses and cars, which of course causes chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is too upset for work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. This causes the former sister to become a bitter vet and walks around clothes she did not have to believe. The older sister will also become sad, but she will soon find romance. Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob the bank. It is obvious that robbery goes wrong, but there seems to be no punishment for fraudsters. Perhaps a punishment should be imposed on writers for failing to create a cohesive film.
