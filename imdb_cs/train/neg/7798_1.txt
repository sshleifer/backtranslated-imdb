This review is based on the nickname Shock-o-Rama, which was released in 2002 in an unmistakable world. How bad is that? It's terrible, which means "1" on the IMDb scale - but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that original German-language prints could improve things - comic dabing in English is not funny at all - but it's probably one of the worst amateur movies of any genre you'll probably see. Zombies in the movie are slow and clumsy as ever, and they seem to have no ability to talk or think about anything that might be their next meal. But they are also intelligent enough to operate chain saws and threateningly to know that the Western taboo on the genitals will undoubtedly revive their conversation with dinner. Country of the Land of the Dead George Romero sent the country of the Zombies, which retained the remnants of social cohesion; here the zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse ideas of director Andreas Schnaus. Completely without redemption of social value, and even worse, completely lacking in entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone who buys money for it.
