After seeing the remake of 1996, I thought it was the funniest way to get Cruella De Vil punishment for torturing animals for my skin only. The whole movie was quite funny and, in my opinion, better than animated. But in reality, there was no need for another. First, if Cruella returns, do not keep her and do not believe her again. Just move her out of prison and that's rap. I thought it was not much fun. Only one original puppy should be returned. I supposed it was Lucky because it was most tempting, and besides Roger and Anita. They decided, however, that they would have a complete overhaul and addition not really a hundred or a hundred and two, but only three puppies and a parrot who thinks he is a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu was useless. Eventually Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She lights in a huge cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor that tried to imitate the same effect from the first. It simply did not work. It was too over the top, and not too funny. Actually, I'm sorry about Cruella.
