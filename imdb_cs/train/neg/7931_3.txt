The explosion of television channels must be grateful to West Randolph Scott's production line, because at any one time there must be one of those that looks like a hundred Randolph Scott films playing at least one no-budget station. <br /> <br /> The Man of the Pistol is a typical melodrama in the early 1950s with production values ​​prior to WWII, based on a historical topical murderous fence, packed with action scenes to mask the complete absence of character development in the script. i lack of strain. In the coming years, the roles of these films will be taken over by TV shows such as "Gunsmoke", "Bonanza", etc. - and this really did a better job. Randolph Scott, who looks particularly skilful, is the good guy fighting against bad guys against whom he will eventually win. There is no longer any interest in what goes emotionally than what his horse feels, unless you decide to resolve an initial misunderstanding with a woman who leads to the end. Music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of "characters" than acting. But it's okay when your ship sails; and I would not love you for enjoying "Diagnosis, Murder". <br /> <br /> Worker, pedestrian and fast ages. 3 stars for competent assembly; 0 for artistic effort.
