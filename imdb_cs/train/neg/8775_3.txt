LOC could be a very well-written film about how the Kargil War was fought; it had a location, budget and skill to be India's "Save Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it is like a bloated, 4-hour training that attempts to combine the war with the film Masala. Even the war scenes were severely executed, they were using the same hill in all their combat scenes, and they were spending time on occasional conversations. Instead of trying to reach out to the Indian public, a better film would be a book about what happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spend time on a militant view (like "Torah, Torah, Torah"). Even better, he could use a competent director, such as Ram Gopal Verma, to write, edit and edit the film. Until then, I wanted to see that he re-edited some of the films, only with the relevant parts; the film will be more observable.
