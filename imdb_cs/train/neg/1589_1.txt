It's unbelievable that the script as a clich√© and totally absurd could make any screen even the little one. The dialogue in this movie makes Catwoman a high cultural class. Billy Zane plays a bad, harmonious game, Elvis sets out and emits a fighter, a fighter who plays the lives of a former football player who has become a gambling fan who plays the NPR's craptastic "Next Action Star" winner. Its performance is cool as ice, and not cool. "The Movie" takes place in Vegas, and as people play poker, the writers thought it was the perfect environment for a film about a guy who is trying to survive for 24 hours against a ubiquitous, wealthy gambler who offered his $ 2.4 million , go through it through the day. And so the hunt continues. Hunt with a violent explosion, court building, dirty cinematography, and disposable inserts containing the word "bet" or "gamble". The female winner is also worthy of a mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry NAS fans who have lost their unforgettable cameras. A surprising end knocks your socks if you like predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should rethink his decision to sell even more. I wish he gave me two hours of my life back.
