Bo Derek's debut film remained invisible for eight years? and so it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director is practically Ed Wood erotic film? not that it was particularly clear, given that Bo (atypical sports dark hair) was only 16 when the movie was made! Jan also wrote and photographed; the second one leads to some decent engagement of the Greek island against which the story is told? but the rendering is scary and the dialogue violent! <br /> <br /> The character played by the male lead Peter Hooten was brought up with the Bo family: they grew up as a brother and sister, but now in adolescence, the pair find themselves attracted to each other (but, as I said, do not expect any sexual fireworks!). But the worst is the fact that the protagonists each obsess obsession over the whole film, which is not only stupid in itself but irritates in their inappropriateness? Hooten wants to set up a remote fishing community in a modernized seaside resort and still expects a cruise ship to appear (which is, of course, going on at the finals); Derek is still a nut? she longs to hold a large antique bathtub !! For the record, a couple are married up to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> They are also involved in the absence of the mayor of the city and the photographer lothario, who wants to make a model from Bo (and which naturally raises the wrath of jealous Hooten). Occasionally, even for very good reasons, we are even treated with excerpts from the screening of old Hollywood classics in an outdoor movie house to which the whole city is gathered (among the titles are PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! At the end of the day, while Bo's naivety all over is undoubtedly charming, it's not enough to make the film a staggering dullness and amateur.
