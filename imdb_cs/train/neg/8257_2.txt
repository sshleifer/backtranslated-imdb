The Gentleman's Game uses the game of golf in a club club environment to illustrate the adolescents' discoveries of honesty, prejudices, and other life lessons. I've been thinking several times that I know where this film is going, just to make it look bad. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure movie actors ever knew where they were heading. The decisive moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks "Karate Kid" and rejects any idea of ​​becoming a mentor of a teenage golfer. It's a bit refreshing that this film refuses to follow most of the simplifying and elaborate film formulas. However, too much still seems to be how it happened. When a hat falls, people are losing all sorts of courtesies of courtesy, or failing to hold on to things they believe in or are exposed to something far less decent than their place in society. Unfortunately, these moments often do not distinguish. And apart from the fact that the club serves as a background for them, there is no real connection or connection between them. It is a pity that writers and directors could not save a better film, especially with respect to talented actors and potential in setting.
