VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a great disappointment! And though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the script, along with Robert Town, he still appears as a lead written by a dry-guided film of unmarked Buzz Kulik. First of all, the highest billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is bad for this part! He is not charismatic enough to play a great Mexican revolutionary! His one note lacks the fire and the taste of Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could bring to the role. Brynner just looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed as a Mexican bandit, who is in the midst of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian. Also, the second billed by Robert Mitchum is totally useless in the picture! Its part as a biplane flying an ace that attracts domestic bombs from the air as a result of the revolution is a poorly written modest role that could be played by every little star. Mitch does not have a decent line in the film and brings him to his next images of the Mexican Revolution with a superior "Bandid" (1956), unfortunately no one is interested in DVD release. In addition to lacking any style, "Villa Rides" also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! There is star Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum a joyful eye, but her casting is just superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters might be able to add a few bad slits to the unordered story line. There are some good action scenes in the movie, but a few good action scenes are not filmmaking and less than the perfect picture quality of Panavision, and the recurring mood of Maurice Jarre does not help. <br /> <br /> Just like Paramount's custom, there are no accessories - not a trailer! Yup, a disappointed movie and a DVD presentation that could and should be much better.
