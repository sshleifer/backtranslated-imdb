Robin Williams and others had good performances, but the film was boring and was disappointing compared to positive reviews. I thought Sy could become a serial killer that leads people to death: ugly clothes go through his victims around cook courts, Oprah quotes and recites his medical history until they ask him to shoot them. I think the film mostly appeals to the Eomanians who think that strangers are interested in their photos. I expect most retailers want to stop customers.
