It's one of those films that tries to be moody and tense, and instead ends up shutting down all over. When I saw it at a strange film festival, I was interested in writing "a young college", but it ended up quite disappointed. It's hard to criticize the "true story," because there's nothing to do with the conspiracy - but I found it incoherent, melodramatic and totally depressing. It's dark and almost ominous, painting the insidious glimmer of the 1970s with impressive music and jarring details. It just does not work - some scenes where they are so salty, that instead of dampening amazement, my audience suppresses wailing and turning eyes. The story has an interesting assumption, but it only turns into the dark, a spirited spiral.
