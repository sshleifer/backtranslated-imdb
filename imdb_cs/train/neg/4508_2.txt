Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this right now, and I find this movie horrible. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend laugh: "They do it all for men!" <br /> <br /> I suggest that these women have no intensity, no sense of struggle between tragedy and identity and that these men are hardly worth fighting. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins, men look foolishly more than they admire. The Japanese are much more intense than Chinese people, and geisha is Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese have something similar, but the faces do not match the main one. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue is so merciless, so American. If it did European with European orientals, they would do much better work. I have to say: most people who liked the film seem to be Americans. I'm sorry, but it's no wonder. You all spoke to them, not instinctively, not passionately. I think Chinese actresses are beautiful, but I could not say that they are good actors in this movie. Yes, cinematography is great, but I really do not see how it is seen that these characters are intricate, deep individuals. I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be amazing to see.
