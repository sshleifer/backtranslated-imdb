Dear God! I still waited for this movie to "start" ... then I waited for herself to redeem himself ... and when he did not even do it, I just sat there, so I realized that: 1) it might be so bad and 2) that I lost a few hours just for simple stupidity. I had the belief that Drew did not even make a movie ... and boy, I lost my faith! Do not bother with this! Drew was trying, but the film was badly written, badly eaten, and only poorly conceived! I can not believe this scenario that got this bad funded! It had millions of chances to do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too big to qualify!) And STILL did not go anywhere! It's just pitiful! Where another reviewer got the idea that this is not the worst, it does me! Because you believe me, if it was even worse, I cut my wrists before!
