If Fassbinder made a worse movie, I certainly do not want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to see this, learning to appreciate the more free style he chooses in excellent movies such as The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant. This film is covered with so many artistic, quasi-symbolic images that look like a parody of "art film". The scene at the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elvira is a prostitute friend surfing after ten minutes are just two of the saddest examples of what makes this film a real test of spectator perseverance. But what really worries me is just the scenes that Elvira and her ex-wife and / or daughter are all about. These are the only moments that show real human emotions and prove that the heart of this terrible movie was an excellent movie that he tried to free. What a shame.
