It was a movie I could not wait to see! So I finally got it and I was quite disappointed. For the beginning of the film he said so little about New York, just a bunch of mute shots of buildings, streets, bridges, and cafes. He really does not focus on the charm of New York. Another thing that changed me was the French film inside this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French style remake! Anyway, you will notice elements that remind you of French films, such as long and dirty scenes, no or little talk, and of course everyone smokes the French style! The story follows many lives (too much to my taste) and eventually seems to be connected. I feel that the characters were not as well dedicated as the stories. The film was too short to cover all fates with all the happy ends. So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.And you have 120 minutes! if you like active scenes dialogues and this is not the movie for you! I'll give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved casting!
