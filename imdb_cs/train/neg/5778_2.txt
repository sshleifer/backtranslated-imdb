Okay, so I was dying to see this movie. He stoked "who is who" in the horror that is in the movie ... well, my friend rented it, brought it and we started watching it. It was supposed to be a comedy .... I did not make a mourning, until 40 minutes. Does it have to do with the budget? In fact, there are no films that stand in the immediate vicinity and are amazing (just like me). Also, when watching this movie I could not help, but I realized the similarities (eg STEALING) with a low budget indie movie called "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my review on this (this film DESTROYS BTW). <Br /> <br /> This movie ... had the potential it really did. She had a "stellar power", a stolen plot (allows the film behind the backstage of filming ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, it makes me more excited and I think) ... it really could be funny . Many of the jokes fall. The game is fine for what it is. But it went on, it was not fun, and the conspiracy was totally stolen. I give it two because it was not SOOO AWFUL, but that's the only reason.
