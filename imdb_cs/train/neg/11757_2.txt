Hey Arnold! is a slow and slightly boring movie. The story is not very creative. The figure Paul Sorvina (Shenk) buys all the dilapidated buildings at low prices to build a gigantic shopping center, shopping complex and office buildings. This conspiracy takes place in many children's films of the last century. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very exciting, so his idea as a bad guy is not too scary. The Gramps remember something about the historical documentary, and the rest of the film is about the past 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find a documentary with the secret aid Helga whose father hopes to become rich with Shenkov Mall. Children have to move around the city on the buses, and such an exciting chase scene with a bus is not just silly, but underlines how this film is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, a TV cartoon is usually very fun and has the humor to refer to adults. TV cartoon is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hello Arnold's movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to give someone, including children, to sleep. Hey Arnold was tough to stay awake until the predictable and utterly boring end. If you want to send your children to a completely non-offensive movie, that's it. I feel that instead of trying to make a 90-minute movie, the producers started with a 30-minute TV script and tried to extend it for 90 minutes. This Mall Story could definitely be included in the TV cartoon series. Let's hope Arnold bets with a better writer if he ever goes on.
