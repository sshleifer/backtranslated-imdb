I can not believe that the same guy was driving these bullshit and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written if he was badly behaving. This pile can not even say that. It begins with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then ignores the narrative, then describes what happened next. Following the story correctly could have done some good sequel, but Craven decided to go in the style of his older films, have no good tie, but the main name of the villain. Not even the actor plays Dracula was (from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to blonde). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have some respect for your taste in movies.
