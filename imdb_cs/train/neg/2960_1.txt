It is undoubtedly the only worst film ever to have ever been made. There is no argument here. This is it. End of the story. The story is juvenile and submutine, it looks like it was created by a three-year-old fascinated dinosaur. The whole concept is simply stupid. It's unthinkable how anyone could come up with such a stupid thing and think it's fun. The jokes are also totally flawed. If you have not seen this movie yet, consider yourself happy. If your morbidly curious how bad the movie is, please do not make me describe it. Words can not say how this movie is totally horrible. It's not just bad, like when you're a bad movie. Even you have coherence, if not fun. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever said, multiplying its level of badness by 5000, and still not feeling how horrible this movie is. After I made one point to Pok√©mon, I give this film one point, it seems to be nothing but a charity. It is bad. Were the producers and directors even in the movies? Because it's a perfect example of how to make a movie. It seems that this filmmaker comes from some amateur high thinner. If you rented it, take it back and ask for a refund. And do not even think about renting it again.
