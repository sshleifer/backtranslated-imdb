I can only understand why some people might want to emphasize this film relationship with the 1980s, but I really would not say that it is an accurate picture of the lives of most people at that time-even the poorest states in Bradford. But it is typical of the dull agitprop garbage that the expensive old Royal Court Theater was spewing at that time. Lots of "real" arts for small, small audiences, but sufficiently interconnected backslapping to secure future credentials for turgid playrights. It's just the fact that if you want to think about a real shared experience, you will find that millions of people have nodded more when they knew they loved and loved and lived as described in "Gregory's Girl." <br /> <br /> I would be tempted to call it a dramatic "kitchen sink", but that would be a great deal of wrong for the water industry. However, as far as a decent screenplay is concerned, this film is really all-out. For some reason, there has been a special observation among Guardian readers - I can only assume that they will get a visual frisson out of pretending to do it. Tell your friends. It's a bad movie with a bad script that likes to think it crosses the border by adding humorous views to the cruel life on the land. it's not ... but it's gloomy. Place the place.
