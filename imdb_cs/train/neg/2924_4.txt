There was something about that woman's leadership, who had this perfect life that always wanted for the worst possible life, started as a prostitute and ended up with Eric Roberts. But her background prevents him from believing Dean Kain, and eventually destroys it completely. It sounds strange, but I like the position when Dean Cain was at the end and the choice he made. She can not hurt her because she loves her, and she is the mother of his child (I think the time frame clearly shows that he is his child and not his brother), but he can not forgive her for everything she has done sleeping with his brother shows the love and duty he felt was almost the only way) and then he was part of his death. In better hands it would be a better film, but for something I caught in late night's cable, it's not bad.
