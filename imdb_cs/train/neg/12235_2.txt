If you want to know what music the white people listened to in 1974, it's the movie for you. But you will have to listen to a lot of flute and violin too (see my notes on My Girl 1). Fatigue to accept: I approached my girl 2 with cynicism and misunderstanding, just saw his predecessor. But as an adopter who is preparing to finally start looking for my birthday, My Girl 2 has made me look at her topic of looking for a mother. Give another way, everything I liked, nothing to do with My Girl 2, but the relationship with the protagonist who asks, like so many adopters, "who is my mom?" And if there are my mom's home movies in the actor's ensemble, I'm sure to shoot my own movie. <br /> <br /> People are hopeless. Movies should not be free. My girl 2 (like my girl 1) is just ... exhausted. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you are not a full juice that is pleased with a number of minor harassment.
