I have a 5-minute rule (sometimes I leave my left hand for 10). If the movie is not good during the first 5 or 10 minutes, it probably never improves. I have to experience no film that has challenged this theory. Dan in real life is definitely not an exception. I watched this turkey and thought; Wow, it's not funny, does not touch, it's not sad and I do not like any character at all. The story of a counselor / widower raising three young daughters who fall in love with a brother's girlfriend. Do I think a word could become a "consultant who could deal with USE"? I do not know. The dance figure did not come to me because somebody qualified me to advise. I think that's irony? I do not know. He deals with parents, brothers, sisters and their children on an annual family shelter that seems to be very sweet and a potential feed for good comedy, stories ... none that will never appear. The central story is basically how she loves this woman, but she can not have it. Everyone who has a pulse will realize he will eventually get it, but you have to suffer from a painfully dysfunctional and frustrating film dialogue throughout your life, the killer of love that comes to an inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
