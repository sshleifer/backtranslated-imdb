I have never seen Tarzan's movie, so when I saw it, I thought I'd do it. Unfortunately, I must say that I am disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not as I imagined that Tarzan looks. And if it did not happen to me when I made a cup of tea, Tarzan never did his traditional shrieking cry. Also, Tarzan was missing to swing across the trees - to jump from vine to grapevine. Oh, well, so much to expect. Anyway, Jane was there - Cheet Monkey was there. There was a guy with a guitar. There were villains, good guys and romance ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing wrong, you understand, but nothing good. <br /> <br /> Probably the best film that introduced Tarzan: 4/10
