Some guy gets caught up. In a direct look, the other guy shoots him. He has some bodyguards and a killer, but the reporter is interested. She went to the hospital where they took the guy who had gone to death. He enters and plays one bodyguard, but he does not feel like talking. I can not figure out why. It's not like he's interested in someone else. There's only reporter there. Anyway, her editor discourages her from working on this charming story. But hey, just like her. She's going to see a murderous sister and mom. Several minutes after she left, they got a great deal of time - someone tossed a trailer - a huge fireball. She then searches the bodyguard from the hospital. He finds him aboard a ship, but a minute later, he is sucked into a diving tank underwater because the three boys are trying to destroy them (and for a long time burned the ship - a huge ball of fire). The reporter and bodyguard destroy the two boys trying to get them out. <br /> <br /> During the next hour, another guy appears on the street, there's a shootout in several hiding places in the warehouse, some chasubles with wreck and death, false suicide, etc. Lotsa stiffs, all kinds of massacres. <br /> <br /> A great thing, but what the reporter and bodyguard can not figure out is why he got a pretty guy in hell. What is the motivation? Of course, it could help us find out why the reporter is even interested. Almost all of this is the only reporter of the story. Nobody else in the media matters. Not even with all the big fiery balls and corpses. It is true that the original boy who got into the eyes was not exactly a celebrity. His work was somewhat boring. It was just the president. Yeah, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a secret service agent. <br /> <br /> It's a spoiler? <br /> <br /> This should be. After all, there are no television cameras, no other news reporter, no blogger ... just another of those police blotters of crimes ... So what's a spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme to think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The Spoiler is that his wife did it! Yeah ... First lady. It was ruled out because the president had deceived himself. And she's running away. It's really sharp, is not it? But how can anyone solve it? Why would anyone be bothered? After all, only one reporter is even interested. <br /> <br /> I give this move "1". It was so silly that I had to keep looking. And just that was stupid! This is a real spoiler! But even if I told you, you have to see it!
