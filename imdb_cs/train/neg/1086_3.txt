Despite its impressive cast and crew, the Pernik Man pedigree disintegrates early and often. Give it an unrealistic tangle, actors sports bad accents and director Robert Altman is participating in collecting a reward. Once again he has made an impressive cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman), this time the letter is a miscast. But that's just part of the problem. Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a high-performance Georgian lawyer who can tirelessly lead a mysterious waitress in heavy-casting scenes to persuade him to be in serious danger from a former husband and crazy father. With red flags, the ubiquitous lawyer breeds and even manages to get his children into misfortune. Fighting with a gun and a fist followed along with the desired pursuit of cars, and if it is not enough, the hurricane is worthy of laughter. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with a gentle and unconvincing southern accent. Running in the trench in all weather situations is blind to what is obvious to keep the story. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is as bad as P.I. but with a little more emphasis on a bad accent. Robert Duvall as an old man is Boo Radely all grew more crazy than a lion that serves a dense bunch of ham but at least it's likely. Women leading (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are lean legs and still. Even the celebrity lawyers who made portraits (Vernon Jordan) are wooden with a few gossips they have. In addition to paying close attention to his actors, Altman's mission en scene splashing with the Spanish moss is dark and formless, his action scenes of a comic book. Missing his slight touch and observation (informs the viewer that Stars and Bars are still waving in Georgia) that make well-executed Altman so unique. Unfortunately, gingerbread is Altman in his worst, even though the salary is the same.
