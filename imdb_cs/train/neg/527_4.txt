They say they will die in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave dies but before she starts telling her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... This is one of those movies that have the look and the expectation that they are a great movie simply because they have so many great actors and actresses , so it seems to be something other than a potboiler that it really is. It's not that bad, but Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all are gentle) expect more than a creepy story than Harlequin romance. Wait for the cable.
