I looked at it because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and cold cars that might appear. I guess I was lying. This movie is very boring. The film begins with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi), who sits at the Porsche dealer and checks for the right car. When he confirms that it is correct, Kip gets the brick trunk and scribbles it at the window and breaks it. He gets Porsche while his friend gets the keys. He starts the car and enters the night. They deliver them to the warehouse only to be followed by the police. So the entire crew kicks out all the cars and goes their separate ways. Then we look at Memphis Raines. He gives a little bit of speech to a group of children on a go-kart track. Then he is confronted with Atleum Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in deep sand *. Memphis is known as one of the most popular car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis heads to the junkyard and meets Raymond Calitrim (Christopher Ecclesten). The guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars in 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are several issues with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48 in the movie take place when Cage and Duvall search for the crew and plan everything. The last 12 hours in the movie is waste! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You can see from ten of ten cars, as the movie promotes. So, where are the next 40 cars? Why do not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. Chase: Chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not exciting at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog runs burgers and will also swallow three keys. It is impossible. The keys were open. Keys would severely damage the esophagus, stomach, and large intestine. Boys suggest the dog laxatives to help him quench. It will not work. The dog gets a lot of diarrhea, but no keys. It was stated in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a toy car up to his rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. The same case with a dog. <br /> <br /> 5. Cop During Chase: When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries desperately to run the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who does not see his car at all. But just as Nicholas Cage restarts the engine, the police officer jerks his head to the right, sees the car, and immediately begins to chase after him. It's stupid. So, when he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He only sees what is in the background. Overall, the film is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The film is stupid. I have never seen the original, but I plan. I give this movie one star out of 10. Get fast and furious instead.
