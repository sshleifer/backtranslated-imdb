Soon after watching this movie, you realize why it has not led to theaters! This film does not deserve the "prequel" tag. Instead, it's a common theme in Hollywood that has previously released good movies with disastrous prequel, sequel, and so on. Film entree hopped everywhere, like ping pong, and character's development was nonexistent. I really felt I was watching some comedy in movies, because acting was so bad. P Diddy needs to stop tainting the movies with his terrible acts, he actually laughed at me every time. The only good thing that comes out of this film is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in this movie and actually brought some pleasure from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the great Carlito Way, I recommend that you do not want to watch it. If you decide to follow it the same way, then treat this movie as if it broke the original, because that's exactly what he did.
