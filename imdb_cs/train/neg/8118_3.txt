Well, EYEboy, I have to say that it will not allow me if someone separates me and tries to make me kidding me, especially when it's someone who looks as smart as you. My favorite part of your post was "But no big bang-bang good guy bad-here, kimosabe." I think he was holding a movie with lot bang bang. I like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that do not have a lot of action if they are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies do not fit into this category and it's just a very bad movie. I really do not see many non-American movies, so I may have been spoiled and I did not realize how bad foreign movies are when I saw secrets and lies. Perhaps, when I consider foreign films a different standard, I could sometimes see how secrets and lies can become one of the best rated IMDB films. Hmm ... If that's true, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new e-mail)
