Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie) wandered into the post of apocalypse of the wilderness (after her protector died in old age, said the protector played by Elias Koteas, a real decent actor) and now she finds that people roam rubbish looking for cyborgs to trade for metal scrap and cash. She leads a group of burnt cyborg (This includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and the human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against hunter Hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes on screen like Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 has managed to be better than the other two items, but it's still a pretty boring feature. The problem here is that potential ideas are never used well, action sequences are routine, and cast names such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given little. Haje is a really crazy heroine and Lynch is too high (as usual) and the film has no inspiration or ambition to be as fun as a cheerful predecessor. (One with Van Damm, the other is just boring.) Disappointment is also a sci-fi angle that almost aggressively resists any good idea he has. As an action movie it's routine and numerical B-movie stuff and is competently made, that's the only thing I can say positively. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (Bad).
