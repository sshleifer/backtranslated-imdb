Pet Sematary, although a nice 80th horror movie with a pleasant director and atmosphere, is a copy of PEDI Avati's Italian ZEDER film. It is obvious that Stephen King copied almost all of the director's thoughts (the Zeder movie was made before King wrote a book) Cat, country, everything copied, this is a plagiarist case but it's Stephen Kind famous American writer, it's absolutely normal, it's obviously because of the enormous difference between such types of Italian films that have no budget (and in part it's the same crap ...) but the original idea, I repeat, it's Italian director Avati /> <br /> Let the world know
