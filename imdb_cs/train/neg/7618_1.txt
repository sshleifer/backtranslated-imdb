This is not a cinema. It's not a talent. It's not informative. It's not scary. It's not fun. It's nothing. <br /> <br /> I have it because my cousin says, "Diablo! COOL!" Yeah, right. The only thing that was good about this experience was the fact that I did not buy it, but instead I leased it. <br /> <br /> It's shot like a bad soap opera. No, wait. Soap operas at least LOOK professional ... sorta. This? Looks like he was shot by somebody's camera. It's scary! Poor! That sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fiery! WHEN IS THIS DIRECTOR? I did not even have to worry about looking at him. He is failing! The performances of these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than he deserved. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> This is registered by 0.3 / 10 on the scale "A" since ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
