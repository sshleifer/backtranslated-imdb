Camp Blood III is a tremendous improvement on Camp Blood II, because it has mostly the right sound and basic sculpture. This time, they ventured a little further from the car park, where two more movies were filmed in good motion because you can no longer hear the cars driving around the remote wilderness. <br /> <br /> This is the reality of a TV show and a fake clown that scares participants. It's hardly a new idea, I've seen at least three other horror films with the same assumption that a real killer has appeared, but at least he has a conspiracy instead of people who are accidentally stabbed with a knife. > <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, this is at least good for a few laughs. I liked the sound of an armed sound when somebody got prematurely punctured and the way the boom mike floats behind people like a phantom. I do not know why anyone would like to do the third Camp Blood movie, I would think it would be better to start from the beginning, but at least try this one. A half-deformed woman was a little too much for me, apparently trying to maintain continuity by hiring some freak that would choose the dress for $ 5, just like in the second movie. They still have not worked out that the machete is used for cutting, not stinging, but well, it's a film about Camp Blood, what do you expect? If you like stupid movies, you get some fun.
