<br /> <br /> The film "Slugs" is unique, because titular pests are actually good guys in this terrible story about nature. You see, these bad slugs have been mutated by the pollution of evil people, and you should not do anything wrong, they're just slugs - sharp-skinned slugs who eat meat and poison, but slugs nevertheless. Real bad guys are people who are either actively trying to destroy our beloved slugs, or over-react when they meet them. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the guy puts on the gloves full of slugs. They were sitting in a comfortable working glove when this giant hand did not get anywhere, and they responded instinctively, defending themselves and biting it. Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his jerky bite, this guy runs around the greenhouse, shouting like an idiot, pouring out some highly volatile chemicals, lighting a fire, knocking on the library, and cutting off his own hand - then fire and volatile chemicals and his house explodes. How can you blame the culprit? <br /> <br /> This film draws a portrait of people who are less than favorable. The characters in this movie include a stupid sheriff who hates everyone, a drunk boy who is for his dog, and a chest whose wife is forty five years older than he. There is also a set of drunken teens <br /> <br /> who are attacked while docking and we have to see the skinny genitals of long-haired junk. Meanwhile, there is a person who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson who yells, "You have no authority to declare the best birthday!" for some reason. Finally, this show of resistance is over with a guy from the classic "Under People" MST3K, whose face explodes after whipped cream (another easily avoided fate that blamed useful, harmless slugs). <br /> <br /> People are portrayed as greedy, silly, racist, alcoholic, and in one useless scene as future oppressors. In the top scene of the movie, villains try to burn slugs who helplessly settle in the canals. Well, because they are idiots, people can climb the whole city. They just do more damage than the slugs ever did! If you hate people, and I know I will, you will appreciate the "Slugs". If you are a fan of bad cinema, you will also appreciate this career from director "Pieces" and "Under People". There is plenty of wrongdoing, stupid dialogue, illogical conspiracy, lame special effects, unnecessary scenes, and bad dubbing to get your attention.
