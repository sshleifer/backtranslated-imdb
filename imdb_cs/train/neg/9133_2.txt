This is a rigorous review of the pilot episode that appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> The TV moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means I'm immune to the nostalgic spell that Moonlighting has for most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (The possible spoiler warning) Pilot Moonlighting is your basic "cave man meets fluffball" yarn where the "charming" hen-man red-heel manipulates the wrong woman into what he really wants and needs. The premises on which the joke scenario is based must have felt motionless around 1950. It also contains some honestly wrong writing, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furniture instead of filming the villains, strictly because a woman who needs masculine help can do herself. I often feel that Susan Faludi was exaggerating when she saw the masculine chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I am with her all - BACKLASH's moonlight has been printed. In one sense, however, this DVD is required for all serious Bruce Willis fans: besides the pilot's episode, it includes a screen test that landed Willis at work. Both features show how awesome Willis's acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I'm a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
