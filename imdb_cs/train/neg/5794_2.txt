The Germans all stand out in open space and crawl with a machine gun. Good guys will never die unless it's for dramatic purposes. "plot" has so many holes, which is ridiculous. (Where did the German soldiers go as soon as they filled the fuel tank to the train? Erik Estrada?) And the whole thought of kidnapping a train? How sad it is! The Germans know where you're going, it's not like you could leave the track and leave! What a shame. I'd rather jump on my head and I'd have to sit again for ten times. I mean, seriously, it was like it was made in the 1960s, but it was made in 88! 1988 !! A-Team is more credible than this terrible justification for the film. Just watch if you need a good laugh. This film is Tele Sevalas, what Green Beret was John Wayne.
