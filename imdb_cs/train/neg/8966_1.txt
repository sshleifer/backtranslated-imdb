The original "Cube" is a fantastic B-movie rich in paranoia, massive characterization and great timeless performances. It's scary, mysterious and cold. And it's absolutely good, in itself, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third (!) movie in the Cube series is part of the protest (most of the pitfalls are sadly recycled), partial aberrations. It's a courageous step to explain what is a cube - something that was never found in the first movie - but because the explanation is insignificant, it would rather be secret. There are some potentially interesting references to a society that exists outside of the cube, but they never appear above the hints of any political and religious totalitarian state. So, what little social commentary feels flat and out of focus. What works? Basically nothing. It's a purely amateur hour, speed is slow (how many of the two fools are watching this screen?) And the effects of the gore, when rebelled, were not convincing. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of the fan of "Cube," an unbeatable and sophomorphic clone of good film that definitely did not need a sequel.
