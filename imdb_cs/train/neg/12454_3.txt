I've read here articles about Wonder Woman for this TV movie. It should be emphasized that at the time the film was shot, she was not wearing traditional clothes. In fact, the producers kept the concept of a comic book writer about WW in the early seventies. As for the film itself, I have to agree with many other posters. Snoozefest! I was a kid when he first appeared at ABC in 1974, so I was right when I was honored with the film about the comic book hero. Still, I plotted the conspiracy, stopped watching three-quarters of the film. Of course I was not at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
