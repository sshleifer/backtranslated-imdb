*** One of the ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it were, it will get F. The Holy Mother of God Mary was so bad. I think I provided her with all reasonable accommodation because I was dealing with it as a direct movie on the video, but it kept me at every step. Like many other B movies, the basic story was decent and the creators seemed to have a reasonable amount of resources, but executions were ridiculous. It's a pity that they have added the good name Halloween to this fiasco. The basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual Halloween Spooky Fund House to float when the Satanic Magic Book appears from nothing and throws the boys from frate into living hell. So it's the same idea, but instead most of the film is devoted to portraying these squadrons of boyfriend boy relationships that rely on a nasty lesbian subplot. Very little true story is dedicated to Halloween or mysterious book magic. In fact, I'm crazy that movie makers thought they could get away. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about brotherhood relationships. This is not what the movie is charged as. I am tempted to trace the producers and at least to be in danger of harming them. The game is about as bad as it is, it's terrible! The script is inadvertently entertaining. Cinematography is simply lazy. The entire movie is an amateur night. This film really makes the production of the SyFy film channel a masterpiece. The last half hour of the film seemed to be the filmmakers realized they did not produce soap opera and had to throw some kind of horror sequence. The evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone into a haunted house into a figure they dress like. I almost feel like crying when I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was an undetectable disaster.
