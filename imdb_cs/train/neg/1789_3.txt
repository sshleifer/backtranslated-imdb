Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I consider this film to be especially grateful. Maybe because I'm from another era and other countries, but I think Crosby's constant references to good old US are initially pleasant, sad after a while and finally unpleasant. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American at all - but it seemed that Englishmen do not have the right and / or need this brave, so smart American visitor to show their way. It's the story of "fish from the water", but unlike most films of this kind, this time it's a "fish" that has the upper hand. To be fair about both myself and the film, I've been watching it for a couple of years and I got the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (I saw another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that also caused me the same reaction, and to my surprise, my wife - who, for what is worth, is an American - she found American Crosby's "face to face" is irritated, Roosevelt, as she said.) As far as the film's premise is concerned, it's good enough for his day, and of course, his support is very good. Scene and music are good as well as great costumes - although I agree with the previous reviewer that the William Bendix wig looks awfully (picture Moe from The Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> All of it will be a much more enjoyable picture without Bing Crosby's attitude, but because there's practically every shot, it's pretty hard to sit in this movie.
