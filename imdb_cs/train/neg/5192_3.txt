It will not take long before you find out why the code name: The Diamond Head has not arrived in the network plans. The TV pilot will not get credits until it's clear how bad it is. Perhaps I missed something because the plot did not make much sense. Based on what I get from a confused mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something in common with a secret weapon. The worst secret agent in the world, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), stops him. Maybe it was more, but believe me? but it really does not matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies should take action. Miraculous moments should be stressed. And dramatic moments should be drama. It's nothing in the code name: Diamond Head. Did I see others using the word "turgid" to describe this for TV snoozer? and it's better than any description of words I can come up with. None of the characters are the least exciting or worth taking care of. And Roy Thinnes thinks the worst leads. His charisma is only slightly north of the slug. Ian McShane is the best for the movie, but unfortunately for everyone else, he seems to return as a regular member. Now that McShane was cast in a lead series, you might have something. I quickly find out that these horror films from the 1970s made for television make the great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that's double if Quinn Martin is involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and Bots. So when I can give the film only 3/10, I'm going to Episode # 608 and 4/5 on my MST3K rating.
