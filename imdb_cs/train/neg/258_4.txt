This is the first time I've seen a movie with Jamie Foxx and I bet it will be my last. I do not understand why it's fun, though people in the audience thought it was very fun when he turned to the camera or said, "I'm going to marry." <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy will be a good guy. A good boy has a wife, so the evil man uses it. Meanwhile, officials are hiding. Final scenes are absolutely incredible. Have you spent 2 years and millions of dollars chasing the guy, but do not do your homework to solve the trivial puzzle? There is no great acting, there is no plot or plot, and photography takes place in the style of MTV. Do not waste money on this. <br /> <br />
