When you talk about global warming, it becomes very strange: science is coming out of the window and "faith" and "consensus" become the topic of discussion. That's because I give the missing mark Al Gore. Instead of supporting intelligent debate, he maintained the debate on the level of "faith" and "consensus". Of course, when you are trying to sell the world to billions of dollars in spending "to stop global warming," you may know that it is a problem to tell the scientific truth: we do not know how much warming has been caused by humans. Perhaps it was not, maybe it could be, or that it was a bit more ice, and we were really lucky we did not cook the planet. But the fact remains that we do not know. <br /> <br /> so we are asked to "trust" in "match". It does not matter that any scientist who discards the "consensus" is excluded. It does not matter that the scientific inquiry concerns a shift away from consensus. Einstein "did not believe" the consensus, Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So why did so much convince the very researchers who would continue the field by asking hard questions? If global warming is so indisputable, certainly few people who test this theory can not be so horrible. What's going on? This is the movie I hoped Al Gore would do. Istead has decided to support his support with genuine "consensus" "consensus." <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
