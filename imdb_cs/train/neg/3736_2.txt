This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams went in as if the rhinoceros had fallen into a tutu, so his performance was still pitiful. Kurt Russell was more credible, but he was still terrible. The conspiracy left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was terrible too. The only thing this movie went through was a trailer that made me lose 90 minutes of my life, which could be better spent trying to lick the back of my head. benefit and burn this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy not to.
