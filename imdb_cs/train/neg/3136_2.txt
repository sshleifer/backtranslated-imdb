There is a lot of obvious hummus with this movie. Let's just read it, the main reasons why anyone would do it for Leo and Cate, who may not necessarily be the best actor in this movie. I'm not saying they are not good actors, I say they have fun in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I tell movie makers a good job that makes the ship look pretty), but IT has even a few big flaws. For example, just before the ship falls, you see your unfinished image on the blue screen as your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the story of REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to this story. The editing was terrible - there is no reason for no movie to be more than 2 1/2 hours (except MAYBE biographical film) and writing and the screenplay was horribly stomon. <br /> <br /> I say that music might have been better than I could have predicted (and not just the song "My heart will go on"). There is one scene that stands out for me when a boat sinks and hears crazy music. This could be the very top of the movie. As for the mood, it was extremely boring. I was much more sincere than sad when Jack died, which I know can not be what the director intended. I felt horrible in the nut shell that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into a hype cat.
