"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolutely spooky break from Luca Besson's classic "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is essentially a woman who is taken and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission for them. (Pretty the same historical structure of La Femme Nikita) Actor combo Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history. Lamas' "acting" is just a bad rendition of Steven Segal. Watching Orenthal's acting in this movie is an unreal experience. Writing and acting is so poor in this movie that it's sometimes ridiculous. There are so many ridiculous action films in the movie: unnecessary car bombs, glass-flying people, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. The musical score is reminiscent of David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which supports Steven Segal from this film. There's a lot of martial arts in the movie, and it's pretty well done for low-budget US productions. An insignificant event, and despite top acting, will never leave and I have to admit that I was a little fun. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas had an action star appearance in the early 1990s, but he is definitely not an action star, so he does serials and not action stars. My recommendation is that you skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and look at "La Femme Nikita".
