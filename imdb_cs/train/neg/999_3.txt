Last night I saw the film "Descent" at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a great disappointment. Disappointment, because the story was potentially strong, the prospect of Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate film was exciting and like a fan (I just was not!) I was useless from "70s / rapes" Let's say we are very curious to check this movie. My conclusion: keep a classic! Yes, the plot has the potential, but the dialogues are flat, the actors are not convincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that it is the right picture of the university world in the US that the emptiness of the character serves the purpose and everything that jazz does but makes the whole film insignificant. Just like the scene where Dawson gets raped: Seriously lacking in intensity! I did not expect anything of "irreversible" style, but yet, do not we think we would feel compassion? I did not do it. Not for a minute was the lamela all the way ;-) And I read that the photo was impressive. Well, it's really good, but not even what's over. I have to admit that the screening was not so good, so maybe I missed something, but at the end of the movie I could not help thinking, "I feel I'm looking back at Argento's" Inferno. "It's even more serious that the first scene in the club is beautifully shot, and I also had a hot feeling that I was looking at a longer and boring version of the scene in a dirty bar near the US-Canadian border at Lynch's Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me '... rough red and blue lights, heavy bass music, a general lascivous / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just could not get into this movie, too bad.
