The whole genre of Biker must be composed of the worst movies ever shot. This causes a lot of fighting, a generous amount of blood, bikers struggling against the Indians, and a dense city that gets up and hits one hut. The game is out of horror. What has happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point, he was in some major studio productions and then simply disappeared. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen Biker for a long time, it's good to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a bit obscene because you watched him!
