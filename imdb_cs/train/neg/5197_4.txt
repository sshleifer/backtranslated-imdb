Poor entry to Bulldog Drummond, starring John Howard. Common funny banter and antics, but not too much. Barrymore does something to do when the inspector exchanges disguises to watch Drummon, Algy and Tenny on a wild goose persecution (mostly in circles, perhaps the budget was tighter than usual) to rescue the poor Phyllis who are held in captivity by people wanting to bring Drummona to his perdition. For those who hold the score, in this Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is afraid that the child's baptism is missing. It's fun to see that Algy and Tenny dress up as fishermen to get together in the Fisherman's Rest, but they just rise up over the stupidity.
