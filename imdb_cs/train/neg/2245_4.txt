This film is not the same as 1954 with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that's a shame because the 1954 version is much better in my opinion. I do not want to deny the talent of Barbra Streisand at all. She is a good actress and great singer. I'm not familiar with another work of Christ Kristofferson, so I can not decide. However, this film leaves much to be desired. It moves slowly, has a homeless and a bad tongue, and it can be very difficult to sit. However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I'd love Judy Garland's version better. Check out the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris and judge yourself.
