Buford's Beach Bunnies gives B-grade T & A movies a bad name. As a fan of this genre I was horrified when I found out that little attempts had been made to exploit young actress talents. In particular, I refer to a significant lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What is the next generation of sad teenage boys watching on late night TV?
