Everyone involved (and the audience) should look for a "Candidate" to see how good this movie could be. What happened to the South American story? What Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw were meant to allow their roles to be cardboard cutouts. So far I have liked all the performances of Gene Hackman and / or the film. He was either uninterested (which I hardly believe) or terribly wrong. I also liked and defended Richard Gere (and was ruined for that). But here he had no "power". He was never intimidating and only occasionally convincing. Overall, I was very disappointed. I really waited a lot more from this director and cast. If you can not find "The Candidate" watch "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
