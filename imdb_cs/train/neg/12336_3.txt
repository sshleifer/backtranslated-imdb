I give it five out of ten. All five grades are for Hendrix, who supplies a very good set of her last day. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera and its editing is approaching scary! We have countless full-length shots of Hendrix where he could almost do anything, and maybe it could be? We do not see his hands on the guitar that's a point! Did we also get a bunch of Hendrix shots from behind? There seem to be three cameras on Hendrick, but the amateur fools are all working. The guy in front of Hendrick seems to be willing to wander in the lazy way around the stage, as if Hendrix's guitar was a mere distraction. While this guy is forced to reset in several cats in the booths before actually demonstrating the incredible guitar work that bleeds the amplifier (the soundtrack is good with Wally Heider). The tracks are scattered by clips of students who lose their protest against Vietnam etc. On tracks like the Gun Machine, the complete waste of the movie! If Hendrix lived for two more years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never see the light of day until a full official release. The only jewel it contains is the unbelievable Johnny B Good, but all in a pretty bad visual documentary of this great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
