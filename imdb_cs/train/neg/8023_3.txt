After watching this movie on DVD I watched the trailer. Voice overlay describes the movie as unreal. Well, it's unreal and it's unreal. <br /> <br /> In fact, there was only one part of the movie that seemed to me to be unreal, but frankly, it was more confused than surrealistic. Other unusual pictures, especially the dining room where everyone was on the floor, were so absurd that they did not make sense. I do not mind pictures that do not mean anything but these scenes seemed irrelevant. My impression is that the director tried to show Logan's internal monologue. I do not know what would explain what is happening. Unfortunately, nothing I've ever seen gave me a clue as to what Logan is thinking about, what his perspective or even his emotional state is. All I could say was that he was not particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he had an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the end signaled what the relationship between the boys was, but it did not do much. Intentional neighboring scenes with those that were easier seemed more like a cop than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> But just as the movie was difficult and inconclusive for me, it was a certain change in tempo. I really liked Madagascar's skin and I felt that this film longed for such a narrative, and maybe even in style. It even failed. There is no doubt about me: this film deserves effort A but D for execution.
