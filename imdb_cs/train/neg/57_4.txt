What makes the "executive producer" in the movie. If I remember correctly, it is the person who raised the financial support to shoot the film. You may notice in a large number of films played by Sean Connery that he is also a powerful producer, which meant that Connery himself raised his money because he is a major player. Unfortunately, it should also be emphasized that a large number of films "played with Sean Connery exclusively because he managed to raise money because he is the main Hollywood player, it is usually a sign that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the film are the same and the same thing, the film itself is nothing more than a stellar vehicle whose story / scenario is not scratched PROTOCOL follows the David David David and a coconut bamboo cocktail waitress who saves the visiting dignitary and as a reward she is becoming a top diplomat. Probably, as Mrs. Davis (who has the difficulty of putting the two sentences together) finds itself in much more extreme and less likely situations. When I say PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn, who is also a powerful producer movie, do you understand what I'm saying about the story / script not boring?
