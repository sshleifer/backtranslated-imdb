Let me be saying that I watched this video watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked as if always the greatest horror, even though I thought it was pretty good. Bleed is pretty bad. It is best to see a female cast naked. Gore is very fake and overcome. It has its funny parts, but it's extremely predictable and I did not want to stay to see a terrible end. If I could, I would forbid these actors and actresses, the only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has more than a hundred other videos and also saw two other cast members in the same or worse movies. They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
