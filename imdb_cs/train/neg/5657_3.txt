I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but writing on the screen of this movie just did not work for me. The story jumps strangely (since then I learned that the movie is missing part) and the characters appear and disappear with an irritating sudden mood. Some internal titles are too explanatory (for example, "why you are no longer a child!") - shorten the picture to a long, slow rhythm - "you are a woman!" Yes, we got it for the first time), but there are several talking sequences asking for an explanation that will never appear. (We hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend argument, please!) A plot that includes incestuous desires (figuratively, if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was hard to follow. To the author's judgment, this problem was considered a problem, and the May-December match is not portrayed as the true and innocuousness of some Mary Pickford films (eg "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney performs well, as usual, but I think he was better targeted in the past - IMHO has handed it over several times. I liked the clown sequence and was very impressed with stuntmen. Loretta Young was charming, though amazingly young. The film has its moments, but so far it's my least favorite film by Chaney.
