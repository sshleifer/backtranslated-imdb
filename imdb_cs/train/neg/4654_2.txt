The female vampire kills young women and the colors of their blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so she has to do what she orders or be turned into blood. After several killings, the assistant becomes regret and falls in love with the homeless. What can I say about this movie? The fact that her transition is slow, she has some strange sound effects (never interested in biting) and the atmosphere (the new jazz comes here) and that the lights seem to be not part of the set. It looks like a "auteur" horror film with all self-sufficiency inside. The conspiracy is utterly stupid, and as you can guess, it's a vampire that explains how to kill it, even if you do not have to do it; of course, cross, light, garlic, and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not a sad, dirty movie. Maybe with some friends and a lot of beers, he can not have his funny parties (to be honest, it's funny within 10-15 minutes near the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by the Troma label, it's the bad film they pose.
