Just like Orson Welles thirty years ago, Mike Sarne got the "biggest train set in the world" to play, but unfortunately lacked the ability to do more than watch his train set become the wreck of a train that is still talking about shock and a special curiosity. Despite postmodernist interpretations that somehow understands as homosexual or even feminist, the fact is that it was a major disaster in 1970, and today it remains one. How would anyone who has the resources available to Mr. Sarne have the best secrets. Only Michael Cimino has ever approached the political and artistic Armageddon, which forms the "heavenly gate". Both films looked like ego trips for their directors, but at least Mr. Cimino made one of the best films of the 1970s before telling studio delight while Mr. Sarne had only sleeping "Joanna" in his closet. In addition, the "Heavenly Gate" boasted some unforgettable and well-crafted sets where Myra Breckinridge's cabinet was tragically bare. Simply put, it is predominantly the worst example of biting a hand that feeds on Hollywood's history.
