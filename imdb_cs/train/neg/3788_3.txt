There is plenty here. Actors are the first level and the script provides a good dialogue that best captures the atmosphere of a tight, family-friendly family. That's why the movie does not work true. We see that Leo, who has apparently learned about his HIV positive diagnosis, basically reacts in a way that is inconsistent with the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. The film also ends a bit suddenly, and it avoids what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family have had to deal with in the light of his love for him. The young actor, played by Leo's brother Marcel, is impressive, for he is generally the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the screenwriters could not decide whether they want a faithful dissertation about the effects of HIV on a functioning and attractive family, or about the devastation of HIV on the victim - and that's just what the two suggest. While this film provides the idea of ​​food, it leaves the viewer much more than it delivers.
