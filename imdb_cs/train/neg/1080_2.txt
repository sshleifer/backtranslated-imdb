How could the director of Altman's experience ever be expecting to spend time taking care of what happens, a leading figure that is a neurotic, whiner, blockbuster without redeemed qualities - that's the central puzzle about this deeply confused piece of work. A huge piece of waste. In addition to this paralyzing deficiency, the fence line also requires a serious concentration. The setting that enters Branagh's character is so obvious that we have set up from the beginning that we tend to ask whether the writer and the director have completely lost respect to their viewers. This last question is at the core of the film: it presents overhead self-clarity with deep contempt for the tastes, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
