I read the review that you had to be students in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand. Perhaps it is true, if so, then this movie is obsolete. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The end ends like all the children who are anti-government and anti-corruption without having a better solution that does not involve the company into Mad Max madness. Yeah, the main characters might be gone, but no. The reasons why they do not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What gets rid of a lot of innocent people is meant to mean that it's never explained or even undefined. It is mentioned that war is the ultimate creative expression, which is perhaps the only revelation that some characters of this film have and that does not make sense. Characters that go to murderous glory do not fight the institution, they just kill people. I thought they could use all the explosives to throw the place, or at least the sanctuary at the end, that would have meant a more symbolic sense, but they did not. <br /> <br /> - This film is a teenage glare of fighting authority that challenges them even when they really need it. It has no moral, symbolic truth or meaning; this film just plays the fantasy of killing teachers and people in "power" that bother you. If you think murder storm / school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and rational way to deal with teachers and institutions that you do not like, then I think you will love this movie. If you are like me and you are working to make yourself blind (very blindly in this movie) revolt against "men," this film is immature and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also say in part that funding was missing and the story seemed to have a touch of attention. Overall, it looks like a very crude suggestion of what could have been but no effort is put into dialogue, development of character or morality, so it's just wrongly done. If ... I could just get my two hours back.
