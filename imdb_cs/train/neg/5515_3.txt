There are many good things that can be said for this cartoon; backgrounds are rich, lush and full of nicely made decorations. Animation is at the usual studio standards of a time that is undoubtedly higher than the current ones. However, for many reasons it is boring. <br /> <br /> Music: It's definitely not in line with the usual Scott Bradley standards. Although it is supposed to be a evocative "Great Gatsby" setting, it ends up being terrible, sleepy, repetitive and monotone (repeating and monotone are not the same as Beethoven's 5th symphony confirms). Since most people (including myself) tend to close their eyes while yawning, there is plenty of visual part of the cartoon that the average viewer will miss. Story: I'm not giving away secrets that are not yet in the land overview - good country, bad town. This is a common theme in movies, animated and alive, ever since. It is a bad nostalgia for non-existent rural idyll, which today is reflected in similar nostalgia to "values" that have never been.
