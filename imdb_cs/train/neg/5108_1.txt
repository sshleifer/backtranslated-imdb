I can not help, but he was allowed to people who praise this show as hearty and tearing. For one, it is totally unrealistic that these people will have a perfect life after their new homes. How can these families keep these new mega-homes? And what about their poor neighbors? Real estate tax must increase after this happens. Moreover, the noise would upset me. <br /> <br /> Second, how extreme can a TV show be in reality? It's practically the same weekly week after week. We are familiar with the suffering family, renovate the house, then surprise the family and everyone breaks Kleenex boxes. And not to mention how boring part of the renovation is. The only interesting part of the show is to see how the house looks, but the segment is also destroyed by fake confessions and constant sobbing. "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show that pretends to be honest but falls flat. Skip this. If you love real estate TV, "Survivor" is far better and moves.
