I have seen it recently and I have to say that I was moved to the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" does not work as a movie. However, I'm looking forward to seeing the document that the producers who organized this project thought it would be a much more convincing work than this movie. The international cast was composed of B - but their conduct was reasonable and I must pay special attention to the young actress who played Holly. It was her first film role and she did a really nice job because it is her most demanding part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was reasonable but ruthless as Patrick, an American whose aim is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this final role. Regrettably, despite my mostly favorable opinion of Virginia Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both of these actors were very forgotten and did not do the best work in this film. I believe in the message and intention of the film, but I had to be fair, so I appreciate the 3 stars "Holly" on the basis of my shortcomings as a movie. But I think the subject deserves serious consideration, and I am delighted that the people behind this film also made a documentary film that I hope will debut on the BBC and other TV networks.
