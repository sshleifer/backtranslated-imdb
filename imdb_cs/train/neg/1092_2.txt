Well, I think the good news of William Winckler's 2001 "The Double-A Avenger" is that he is able to combine three of the mammoth miracles Russ Meyer - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in one picture. (I can assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy in the week when they shot this thing ... or they could see a copy of the script!) The bad news, though (and there is plenty), is that this movie - if it is even possible to say that when it was shot directly on the video - it's complete wreckage, total abortion, exorcism, absolute abomination and really one of the worst pictures I've ever seen. Check out the weakest superhero movie ever made! The story here is what she is doing with Kitto getting superstars after uniting a rare plant coconut plant in South America to cure breast cancer (oy) and later fighting with a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in LA Damn that every lame breast joke that slipped out, (except for some of Kitten's old photos in its bloom) and that some shaving cream and paper-mache boulder are the sum of the special exchange rate. Meyer's girls are a bit long in the tooth / saggy in the chest, and kindly, though Sheri Dawn Thomas, like the bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Manages to excel nicely. So why did I give this juvenile, unsuccessful, unsuccessful embarrassment of the movie 2 Stars instead of 1? To be brief: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice commentary on the special features of the DVD I've just watched is totally funny, especially when he draws about 100 synonyms for the 1000 word "breasts" on his Canonical Hooters List website. The man is a national treasure and can upgrade this skeet on disk to a coaster position!
