Oh, man, this movie sometimes bites! If you've ever been afraid to see the rehash genre slasher, make it as cheap as possible (PC-friendly, it means no nudity, the classic element of slasher films) Cut it. Each clich√© is retreaded without any sign of self-confidence and acting. Oh, acting again defines the word horror. I should have known better because a direct Dutch translation of the title would bounce me off.
