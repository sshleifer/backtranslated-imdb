High heels are strange things. They can raise women's (or cross-dressed men) to new heights, present a sharp expression of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, dangerous leg pains can inevitably lead to excursions, falls, and ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is a rather disappointed way than a stylish high riser. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but as for the plot, it is a language-uned and boring thing full of confusing, complex characters that never fully capture or make sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos is simply not interesting. The best piece comes at the beginning in the amazingly horrible case of child-directed killings. From this great piece of black comedy things look, but then the movie gets to the heels. There are strong enough performances and there is some stylish artistic direction to expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinematography. With the story of murder, showbiz, femininity, the broken relationship of mother and daughter and character, who is alternately a judge, a transvestite, and a police informant, it could be a melodramatic force. Instead, it's bad. High heels will surely sink.
