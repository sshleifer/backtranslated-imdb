I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (like Jill), whom I met briefly at LA on the Modeling Fair in my first feature film. I was hoping to see her more, but I thought she was doing very well. Because it's such a beautiful and ready-made TV and model, it was not surprising. I was curious about why she was killed and what happened. Maybe I just miss it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure about the genre of this movie and although I liked the actors, I felt it was for the audience of the college. I tried to keep my mind open, for horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt I had survived the gag. It seemed to stretch in some places, letting some places argue about the power of the evil professor and how many other films had a dissatisfied end. After writing a few scripts, I know that a lot of this is difficult, and it can come down to personal opinions, how many movies you have seen and studied, and those you are dealing with at some point. <br /> <br /> In short, I was an interesting but not satisfying plot and ended up for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) finally returned to the portal and kicked out all the asses that would be a satisfactory end and would get a higher score.
