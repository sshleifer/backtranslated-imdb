The craziest thing about this ridiculous film is its conceit that if one becomes holy, he or she and his family and his important others live forever. Let's forget that in order to become a saint, the holy one must be dead and the saints have no other significant. The fact that Nick Jolly Elf was a million years old to Fred Scrooge was never even outlined! Open up on Nick's teachings on how to make toys and then learn how to run Fred on Fred; Nick, who made a sick baby dolly, Fred tossed the dolls, along with a family farm! After several such episodes, the morale of current Fred blows his spleen on Anonymous siblings while his teammates lose their kiss in empathy. There, I just wrote a more coherent story than this idiocy! This Santa, who is a "ho, ho, ho, ho," from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss saddled with the Queen Harpies, a surgery directly from the Mega-Mall hell and the answer to the advice (huh?) That just gave the Easter Bunny your pink egg. Yeah, and his right hand is a blonde in a coat of tight mini-dresses and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! But what really sent me over the edge, Slam was named # 1 on the Naughty List. Should not be reserved a tiny list for future Hitler and Stalin? Children who are the true embodiment of evil? No, for old sausages, a good guy who drove away because he's undesirable and unloved is Demon Seed! <br /> <br /> Nimrods behind Fred Claus should be cooked in his own pudding! Bah!
