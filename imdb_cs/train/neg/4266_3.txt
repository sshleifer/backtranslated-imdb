Surely NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, fencing and the perfect landscape cinema you'll probably see, but that's not what makes the movie good. Helps, but the story must shine over these things. And that's where Nomad is going. The story is compressed and gives him the feeling he was thrown together just to create a "cool" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters come from the area in which this story takes place (and it is obviously obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If the filmmakers want to kill us in culture, such as Jugars and Kazas, they are damn better used by actors / actresses who appear to be part of. War tribes, prophecy, brotherly love and devotion, love the interest that separates our "heroes" all touch, but with such a small impact and time on the screen that most of the audience clears aside in favor of further battles, additional action horse scenes, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that during the shoot there were significant changes in Nomad, namely director and cameraman. Ivan Passer (Director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov and Ueli Steiger (cameraman) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have a better eye because his visions of the countries have made the final stretch that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the transition to Bodrova as a director may not be the smartest choice. From what I see here, they focus on the battles and not the people who, in my opinion, come from Bodrova's eyes and not Passer's. It's really a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The most disgraceful aspect is that it could be a really fantastic film that focuses on both character and action. Unfortunately, it seemed that the higher groups decided that they needed it, and that they took a cheap (intellectually speaking) way. Although this film is not a positive rating, it's worth watching for amazing cinematographic work. But that's all.
