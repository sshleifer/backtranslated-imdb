Well-assembled entry into serial killer genre, which unfortunately gets into its own prejudices to be really satisfying. Willem Dafoe is great as a NYC detective who tries to trace what appears to be a cop, using the same renaissance art killing techniques used in a series of murders he has solved years before. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's younger partner and has good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to bind together two cases. Clea Duval is a friend of the elderly victim and Peter Stormare is a Dafoe arts broker / tutor ... it's a bit difficult to take, though Stormare is of course never boring. The end of the film is particularly disappointing. Let's take a quick look at Deborah Harry as Dafoe's less than his coming neighbor.
