This is one of those movies that have a great video box, but it has cable work and unfamiliar actors who speak the wrong dialogue. It's so dark when the killing happens that it's hard to see and the movie is hard to grasp. this is Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tygres in WCW before she folded) and she's a good actress. I like low-budget movies especially those that have mistakes because they are fun to watch but separate unfourtunatly is not one of them.This movie is fine if you like voodoo and cut off heads but it's not a junk but if you need something new to watch then rental rentals.
