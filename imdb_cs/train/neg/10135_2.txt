I just watched this movie at Starz. Allow me to go through several things that I thought could be improved; playing, writing, directing, special effects, camera crews, sound and lighting. It also appeared that the writers did not know it had to do with the film. It seems that in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, he could buy a super-advanced stealth bomber that could be totally invisible for $ 75 million. Today's clock costs about $ 3 billion and can not be invisible. From one hour, he can probably fly from the US to the Middle East. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I did not mind, but it seemed like a poor attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera would accidentally approach actors and skip to random scenes. Yeah yeah, from his movie Steven Segal, his predictable hell. All in all, I'm gonna run it with snakes on the plane.
