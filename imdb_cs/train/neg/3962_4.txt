I was really looking forward to seeing Nana after seeing the amazing debut work Renoir, Whirlpool of Destiny. I read that Nana was generally considered to be his best silent film, so I had great hopes. Unfortunately it was like a huge step back. Catherine Hessling is the main problem of this film. Her acting is over the top, even for the silent film. Her acting is rather something that could be expected in the film from the early teens, not the late 1920s. She usually has the same face that reminds me (sorry to say) someone with junk pain. It was also very hard to believe that somebody would get this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her at all. The film was also quite long, the camera was uninteresting (except the horses) and the editing was boring. The story reminded me of Pabor Pandora's box. It is interesting to compare these two, because these films are only three years. Pandora's Box simply scores at every level where Nana fails. This film is only for Renoir completists or very serious silent movies of admirers.
