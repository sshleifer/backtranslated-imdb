I doubt it will sometimes be a cult movie. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure, and I did not expect much from the film and even less. What could be smart and moving was the camp. It was rid of the music that Gramma had done and had more fillers than cheap dog food. There was no background to the Gram or the brightly colored people of that time. The characters I've seen were not known to me either as a Gram fan or any version of his "adventure after death" that I've heard. Rock and roll is full of stories, also good, but should be taken with grain of salt. They can be great stories even though they are exaggerated. But this movie had a good story and turned into a tripe. Stealing any dead body and consequent consequences should never be a boring story, but somehow it did. I am tempted to steal every copy of Parsons Grand Theft, to go to the desert and burn them all.
