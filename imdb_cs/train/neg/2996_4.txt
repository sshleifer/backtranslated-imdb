Born Again is a substandard episode of the first season. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and simply does not fly. I have never been great for reincarnation and it could have been part of my apathy for this episode. It refers to the Tooms case, which is a nice sequel to the previous episode. But the positive ends. This is unfortunate because it happens at the beginning of an episode. I think it's sad that a dead man would decide to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. And she waits until the girl disappears eight to start a vengeful revenge. There is even a serious lack of humorous dialogue between Mulder and Scully to make the episode over water. If you are reincarnating, maybe this episode is on your alley. If you are not, then at least you can find out what bradycardia is.
