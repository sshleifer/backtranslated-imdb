The beginning of the nineties brought many "special" and "overwhelming" independent films whose sub-genre is a semi-pirate pirate crime film. Other notes include "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn" and "Natural Born Killers" to a certain extent. Good movies, such as those that have become inevitable, such as "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns the Radio" and this relentlessly surrealist anti-masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". It's a comedy that tries to achieve a certain emotional tone, it does, but it continues to the point of irritation. While persecution in the spiritual world of the desert and casting of Chris Penn is a good idea, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime film, and is not enough focused on actually laughing to be a comedy. I will not end but let's say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of genre cancer. These are the fumes of indie-mania.
