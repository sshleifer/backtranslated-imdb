People like me will share this movie. It's just not realistic. The plot is predictable. You can predict everything that happens to be a convoy. Of course they find treasure and become dirty rich and the trick of that evil guy. We've seen it a million times before. Writers of this film must think that most of the films that are public are stupid. She must be right because most people really liked this movie. I think I'll solve the puzzles in a few seconds. The secret treasury hidden under the subway in Manhattan? You would think about everything that's going on in New York underground. That room would be discovered earlier. and everything that was built during the Civil War? PRAY A love story between Ben and Abigail? how cute and I thought the romance in Clive Cussler's novels is weak. They just fall in love, in two seconds if I'm more interested in saving my own ass, and then I get some. hell with the girl and a stupid piece of paper. 1/10 garbage
