Taking pictures on the DVD is so dark that I think the screen has died. I think I did not notice half the film. Still, it was badly created and was not interesting. I have not found a story related to the name "Black Widow". I was looking at a secret or a thriller, but I did not care enough to take care of them after the first few shots. I rented a movie in particular for Willem Dafoe and was sad to lose his talent. I do not believe that Giada Colagrande was studying film making enough to make a major film. She is attractive and could develop into an actor, but she has taken too many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem to be believable. I do not understand why the other characters were even plotted.
