Usually I do not comment (I read the opinions of others) ... but this one, which I have to comment on ... I was convinced that I'm watching this movie worlds like action, F-117 and other hi-tech stuff, but only a few first minutes and I changed my mind ... Lousy's acting, miserable screenplay and big science fiction. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just one thing, , I usually check user comments and ratings on this site ... 3.7 points and I'm giving this movie a try, now I'm wondering, WHO to rate this movie by giving him more than 2 points ??????????
