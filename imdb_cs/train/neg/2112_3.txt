Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to make his wife look young and beautiful. For this purpose, drugs during marriage ceremonies combine to look as if they were dead to steal their bodies. I'm not entirely sure what he does with the bodies. I do not remember explaining it completely. All I know is that he pulls something out of him and injects him into his wife. (I just guess it's a spinal cord, the urethra was in the rage of scientists from the 1940s). The rest is a lot to argue about. There is a couple (well, really more than a few, but I will only write about two) problems I have with this movie. One is the way Bela uses it. Sure he does a decent job in his own exaggerated way (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply abstract). But letting him conceal him in the back of the funeral prison or leave him in the bedroom of a woman's reporter for nothing to do is stupid. Also, why did he beat him and / or kill every henchman he has? Would that look like evil? Well, someone who kidnaps brides in a coma can not really be made to look more evil. The second problem I have is the idea of ​​bride drugs. Why the bride? Would she not require a woman under the age of 20? Watching Bella through these difficulties to get her victims reminded me of the idiot fisherman that I still know what you did in the summer. In any case, it seems to be an easier way to achieve your goal than to use a seemingly impossible plan that depends largely on circumstances outside your control. (BTW, the alternative name for this movie is Case of the Missing Bride. I think it partly explains the need for "bride.")
