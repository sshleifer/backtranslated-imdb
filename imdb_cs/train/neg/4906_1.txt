I do not know where to start. Apparently it was for a television movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour, but something before or after it seemed to be a painting by the number of a movie. And to talk about bad chemistry between dragging dragons. .. <br /> <br /> I'm going deep, but this movie does not really deserve it. Step: D + (IMDB Rating 3/10)
