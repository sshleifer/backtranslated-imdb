I'm so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to A-pix movies producing and distributing, and without exception, everything that this company is doing is pure crap! First of all, and it's very important, never to ever watch this film sober! Why would you? Unlike many other fun films, it seems to me that this is deliberately wrong. I can not see how a fake snowman is, so it's always just a short while to see how he moves the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton's piece of crap, becuz, which was also made to be a good movie, and that the version is as bad as this one.
