I give this film the awareness that it is very well done and is sensible. You can not get the improbability of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> First and foremost a game built around the concept of "Russian roulette", which must fill an hour. The big problem is that if you are doing a live show you can run the possibility that your first competitor will be the one unlucky enough to draw a "real" bullet. So what are you gonna do? You have 50 minutes of filming shows and nothing you should see. The result is that Well, you get to the end and the first five contestants survive, which means that the number six has a bullet and can not get a paycheck. At this point it will not shoot, so it's a bit counter-climatic. <br /> <br /> The second problem, almost the same. Human nature. People are getting ready, panic, falling their underwear and doing things that would not otherwise do a very good TV. Too much randomness. That's why "real" TV reality is in fact thoroughly written and modified in more detail. (The only random thing is an "artistic artistic" argument about women's sacrifices, which were in fact rarely historically predictable since it was filming itself) <br /> <br /> We are convinced that ratings are will increase as it will take place at 1:00 in the morning (unlikely) with the Asian token the girl announces every reinforcement of the rating. Point of race and gender. A great surprise that two minorities (one homosexual) and two female contestants are survivors. So we're staying with those two white men, and of course, a little less pleasant of them is the one who buys them. The purpose of such an exhibition would be that it's a coincidence, but the guy you like the smallest is the one who dies. Climax is that after a two-hour fight for television suicide, the character of Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and played in this matter, so there is no one who blames it, but herself) is really growing conscience when someone dies. What would you think would happen? She is instantly shot by a viewer angry at the whole thing (the motives never explained) and the show continued to be a big hit. Really? <br /> <br /> The problem with media satire lies in the fact that it must have some grounding in reality, or it must be over the top to be absurd (for example, a network). Not one.
