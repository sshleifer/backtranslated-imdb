I'm like Dafoe as an actor, but I've been watching this movie for a few hours of my life, I still can not believe I've been able to watch it in full. Was there really a point to the movie? And finally, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this awful, nonsensical piece of mischievous justification for the movie! I'm not sure without hitting the facts, but Dafoe got married or seen a horrible actress in this real-life movie if it was an attempt to start her career, if I'm afraid it had to fail. in the hope I can actually give someone to watch this movie even though one person takes note of their notes and decides they prefer to watch the drying coat I feel I've done something good in the world if I had only the same Council ...
