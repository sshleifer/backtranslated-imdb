My God, what an incredible movie! It reminded me of a similar scene in Mel Gibson's film, "We were soldiers," when "the company is not lost, they're just cut off." And the second scene in Pearl Harbor when a British officer says to Ben Affleck "The Americans are like you, then God will help people, <br /> <br /> You have all three movies together and you have enough BULLSHIT to inherit the entire Sahara desert. <br /> <br /> The story of the Prague battalion may be real, but the film would it could have been done without the admission of American prequalified Jingoist propaganda. During the aforementioned Pearl Harbor scenes, audible moans appeared in the cinema.) The Lost Battalion is in its own class. <br /> <br /> " they think they are unmatched? "Basically, I was crumpled and damn close when I conjured up all the fumes that were fired during this diarrhoeal catastrophe (the movie that is) <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were well made (3 stars for that) but if the script is dung, then packed even in colorful ribbons, it's still dung, the writer James Carabatsos also wrote the other shouts: Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge, someone please shoot him before he writes other such garbage. Russell Mulcahy is also Australian. God, shame !!!
