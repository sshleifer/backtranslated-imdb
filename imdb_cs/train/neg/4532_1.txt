My husband and I bought the old DVD School Sesame Street for our daughter and I must say I will not allow her to watch new episodes on TV because I find all the characters annoying. Baby Bear and Telly? OMgosh, How can one make up and make useless blabber for his "skits"? Elmo? Give her rest, not every kid likes, again, annoying and does not teach my child. Mr. Noodle? what to refuse. I think I once made a "new" show for her, she and I were stupid than before. The show definitely did wrong. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's breaking news, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, All Great Jumps STATE SCHOOLS SS Sesame Street suffered a direct hit of boredom and stupidity since Jim Henson went through 1990. The exhibition no longer has the educational, fun and interactive skits that are used to. The new versions will find unbearably annoying and full of unnecessary non-educational blabber. On the way to the producers / writers of the Secondary School, you have one more caricature show for parents to sit in front of them with inefficient, unprotected children to get out of their hair. By Producers / Writers: I suggest that you remove the old muppets and start recording similar content as the first Sesame Street. The Lord knows I definitely do not want my baby to talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
