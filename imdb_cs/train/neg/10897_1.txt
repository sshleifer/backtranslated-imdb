It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! It was stupid that there was no conspiracy and special mistakes were ridiculous !! And I've never seen such a bad deal in my life! The only good part of the film was all hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people thought when they shot this movie! I did not even want to finish the whole thing because you get to that point in a movie where all the people in bed are touching. I think it was like some bad and twisted child porn! I would like to advise anyone who has heard about this film and would like to see that she just forgets it and finds another movie to watch! I was very disappointed! The whole movie was, in my opinion, a complete waste of time.
