ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (ninth) movie of the series and shows the direction inevitably reached. Characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and Judge HARDY (Lewis Stone) will be front and center. The remainder of the cast also fit into an hour and collected checks. The series would rise to the occasion again, and it would take a moment, but the deadly bankruptcy would get inside. Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue to portray the character of HARDY in a sympathetic way. The rest of the cast would be professional, though less and less doing. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, will continue in his character as if there was no learning curve. The ANDY response to any situation was naive and unbelievable. Even after he returned as a World War II veteran in LOVE LAUGHS IN ANDY HARDY (1946), his reaction to any "tea storm" was the same, juvenile. This film is clearly illustrated. ANDY gets into some incredible situations that can be solved with a simple explanation. This screen-writing device was known as the "idiot plot". A tool for spreading badly written scenarios. Perhaps it was Mickey Rooney's minor mistake than the director and writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz directed too many people and needed a stronger hand to control too much of Rooneys' excesses. To see our overview on a whole line, go to YOU ​​ONLY YES ONCE (1937).
