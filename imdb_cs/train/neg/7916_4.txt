Where to start? X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's eerily violent and romantic past, his complicated relationship with Victor Creed, and the sinister Weapon X program. " /> <br /> His epic violent past will prove to be exceptionally non-violent. His relationship with Creed is so hidden that it's hard to understand how they have any connection at all. We are thrown out of a place in the opening scene that shows them as escaping children, a set of war scenes that have fought for their entire lifetime, and finally to the present, where they are part of the hardcore murder government team. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to show their relationship as brothers at all. There is no complicated rule or love for us. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverin was forced and sudden. We've thrown into romance so fast that it's over before you can blink your eye. After the introduction of Silverfox, he is killed about fifteen minutes later. We were left wondering why we should take care of that. Who was it? The key element of this weak revenge-driven stories is the surprisingly unexplored romance. It was rushed simply because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Wondrously, when Wolverine discovers that his love is dead, he leaves her in the woods to hurt when he leaves and finds Sabertooth. To be romantic, that is, it was even tiny for him, but it was necessary that it was to reveal a very predictable surprise. As for the X weapon program, let's just say that Wolverine's painfully crippled process is in operation. Eventually he arrives in the house of a comfortably old but absolutely loving couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not concerned when they find the naked sweaty man in the barn. Is wondering what fate is waiting for them? In previous movies and comic books, the main reason why Wolverine's amnesia was troubled by him, partly dependent on the fact that he was supposedly a criminal cold-blooded. <br /> <br /> We knew this was the case ... did he really want to remember these horrors or keep them hidden and continue their current more positive way of fighting the villains of the world next to their teammates? <br /> <br /> As indicated in X2: X-Men United, when Stryker gave up some of his secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be concerned if he knew of the evil deeds they had committed together. This film makes the team pretty good, but really does not do much. No interfering violence, no merciless acts, just annoy a few natives in foreign countries in ten or fifteen minutes on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not a bad man at all under Stryker. Instead, he constantly tried to lay his cousin on his brother Sabertooth, who was then a violent agent whom we all thought was Wolverine. Eventually it just leaves all of them. <br /> <br /> No duality conflict here at all. <br /> <br /> Idiotly REMOVE that the character of the conflict of good and evil dulled the story immensely. They could also give him rubber claws. In this movie, there were a number of mistakes that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the saddest Deus Ex Machinas ever hit by the script. <br /> <br /> Spells for Clearing Memory. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> It seems to be the only thing that Wolverine would bring. Still, it was obviously forgotten when he was an agent after the agent was sent to bring him bullets and bombs, which would certainly not work on him. Another problem with this film is the effort to concentrate on Wolverine while throwing a ton of other mutants that had nothing at all. The intriguing figures were merely window dressing and did nothing about the story. Most of them were in the movie for 5-10 minutes max, and yet you find that you want us to see more of them and less Wolverine. Fred Dukes (Blob, but not a comic version) Tank racket with little to no physical damage at all but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to feel it? Cyclops optical beams (which instead are compassionate forces are now more related to lasers) can burn buildings, but when they shoot directly into the Sabertooth, it simply breaks it into the ground without damaging his clothes. Adamantium trench coats everyone? (Gravitace defying) The mutant Gambit, instead of using his signature cards, is made into some crazy acrobat. In one badly modified scene Wolverine crashes into unconsciousness ... and then it's surprising a few minutes later that he is on the roof running towards Wolverine. As he gained consciousness, he escaped a few blocks, climbed into the building, then returned to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of scratching the match's secrets to be explained. Some have been excuse the movies for weakness by claiming it was made of a comic, and therefore should be lightweight and heavy on lightning. The idea that this film is a comic film is thin and superficial because of this fact is wrong. The source material of the comic book, the true origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen. He does not have a coat of past past, nor does he care about readers like CGI junkies. This is a well-crafted story, and despite being redeployed and re-set, he started with WEAPON X from Barry Windsor-Smith. A more intense and exciting story. FOX should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Who has a magic weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
