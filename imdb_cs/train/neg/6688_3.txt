This film is pretty awful, but I have some interesting information about it: It was shot in 1976 at North Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as in the Oak Creek Canyon at Sedona in AZ. A good majority of the bonuses in the film are students of the drama from the NAU. That year I was the youngest actress in the theater, but for some reason I did not take part in the production. However, I knew a few people who did and can deliver this somewhat weird fact: In this film there is a scene where two of the principles, as part of their ritual task, must go naked into the forest. They are seen from behind in the movie, doing just that. It's not actors, but two guys from the theater department. The identity of these "stunts posters" will remain anonymous, at least on this website unless they decide to "reveal" themselves!
