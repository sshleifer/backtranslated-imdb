Before watching "Dahmer", I thought no movie would be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. The sum of the "Dahmera" is a story about a homosexual serial killer who has almost no killing and almost completely consists of Dahmer's encounter with homosexual men before they were killed. There is no land to be found, and it makes no sense to tell us something about "Dahmere." Everything you learn about Dahmer watching this movie is that he liked sex with men. Striking acting, horrible direction, terrible writing, terrible everything ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and diving vomiting for three hours, go with vomiting ... it will be less painful .....
