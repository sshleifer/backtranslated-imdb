This is a well-informed film in PBS Frontline. The problem is that Frontline has already done this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer to tell him the story. More worrying is the fact that film director Charles Ferguson - the former think tank won - was a fighter until the occupation went south. What does he think will happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland went really well until it was confused by the annoying Nazis. And that is the movie that feels like an excuse for occupation rather than deconstruction of the act of war itself. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ferguson suggests that the war could have been better - as if every war could have been better.
