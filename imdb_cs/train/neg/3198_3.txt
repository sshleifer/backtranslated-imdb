In short, the film had a little weak first act with forced action and somewhat discontinuous rhythm and step, a rather decent second act that managed to build some tension and intrigues despite inconsistent pacing and some bad performances cast and 3rd act ... practically not no 3rd act! <br /> <br /> As for the 3rd act, the movie suddenly ends. There is no distinction and no path down from the culmination of the second act, so there was no power of the third law. Criminals die and that's it; final loans are rolling. There is nothing to show what happens to protagonists and supporting characters, and so on. Audiences probably left the theater after the movie and asked, "Is that so?" True startup. <br /> <br /> The music was composed by David Belle, who worked well enough to mostly serve the film, but it is certainly nothing special. It's just functional, but it does so by being generic and derived. It is also obvious that the score is VERY dated using synthesized tympanic for some of the drums. What interests me most is that some moments of tension elicit musical signals sounding as if they were tear apart from James Horner from "48 HRS". and "Commando", especially brass. Overall, the film had potential, as the basic story itself was good, but the performance was low in average, weak, and somewhat inconsistent. <br /> There was practically no 3rd law to properly complete the story, and this omission is big and unforgivable because it does not allow the film to finish satisfactorily. This could be either a scenario or perhaps production had to stop filming or editing a third act in the finished film due to budget constraints (but I speculate why there is no 3rd act). Regardless of the reason, the sudden end really hurts the movie seriously. <br /> <br /> This is good for viewing if you are curious and you can get the film at very cheap as well as learn why you need to have 3 acts (beginning, middle, end) when writing scenarios and making movies. Otherwise, you might not want to waste your time unless you get the MST3K version to make it laugh at least.
