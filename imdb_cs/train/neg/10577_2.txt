Some filmmakers taking part in this series have produced some really great movies, but are sure they do not have many skills with this series. Especially writing. OK, the first season was somewhat better, but these new episodes are just smell. I'm a huge fan of horror, and in my opinion the overwhelming majority of these episodes are total garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. Several of them are visually creative. It's just a typical made Hollywood bull, uninteresting, childish, ill-conceived, and in some cases just ridiculous. Like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing that this series offers is great nudity! Other than that this series swings. Sometimes I think they hired a couple of octopuses to write episodes. Maybe yes.
