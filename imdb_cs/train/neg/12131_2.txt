Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately, directing is not his strength. Before I rented it, I had great expectations about the movie and maybe I did not love that much. I admire Spacey's efforts to film a movie that's mostly in a small environment, but it's not counting. I found the film boring, boring and stretched. The game was not devastating. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially because he is aware of most other movies. Skeet Ulrich was disappointed, but this was one of his first films (I got kicked as a young and dandy star Scream). The only thing that caught me in this movie was the only clip of a car outside. The central line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved along the line and around the wreck. However, this shot was very "Usual Suspects" ish and my guess is that Spacey got the idea of ​​his older film (which is a very good mind). To see the fabulous movie that takes place in a small environment, check out the Hitchcock rescue boat. Maybe Spacey should watch this before filming.
