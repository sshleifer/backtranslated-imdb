It happened to me that I discovered this movie on a shelf under a "new release" and found that the idea of ​​a hip hop zombie was too interesting to get up. That's how it was really paid for the box and I thought, "What a great idea!" In addition, "Welcome to Oakland" is also on the packaging. How can I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted only as long as it was not an introductory topic. Not even hip-hop music or hip-hop culture played a role in the film. When I lived in Oakland myself, I know there are many aspiring hip-hop artists, so the low cost of this film was not a justification without proper soundtrack. Any number of struggling artists would have jumped up to the opportunity to contribute to this film. Why did not the Brothers Quiroz use it, is behind me. When the film stretched out, it was a very typical zombie film with occupancy that became totally black and Latino. Maybe you think the film would have been an unusual inclination ... but no. Somehow, the Quiroz Brothers vision of "urban culture" collapses to drive and shoot the F-bomb in every line in the movie. The rapid use of the word "fuck" is probably the most famous feature of this movie; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and no line had it at least once. I am not at all pitiful about the fact that I swore in the movie, but the feeling that it was the result of a lack of thought by writers (also the Quiroz brothers) and the script was generally very poor. br /> <br /> The film was generally disappointing. It would be interesting to see the "urban culture" of the zombies, but the "Hood of the Living Dead" does not reach that number. The characters in the movie can be as easily as white or eskim or something else. There was no distinct taste for the film. This is another fictitious scenario with bad effect, bad writing, amateur direction, cinematic cinema, cheap soundtrack, and nothing to recommend.
