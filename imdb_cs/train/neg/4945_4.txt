Sure, this is not really a blockbuster, nor does it focus on that. "Dieter" is the first name of a very popular German musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and that's exactly what this film is about. It's based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" wrote a few years ago, but it is not accurate about it. The movie is full of offensive sexual content (at least for an American standard), which is either fun (not for other "actors" of course) or stupid - depending on your individual humor or "Bohlen" -Fan or not. From a technical point of view, it is not very critical. When we talk about myself, I find that this movie is OK-film.
