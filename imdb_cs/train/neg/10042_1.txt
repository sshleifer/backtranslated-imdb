So long awaited the movie .. But it disappointed me and my friends who went to see the film the first day .. From the trailers it looked like an action movie, but it turned out that it is out and out comedy (bad comedy). But one thing that deserves recognition is the acting of these professional actors, they have done very well their part of the film. Good acting, but I do not think it can save the movie .. India was shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan (Ladakh?) They were all saturated in color, all right. However, the way the inner beauty of these places was affected, I wanted to find out exactly where these places are and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> The actions were shot very badly, no one could do it (akshay kumar ) very well, but it could be much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst I've ever seen in recent movies (90 films had better animation scenes, I think (the initial scene where the car falls, flying should be a better word 'way to the lake.) And the movie name was mentioned almost every 20 to 30 minutes, just to make sure that the audience does not forget the name of the movie.
