It was a terrible movie. In essence, Jane March was the North Korean Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible of the American forces in South Korea. Being a maid for the American military family, they all consider it Korean, although it looks whiter (I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asia, not at all Korean) and the teenage boy of the household begins to hate her and ends up sleeping with her. The way in which Korea and the US Army are depicted in Korea is totally insane. Of course, the screenwriter and director were, of course, white men who had never spent a day in Korea before, and had no intention of showing real life in Korea, neither for the Koreans nor for the American GI, instead of trying to fulfill their dubious fantasies from Asia, no matter how incredibly the movie makes. Anyone who has ever been to Korea will know that it is utter waste. Eventually, a North Korean spy girl is killed, which is obviously "paying for her sins". Very bad film with a shape for television.
