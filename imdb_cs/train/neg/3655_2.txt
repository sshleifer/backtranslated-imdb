Oh, my, I think it might be the only rarest film I've ever seen. I mean, it's one of the best b-movies. The first proof is that it's not DVD $ 5. Oh, no, this is too common. I have it on VHS, from bin full of ex-rental videos to my local video store. If I can quote the chateau: "In the 17th century Japan, there lived a samurai that would set the standard for ages. It was named Mayeda. It is sent on an epic journey all over the world to gain 5,000 nuts from the King of Spain. When a violent storm swims at sea precious gold intended for the purchase of weapons and almost takes their lives Mayeda has to fight all the chances of surviving and to secure the fate of his beloved Japan. "Then he goes on to say," Many million dollars action adventure epic sets on three continents "I had to see another film. It was not an epic situation, and it certainly was no more than a million dollars. No, "Shogun Mayeda" is really just a crazy Adventure English-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). It's not even Shogun, but it's not important. What's important is that he does a really great impression of John Cleese's re-enriching one of Monty Python and the Holy Grail's castles and his ability to go out of serious scenes to show his power to the samurai mind. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The biggest theme of this film is the Anglo-Saxon accent of Sho Kosugi. The film may lack almost everything that makes good a movie, but it will compensate for it with some of the easiest lines that have ever been awarded the best English accent. And frankly, do you really want something else? You could move Shogun Mayeda to the end and read Kosugi's final line again and again. The tape is likely to wear before it gets tired of one line. Amazing. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very much cheese.
