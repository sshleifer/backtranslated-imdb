Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece; Redford's film is mediocrity. He adds banal scenes from the Maclean brothers who are going through the falls, and twice they hit the unlucky bar, which he never even thought of in the story. Cradle Brad Pitt, who is trying to play charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius out there, proves to be either genuine or depressing, depending on what the original story has for you. Some fly scenes are beautiful. Also Tom Skerritt as a father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are powerful and masculine as people once expected. None of the women make an impression in the movie, which is regrettable because Maclean loved women in his story and made it clear, even poetic.
