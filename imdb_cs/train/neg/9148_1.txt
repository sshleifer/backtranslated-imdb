I was looking at the Imdbs lower 100 because I thought Id never seen anything as bad as Plan 9 of the Outerspace or Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur defeated both. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen in the many endless movies I've seen. Bad characters, bad characters, terrible acting, terrible story There's no one else but Sam ever said anything about this movie. Sam was a terribly annoying actor, but his direction was so bad he could just overthrow Ed Wood. The director should be ashamed of his work, unfortunately I have to give at least 1 star, but he deserves to be - the continuing stars.
