Can a fake scenery destroy an image? You would not think so, but for me here. Listen, I have a lot of classic era movies, and I know quite a lot, except for drivers such as drivers driving a car in front of the screen, etc. But a lot of this hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have fake scenery, fake mountains and flowers shot after the shot, as seen in "Brigade", after some time offends. <br /> <br /> As far as musical entertainment is concerned, it is always subjective. What songs one person likes, another does not have to, so it should not be a big part of the movie rating (whether someone likes songs). I could make this film because of its 1950 songs, dances, novels and characters, but it was the 1950s and many people enjoyed these things. The musicals were very well looked after in the 1950s. I liked the 30's and 40's with big cocks. In the fifties of the last century, knocking was out and this new thing that I could become was. Does that make it a miserable movie? No. I just do one thing I did not care much about <br /> <br /> Despite good cast, good director and high expectations, this movie bombed at the box office and with me. I liked it more, being a dreamer myself, and that's a nice part of this story. I'm not a cynical type, and a nice city, and nice people who feel good, sounds a terrible appeal. So why can not I connect with this movie? She was also a dancer. I do not care about things that replace tan dance on the screen. But-no-the thing really refused me. There was no Scotland, no highlands, just a hokey-looking backdrop to make it look like, and that's almost from the beginning. Evaluate one point for today's realism, where they are usually "found".
