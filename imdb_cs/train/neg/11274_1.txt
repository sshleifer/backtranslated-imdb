Just to get the film closer to the film, I decided to write another review. In the past, I missed a few things ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, acting. Third, Jesus Christ, who thought to make such a waste like this and then expected that we would like it if we had no redemption from the beginning until the end, except when Joseph Fiennes eventually avoided a very harsh climax! br /> <br /> I can not believe I lost my money when I could give it homeless or bus or something! Do you get an image?
