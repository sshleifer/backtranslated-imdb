This is a candidate for one of the most disappointed film experiences of my life. Cold title, excellent director (I saw "Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before this), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that's the question that bothered me in my temples a few hours after watching this turkey. <br /> <br /> Unconnected and unsuccessful in an attempt to be unconventional, it's a dead zone of the movie, which should be avoided at all costs. Her critical lambasting deserved. You have one of those rare movies that do not contain a single redemption. Zero z ****.
