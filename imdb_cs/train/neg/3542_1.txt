After reading the comments on the web I feel compelled to write for the first time. It seems that this film is like Marmite and has divided the audience. I must say that while I agree that movies may not make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), they must still get you into the characters. Now that I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I must say I could not have a beer about Mr. Green or the other cardboard gangsters who inhabited this day's world. <br /> <br /> Also, while so many people try to try and say that you were not happy because you did not get it, I would have to disagree - I did not like it because I was bored. I wanted the movie to end and kept listening to the quotes again and again. Say it's smarter if it's going to be - I think it's a repetition. The main reason for writing is, however, the question of all other reviewers - the print of the movie I have seen. Just music over black. Have I been looking at a print or is it a proof that GR claims it? Or are everyone in the movie watching a rough cut and having their name removed?
