I am a huge fan of a series of comic books, but this film has fallen below my expectations. I expected Heavy Metal 2000 to feel a little bit ... slow moving, bad dialogue, lots of blood ..... but it was worse than anything I could imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as a comic, but good points stop there. The characters do not have the energy or the spirit that caught me in the comic book series. The film covers only a small part of the comic and the part used is slower and boring than the later parts. The film's focus is on insignificant events instead of the more intriguing overall comic plot. With the right people working on this project, it could be amazing. Unfortunately, it was not so, so now there is another horrible film that will not see much or even less. My copy certainly gathers dust for many years until finally I get rid of it.
