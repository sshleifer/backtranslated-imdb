Although it is part of the title of this Flying Guillotines film, it has no connection with the original flying guillotines (1975) and its sequel to Flying Guillotines II (1978). These two originals are the masterpieces of the kung-fu film and still stand as a classic. This is a much worse copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu movie, is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film does not have much acting. It is a meaningless battle scene behind the other, and the flying guillotine does not play a significant role in them either. The story is about some Shaolin monks who follow some villains who left with a sacred book, and the evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the conspiracy. The same evil prince intends to attract monks and use flying guillots on them. <br /> <br /> The title includes four Flying Guillotine films. This is, in my opinion, the least quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this film differs from the other three, which suggests that this film produced a different subject than the other three. The film has no chemistry side by side because it is inadvertently fun because of poor production. <br /> <br /> Best skip this and watch the two originals.
