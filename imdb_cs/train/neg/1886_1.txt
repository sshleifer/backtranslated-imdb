Once I promised never to come out of a movie (personal politics that made me suffer from various kinds of attacks like Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a really terrible experience. Anyone who sees this film will think that the Austrians are an unfortunate, pathetic group of retarders. It shows a world where love and humanity do not exist, a world where people humiliate each other for just one reason - to turn away from their own miserable existence. Choosing a director-style with unprofessional actors (most of them looking directly from the idea of ​​Austrian cartoonist Deix), director Seidl wants to believe it's real life in Austrian (European - Western) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sexual orgy, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and aggravation. But it is not a social critique. It is just a pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you have bad acting, bad cinema, bad filming. If someone needs such a film to realize that things are wrong in our society, then this person would have to go through closed eyes. This is a pseudo-social critique with a hammer. And he looks at the people in an abominably blissful way. It shows ugly people - that's not why I hate it. But it shows the average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And that is why this film is truly contemptuous.
