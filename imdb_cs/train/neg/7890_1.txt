How sad it is not to post a mark below 1. I watched this piece of nonsense and hardly believed what I was watching. Every part of the movie was terrible. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, everything. In fact, I boasted loudly at various places in the film. Especially I loved a corner where our hero in the hospital moves in slow motion with a faint focus and a knockbox from the nurses hand because ............. well. Just because. Product location? Crucifixes (Crusaders?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian believer and are very happy to be happy, you can enjoy this movie. If you like this movie, you really have to get out.
