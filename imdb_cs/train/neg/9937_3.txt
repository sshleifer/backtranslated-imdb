Firstly, it is a very dated film that is not focused on the exposition of the left-wing political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is senseless because the answer was achieved by being intellectual), it makes me worse; as if we all had to go back to being opiates in the name of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellectuality is just one of many human qualities, but that does not mean we should not be educated to the fullest extent possible. But undoubtedly this non-learning message is associated with Godard's use of rock music; and therefore Rolling Stones. The song "Sympathy for the Devil," the creation of which we are witnessing and from which the film takes its name, is in fact nothing special. A chord sequence that is not too original was used for a much better effect in Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou' (Led Zeppelin II). Additionally, "Sir" Mick Jagger declares in his usually misty way (rather like Bob Dylan) - note how the first melodic phrase repeats indelibly to create a verse. <br /> <br /> In addition to the black panthers depicted in this film, they do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes include the equation of fascism with pornography; a report that in fact undermines the sexual "liberation" of the 1960s and 1970s (in fact, a message that would have believed The Rolling Stones at the time the film was shot). No wonder the DVD released The Sunday Times for free! For a truly deep historical exposition of left-wing sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore".
