Do not waste time on this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the smallest I've ever seen. I have to be seriously interested in how the people involved in making this film could look at this final scene and think, "Yeah, it's over!" and they tried to do it on their backs. For me it seemed rather that they had just run out of ideas! They built the final scenes to have a cold bend, but instead simply let the whole face recede. When the last shot disappeared into black and I heard that musical music started, I was in shock - I could not believe what I saw, and that even someone could say it would end. The best one could do with this movie is to overwrite the end and give it some substance. Seriously, I would like to get the one who came up with it in the room, looked them up in the face and said - WTF ?? !!!!
