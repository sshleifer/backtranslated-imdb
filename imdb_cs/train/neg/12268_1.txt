I saw about four other Japanese horror films and they were not very impressive. But I felt it was a path leading to meaningful scripting. <br /> <br /> Not here, in any way. This is a detective who is trying to combine similar murders that are happening. When he finds the suspect to be questioned, the suspect scares because he still sees the spirit. Then the ghost begins to watch the detective around an IMPORTANT REASON, WHICH NEVER EVOLVES AND RELIEVES MORE THAN FOLLOWING THE FILM. <br /> <br /> It is not enough? Oh no. The film keeps switching views of different characters that have nothing to do with the story. I have seen it in other films where it shows a different perspective. It is not so. <br /> <br /> And what happens on the screen, which is actually acceptable, ends quickly. For example, there are several scenes with a mild instrumental score that he builds and ... then simply cuts off to another scene. I am aware that this can be a dramatic effect. This is definitely not an intention. It's just a bad editorial. Finally there is a "spirit" that screams in a way that is not scary or unintentionally entertaining. It's unpleasant, and it's going to happen a lot in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the fears have been done before, so you can see that everyone is coming. Then one of them ends the movie. At that moment a wave of confusion passed over the audience, as I felt we all felt we had time. Someone made a fake applause, and laughter continued. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, avoid.
