I think everyone was very disappointed with this science fiction film. One thing was Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what's supposed to be a classic. I found it boring, rough and ridiculous. If you saw that, you know what I mean. Almost everyone in Imdb says it's crap and boy, they're right! If it is not, avoid it. It's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
