Kris Kristofferson has barely found himself on the screen with his humorous eagle, La Streisand and feminism, at the height of his 70s. <br /> <br /> None of these characters really do. likeable; I was glad when Kristofferson's Ferrari crossed the hill and crashed. If you want to see a good movie about a rock & roll star, try "Buddy Holly Story" (made about a year and a half after that blow).
