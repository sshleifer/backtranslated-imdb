If you like syphilis opera sofia, this show is for you, like a tariff like me, it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes, I can no longer watch it. It's boring and slow, and to show that the timeline is based around 100,000 years ago, if you base it on the Battlestar Galactica on Earth, they seem to have the same thing as the Chevy, street and people who watch 100,000 years old favorite LCD TV brands. The same goes for the rest of the sets and the show, there are just a lot of today's things involved in it to forget it, I think they could do a lot better work to get to these questions and yes battlestar galactica had some the same problems, but not so bad. Like the rest like the rest of the show, it's not as good as BSG and is it a bad follow-up on it?
