Despite recognition on the DVD title version I borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war films of a period of mud, boredom and frustration of hope, but unfortunately, man is omitted by thinking that it is all for this film. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not like a good war movie must have a fight scene every five minutes. One of the best films of the Second World War, "Twelve O'Clock High", has a very small action. But it cope with the rupture of dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to "The Story of GI Joe" is a short combat segment (called "the city under siege" on DVD) that takes place in Italy. It is true that it is one of the fastest and most convincing battle scenes of each war movie. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not worth asking you about this highlight. Another shutdown is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is supposed to be "romeo" but comes from a perverse. On the other hand, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathizer, even if he is a faulty person. As Captain Walker (Mitchum) says in volunteering on another patrol: "Every step forward is a step closer ... to home." But the last step? one patrol too much ?? it drives him above the mental edge. It is a shame that the rest of the film does not provide fair gentle questions. As for Meredith's display of Pyle ... it's practically comatose.
