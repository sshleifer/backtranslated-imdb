this film has a lot of shortcomings and that's all I've seen. is painfully long and terribly directed. I saw that the whole audience is beginning to be impatient and waiting for it to end. Run time is over 3 hours, which could be adjusted to less than 2 hours. The transition between stories is average. most people admit that she is waiting for something better on the seats to come out. His funny only in his pockets. ambitious project and lower parallel performance. govinda doing decent work, anil kapoor disappointed me, we expected the rest. if u expect something close to babel or love, then not his whereabouts.
