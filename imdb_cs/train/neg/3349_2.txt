I have to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I've had some time to do. I'm sure it must be more scary than this movie. I remember jumping once when I saw that the other day, even though I do not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> Special effects are great and I saw it on DVD, but I'm sure the theater had to be a great look. After completing the first few special effects, I waited until the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I thought this film at least must be free based on the classic novel, so it should be a good story, but it was not. I was relieved to look at Catherine Zeta-Jones's gorgeous figure throughout the movie, because there was basically nothing else to look at. Lili Talor was such a cat. I did not like her a bit about catching people. Also, the guy in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, while Liam Neeson has done an admirable job trying to get through this film with some kind of acting. Half of the three-quarters of the trip that I was just dying, I've seen TÃ¡bor's Friday 13th or Scream Queenish movie! At least there is some value of entertainment. If there is no story, it will at least fill it with bloody death or attractive women. It had nothing. <br /> <br />
