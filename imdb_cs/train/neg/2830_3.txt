If Ashanti was a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery, still prevalent in Third World countries, the film could have been better accepted. Instead, he becomes a star buried by the disaster of the movie where the stars came, saying their lines and lifting their payouts without much conviction. Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian work in East Africa. Next comes Peter Ustinov, who can scarcely call enough ham to make part of his role as a Muslim slave trader. Because Johnson is black, she catches her with many children and several adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, Caine does not like the kidnapping and the rest of the film spends her rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has such people as William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and they look so incredibly bored with the whole thing. Usually in something like talented people like the ones mentioned above they will overreact and enjoy the scenery diet. But Ashanti does not even have that. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The scent of tax depreciation penetrates the air.
