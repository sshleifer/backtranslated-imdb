Beautiful Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who died after her ice angel crushed her before "me" with fianc√©e Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years Henry has to go on and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very concerned. Chloe prepares Henry to talk to the attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley must contact Kate's spirit and hope that Henry will help with his life. When a psychic begins to attract Henry, Kate's spirit seems to have engulfed romance. There are some funny situations; but if you saw trailers, you saw the essence of the movie. Also in cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally, I thought Bell stole a show from Parker. And Biggs, as usual, in the ass. Still this film was exaggerated.
