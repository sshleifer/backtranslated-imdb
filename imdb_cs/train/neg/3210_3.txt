It's really no way to beat the bush when you say it, Lady Death: The film is just upset. Besides the fact that the main character is a well-dressed blonde who runs around hell in a leather bikini with occasional shots of graphic violence, it seems that the film was created with a cartoon mentality in the 1980s based on a number of action figures. The evil guy even talks like a skeleton, has a tough, inexperienced friend, and lives in a lair that seems to have been carved out of the old Blackstar cartoon series on Saturday morning. Just do not expect other humor than sometimes exhausting bad dialogue. Otherwise, it seems like a type of anime story better suited to hentai, although there is no sex, no rape of the tentacle (thank god!) And very little sexual appeal, despite the physical appearance of the title character. There's just no adult edge on this material unless you count half a heroine and bloody death. Basically, we have the episode She-Ra, princess of power, but with smaller garments and more ghosts.
