I was in the second class 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We learned about the universe. All the little kids want to go into space, right? After what I saw, I was so scared that I would "inadvertently" get into the universe with some psychotic robot with a trace of my mind. I did not know it was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something. I think it was my own version when people were outraged by the "World of War" broadcasting program. So, recently, I've been watching this movie again, realizing your favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you that I laughed at the dramatic parts and laughed even more in acting. I mean, when Andy is in the universe, he moves slowly, did you ever find out? I do not think you are in the space that is slowly talking to you, or you think it's slow. Best is when Andy is knocked unconscious on the oxygen tank and starts swimming back when the security door closes. Little Max is trying to stretch her. Suddenly, Max's face gets big faces when he shouts (slow) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!" I did not know at all.
