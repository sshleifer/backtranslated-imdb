Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all in the top form. They deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm a great fan as well as a TV show. Their rock rocks are all so talented! I'm also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! If you are a fan of Club S, do not read this! <br /> <br /> The performance is terribly weak, the dialogue is awful and the jokes are not even finished correctly (I'm sorry to the director). Jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 small, passionate S Club fans are not interested. They thought they could do better. And they did it. They have conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat, ugly man who founded the Mosh band," must thank his happy stars who left when he did. One of the worst movies he ever did. IMPORTANT FROM THIS FILM! DO NOT COME AND NEVER! DO NOT COMPLETE! You will cry! 0/10 RJT
