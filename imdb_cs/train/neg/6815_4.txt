The eight Jean Rollin films I've watched may also be the strangest; An interesting conspiracy (such as it is) seems to be too fragile at first to keep even its trim for 84 minutes, but it somehow causes it to get overly confused as it goes! A bureaucratic female vampire (somewhat dressed as the title promises) holds in captivity in a remote castle and appears only on a "feast" on the blood of willing victims (who are probably members of a suicide club) As if uncertain where it all goes, the writer-director does he eventually have a human villain? in fact, a ugly father? sadly revealed as a mutant (!!) of the future! The lunar tempo and the dream as an atmosphere (the cultists wear a hood and animal masks to hide their features from a protected girl) are, of course, typical of both filmmakers (as well as the seaside at {anti} culmination) and "Euro-Cult" like white starry beauties on the display. Personally, the most interesting thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually empty matter was watching a famous actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in Luis Bunuel's last six films).
