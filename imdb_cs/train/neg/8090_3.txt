I'm partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "in part" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately this movie falls into the later category. This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as the recent Miyazaki movie "Howl's Moving Castle." An interesting idea is set, but then it instantly shrinks to a bit more than the background for some insurmountable events that only serve to confuse the plot, rather than to explain. The first third of the film unveils a post-cappuccous world story set in and actually looks like a very interesting story is about to unfold. Since then, things have gone down. The middle part of the film is largely made of a dull, turbid eco-propaganda, and the end is heavily blurred by relying on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism that destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie looks as though someone has been ripping every other page out of the script before giving it to the animators. What is left is something that is visually stunning (although unfortunately the version I saw was a copy of the N-generation of the wrong color - which leads to a common myth that Nausicaa shows a bare bottom while flying) but which makes no sense, and eventually she left me confused.
