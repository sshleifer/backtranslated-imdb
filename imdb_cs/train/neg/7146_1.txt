I only registered to comment (which to a large extent echoes some of those already here) that acting is worse than a subsector, that explains it on commonly held stereotypes, has some of the worst manifestations of flawless feminine objectification (all point no brain) and has some of the best-known lines known to men. <br /> <br /> Including, but not exclusively, "Everyone sees what these guys can do". I should also mention that if you show a crash with innocent civilians, you will end up feeling innocent people feeling sick and starting to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical characters of a black guy who only has people bad. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow such a kind of character exploration. Do you want a movie that leaves audiences on the side of bad guys? Oceans 11. This film just hates bad people instead of capturing viewers. <br /> <br /> Even automobiles can not compensate for this happening of the movie. The Enzo, which Griffin destroyed, perfectly sums up this film. It just upset it.
