The film is quite funny and includes about four dates, then it becomes a charming ad for someone who you (and even his "friends") really can not stand. It's a pretty interesting concept; movie days to find true love in modern LA. The problem is that he feels an incredibly (and poorly) scenario in times and is unswervingly promoted. It is difficult to take care of them and be drawn into any character, because the writer / actor is so egotic, unwavering, untrue and just unlike. You're finally sorry for his dates.
