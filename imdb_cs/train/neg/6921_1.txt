I went to pre-control this film and was shocked as it is cheese. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√©, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, worshiping Satan, secret policemen, affairs, religion ... and that was a mess. acting was nice. boy and Jesus buddy were ok but besides them .... Anyway. I admire the effort (although it has failed slightly) in trying to show the Christian people in a different way ... even if they did, the way the gospel was, it was a little modest and stupid. But again it may be because he talked to a little child ... no. I actually decided that it was all wrong. music ... oh my god ... terrible ... too dramatic. Good. I felt bad for the people who made this movie for the first time; It looked like a bad student project. I'm going to stop arguing about it now and say the bottom line, go see this movie if you want to throw and fifty minutes of your life crap. here you go.
