First of all, this story is exaggerated - the girl wants to do it, they all love her, the snobby girl interferes, everything looks lost, the girl stretches, everybody loves her again, etc. Throwing into the hardware thing, the hero and the one-parent problems so predictable that you can practice with it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate to stick to the distribution of classical music. They are reporting that everyone who is involved in classical music is anxious and snob and close - in fact, I just do not remember the quote, but I remember in one place in the movie Holly says, "Why should they be so agile ... so classical?" It's really insulting to brand classical music this way. <br /> <br /> Third, I went ten times, but the only reason I can think of filming this movie is to promote Britney Spears. there is simply no point at all. And yeah yeah, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure if it was her singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, it was not as amazing as they did to make it - especially when she was banging. The whole time was excessive. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
