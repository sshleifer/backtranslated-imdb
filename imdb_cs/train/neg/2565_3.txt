There's so much wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the first twenty minutes of the movie could be compressed to just five or maybe ten. The overall movie is already (mercifully) short, but it could be solved by a little more emphasized on Mean Lion (as the link to "The Wiz" was missing on this one) and worked his subplot a little closer to the main conspiracy. In short, the scenario had seed of a good idea, but it needed quite a bit of redesign. <br /> <br /> Secondly it could be without raw humor. The original also had some that could do it without, but at least there was almost an idea - here, flatulence and urinating. Third, the show is a bit too confident. The original series was pretty good, just like the first movie, but here's just the way, too much. Brendan Fraser's jokes were just a bit over the top (and why not mention the "new Ursula"?). Other gangs with the Narator, especially a pair of interactions near the end, also cross good sense. Fourthly, a little more attention could be paid to the work of CGI. At first, it was hard to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here CGI stands out as a painful thumb. Ideally, special effects should just tell the story, whether they are good or bad, and at least make success on that count, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still. <br /> <br /> Everything that has been said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is pretty decent. It's missing on Brendan Fraser's ground, but Christopher really failed in this particular comparison-he even managed to give a little personal depth to George, who should be the main foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie, but he was not here. Julie Benz, as a new Ursula, surprised me that I was even better than Leslie Mann. Most of the other performances were quite standard, and not in my mind she was good or bad.
