Sure, it's happening in the West, but the name seems to be a conventional Western. Instead, it's a woman's sheriff's movie. Make no mistake, even if it's a bad movie about a sheriff woman. She will become a sheriff when her husband is shot; she's just a little upset about this. Her main goal is to go after her dick who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. This will happen, the hero will fall in love with the murderer, and vice versa. Amazingly stupid, as someone killed in this movie, thanked the new sheriff. She had more than just a chance to put the murderer behind the bars, but I think because she liked she did not. The killer is also the mayor of the city for personal reasons, which are also somewhat stupid. This movie is very boring and really worth watching ... it's not one of the better MST3000 episodes you've ever done. I can not imagine anyone seeing them without them because it would be much more painful. Corman is a low-budget director, but he should even know better than people go to one place and come out differently.
