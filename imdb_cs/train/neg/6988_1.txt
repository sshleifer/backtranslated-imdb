I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows. I saw the Universal trademark followed by a new familiar name and a theme sand that still impressed me. Computer animation on some scenery as a solid title title "The Jetsons" from a spaceship approaching the amusement park and more made this version wonderful and fantastic. Shortly after that until the end ... I could not believe my eyes !!!! How happy I was that I could forget everything I saw. Tiffany's song and her song in a new arrangement were in my head. Anyway, I would like to see this space family (including The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in the entire computer graphics design like Toy story or Bug life. The best style for Hanna-Barber is in my opinion.
