Imagine Big Chill with the occupation of a twenty-year-old man whose characters are all insurmountable, and the iguana-like man-lizard chases them around and you have the idea of ​​foolishness here. On the positive side, the movie does not include monster rendering. There are no shots or night scenes where you have to imagine what it looks like; there are people directly. Unfortunately, design and design are not inspired. A little secret has helped. I thought I saw a lot worse, but if you want to get it on a full screen for many flicks, your monster will look damn well. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is an ending twist involving an allegedly dead brother who has absolutely no sense at all. This was not a surprise given the scenario writing the script. In terms of acting; but let's say it was not painful, but I do not expect to see many of these kids in future movie shows.
