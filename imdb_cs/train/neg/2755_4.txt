This is the saddest collection of clich√©s that are strung on a straight line, without any recognizable plot or any decent way of playing that I have seen long ago. Cannibalizing Star Wars scenes, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, this was a worldwide war with spectator intelligence. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! Even if it is not so low that it would be really fun and have reached the cult status as a comedy, the film offers some laughter. The trick is to place the copied scenes in the context of their original films. Gandalf may be funny to speak Korean, basilisk looking for a snake cheerful if you compare it with a kitten and a bad henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jay-bing, or whatever his name was. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Every pleasure coming from this film is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and the imagination of the audience, not the director / writer. Shit on you, Shim!
