This movie was absolutely hideous! I can not understand how this film brought production. Nothing against shooting a movie, of course, it's all the mistake of a writing team. You take the old average conspiracy - we danced the path of being poor and forced - or STEP in this case. But this does not have any form of a real conspiracy-or at least something that somebody cares about. With Canadian speakers actors in what is to be an American - this movie is falling. In a good position, the direction was quite good and the cinematography was quite decent. It looks like the budget for production was generous too. My only demand is for this team to leave writing alone and go to find real screenwriters to help them bring words alive to the film. Net result - How it moves, how angry it is.
