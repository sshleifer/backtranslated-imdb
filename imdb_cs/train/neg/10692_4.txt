Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered as she left for Italy, weary of the Hollywood spell. At first it suffered from the suffering of the volcanic island in the town of STROMBOLI, an artistic failure that would kill a less-durable actress. And now it's EUROPA 51, another boring exercise in a wet mood. The story did not do much for Alexander Knox, in another ungrateful role as her long-standing husband who is trying to calm her down after the suicidal death of their young son. At least it has better production value and a more consistent scenario than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still appealing here, but it is matronized as a rich society. She had never been able to cope with the sudden loss of her son, even though it was an attempt on a dear friend. "Sometimes I think I've avoided," she told her wife. A dirty statement in a movie that is totally free of humor or grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story is going. Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with bad children does not improve his emotional health, and from there he gets worse. The overall effect of the film is that it is not interesting enough to get into the project for a major star such as Bergman. The film loses momentum in the middle of the story, while Bergman becomes more and more upset and her husband suspects that she is two-timing him. The story goes downhill after treating the street pawn in her final illness. The ultimate plot plot is for her husband to need her for observation in a mental asylum. Ingrid suffers from nobility over everything (over-compensating for loss of her son), but it is not useful. Not just one of her best movies, in a nutshell. Note: If mental health neorealism wished, it could be better if SNAKE PIT leadership was taken by Director Anatole Litvak! He would be more than EUROPA 51 for his career. Summary: Another indiscreet of Rossellini and Bergman.
