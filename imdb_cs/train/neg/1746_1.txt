Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> No line of land. Very little character development. <br /> <br /> Strong and stupid humor. The whole movie was messy and out of the way. The story was not right. The airport was shot in a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> The same story chewed again and again until you said "Please, just keep going!" Even song and dance were useless and poorly choreographed. The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot dots all around ... but then most Bollywood movies have that, just like today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
