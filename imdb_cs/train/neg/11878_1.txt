Indeed, if it turns out, this movie is simply not fun. Josh Kornbluth is the opposite of fun and yet he thinks he is cheerful. The conspiracy to send 17 letters was fine, until Josh "look at me, I'm miserable," he started to attack every scene. Judas Priest joke may be the least funny thing I've ever received, and it says quite a bit because it has a solid competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And as for the incredible overuse of the "Debaser" Pixies, I have one thing to say: What Pixies did to deserve such fate? What did Josh Kornblut do, who made him shoot / shoot / produce / star in such a terrible movie?
