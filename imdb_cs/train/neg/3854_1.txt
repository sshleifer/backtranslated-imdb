Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who has a lot of potential with the leadership of a renowned agent. Obviously, the person who led her to this travesty is not someone who does something about her career. I was sitting in a theater surrounded by teenagers who had a different film in the mountains to find out who would think who would think this film would attract anyone. It was badly written, the director of the department could only give 1-2 minutes effort to the character and the director apparently did not care.
