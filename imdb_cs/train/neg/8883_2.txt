Cliff Robertson, who, as an enthusiast who married a wealthy wife, brings acting performance if ever there; it's as if director Michael Anderson still screamed "Dial it, think of the zombies, just less lively" through his little bullhorn when he trained Robertson's efforts. The rest of the cast is barely better; Jennifer Agutter of the LOGAN'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should be embodied as a key role. If the quality of acting was three times better; if some of the larger holes were filled; and if the stimulation was given by adrenaline, then this custom could get to the standard acceptable to Hallmark \ Lifetime TV channel. As it is, his rating is so inexplicably high that he can not help to think about the chronic insomnia that DOMINIQUE uses to catch a little delay. Maybe TV telemarketing servers in the late night miss a great opportunity without being interested.
