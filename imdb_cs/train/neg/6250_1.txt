I really liked it. That's when I realized all the bugs in it. It's so unrealistic. I know it's a fiction, but it's not even a little believable. Here's the reason. ** Spoilers before humans ... ** Do we really assume that a child like Yugi would descend from the pharaoh of ancient Egypt? Come on! It's the biggest nerd on Earth's face. And what happens to Pharaoh's hair (aka Atem and / or Yami)? The last time I checked, the Pharaohs shaved (except for some hair on their heads) and wearing luxurious hats. And we have to be convinced that the evil rich genius boy called Seto Kaiba can legitimately run a successful business while he has time to go to a dirty little school such as Domino High? Puh-leeze! First, he must be legally grown to run a business. And that would not make him a very genius boy because he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why would he attend a "Domino High" school when his business is obviously successful enough to visit a fanciful Snob Academy? In addition, the side plots with their little brother are so scary and chaotic. Every time you turn around, the kid was kidnapped by bad guys. * yawning * nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor child who lives with a good father. He says Joey gets all the money to visit his school because his father is an alcoholic, but Joey never sees that he's doing something reminding work. It does not even work. And his sister Serenity is a complete fool. Why would she choose the snob like a duke (who put his brother in his costume and publicly humiliated him on television), and for a nice guy like Tristan? Is it really so clueless? Different characters throughout the show get obsessed with demonic forces to keep their souls from demonic powers and become prey to mental illness. (Oh, that's safe for kids, no.) Tea is a typical type of girl - a minor type whose only purpose is to be a girlfriend Yugi / Yami. And while she has some cold spots for her, she just does not have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is just horrible. All characters look bad and anorexic. Perspectives are horrible (especially when they do close to one's hand) and the colors look good, but not stellar. But the worst hole in the series was the fact that Yami says his Millennium Puzzle can send the soul back to the body. If so, how did Jugi's grandpa not save when Pegasus stole his soul and rescued the trouble of getting her back? In fact, it's commercial for yourself. The only plus side is the "Yu-Gi-Oh: Truncated Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more important. Take a look at the abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
