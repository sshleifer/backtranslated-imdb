I was (bad) lucky to see this movie at an American show. When I was reluctantly sad, I was shocked to see so many good IMDB reviews. The original film was Turkey, but interesting. It happened in the early seventies, after the 1969 revolution; this film just smells ......., well, nothing really. It's so bad. Imagine a miserable perfume advertisement - do you see what I mean? Madonna could never act and it was embarrassing on the big screen for years. It looks worse and worse in each of those years, making it more and more like a horse with a sword. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who has built his "reputation" on Lock Stock, has never been able to drive - his films are shallow, poorly cut, fashion shows. He does not even disappoint here; he wisely occupied his wife as the star of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Please, people, keep a little good reviews of this movie from other posters below. Of course they are entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to continue humiliating by giving him the money. <br /> <br />
