Wow, guys are pretty nice! Corny, Corny, Corny That's what I feel about the movie. (Edward Asner) escaped from prison dressed as Santa, he believes his real Santa so Fake Santa to take the kids to help him find a bag of stolen money.the movie is like the Christmas version of "Whistle Down wind ". The film starts well but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that it eventually becomes ridiculous and you just can not take this movie seriously. For example, you get a Scrooge type named Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), who is a total of Douchebag, who treats his young son as a pile of rubbish, treats his son so badly that he does not even buy decent clothes, Jeans with holes in it! but a 45 second scene with Fake Santa visits Sumner and by the end of the movie you get a guy all happy singing Christmas Carol and giving his neglected son a hug ... Yeah, that's how Corny is ... I'm all for feeling good movie, especially during Christmas and I'm a big fan of seasonal television, but this is too good for me, it's a shame because it started well, but the other half of the film pulls a supernatural feature of a movie that simply disagrees with the rest. It's not bad, there's some solid acting, especially from kids, but there's a lot of better Christmas movies.
