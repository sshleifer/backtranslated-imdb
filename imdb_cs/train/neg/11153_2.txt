Another in a long line of movies from people who think the knowledge of camera control is the same as telling the story. Within 15 minutes, the whole assumption is divided into several rows, so there is absolutely no secret that would eliminate the whole aspect of tension. The only half-hour competent actor is killed in the film for 10 minutes, so we stayed with silly characters running around stupid things. Low-budget movies can not afford expensive special effects, so parts of CGI are not surprisingly insurmountable, but they were at least a valid attempt. A terrible suit is terrible, as it can be seen when it sinks down the pavement, and the director still emphasizes the eyes that are neither red in mirror shots. Dialogue is clumsy and uninspiring, with some lines resembling Alien or Terminator. The last action sequence takes place at the police station, and also the Terminator's detachment, all hiding in a glass office that Darkwolf will not accumulate. Eventually the girl calls the hero of the "good protector" but receives both her partners, the original protector and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without a decent shot. despite the arsenal of silver bullets and submachine gun. But here is the real basis for bad writing: They could have killed the beast right after the beginning of holding the stripper and blinking red. Instead, he put them in custody ?!
