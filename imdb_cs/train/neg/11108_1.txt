Where to start. The film started quite well, but after 30 minutes I caught watching the clock. Horror at the beginning of the movie was good, but then the story kicked in. It just became more stupid and stupid as time was ticked. Actors gave the average performance in this film, however, I got when the film stretched out and took my word for it, dragged it, just getting more and more attracted. SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie could not get worse, the end is overloaded when the skeleton-looking monsters appear, just eating the dead which did not make sense at all. It turned out to be a body that nourishes the cult, and good guys die at the end. The ending actually made me just laugh at how bad it was. As soon as the main role is freed from Vinny Jones, he becomes a new killer. <br /> <br /> In the end, this Creep movie looked like the best horror movie ever to have been. I gave her one star because the woman was doing a pretty good job, but she could not save this train from the wreck of the movie!
