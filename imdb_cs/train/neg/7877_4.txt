The creators of this film have created a future where not only abortion and birth control are illegal in every state, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long sentences of imprisonment. In other words, this film is every liberal worst nightmare! the political agenda is so tough and the style of the film is so low that it loses the couple quite quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are, I would recommend skipping it.
