I'm not a regular Springer browser, but I look at his show in a flash and I think the show is a good guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So naturally I will watch this movie, which expects to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First of all, Jerry appears about twenty minutes after the movie. You spend the second hour and twenty minutes building this pseudo-fare on trailer, jealousy, incest, and deceit. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a tragedy sadness that sleeps with her stepfather (very unusual, magical, drunk Michael Dudikoff, who eventually gets rid of his action hero persona). Mother learns about this matter, gets into the fight, wants to take her to the "Jerry Show" (that's true, not Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American. They will come to the "Jerry" show. Those characters collide. Blah, blah, crazy fool! Trash is rarely this BORRRINGG !!!! I wondered why Springer had millions of fans, but none of them had seen their movie. Well, now it's quite obvious! Whether you love or hate him, you hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a complete disorder of the movie (if you say it). It's so poorly crafted, with scenes that just do not connect, and after a certain time the mystery will practically disappear and it's just across the map! Imagine that the predictable soap opera has changed into a comic. Rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is the hot girl-girl scene. It's as risky as he gets it. Do not get me wrong, the scene is quite risky, but if you look at a total movie that compares with the Springer material, this disastrous farce seems to be extremely disinfected. My score: 3 (out of 10)
