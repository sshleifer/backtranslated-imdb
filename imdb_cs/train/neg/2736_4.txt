The only reason I comment is that I finally found out why Dr. Cox bald. Although we all probably all of them have said this week, Dr. Cox is bald because he showed these episodes in a different order than filmed. The latest episode when our favorite, dear sister Roberts, who loves Jesus, is dying. He has to show them for an extraordinary reason for some special reason and forgot that they have slipped into continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes before. I remember when Elliot tries to get Scott Foley and her hair wet for two seconds before the water strikes her. I try not to record these things, but my favorite show needs to be stronger.
