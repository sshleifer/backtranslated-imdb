In fact, he had to stop. Do not get me wrong, love bad monster movies. But this was too boring, regardless of the thrilling music that never brought you anywhere. The actress had too much teeth, and the clich√© was too obvious when she came into contact with one of those animals. This film is completely betraying a DVD cover that looks quite interesting. From the cover we expect a huge monster, but these cute not as gigantic, as was the expectation of electric eel. He was moving to watch the next movie The Killer Rats, but that's another review. Deep Shock was really stupid, a big shame because it looks like a pretty high budget.
