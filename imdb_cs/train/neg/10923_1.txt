A television film about the ancient Egyptian curse brought the first version of the Ten Commandments to the United States in the 1920s during the filming of DeMille, and which is revived when DeMille sets are discovered in the desert. One of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. The question is, did the filmmakers be serious or shit when they filmed this movie? If it's serious, it's a ridiculously bad movie and a great movie you can choose for your bad guy. If his comedy is less good, but fun for all the wrong reasons. In this movie you will laugh long and hard, probably more than many other "comedies" in Hollywood.
