I do not know who thought the Orcans were going around killing people and whining and destroying things for vengeance, but my god is absurd. Orcas are definitely not the cold-blooded killer who makes this movie to be ... stupid. The Orcans are extremely intelligent, do not do me wrong, but I very much doubt they know and understand concepts like revenge. So I have to say that everything I got from this movie was fun as it was absurd. So I had a little fun. Personally, I would recommend going and seeing Jaws if you want to see the type of Animal-Killing-Humans. But if you are like me and want to laugh at something so far from realism, then I would say you go on. : D
