Fidelity to Peter Falk is all that gave me this terrible image (1) he deserves. (In fact, I believed Mr. Falk that I was watching this movie all the way from head to tail.) Even if you forgive all the obvious mistakes, it was simply the poorest excuse for the creator of the "Columbo" movie at all. I'm glad to watch her on TV for free; would hate it if he scolded his money for printing.
