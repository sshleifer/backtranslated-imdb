Well, I was blown, Woody Allen's film, which I missed after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on the movie I've seen less than half, but I hope you'll understand why). In fact, it turned out very soon that we would probably be supportive of the screen: a scenario that explained its mood as if it had beads; cast that all tried to be characters from Hanna and her sisters (except Chloe Sevigny) and were misdirected; and a camera that sits enormously, except there was nothing to film but chat and the actor deliver. Drama? None; it is partly pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to trigger a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe in this case I left too soon, but then I decided against another hour and a half of one clone-Allen clones. Does the script have fun moments? I went almost completely to the back of the Will Ferrell clippings in a trailer (trailer - turned on, oh!) ?? but there are few steps that would allow them to fly unannounced as best they can. Worse than it is not fluency. Let's say the wood film of this film makes the forest look like jelly: the initial cafe-bound discussion is the most abject case-in-point. The only thing that should be done by numbers is a potted review? 2/10.
