I saw one of the theater shows in Denver and I was never less impressed. The word "vagina" says everything. A body part. Nothing here is shocking. I could tell my doctor: "Your left hand is a bit hurt for tennis" or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with the same or more social commentary. It could be "Triceps monologues" for all the fun or radical comments I've heard. Monologues were boring, but they brought drama, the themes were obsolete, and I was bored and angry alternately. Once I think I laughed, but it probably was not when I had. It's definitely not really a hit. Oh, and the spoilers: there was a forester! - oh, wait, maybe not, think about it. And inappropriate pitching! A Crack Mom! This is about it.
