I'm horrified at how bad this movie is. As a beginner of the 20th century, Hollywood artists set a new low - even past The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I'd see a movie worse than you two. It was about something a little different & time. However, the intentions and results were terribly similar. <br /> <br /> First it's a terrible casting: Eddie Izzard like CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe the guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even begin to attempt to capture the look or sound of the period they are supposed to portray. Well, Last Picture Show was a decent movie, but this thing is a disaster, and the rest of Bogdonovitch's pictures was not much better. Guess he's shaking with Welles & Hitch & Ford has long since lost. Still good for hosting TCM.
