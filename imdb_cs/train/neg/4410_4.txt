A typical action movie: a good cop gets involved in the mess of criminal police and Japanese gangsters. The result is a good result, decent performances, several summer breaks and some fair events - plus the chance to see the beautiful Danielle Harris - who uses her eternal form as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** from ****.
