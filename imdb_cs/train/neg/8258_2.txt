I was lucky to read the book before I saw the movie. It was an epic episode of adolescence, a dream of summer flying, a great potential Indian movie or a big budget drama. Somehow it got into the hands of hackers who clearly noticed Boogie Nights and Rushmore without knowing anything. The script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and faint eyebrows. I'm sorry for the actors because the characters in the book were rich and structured, but they were reduced to embarrassing features in the movie. Mason Gamble is great when he gets the opportunity, as well as Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains from the story plays like bad after school. Poor people = good, rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Though it's almost worth watching to see the South California beach, where Gary Sinise parks his trailer, which is designed to be licensed for the Bay of Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but the tumultuous turn of the first director, Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br />
