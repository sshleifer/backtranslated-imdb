Woody Allen has made some of the biggest comedies at all and I really would like to say that Annie Hall is the biggest film ever, but if I really thought about it, I would probably think of one or two that is better, but it would be hard. Of course he had some movies that are not good enough but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he had never before had the film as bad as Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and so unhappy, his movies are usually funny and funny, but how did that happen, is he still our good old Woody? The plot takes place around four friends who together have dinner. Two are playwrights and one of the others mentions the funny story that happened to her boyfriend. This is a young woman who is unexpectedly dying for dinner. We have never heard of the rest because two songs are starting to debate whether it would mean better comedy or tragedy. Then we begin to see two points of view. They both concentrate on this woman named Melinda who has problems with drugs and her former husband. Tragedy is an old family girlfriend who, after suicide attempt, has decided to appear with her oldest best friends. The comedy is about Melida, who pulls off at the party when she picks up 28 sleeping pills. They both go to the wild vortex of events that never make sense, nor do they fit together or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some nice performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not fit together there on their own. They did not stop it sinking this year beyond most other films.
