Trust me, this is one movie you do not want to avoid, and it comes from one big fan of Denzel Washington. The disappointment is that it is a third of a big movie. The first part of the film makes extraordinary work to set the character and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl she paid for protection. Trailers to this movie all report being kidnapped. So, I do not give anything when I say that the film after being kidnapped will drop into an almost impregnable mess. Whatever the director tried to achieve, all he could do was that the audience literally took possession of it. Fast, frantic and jerked cuts follow for another half hour when Creasy follows the offender. These cuts are so unnatural and disorderly that everything they do is distract them from the story. I'm sure the director thought that this turbulent way of presenting the story meant a change in the character of Creasy and meant that another film should be followed. Well, he was right. The following movie was complete and unsatisfactory. The result is a depressing end that destroys even the first forty minutes of the film.
