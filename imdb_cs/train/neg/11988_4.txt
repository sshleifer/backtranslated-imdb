I left this film with feelings that could have been much better. Instead of a breathtaking, tense story about a boy's struggle for survival in the wilderness, it will appear when the National Geographic document meets with Columbia sportswear. The film begins with Brian (Jarre Rushton) preparing to travel by plane to see his father. His mother accidentally gives the quaint choice of the ax as a determined gift (what is happening to the Rubik's Cube?), Little to know how much it will soon need. Once in the air, the pilot (blink-and-you'll-miss-him comes by Ned Beatty) suffers from a fatal heart attack, so Brian helpless as a plane crashes into the lake. Extremely happy when you walk (or rather swim) practically undamaged, Brian has to find shelter, food and hope for rescue. Here's where the main film problem begins. Given the very nature of Brian's solitude, Jared has only a few rows to talk about, so the film should be matched by accelerating the tension of each scene. Instead it is shown walking, sitting around, and so on, with only minimal danger. As a result, she relies too much on the memory of parental restless marriage as a source of tension. These scenes simply get in the way and do not add much to the story. Even worse, sometimes Jared? his face covered with mud - launches the first or two cries that trigger unhappy parallels with 'Predator'. I was talking about the unfortunate way that we could have done when we spared a look at his plumage, but it probably helped keep him warm at night. Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in utterly inefficient performance as a mother. Both together with their father have little influence in the film. For example, we never show how they respond to reports of Brian's disappearance, how they could organize rescue attempts, and so on. It is the only source of tension that filmmakers have done well to spend so much time on the events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey.
