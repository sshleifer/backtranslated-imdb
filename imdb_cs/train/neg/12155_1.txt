If this movie was written and produced with the intention of creating a bad classical classic, it could be (as I say, maybe) a hit. Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so terrible that it becomes fascinating in terms of its mistakes? That's it. Each of the actors should be nominated for the worst acting performance. It would be hard to find another movie, with this production budget that contains so little of any value. The whole thing, from the opening scenes, dispels logic. The dialogue is absolutely unbelievable and illogical. This is the behavior and general story of the film itself. What is really funny is that some buffoons in the meeting room actually made a decision to spend money on this waste. Wow.
