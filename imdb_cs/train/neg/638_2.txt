Good Earth is perhaps the most intimidating movie I've ever seen in my life. This thing is slow and lacking. The game is a frontier comic. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I have seen a movie that does not do its true ability of justice. The only saving mercy I have found with this film is its productive value. Using hundreds of add-ons throughout the movie creates a very credible and exciting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are easy to sell and were revolutionary at the time. Apart from production value, I can not say anything else about what is good or fun about this movie.
