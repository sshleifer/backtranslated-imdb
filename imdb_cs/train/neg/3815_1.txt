The game is bad ham, all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is apparently very young children, assuming they have below average IQ. I realize that it was meant for children, but it's also Malcolm on the Wednesday, but it still throws adult humor and situations. What should we expect at the show led by Bob Saget, the only comedian who is less entertaining than the ball that hits a man's weakness, which is probably why he stopped hosting the American Funniest Home Videos. Parents, do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money at college. Show your children stupid and grow up.
