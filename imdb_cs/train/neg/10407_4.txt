I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, to be boring and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of modern home cats, if not smaller. The game was terrible and this movie was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor series, because even if it tells the story of how the grabs were created, the story is so stupid and useless. Also, if you want to tell the story back in time, make sure you use the same ACTOR Gross), be someone in the past when someone is present in other films Tremor.Geez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste time.Stick to Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, for good time.This movie, however, that you are far away sitting next to you with the STOP button works for a quick retreat from this nonsense.
