Opening for 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved that he had only a good idea for the rest of the movie. The absolute lowest common denominator humor. Painful monitoring. Complete work. Undoubtedly less than a week, as well as the first. Give Meyers a hook and secure him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let him down until he develops a decent script for something, nothing. It has it in it. These things Austin Powers are just embarrassing. <br/> <br/> Let Goldmember sink without a trace.
