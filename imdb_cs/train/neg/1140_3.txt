Scary, but mostly in the sense that it will end before I'm 70 years old. I saw this as a late night again in 1976, and I thought it would never end. Just like crackers it's better than nothing (but only). Ray Milland is a bit frightening because it looks like he's stuffed with a taxi driver. Yvette Mimeux looks like she smokes all the beautiful Burbank Brown center. <br /> <br /> It's Roy Rogers's version of Rosemary's Baby. This is one turkey that should never be made. If you have insomnia and it's Saturday morning at 1:30 and it's nothing but taking over the Roller Derby in 1972, then it's probably too. But God will help you if it's your only choice for fun.
