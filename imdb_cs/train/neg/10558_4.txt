I do not know why the fans have it, and I do not know why I even gave them the score I have. That's absurd. There is a lot of giallo where one has to stop mistrust, let the picture horn and catch up with him before he becomes crazy and some poor policemen must finally explain what we have seen. But it has very little, and it has too long sequences in which nothing happens and it does not matter for anything while we have to listen to the most recurring soundtrack, even according to Italian standards. It is not giallo, it is a complete bowl of horrible ideas with Klaus Kinski in one of the most popular "phoned" shows. I think he appeared, did his day job, and cleared that Mr. D'Amato had left to get the others. Ewa, of course, is pretty, but it's not enough, and in the end we have seen too many of her openings all over the place, long after we've completely lost interest in this inspiration and difficulty. Maybe I just was not in the right mood!
