I can sit this movie once, but I doubt it would be the second time. Slightly fun especially for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. Matt Dillon's entertainment (something about Mary) and the resurgence of Michael Keaton's more serious acting. This is not fun romp The Love Bug, but it's observable. One of my main detractions from the film was the fact that Herbie developed for the most part into R2D2. I did not want to bother the effects of the headlamps for about the second time about thirty times when they were used, and the bending front fender caused me the same reaction. Take a look at this with small children, that is, Children with one digit and do not expect to see much of this movie. <br /> <br />
