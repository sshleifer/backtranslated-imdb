This film did not have any huge stars in it, but it had a very good cast full of excellent supporting actors A Gene Tierney before it became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Josh Callei and Cederic Hardwick, you would expect more than the movie to actually deliver. I think most of them are due to the second stage scenario because director Henry Hathaway was a competent and respected man on the rudder. The film is located in East Africa during the Second World War - just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while the subversive Nazi elements are trying to provoke difficulties among the locals. One of the white men in the movie is a double - working to destroy the British Empire! But beautiful Tierney, who plays Sultan's daughter (!), Helps save the day for good Britain. American filmmakers have a long way to go with the Empire and the 1930s and the 1940s a number of pro-empire films. Nowadays, with changed sensitivities, it seems ridiculous to see the happy black natives dying behind the queen and the earth - and it would be difficult to root on both sides! Yet, at the time, this propaganda track was effective in drumming support for the British - though when viewed today, the film suffers from long-lasting scripting and silly casting. The only clear moment in the movie is the final settlement between George Sanders and the enemy. It was a pity that, after such a strong scene, the film seemed to be talking and talking - it lost part of its strike.
