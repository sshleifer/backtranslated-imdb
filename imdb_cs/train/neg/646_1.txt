I saw this movie by accident and this movie was an accident ... but it must be. blonde women who encounter, the villain appeared, and then vanished from one place to another as he disappeared and reappeared hiding. he was not even a super hero, so I do not know how he did it. He could not scare a cat and it's not hard to do. the old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer frightening, in fact it stopped scary years before. you had a cop on the path of a villain, another cliché (played idris elba with a very convincing American accent, he is from London), the director had no clue and made a film full of clichés and making "spooky motion" which was comedy looks scary. pathetic!
