This movie was so amateur that I barely believed what I saw. It's filmed on VIDEO! NO film! I have not seen it since the beginning of the 1970s, when a film about weekly "horror flicks" shot in ... video appeared in nightclubs. It looks like a bad soap opera, and it's a compliment. Some actors do the best. Michael Des Barres is fine with what to do, which is to act as a sexual habit outside of control. I can not say it's nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski as a therapist sits in a chair practically for the entire movie, with very little variation in the camera angle. I can not question her about the poor blocking of someone else, but she is absolutely incredible in her role. Her little girl is against her here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassja Kinski. She is certainly carefree and exotic, but she is out of reach. Alexandra Paul is pathetic. Each line it supplies is with three exclamations. Someone had to make her cry at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a furious rescue? Eventually, Rosanna Arquette as a sweet, frantic wife falls out of order and probably the most reliable of the bundle. But that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst movie I have seen for years.
