What I found so curious about this movie - I saw a full 4 hour roadshow version, it's so strange that it's harsh. For a film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, engaged in tremendous political struggle, are almost completely without emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is best second only with a slightly high voice) have no drama or depth and basically coincide with Castro, who tells Chee: Go here, go there, do it and without explaining what the effect or use of this action will result. Odder is still an actor in the cast who has the power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he is shunted aside in the smaller part in the second half. Without the strain or passion that you would expect to shoot these men and their followers, the film becomes a rough film about long epics about furry, bearded men passing through different jungles, screaming and shooting for no particular purpose or end. Several reviews I read fused to Steven Soderberg's work while the actors almost ignored. (One actually spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than a story or actor or the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a special, special action because a) Soderbergh was just a rental weapon on the film ab) it's just a competent work job with an unmarked nod to JFK Oliver Stone in a black-and-white cut when working with a camera when Che is visiting New York. If you can imagine Reds director Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you get an idea of ​​the boring power of this movie.
