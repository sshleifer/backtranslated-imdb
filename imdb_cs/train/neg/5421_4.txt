This is one of the topics I can associate with a lot more than most people because I hate the noise and I have no idea how you are in the big cities, especially in New York, especially how people have to sleep at all! I wondered how people can endure all the noise in these days. The basic motive of the film is that it makes an interesting subject. It's a bad thing about it. Tim Robbbins is decent, although with the exception of several scenes (especially with the supermodel Margarita Leiveva), he does not seem to be really there. My biggest hope for this film is that the agent cast will see the absolutely amazing and talented actress to be bought, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do but she is a beautiful supermodel. Even if she tries to look at another girl next to herself. I am sad that people such as Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian can be in a world without interchangeable skills or talents to gain more glory and success than this gifted beauty. I did not care much about this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I saw some new talent. I hope the producers and directors think of Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to make a big budget movie. If Megan Fox can create a star (because she is not so hot and her actor talent is worse than Disney Channel TV shows) from one movie, it should be easy for her because she is wonderful & has talent! I would recommend her to change her surname so that we can speak and handle it. I hope it will be her career, and if there is any justice, she may appear in some great summer movie over the next few years.
