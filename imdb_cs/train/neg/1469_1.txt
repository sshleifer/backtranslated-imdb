Just like watching home movies in the neighboring summer camp, "Indian Summer" is sleep-inducing sleep. The eight graduates who graduate from the studio are hardly imagined when incredibly boring obstacles for characters we do not know about. Certain actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton, are totally unnecessary in this film. One camp awareness that "everything seems to be much smaller than I remember," is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you rage. The predicted jokes are neither funny nor original if you think the short film is a real "bastard". This film was a great disappointment with regard to sufficient talent. "Indian Summer" I did not think I was sick. - MERK
