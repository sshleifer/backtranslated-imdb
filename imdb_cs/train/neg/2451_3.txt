This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else I've ever seen. Indeed, if you are a fan of Tolkien, rent it just to laugh him with your friends. I'm not going to be a millionth person to separate his mistakes ... all I'm saying is that the movie (for me, anyway) has lost the main points to turn my favorite character, Sam, into a stupid idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
