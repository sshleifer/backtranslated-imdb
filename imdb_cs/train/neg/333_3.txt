I remember when the Golden Child was released in 1986, it was critics everywhere and I talked so horribly that it almost ended Eddie Murphy's glamorous career, so I think this movie has something to do. the beginning when Buddhist monks kneel before the child with a blank expression on his face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> boys pull a huge bird cage and hold the baby inside that is now sitting ... Continue Guess? You get the impression that even if he's taken him to sleep at Michael Jackson's Miraculous Ranch, he'd still have the same blank look, this movie will be better called THE DREW CHILD <br /> <br /> The title sequence begins and is a movie from the 1980s pop soundtrack features. Obviously, it could be cool and funky at the time, but now in 2004 it looks very dated. Not only that, but full spring with some bloody opening. In fact, this is the main problem (and the boy is serious) with this movie - The whole mood seems to be changing from scene to scene so much that it's sometimes like watching scenes from totally different films connected together. I personally blame the director, but it should also be emphasized that both the screenwriter and the producer should share the same guilt. Did anyone say before the shoot, what kind of movie will it be? It's part of fantasy, part of martial arts, part of comrade, part of comedy and it's all crap
