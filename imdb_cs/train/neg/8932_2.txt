I have to say that I was very curious about viewing this film and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by the 20th century Fox in 1970. It also appeared on several critics lists of bad films, and it only deepened the interest as I had to see what made this movie so bad. When I see him, I think I have answers. Although I'm going to say it makes for a curious look, acting, direction and script are so ridiculous that the supposed satire is completely absent. It seems that Racquel Welch is trying to wear a movie, but after the startup sequence of the sex change operation, the film goes so far up the hill that she can not do the job herself. John Huston, as Uncle Buck Loner, certainly does not help licking and looking at the canvas; sometimes he seems to wonder what he is doing there. Rex Reed jumps around like Myron, Myra's alter ego and even has his own celebrated scene of masturbation. Bravo on debut performance! Farrah Fawcett plays a naked blonde; in this role it seemed convincing. Of course, the fairest roles took place in the West of Mae. The look of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face that makes sexual moods seemed more suitable for horror film. I do not think I would personally destroy this; but in this movie no one does not look good. The direction seems so unsatisfied and there is no such thing as the film is not only bad but also boring. Ride old movie stars from old stars and film is even more disconnected. To everybody who liked it, and I was glad to see him at least, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be a disaster that has always been seen from the start.
