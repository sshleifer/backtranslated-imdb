102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of a previous installment, and she has all the weaknesses of the first, stupid, cushioned storyline, horrible that Glenn Close, who tries on every scene, is playing her own fun and incredibly boring and unimportant actors . Dogs are once again the only "actors" who seem "real" and that is a stretch. Another unnecessary effort. CLASS: D
