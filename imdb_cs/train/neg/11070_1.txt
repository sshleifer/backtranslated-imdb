That was really a bad movie. The character "Cole," played by Michael Moriarty, was the biggest reason he got this flop, the actor felt he would conjure an incredibly clumsy southern shot, making it a bad thing. After about 20 minutes, I wanted the referent therapist to show up, which would add some honesty. <br /> <br /> - 1) badly acting - 2) non-symptomatic characters - 3) /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
