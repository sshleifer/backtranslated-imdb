As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had (finally) to watch this very, very boring picture. It's Miss Dietrich's first color film and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a huge uproar about a topic that makes me, of course, dirty: religious guilt. (Who needs it?) It's enough to say that all of Dietrich's films (and I've seen most, including "Pittsburgh") are the only ones where even his performance is hardly worth watching. Color photographs are fine (this is very early release of Technicolor), but without purpose. Excellent casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough to say?). The only thing she cares about is John Carradine's extraordinary caricature of a performance like "The Divine Sander," which predicts everything that's going to happen. The anticipated "happy ending" is one of the most depressing concepts. Another example of the great encouragement of David O. Selznicka (does he ever do a really good movie - other than this one?) And for the latest disillusionment, the soundtrack MGM DVD is a clutter, seemingly a randomized volume. Not highly responsive.
