My wife and I are watching the film every night without any distractions and mostly art films that require thoughts. I have a lot of patience for movies that are slowly blooming. My wife has the double attention I'm doing. All that was said - this movie is just empty and BORING! It was not going anywhere. They never bloom. It started quite strong with a promising conspiracy ... then we bake for biscuits ... goes to Spain ... she is angry, stares ... the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false beginnings and dead ends. FF we went through several extended sequences that were just staring into the universe. Artificial depth was implied when playing with mud and crying. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully fired chicken that pretends to be deep or artistic. You never know or understand Morvern at all. About halfway you do not care. We just wanted to see that at least one of the bar sections develops. Do not waste time on it. I'm shocked to be so tall.
