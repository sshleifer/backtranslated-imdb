This movie is so bad that she wanted to vomit me. Badly made, complete zone without laughter. Why in the name of God would you anoint a movie that is, to a certain extent, spoof (and damn funny about it), how does it cost? The sets are ridiculous, the effects are so bad they are not even ridiculous, and the acting actor. It's a complete secret, why would you even consider tracking this piece of garbage. National Lampoon once created the Animal House, which people still think is totally cheerful. They are now being condemned to make TV movies look like ****. Name your theme and could be used to describe this movie.
