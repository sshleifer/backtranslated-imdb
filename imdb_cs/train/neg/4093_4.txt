The story and the characters are ridiculous and barely qualified as "fence" and "character". The biggest problem is that everything is dark, blurred and blurred. The fact that Fulci filled the film with fog does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is totally bizarre and full of sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite funny, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he is projected into a new guy in a minute and has a whole range of women on his side. Although it will show its antisocial tendencies by accidentally putting the arrow in some poor b ***** d who are just looking at their own business! Pictures of blood or gore flowing gain more attention than figures, but what you want from Fulci. Maybe it destroyed his career, but it was not really much more stupid than Zombie. You're on hire if you like bloody Italian flicks or you are desperate for sword and witchcraft or something bizarre. How do you sleep by inhaling the pit 2 feet away from the head and shouting for help?
