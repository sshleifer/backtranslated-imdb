Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a little modern psychological point of view, then see live performances are the only things worth watching. This film has tunes and tons of the camera band, together with President Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-leading role and a lot of fucking deadly scenes. Sounds like it could be good, is not it? Well, deaths are still coming and repeatedly into many different Warp Tour groups and fans at the event. Some of the deaths begin to be stylish, but they are recycled again and again until they are completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies that their head is broken or intestines drawn out of their stomach. Gore looks like it was from "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" by Andreas Schnaas; with the fact that it's a "diluted blood type," but now the film is really decent and provides humor - something that is terribly lacking in this movie. Sure, the movie shot by Doug Sakmann from Troma, he has great low budget potential and he's trying ... but it's too hard. Everything is extremely fun in this movie and that's what it brings. Everything is trying to be too comical and frantic, through deliberate misconduct, overuse of meaningless deaths and doing the same thing ... over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board" or any movie you've made with your friends: it's funny for those who did it, and that's probably it. <br /> <br /> Potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it's the same ... again and again: The band is playing, the group dies, the fans are dying. Everybody dies, the blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated. The question is for these types of movies - which is basically a "bad slap-stick" - trying too hard or not at all?
