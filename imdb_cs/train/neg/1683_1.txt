It's hard to call The Grudge as a horror movie. At best, for a few moments, I'm a little bit surprised. If one forgets (unsuccessfully) scary proportions and looks at other parts of the film, he is again disappointed. The game is fine, but it's not great. The story may be a little interesting at first, while one is trying to get what's going on. But to the end we understand that it is not very understandable. "Scary" elements seem to be sometimes added to the script for no reason ... So ... (yawning) Check out this movie if you do not have anything more interesting doing like cutting carrots or looking at the clouds.
