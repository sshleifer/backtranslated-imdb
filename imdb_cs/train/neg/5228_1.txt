I saw this movie at night. I can not even begin to say how much this film has sucked. Writing, voice talk, even hot. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span due to comedy. It simply does not work. It literally drops in all places. <br /> <br /> Also, movie animation is very poor quality. I know it's a one-man movie, but I think he could do 97 minutes for anger, maybe he could make funny one second at least. cake as the worst film of all time. So. It was really bad. If you are looking for a movie that makes you laugh, avoid this abomination. My advice: Do not even buy it or look at it. Your brain will be than you.
