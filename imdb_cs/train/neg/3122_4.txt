I could not give this film a bad rating or a bad overview for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are some slightly disturbing elements that rely on psychological, which was something the film could concentrate a bit on. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, the narrator of the night deejay who goes through personal affairs: his lover avoided, and Gabriel has what seems to be a story block story. One day he will receive and read the story written by a dying 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered in the hands of his parents. She lives with her adopted mother and social worker Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins to make friends with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers that Pete Boland does not exist at all. I will not go into detail because I do not want to pamper the film, but I'll tell you: it's quite predictable. Fascinating narrative story and good performances by Robin Williams and Toni Collette, which I thought was a film key character. Collette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and handsome actresses. Her ability to tap on the psyche and personality of the character she portrays is very strange and I hope to see her win Oscar (I think she could beat the best actress if the screenplay was a bit better). The film starts out as a psychological thriller, but it's predictable. If your curiosity is to know the end of the movie and twist, then look at the film, or I would hire another predictable thriller called "Hide and Seek".
