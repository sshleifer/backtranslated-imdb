This movie is just terrible. John Ritter makes Pratt Falls, 75% of actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cards, bad editing, terrible mixing of the sound (dialogue is hard to rise above the noise in the background) and the plot that really goes nowhere. I did not think I'd ever say it, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least three more that suck in more. Patti Hansen delivers his lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started wondering if she was dead inside. Even Bogdanovic's children are terrible (the oldest one is certainly reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is really terrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until four years later. Please do not look at it. If you see it in your TV list, unplug the cable. If a friend suggests you, reconsider your friendship. If your husband wants to look at it, then it is better to find another cohabitation. I'd like to frighten my eyes with lawns on the lawn rather than sit again in this garbage. If I could summarize this film in one word, it would be the word: Suckotrocity
