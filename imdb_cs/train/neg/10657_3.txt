I had a lot of hope for this film and I watched it with a lot of expectations. essentially because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who has forever marked footsteps in the sand of time. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this movie, brutality and violence in the dark and orange watches look a lot better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very brave policeman. Who is assigned to investigate brutal serial murders. In this case, Raghavan effectively finds a link thread and is close to resolving murders and murdering psychologists, two psychologically disrupted but brilliant medical students behind cliffs but escaping and getting killed again. Finally, Raghavan kills them both after saving many innocent lives. Three psycho-killers are the ones who will keep viewers to go to theaters. Murders and sexual harassment and rape are very clearly demonstrated, which movie could survive without. <br /> <br /> Even imagine that teenagers and children will watch this movie in the theater and the kind of painting that is required to paint in their minds is certainly not nice. Director Gautham should be aware that he also has a certain duty towards the company and its listeners. I never go to the movies to look like Gautham's name on the production list.
