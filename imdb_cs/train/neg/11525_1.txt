Just horrible! Why would not you use real actors? Look, it must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want some credibility or any message sent through these low-budget movies ... please use true actors for love of God! Most will work for free ... make use of it! Now to my comment ... anyway, humor was lower than the humor of a variety and was not funny at any level. As for quality ... in one scene shot on a public transport bus, you can see the crew's reflection ... guess what? It was one person who looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not his. Well, I suppose the only viewer of this movie is gore fetish ... and that was not a good gore.
