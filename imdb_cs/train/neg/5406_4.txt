My first opinions on this movie were, of course, bad. I expected horrible, miserable acting, bad fun, funny movies with special effects. What I got was not so bad. The special effects were totally terrible, but I found the movie very interesting and the script was actually quite good and decent. It was not bad acting, and overall I enjoyed watching this movie. It's still a bad movie, but it's not completely worthless, as I thought it would be, and I'm delighted to be able to destroy this movie even though it was not that good. Overall, this is a movie that should be avoided, but it was not as bad to me as I expected to be.
