This film has little to recommend, although little is breathtaking scenery, cinema and wildlife, it is difficult to raise its weaknesses in the company of such deep reviews. It is these things, however, that the lack of a satisfactory plot and its implementation is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I'm watching it with the kids and none of us has been overwhelmed by the end. Yes, the pictures were great, the wide landscape over the woods and the beautiful mountains, but what was going on in the foreground? A relatively boring story about the stupidity of a stupid girl who learns very slowly a very basic lesson about wildlife - and it gets pretty easy, given what's going on. It's certainly not a new story, in fact nothing new about the way it's said, and we all have seen it all before, and even more eloquently Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing really to be derived from this movie is how to work with these beautiful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
