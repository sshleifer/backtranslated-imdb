I really did not expect from the "Night Listener" and I never heard of it before I saw the VCR cover. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building a tension and tension. The opportunity is a bit stretching, but in fact it will help you think about what's going to happen and more importantly: when. As the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is drawn into some sort of "cat and mouse" until he becomes obsessed with finding the truth and existence of a 14-year-old child, sometimes seen personally. Night listening is an interesting story that is great in building tension throughout the movie and you are largely held in the darkness of who lies and what is real. However, it eventually disappoints it a little and does not fulfill the potential it could have. It does not give you a really detailed or credible explanation of another major person who would be useful and interesting.
