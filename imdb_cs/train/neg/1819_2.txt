I was looking for the film for one reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst directors of all time - right there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horror. But I was a bit disappointed, because even though the film was really bad, he never touched the level of horror of some of his older films. For this reason, this film was not very fun for us when watching fans of bad movies. Now I was cautious watching this movie, as the name "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the movie sound like a pornographic movie - something I would not rate on IMDb. However, it seemed that this film is sometimes - especially in the first 10 minutes. But you could say that the script has undergone many changes, because there is no irritation for most of the film and there is a plot at the end of the film, based on where it is violent and definitely not sexy! The result of all this is utter confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts are even good. For example, as a porn video, it surprisingly shows little and it's incomprehensible why she would have a 71-year-old guy in one of the love scenes. Surely, 71-year-old Livingston looked pretty good-but he was still an old man, and nobody wanted to see him manage a young nymph! Then, when he became very violent for the past 20 minutes, Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to take care of it and the movie has been pretty boring even with such crazy title as "Naughty Stewardesses".
