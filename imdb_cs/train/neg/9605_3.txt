This Italian film from the 1970s is not even in the classroom with dog soldiers, The Howling, or even the terrible American werewolf in Paris, but ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the main actress, stunning blondes, running in a birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nakedness ... it's obvious she's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is humming, SFX is a childish and acting (mostly) smell. The only redemption of the value of this movie is everything (and it's LOT) nudes and sexual scenes. It has grown to HBO standards, but it's still fun to see when you find yourself on a Saturday night without date. OK ... TAKE SPOILER ... There is no werewolf (except the introductory scene of the hero's ancestor). The girl only imagines that he is a werewolf ... in other words, the Lycantrope clinical.
