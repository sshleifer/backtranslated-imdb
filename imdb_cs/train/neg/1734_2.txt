I am a big fan of the old western and I do not believe that Hollywood is able to capture its old glory. But neither Ronda Fleming nor Stewart Granger can help this 1957 film, which carries almost all the sad characteristics of the western reformed shooter, who has become a good guy. a fallen but virtuous woman, fanatical city dwellers who have to turn to shooters for salvation etc. I can not even tell the last surname of the writer and the young "actor" played by Granger's son. Some nepotism? I've seen better acting in college games. Chill Wills plays the cartoon character Chill Wills. Have I already reached 1000 words?
