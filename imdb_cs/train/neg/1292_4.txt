Well ... it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I heard a lot of good things about it and I was very disappointed. I saw where the filmmakers came from, and that they were trying to express the fact that both sides in this battle were not completely different, that individuals were losing their struggles, etc. Atd. (well, that's my assumption, same = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Anyway .. the film is bored with me. I watched a lot of really long movies, but it seemed to me that it dragged on and on and on ... basically because I just could not bring myself to take care of some of the characters. I just wondered .. who cares ??? I also found that acting is rather dead and dialogue is tense. I understand it was the 1980s and all, but most of the conversations seemed rather unnatural. Nobody seemed to feel like most of the film except melodramatic events. "Romance" in the story does not seem to be supported by anything other than "I am a guy and you are a girl", which I do not consider romance, yet I felt I was guided to the belief that these people are in love. Well ... I think it's all "all sorts of horror around us, we have to make each other incline to" write something or something. I also hoped there was some dynamism among the two best friends (who at first seemed to be interested in the girl), but that was just something. Maybe I'm avoiding the love of the triangle of love. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Come on .. Daniel Holt was the only person I really liked. And Sue Lee is all right. I did not really like Jake, but it seemed to be a little ... unmanned. I did not care for Jack Bullu. And I'm pretty sure you ought to * hate just about everyone else except the poor normal people who bite to the left and right. It was quite graphic and it had the whole thing of "horror of war," but I've seen a bunch of other movies on the same topic. (I liked a lot, for example, although it was a bit emotional manipulative) But as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
