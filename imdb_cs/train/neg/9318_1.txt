This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Again, I made a mistake when buying a movie because the synapse on the back was cool and the front cover looked pretty cool. (After buying this and the movie "Malevolence", which I also studied here, I learned my lesson). I love horror films that take place in the woods, in the desert or on the farm. It is reportedly taking place in the Texas woods, but it is probably shot at the director's yard. The production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely BEST. The story had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell to F.YE and another "Mom and Pop" store that bought the used DVD and did not even take it. It is so terrible that it was a bad misapprehension for the film. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example), but it definitely takes a cake. I did not think it was a worse film than "Troll 2". The boy was wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone gives it to you for free but even if you do not stay with it if you do not throw it away, which is what I'm going to do !!!!
