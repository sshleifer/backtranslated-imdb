It's so sad that the Romanian audience is still inhabited by vulgar and uneducated people who enjoy this kind of cheap and show-like shows as superficial and brutal as the series "Garcea" or "baby toy" Vacanta mare ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such artists are never expected to regard their performance as "art." Pintilie, who shot a very good film 40 years ago ("Duminicä la ora Sase"), after which another appeared, "Reconstitution", tries to declare his artwork for his films - but unfortunately, on a very limited level, specifically cinematographic means of expression. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample "HOW NOT" - that's his only credit.
