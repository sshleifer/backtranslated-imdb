For a conscious Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit and clean up mistakes, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, error attributes, wrong clothing. from local songs and (shame of shame) of the wrong tools and other boner I just can not think of. These defects come quickly and furiously, so you have to be on your fingers. I did not make it "1" mainly because of being shot in Liverpool and actors (Rain band) give it to them (Lennon's character is credible and does a good job). Also, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at one point, and it counts for SOME. <br /> <br /> So, look at it for fun, but please do not take it as historically accurate.
