When I saw the first ten episodes, I must say that this show is upset. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but it was shot in California so we could have a scene in the desert. That would be more true for the movie. The first scene, where they are in another world, is in the mountains, with a lot of pinetres where it looks cold. It does not feel too Egyptian. What was so good in the movie was that you felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here they feel they are fighting against foreigners on the Canadian mainland. And it is so deceptive that the other planets seem to fall. You can see the leaves on the ground in the forests that look like Vancouver forest areas. It just makes the show even more incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> And then Richard Dean Anderson. He's not Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he's trying to copy Russels's performance a bit, but he's just not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as an actor as Russel. And Russell's way of playing About Neil, it was very cynical. Andersons About Neil is too mild. I liked the Russells version did not just *** and had no trouble firing the bomb until the very end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a really good job like Jackson when he takes over from James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. It's not Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! Former bodyguard with a pathetic Ra, seen only in the pilot and the next episode. Teal'c speaks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting than Jean Claude Van Damme. And the fact that Teal'c and Ra character and the people they put in the film can speak English at the same time is also incredibly dumb. What caused strangers so scary in the movie was that they spoke the ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As far as the special effects are concerned, they are really good at the pilot. But the very rare effects in the real show are badly done and look cheap. Especially the planet visited by crystals. It is so obvious that he is going through a sound scene with a bad background image. It is an insult to the audience that it looked so cheap. Especially when they managed to bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> X files have had better effects when they broadcast their first episodes in 1993. It was 4 years before SG-1 began. And they did not see two million dollars for every episode he probably had SG-1. He has to spend all his money on meals. Because I can not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring and unnecessary show, it might be great if they made a Hollywood show with a larger budget and better writers and better characters.
