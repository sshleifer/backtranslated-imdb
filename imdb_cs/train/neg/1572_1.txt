This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Striking acting, laughter "action" (it is clear that cars are traveling slowly), cruel script, terribly unsatisfactory end and incompetent direction make the film's snake. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this waste. There is no great tension in the car, and when the characters hit the moments of hope, they mix for some reason as "cruel banshees", even "high five" when they see that the bridge is running! <br /> Also a string of events that lead these people to share the same credibility of cars. Obviously based on real events? If so, the truth is obviously alien to fiction! It was unfortunate that it was portrayed in such a non-destructive way.
