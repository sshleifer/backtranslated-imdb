No, it's not a horror film ... This is actually a love story. The Ring is a silent film from 1927, which stars two boxers and a woman who comes between them. He loves a boxer known as "One Circle" Jack. He loves him until the champion comes. Even though he takes one round, he will openly flirt with the champion until the top boxing fight between one and one champion. She returns to the corner of one round, just as things look the most disgusting, and miraculously finds inner strength to win the battle and to get his wife back to love. The film was very early in Hitch's career, but time restrictions must not make him a permanent film. Although there are special movie tricks and some comic relief, this film simply does not hold any of its later works. It had to be extremely risky for a period of time with an unholy adulteress. It was possible in 1927. Looking at all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they could go back and actually disappear on today's screen. Maybe I should be ... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie if you do not plan to watch all Hitchcock movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
