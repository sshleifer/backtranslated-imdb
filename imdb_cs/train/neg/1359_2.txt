A good actress is terribly unnecessary in this slower than molasses and random comedy comedy. Peter Ustinov is trying hard to bring something to life here, but the result is dull drilling that lacks all the right strokes that could make it observable. Regardless of the favorable comments, this movie is terrible. Badly Directed. Badly modified. He acted badly. Badly written. You have to sit over a hundred movies to hit one of the bad ones. The conspicuous and intolerable conspiracy concerns Ustin, who has gone to a US insurance company to hack his computer and kill millions of pounds. As he does, it's about cruelty and credibility (he just learns computer skills seemingly overnight to read some brochures, and hoodwinks computer expert Robert Morley goes to South America and steals his identity). a minor plot, Ustinov tells his friend Maggie Smith, who happens to become his secretary by accident after he gets to the apartment in her building. She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that they do not do anywhere, while Ustinov is a splitter of money and tries to keep up with Newhart and Karel Malden. Then Marries Smith flies to Brazil, which has become the basic finale of almost every British kaperska comedy from (Nuns on the Run - a fish called Wanda?) The surprising twist of the end is more ridiculous than everything that came earlier. In the end, I thought I had to really be away from my rocker to get away. Even the portrait of Cesar Romer did not help. One of the most dangerous, mischievous "comedies" I've ever seen and definitely the worst capers. Do not waste time. If you like it, you need to see better movies.
