I will not mention any plot, because although it would be completely predictable, one ubiquitous plot happens everywhere, in the commentary on the film, in the plot report, and even in the cover of my Netflix cover. Maybe I'd enjoy it if I did not know. Maybe. This film has a delusional cast, most of which have paid for rather limited material, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. William McNamara was impossible, but it was obviously clear. And a pair of Lenore Zann's pantyhose appeared several times quickly. But none of this means that it would be the smallest recommendation. Does not any of these subtle actors prepare these scripts before signing?
