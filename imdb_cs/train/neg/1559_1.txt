This may be the worst movie to see if I live at the age of 100. I think a group of first pupils could come up with better phrases as a class project. I'm a fool because I watched it and God loved mercifully the souls that were paid to produce this film.

I can not believe that F / X occasionally shows it. The only time I saw it was one of the Olds! channels - not the main ones. And it was about half a second.
