I really wanted to like this movie, but I never had a chance. It's basically thought to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it's unfortunate to fail. It consistently feels like it is written and it was high school children on a school project, and that's also a level that seems to be humorous. There is no gentleness and, more damned for the mercenary, never feels like a document. And while the lines are not funny in the first place, trying to deliver the dead hinge would help - certainly there would be something better than the one waiting for us. <br /> <br /> "I recommend this to people who like" comedy "in the spirit of" Big Momma's House "or" Norbit ", people who think the words" ass "are hysterically amusing in their essence. Other people should stay away and not waste time.
