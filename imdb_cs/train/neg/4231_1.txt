I felt obliged to watch this movie all the time because I found it in a bargaining basket and bought it for my own, but many times I approached it to shut it down and just paid the money I paid for it. If you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is fine. If there is a thing that the filmmakers knew, it's creative use of fake blood and body parts for a bad effect. If it's not exciting, stay out. <br /> <br /> This movie is shot on a home video camera, with high school props and horrific actors. This is dubbed from German, but it even allows, it sounds terrible. This movie is about the size of a budget, except for the above-mentioned special effects. If they spent a little more money on actors and a real scenario instead of blood and guts, the film could be a bit more enjoyable. The story is about three men landing on an island inhabited by an army of tin-camouflaged sadists. They are captured and the rest of the film is about their escape attempt. I call it the story in the most exciting sense, because it's really a series of scenes of torture and struggle associated with a distrustful dialogue. like a soulless gore. Consider a warning.
