OK. I think the TV show is a little cute and always has a lesson. So when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to join. I wish I stayed at home watching TV instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is stupid and non-original is the smallest of the problems with this movie. The story is next to nonexistent, it seems that the characters exist in a vacuum and the worst thing is that Gadget does not draw anything at all. Disney appears to have taken all the things they do that Inspector Gadget is working on television and throwing them all. To be fair, my younger child (8 years) enjoyed the film, but the older one (10 years) came away when he thought it was stupid (he was too old for the humor of youth but was too young for some adult humor ) br /> <br /> I generally like Disney movies, but I miss my miles. It's fine for a very narrow age ring (say 7 to 9), but for everyone else it must be missing.
