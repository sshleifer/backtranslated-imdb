Under the dense green gloss of computer graphics, the stunning art and skill of Ichikawa Somegora shone. Unfortunately, he lost himself in all of this. Old Eda's scenes - Courtesan, Sumid, Examiner and acting in Nakamura-za - were all exciting and engaging and took you back to an interesting and rich time. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro stands out and excites, was much more enriching than any of the absurd high junk that followed. Skill, energy in the audience, set colors were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over storyline and performance. What an unnecessary opportunity! One of the best Kabuki actors is alive and he's losing his back.
