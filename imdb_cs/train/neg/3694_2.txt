This is undoubtedly the worst Rajnikanth movies ever. The first part is held in place with a good comedy from Goundamani, but gradually worsens, worse and totally illogical. Our hero also digs on saints with the same name (Baba) through the corn and totally wasting one line. In the first half, Rajni pronounces the usual range of oneliners and style, and in the second half he becomes a quasi-saint after a beggar takes over an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (not the famous Saints in which he kicked earlier) gives his special powers without any obvious reason (other than karma). It really is going to be interesting right now, right? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about losing its magical boon and power and fighting with politicians and related black magic. Common predictable bullshit with cheerful realization. Oh and black magic never worked on our hero, because it happened to have Param Vir ... er ... Shakti Chakra with him. Thieves and ordinary political villains are clich√©s, overworked, and ultimately totally insignificant to a conspiracy that does not go anywhere. But despite all the flaws it was fun to kill the time and during the public events Baba yelled one liner. It's also fun to watch other curses about this movie. AR Rehman says he composed songs for his movie through a cell phone. That's important, he thought. Rajni is very popular in Japan and has two characters (one of which is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Of Japanese origin in this movie just because of it. But the way they are rendered, dressed and treated is totally pathetic. The Japanese may stop watching the Rajni movies after seeing it. This movie was probably a promotional material for Rajni's entry into politics, but the results of the film itself would destroy all his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun, if you turn off your brain again.
