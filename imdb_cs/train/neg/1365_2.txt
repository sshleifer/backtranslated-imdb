The concept of a legal gray area in the love of crime contributes to about 10% of the film's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to the fact that it is clearly wrong. To say that Sean Young's performance as a so-called district attorney is wooden, it's a gross understatement. With her carefree suits and unnecessary gel effect, Young is trying to persuade the audience of their determined hatred for men. Why else would she ask her boyfriend to stand up as a prostitute just to arrest the cops who try to pick them up? This hatred is also the only reason why it tirelessly chases a perverse photographer who gives women consensual excitement and driving power behind this dirty film. Watching the young walk from cold to full frontal nudity does not raise interest, but an angry scream that throws next to a fire at the lake. Watching her nausea and anger about her self-harm and sexual frustration make charity love for a rental fee, but it's all downhill to and from here. In spite of her need to build Patrick Berg's character, justice, her police skills had completely escaped her in the horrors of her own tiresome desire and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent job as a slim sociopath; if it worked in Sleep with the enemy, it would be damn to work. But I can not help, but I wonder if the apparent lack of energy Young brings film conflicts with its slimness. I guess this is happening and the result is a "thriller" with excitements that are totally bad and yet comic.
