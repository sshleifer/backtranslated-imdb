Finally, I noticed that at the end Detroit PD will share its participation. The Chief of Police has even one speech he plays himself (and the boy, you can say he can not act). The reason for the fun is that in this movie the police first shoot and ask later. Not such a type of PR, I think the police would want. Besides, they're your standard cops and raiders, 70's racing angels. Alex Rocco was given the unfaithful role of a rescue policeman who could not get ahead and seduced him with a mentally ill woman. He earns it by hooking up to the local canteen. Hari Rhodes is his stunning partner who has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after the suspects when wearing a trenchcoat. The film moves up to the penultimate shift, which has absolutely no sense (why do people who are guilty of robbery only take the whole police force?). Not only do we see one shootout, but because there are four bad people, we see four. Then there is a final conclusion to let one guess what would really happen, but let me just think how silly it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown" brains, I should not be surprised.
