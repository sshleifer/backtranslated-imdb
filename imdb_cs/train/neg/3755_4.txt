I loved this movie, I admit it. This must be the best video I've ever seen. Well ... I and my boyfriend decided I thought we'd shoot that movie. We knew what to expect, and we have exactly what we expected, and more. When that red neck hit a tree against Sasquatch, we literally watched this part about three to four times, that was amazing (hysterically, of course). And why? Oh, why should the main character get so much? Just as honestly, we know that you are in danger and that it will help a lot. But really, if this movie is that you are a local RENT IT video rental company. It is worth the money and it is not bad as if it were bad, but not incredibly bad. Overall, you will find yourself totally amazing if you borrow this movie.
