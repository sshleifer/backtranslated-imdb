I could not believe my eyes as I watched this movie. It does not make sense even in blood and violence. Unlike other frightening films that have gore and the sense that the film is just blood, gore and killing one after another. This film is not at all interesting, has no meaningful story or story, nor does it have any intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and the whole movie is useless. Do not waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two of thoughtless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not frightening but simply revolting. This is probably the worst horror film I've ever watched from all the horror films I've ever seen.
