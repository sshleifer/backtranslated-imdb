Oh dear. This movie could have the subtitle "When the writers pull down!" What a smell. I really had a lot of hope, mostly after reading the IMDb review, which is thinking about the whole IMDb rating system, but that's a separate matter. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce the Almighty, the Office, etc. So I was expecting great things. Saying I'm disappointed is the understatement of the year. There's so much wrong in this movie, but I'm going to confine myself to (a) the improbability of any family that behaves similarly to these people (mass aerobics exercise, what is the real life planet?), Unfamiliar script (killer of love?) And reality that the character of Dan is so unmanageable, do you find that you wonder what the girl saw in him to love her in it? This film was filled with a crack in a tireless conversation, shouting, ridiculous scenes, and slow, slow, slow. If we were not with parents who would not get too much and would not be spending money, we would go in half an hour. Unlike the filmmakers who would be better off throwing all the money they spent on making this film a fireworks - it would be fun. If you like movies, avoid it as a plague.
