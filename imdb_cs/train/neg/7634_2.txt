It is a kind of film that shows the weakness of French cinema in terms of making thrillers. The desire of director "Sound of the American" is so spectacular that you will not apologize for a minute if you have not seen a serial killer movie since then "Peeping Tom". Two male cops (or one-and-a-half, like you see), terrible murders, conspiracy more complicated than complex. Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre (he sees this incredibly stupid "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" two years ago). The scenes with his pregnant wife, which should be the counterpart to the otherwise obvious atmosphere of the rest of the plot, are among the worst movies. Add a vibrant love scene between them and a stupid autopsy to get PG 12 and so attract a huge teen audience. A violent and absurd conclusion followed by a silent an epilogue that could make a good deal for the CÃ´te d'Azur, it's really the silence of the lame.
