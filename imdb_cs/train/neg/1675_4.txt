It seemed that the act was interesting. How can a real brutal murder be turned into a really boring movie? Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and learn. Before the movie was released, I heard of the Wonderland murders and found it an interesting story of some really sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is zero character development, so we can never understand why this is happening, or get a good sense of mutual relationships between characters. The pace of the direction was very boring. All of this leads to an extremely boring film. Given that Dawn Schiller, a central figure like Holmes's girlfriend, was a co-worker, and Holmes's wife was a film consultant, we should have had the opportunity to get a real look at the characters.
