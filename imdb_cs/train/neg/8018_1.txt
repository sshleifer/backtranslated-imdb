Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should result in a really great movie and the main actor was definitely sensitive enough to be able to handle this topic, but the script - if there was even a * script * - is a mess. This is less a movie than a random presentation that does not lead anywhere. I think it's going nowhere, with the difference that it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever be sitting on. As I have already mentioned, the main actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), Like his sometimes harsh but ultimately loving and accepting mother. Movie makers have a lot to say about it because it's a mess. It's a real shame because I really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically an out-of-the-box movie that never happened. Skip this - it was not worth the $ 6 I missed for pay-per-view.
