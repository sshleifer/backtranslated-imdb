The real harm of the "Assembly" is not in bad acting or in a dirty, concealed plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series began, even though it had one main attraction: Takashima. I would like to see Laurel Takashi in the room with Susan Ivan, even in just five minutes. She has such a sarcasm, the joke, the double personality that is both volatile and sweet. Unfortunately, the pilot film "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story involving murder. Patricia Tallman - who never really returned to the series until much later - fortunately with age became much better Lyta Alexandra, who is more than a whimper, a tired telepath. Let me give you one last thought - why is Delenn look like some sort of frog on the outside field (even if she's a woman)? Thank you heaven for Minbari's later appearance in the show.
