This movie reminds me of really bad films from the 1950s and 1960s. It's not frightening or interesting, but it's boring, deep and silly. The special effects are ridiculous, all the actors are ridiculous and the end is just terrible. lose money, rent or buy something better. I give it 3.5 out of 10 (I considered this turkey quite fun because of its stupidity).
