I saw this movie before the premiere at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, filmmakers and film directors were present, they were probably experiencing our reaction. Many scenes have caused laughter from the audience, which would be fine if it was a comedy, but it was a horror movie. If the audience was not afraid, they seemed to be the filmmakers. Reduced release for more than a year. From curiosity, I saw her again to see if I could say they did not. It was the same lousy film, just a year older. Almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good," but it's slow and boring.
