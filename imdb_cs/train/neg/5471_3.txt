A typical Troma-basket, this smutty 80 movie is considered one of the "highlights" of the notorious production studio Lloyd Kaufman, along with "The Toxic Avenger," which was released a year earlier. "Toxic Avenger" is much better when you ask me, but this demented spitting is still tenacious; just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. Events are held in Tromaville, a small town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and certainly not. Safety measures at the local nuclear power plant are the least standard (even Homer Simpson has never been this impassable), and toxic waste goes to a nearby high school. The first drunk victim is a stereotypical nude who started to run green things out of all body cavities, but his death is considered an accident because he did not have in his house less than two microwave ovens! Oh, humanity! Shortly thereafter, nuclear leakage also affects the school's weed plantation, and the thing really starts to dwindle. After smoking at a joint party, the weakest pair at school produces a huge monster of worms that settle in the basement and feed a lot of adolescents. "Nuke 'em High" is the creation of top-of-the-line movies with dialogues so silly that they hurt your ears and make-up effects that make the word completely tasteless. If you love watching faces that melt, they are crushed or split in half, it's definitely a must! Unlike the "Toxic Avenger," this film suffers from a couple of really boring and prolonged moments when something really does not happen, like when Chrissy and Warren try to find out what's wrong with their hormones. Gross humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger," and acting is unremittingly amateur. Continue only if you are a passionate thrill-fanatic.
