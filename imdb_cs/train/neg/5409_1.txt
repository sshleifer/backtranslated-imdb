Christmas Mystery was narrated as a wonderful film, but I was really disappointed. They even sold copies of VHS and DVD after the film, which led me to believe that the producers were really proud of this project. Like the actor on the screen, I felt most of the show was called, although Beau Bridge, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I was Richard Thomas, I would not put this movie on my other gentle biography. It was embarrassing. I have been a fan since his Waltons, but I have found that I did not try to follow any of his subsequent works, so this offer was poor. To protect the actors, the director was compressed, mechanically, and thoroughly amateur. I hope this is not considered a malicious review and negative assumptions about my qualification as criticism. I turned the film because it was good cast and I was ready for the movie. However, I would like to invite everyone to watch this movie and not want the money to be returned, even if it was on T.V.
