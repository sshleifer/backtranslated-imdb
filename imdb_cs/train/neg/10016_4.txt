"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many 50s of movies that involved supernatural young teens. In this case, adolescents can not pay rent for their hangout and get to displacement. When they do not succeed elsewhere, they decide on a seemingly haunted house. As you guessed, as soon as they arrived, some strange things started to do. And at the end it's twisted. There's nothing in this movie that you've seen in other movies, but it's still fun. My favorite character was the parrot who took possession of it. Well, let me rephrase that: Quentin Tarantino did not talk like a character, but he said things we do not expect from a bird. The film is pure hokum, but harmless.
