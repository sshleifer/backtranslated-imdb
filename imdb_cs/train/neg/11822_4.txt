I thought Harvey Keitel, young, fresh from Sex Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus, Ennio Morricone's music. I expected an old school, nervous Italian policeman built in America. Istead, I got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that let me say: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions and inadequate actions. Result: A potential cult classic flushed after the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can bring these boys together with better writing. Oh and Morricone score: OK, but unforgettable. Overall, it's not a waste of time, but not "you have to see" unless you're a hard Keite fan.
