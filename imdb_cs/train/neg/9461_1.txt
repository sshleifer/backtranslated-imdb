The cat in the hat is just a slap in the face. Mike Myers as a Cat in a Hat is not really funny and Mike Myers could not be worse. It is his worst film ever in life. Actor and story were terrible. I mean, how would they prove that Dr. Seuss will do their most beloved stories and be one of the worst movies of all time and such disappointment. I could not see the worst film than this, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this movie is so bad that I can not even describe how much this movie is doing. Bo Welch should be released or a writer should. <br /> <br /> Hedeen's View: 0/10 No Stars F
