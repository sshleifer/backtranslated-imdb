I chased this movie because I was going through a section of horror for those movies that no one heard of and could be a possible jewel. I saw it, and because I'm a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It has been rated EM, which means: Extremely mature. I think this precious and high ranking was absolutely destined for violence and everything else, I got it. A warning on the box said: Extreme violence, extreme pain and nudity. "Extreme violence" occurred to me. The film ended up like a pretty tame flap. She had one or two scenes, but I saw PG-13 worse. Of course, the amount of gore in the movie is not everything that counts, right? You also have a conspiracy. Well, the conspiracy was boring, and there was nothing special about it. Do not rent it. I'm telling the truth. I can not imagine how someone might really like it when it says, "I'll go again." There were moments when you went on, but I will never see the movie again.
