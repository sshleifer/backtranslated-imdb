She made an unfortunate mistake to see this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was good from the beginning, but it's the last positive comment I have on the film. Actor was terrible, I wonder if the real gogo girls were accepted? But it was a plot that was really ridiculous, in fact it was ridiculous and boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers under **. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I want to mention only a few scenes that really got the audience laughing: <br /> <br /> Throwing a girl in the field: who would think that a boy who pushes another baby can be treated so badly. The real eye. <br /> <br /> Getting on the Bus Stage: The girl gets on the bus. But according to music, the world ends. <br /> <br /> Rolling under a clothesline: Wow, this really proves the ability of a writer. In the room, followed by raw meat and skill sales. Why simply let her make all three "sins" at once? At least the film could be slightly shorter. Running down the stairs of the department store: Watch one of the girls go up the stairs following the body that drives Dau, do not wait. but she * is * just walking fast and trying to break her nails. Bloody Run: It's definitely my favorite scene and the right end of the movie. A half marathon in red, supplemented by sliding down the stairs and over the bridge, only to be sent by unrealistically flying through the passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is made by the most obscene girl in the movie that is now holding on to you. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this film was created by 16 years old and their buddies. It's sad that we meet the director with a presentation, but that's not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're in a sarcastic mood and laughing with a few buddies, even think about it.
