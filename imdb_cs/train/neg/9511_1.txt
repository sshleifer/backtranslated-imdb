I wanted to see this movie since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it last night at 7:40. I regret the day I lost my ticket when I could see something better. At first there was a lot of sexual waste and clich√©s. They exaggerated the way love actually works. All girls were stereo types. The boyfriend was too stupid for his age. The gushing gases the pregnant girl had had barely laughed. The bank robbery was totally boring with gags that were used in other films. Their escape was the old whip Chevy van, who claimed he had no breaks. Hey, why did not they like a pretty girl vehicle instead? It could have strengthened the public's view of the movie. This movie was a very low, low and low budget because nothing was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of things in it that would lead Christian people to nuts. Hi, I even expected it to be a car chase, because all the banal stolen movies have a car, but I, but it never was. So, evaluate this b movie, which means low budgets and one of ten stars.
