This movie is a joke, and Quinton should be ashamed of it and tried to pass it on as Modest Blaise. If you have trouble sleeping, it all means renting this movie. The wandering character they call an actress to be Modesta Blaise must be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe it could be used as a hat at the back of a real movie. Seventy-five minutes without a thank you whoever invented a fast forward button. If you see this movie if you can tell it that your RUN is coming. I can not help, but think about what the 3rd world country could use the money that was unnecessarily useless. this movie is boring actors are boring waste with the color of the waste air that breathes If you would like to see Mostey Blaise Film then watch the one who did in the 1960s maybe what the director should do.
