A young boy gets a lot of money and immediately begins to live. Unfortunately, a person whose money really is is becoming very bad. He wants his booty back. When he finds out who has the money, he starts trying to get back. This little boy who is lucky enough not to fall into the hands of an evil man is getting rid of him. It sounds good, I bet. Very predictable, not at all interesting. Come with something a little different, ok guys?
