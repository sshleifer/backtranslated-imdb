I could not wait to see this movie. About half the movie I could not wait to finish. All (white) actors bring their lines like Woody Allen just said, "Say it like this ..." Then they said their lines on the screen as if trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really talks, and he does not cry over his words like Mr. Allen. Part of the comedy of this film was as boring as tragedy and certainly never fun or even fun. I have to admit that I have never been a great fan of Woody Allen and this film has not changed me definitively. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen.
