I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. Certainly not. It's one of those films that seemed to be made exclusively for the Oscars: music in the whole movie in almost every slide, almost no senselessness that was in a long time lost, sepia toned image, demanding title, NO SEX and genius, which explains everything he / she thinks and closes in sfx / cgi to get it (stupid audience). One thing that amused me is the fact that they wrote NOBEL PRICE! Instead they call the Nobel Prize (named after a real person called Alfred Nobel) as a "noble prize". Jesus! How can one make such a mistake in such a large production, probably based on a true story. What a fake! What are you and others thinking about RON?
