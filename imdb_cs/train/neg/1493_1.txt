He really does not like the people filming this movie and thinking that they are worth what they do to work. Even more mysterious are those watching this movie without feeling extinct in 88 minutes doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore works - but strangely, it's not as disturbing as you would think you would see organs pulled from the upper (former) solid bodies of the left and right. He probably has to deal with the fact that after their terrible inhuman actions they want to die in pain. <br /> <br /> So if you are not interested in the following: <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <br /> </ p> <p> -plot (some dirty horror movies are remotely linear or at least surprising. The movie does not make sense if you are not as damn as the writers of course were). <br /> <br /> - Theme (Do not be afraid of this film, nothing you should scare in bed at night, nothing to think or understand or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, music as ordinary and boring as a script). <br /> <br /> - Scenery (It could have been this film rescue grace, but no ... nothing here is pleasant, even the rocks are fake). If you do not care, and you're just a horny young man with bad taste in music and "women," this movie is for you. Positive Notes: Occasionally interesting cinematography, lost on other elements. Very realistic gore; again unnecessary. But the intestinal scene is classic. I agree that mutant-disembowelment solves the problem of a false accent.
