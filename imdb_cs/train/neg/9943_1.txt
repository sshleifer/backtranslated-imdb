Cover art (which includes a man with a terrible pellet pistol) might seem like a martial arts movie. (Hardly.) Interestingly, the real title of the movie is the Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a condom brand in the US) This film is full of homoeroticism. If you like it, then this movie is not that bad. Consider these points: <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> From the cameraman's view, this film is a dear queen! Several scenes contain characters that are very close to each other and occasionally touch when they are conversing. Also, the cousin of the hero likes women and every other man in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message that filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> I have to go to battle scenes? (Yes, private parts of someone engage in one fight.) Martial arts scenes are short and non-imaginative. No imagination, just the standard moves you would see behind old Chuck Norris. There is also a scene with car chase, which may be the very first low-speed movie.
