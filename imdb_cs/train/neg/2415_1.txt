... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT USE THIS FILM. If you want to see the "esquire" document on "hooded life", you are also in the wrong place. If you're looking for a funny movie, it's a real winner! The game is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example is definitely an officer investigating the way. I can say he made a voice for the operator 911 as well as the tone of his voice. If I heard a cardboard box, it would look like this guy. Oh yes and "zombies" have done their best snake impression, which is on the same level with their FANTASTIC overall effect (note sarcasm ... HOW THIS DOES NOT LOOK FOR OSCAR FOR BEST MAKE-UP) Quiroz ...... does not say any form. I felt I was looking at the improvisation period (the period is more like LA in 1990). But the direction is one step in the worst scenario I think I love film. I have not heard such beautiful lines as epic one word starting with "F ** k!" From Ice Grill, which was another "urban" thriller. Of course this works, of course, in conjunction with hip-hop musical accompaniment. All 3 or so songs from it! Overall, what did you expect from the "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented the movie with the intent of laughing at each scene and the boy I delivered, and MORE! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to meet a group of boys and laugh at a low budget picture that is terrifying. A completely unforgettable experience!
