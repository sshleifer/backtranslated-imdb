A fictional film (referred to as story-based, even if it has "documented" credits) about a group of scientists who go to the wilderness of Canada to try to find Bigfoot. (They want to capture one and then connect the tracking device). Its a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo mixes in what is really boring film by a lot of people wandering around the desert. There are some attempts to create tension and fear, but be completely honest, there is nothing worth seeing outside some of the great-looking wildshots. It's the perfect definition of an exploiting movie, it promises you so much, a Bigfoot view, but it really does bring very little. Recommended only for insomniacs
