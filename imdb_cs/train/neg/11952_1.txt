His first film after the death of longtime friend John Belushi, Aykroyd shows a lot of fatigue when he tried to pull out the character that would be for Belushi snap. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dr. Detroit gives us a barking professor, Aykroyd, a strange, violent pimp to fend off an opponent known only as a mom. That's bad enough, but she also has teaching classes, a school dinner for guests, four ladies supper dinner, and Pimp's dinner (or something) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd is mostly reluctant. Why should the viewer be alone? In this film, Aykroyd met Donna Dixon's future wife. From this chaotic mess, at least something good came about. One and a half stars. You want a good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want to be wrong, see "Doctor Detroit."
