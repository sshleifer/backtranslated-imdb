I admit that at the moment I am only a college student, which is English. At the time I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I mean younger, but maybe older, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes much to my physics course, my interest in quantum mechanics, which has led me to read a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the subject, and any article I can find Discover, and so on. I'm not PhD in any way. <br /> <br /> It said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just terrible. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how strange everyone is. My mother is such a person, and since she saw this movie, she tried to get all her friends to check out and buy a copy of the movie. I have tried to point out the various shortcomings and problems I have seen with film logic and science - and they are numerous - and refused my assertion because "yes, a high school student knows more than all those with PhD." In this case that's obvious. <br /> <br /> Leaving the fact that getting a doctoral degree does not necessarily require the person to be right or in fact intelligent. Since my basic understanding of physics is enough to reveal half of the film. When they left it, the filmmakers completely manipulated interviews with at least one of the participants to appear to support their faith when they actually stood up. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I think the intuiter did a really good job of debunking the movie, so do not hesitate and read that if you do that. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
