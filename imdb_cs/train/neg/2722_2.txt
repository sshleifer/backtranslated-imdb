For big thinkers among us, "Intruder" is a madly incoherent film from France that gives the so-called "art films" a bad name. The story is about a hot old horse, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor) who goes looking for Tahiti to heart transplant, but besides, I have no idea who is in the movie or why they do what they do. Without a contiguous story, we will lose the film earlier, although I am quite willing to admit that there may be somebody who actually sends a message out of this movie. <br /> <br /> This confused stellar run takes two hours and five minutes - although I seriously doubt anyone with any life will still hang around the final credits.
