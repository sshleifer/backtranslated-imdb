Absolutely the most unfavorable movie I've ever spent on my money. It was a bad choice for all these big stars to lose their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was drawn less than an inspiring way. He did not play any acting talent - he just read part. Alek can normally play realistic characters, Gwynyth looked ugly for a non-profitable part, Annette needs advice on how to choose the movies she chooses to play, just like all the big stars that let me down in disappointment in the way everyone has allowed their talents to be frozen in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. "Running with scissors" leads the public to expect a great acting in a movie that suggests that she is experiencing tension and deep emotions. There was only one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation on the screen. Perhaps it was the director's fault.
