I saw and liked the original movie and I expected more of a remake than this one. <br /> <br /> Good: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the scores and visuals are adequate and the performances were fine (Tim Roth was excellent, the other directors were okay, and a handful of "supportive supporting actors" took very good care of a very limited role). The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: The monkey town was terrible. The characters move in circles and suddenly somewhere in the center of the city are escaping tunnels. In addition, what escape route runs across everyone's bedroom? The story has been resolved to include as many actions as possible. I like action scenes, but the original film has more meat and deserves more respect. In the end, the end was completely nonsensical as it was introduced. Without seeing an inevitable sequel, there is no reason to do so. <br /> <br />
