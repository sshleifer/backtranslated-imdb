When will the pain stop? I never want to see another version of Christmas Carols again. They continue to make movies with the same story, they fall over themselves when they try to make the film better than others, but unfortunately it does not, because it's not a good story. Moral, old-fashioned, conservative happy thinking. As if people are learning. Many different versions of this movie prove that we are not.
