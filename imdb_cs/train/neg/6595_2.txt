I put the film in the hotel room to make the kids entertained in the morning to go home because I packed all their toys. (Fathers do not like looking at "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My four-year-old found one funny scene but told me the rest was "too stupid." These are FOUR YEARS people. Everyone who is more than nine years old will want to kill his television than to play alone. <br /> <br /> They said this movie is bad, it's like saying the Holocaust was a little mistake. There are no words about how ridiculous and terrible the "film" is. The game is bad, the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically inoperative. Because it's supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the badness of the movie is even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some strange fake accent (Ireland-Pakistan-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun, if I can say), but all the characters are terrible. I did not see the real movie of Laurel and Hardy in the age, but I know they should be much better than this. What's the point of destroying the classic comic duo with ... this? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Derived garbage. Avoid at all costs if you do not have a strange Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
