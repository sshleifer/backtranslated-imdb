Doris Day never leaves a bad script to get her down. Even in the most difficult circumstances the day gives 100% and is usually not damaged. This comedy, inspired by the realistic downfall of New York in 1965, but truly tailored to the French play by Claude Magnier, gives Doris just a little bit of it, but spoofs his own brilliant picture. the other half, to be comically sedate (which is fun because of what day gives the situation). There are some funny lines here, but the stagnation of the material is apparently transferred from the game ... and instead of conjuring up some fun incidents in the Big Apple, we're stuck in the suburbs. Doris's stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) are not good for her, nor is it a formless hairstyle she's wearing. Still, it's not terrible, she has some big laughs and it's a must for everyday fans. ** z ****
