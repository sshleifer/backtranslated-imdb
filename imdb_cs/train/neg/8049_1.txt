Be warned not to lift the names of Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is unnecessary and insignificant, and he often wonders about Twain's phrase that he wishes all the characters to be drowned together. When someone brings the category of the worst movies ever made, it's not like I think it's about Plan 9 or _Attack of the Killer Shrews; it is similar. What a complete waste of time - my own and everyone involved in this film.
