It has the logical consistency of marshmallows stuffed with ketchup, and the overall flavor is just as disgusting. <br /> <br /> It will be used in the 9th cycle of hell during rest. Simply torture. I'd rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer and walk through the 5400 blue death screens before I look at this terrible noise - again. Grapes. Grapes. Horribly. You know, the good thing about Swiss cheese is that you get some cheese along with the holes: here are just openings - and excitement? So it will change the color of dry to adrenaline hurry and Olympic fast sport. My brain hurts to try to find out who OK'd this disgust think of the assumption? (I sincerely hope otherwise there is no redemption), the only comfort is that they have the pleasure of sitting through the wounds. Made for television broadcasts should not be synonymous with: "Sure, let the horse form run freely around the living quarters! Our listeners are idiots!" <br /> <br /> I was addicted just to know how it might be worse. That's not a good sign, people. <br /> <br /> Hallmark should be ashamed of letting him go. <br /> <br /> I should be ashamed to look at it. I'm on a long shower.
