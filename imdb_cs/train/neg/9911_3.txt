If you have a beloved actor, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio, or any other distraction. Great talent is totally useless in the movie "Three Days to Las Vegas". My neighbors holiday movies are as interesting as this bad road movie. If you want to see how to use veterans with a good script, check out "The Crew". There is no real factor paying off and watching these wonderful actors who are struggling with such a weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the shallow script cheats on the audience by basically giving the actors nothing to work with. - MERK
