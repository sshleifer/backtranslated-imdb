I definitely disagreed with these remarks, which state that it is a good movie. This is a completely SUCKED movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. Story development is strange. Mia Kirshner has changed from an innocent girl to a party-entertainment looking for a cat for no convincing reasons at all. In addition, all the actors seemed too old because they were college students - college students looked like about thirty years - the rest you think about it. I watched for the first ten minutes and began sending quickly to look at sexual scenes. all sexual scenes are lame, poor, and, most importantly, none at all. All sex scenes are ridiculous when we consider how many clothes they have. Make a favor - give it and save a few pairs. Conclusion: story - 0, sex - 0, acting - 0, score - 0 out of 10.
