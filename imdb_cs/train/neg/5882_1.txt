You are not sure why this film was promoted as a wild, strange, mixed comedy. There is not much in this movie that would be entertaining or blocking the viewer. Annette Bening (whose acting was like an Oscar-like) comes here as an outgoing, her performance seems routine. Brian Cox's character is confusing and irritating, and Augusten plays the lead? Joseph Cross? it seems he simply has no personality to perform his role. The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to support this boring, indecent film. The movie disappeared quickly and it seems to have a good reason. In some scenes, I realized that some scenes are dirty (scene with Brian Cox and his exhausting opponent in the toilets), some of the worst scenes in "You, Me and Everyone We Know" and "Squid and Whale" some embarrassing, and most of it worrying. I found the whole experience as a waste of time. Do not waste time?
