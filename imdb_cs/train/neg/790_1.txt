Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) BBC3 Leader needs BBC1 and BBC2 programs to keep their licenses and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers her unfunny friends. <br /> <br /> 3) The head of BBC3 is capturing, completely ignoring the fact that they are not fun. The worst of all is probably racist, because all the characters play up to bad stereotypes. If a white person did such things, it would be an offense! <br /> <br /> Cocktail.
