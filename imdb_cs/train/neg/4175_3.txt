I think Micheal Ironsides's acting career must end if he's supposed to play in such a low shit. He certainly could do better than spend time in this garbage. This movie could be much better if it had a good budget, but it repeatedly shows the movie. There is one scene on the base that looks like her, outside her front station, and I bet that it was. There is one scene that gave this movie 3 and shows the spaceship landing and taking off across the lake, surrounded by forests. That's done well, but the rest of the movie, forget it. There is another scene that looks like the engineering factory I bet, and it does not look like a space base like it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, it has a serious low budget, it makes no sense, and God helps Michel Ironsides.
