I was obliged to watch the film for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I got paid), but I still found a movie that sucks far more than the average. The jokes were deceptive, the two main actresses ... well, they are using the "First Women's Club" division at the age of women in Hollywood, they are not in the age of "hot cats" but in the age of a district attorney. What made me most upset about the movie was a major story line that pretty plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which all boys are accustomed to a guy who offers them money to "make their wife" that she's murdered.) Overall, it's a fucking piece of crap.
