Even if it was fun at a distance, this moldy wax of the film would still be vainly disrespectful. Stop just before digging the boys' bodies and resuming the weekend at Bernie? but only? producer Larry Harmon and director of French films Ernest use copyright as an excuse to get away with all the tattoo and Ollie links. Gailard Sartain makes a fair revelation of Ollie, but Bronson Pinchot does not reach tenth in Stan lookalike; even if the two films were in place, they were no less disgusting. The less was the disaster around, the better. Utopia looks like a dignified swan song.
