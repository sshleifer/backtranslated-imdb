Shocking! Completely terrible! No plot, no point, no end. It looks like the director turned on the camera and the whole crew went to lunch. Daily. I'm trying to DOWN this video away, but no one will have it. I give it 2 place 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I have to say this to my fingers. <br /> <br />
