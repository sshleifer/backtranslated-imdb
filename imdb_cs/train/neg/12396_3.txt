There are not many good things to say about the underworld, Soderbergh's untrue efforts for neo-noir. Soderbergh transforms Robert Siodmaker's loyal Noor Criss-Cross without changing his conspiracy at all; however, adaptation takes him every ounce of his most modern film atmosphere, gives him the same story, the least attractive places, lifestyle, and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who later made wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the oceanic series with great style and atmosphere, takes on a dangerously clear path to modernization by renovating the story in the worst, inferior and sweetest ways of the early nineties. Nightclubs have a terrible, dull dressed garage band, the uninteresting version of Petra Gallagher against Bryan Lancaster is the hero left by his femme fatale girlfriend for the urge to buy film-minded modern appliances such as stereo, televisions and other up-to-date equipment that sucks the reaction from the movie. It could have been much more fun and less boring if it had several rescue mercies as a good score, more meat for his characters, more than just William Fichtner who gives the show, a wooden, brighter pace. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with it. Soderbergh, a fine director, this time does not use his dry separation in favor of his film. This disposition works amazingly by helping a multiple-language criminal film like George Clooney's previously mentioned photos or a social or character drama such as Traffic or sex, lies and videotapes. With movies like Dole, it strengthens the boredom of the viewer.
