This is allegedly a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based his life, but he changed things around to fit the detective figures. These detectives date into beautiful models and have no problem getting them. It sounds more like a millionaire than a detective, right? This whole movie was written by Peter and shows how he was out of touch with real people. You should write what you know, and it really did. And it leaves the audience bored, confused and jealous. This is curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who actually married Keith Richards, was also a model like Stratten, but he is much better and has a much larger part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. With the story he has not much to do, which is quite complicated. Overall, every character in this movie is something that very few people can relate to, unless you're a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels on your challenge. For others, it's an irritating snoring. This is what happens when you are out of contact. Have fun with some of your friends with internal jokes and you hate everyone else.
