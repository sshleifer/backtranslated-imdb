It follows the same path as most of the sequel. The first one was great. The other was average and this one, full of bad acting and some stupid dialogue, and as well as a lot of suspicion of distrust, this film was weak. Very predictable, and I just could not stand that Henry Wrinkler - like a boss with that stupid eye - was doing so much more. I liked it first. I would like them to get closer to these lines than to what they did here. There were too many unexplained things to explain, what time period it was, and why it was there? an old-fashioned phone in this room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is another job. <br /> <br /> Blah!
