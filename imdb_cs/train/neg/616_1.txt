Let's look at it; some guy who dies and his soul is transferred to a scarecrow. Das does not happen! OMFG This stupid boy who can not get rid of it gets his ass given to him by a drunk bastard who twisted his mother. As soon as he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and lets his spirit go to scare. The drunken guy covered his death by seeming to be suicidal, thinking he'd gone away with him. Later, we see that he is dropped out of the trailer and later acquires another encounter with a scarecrow. They had a brief meeting that involved a drunkard who called him a loser, and the scarecrow bounced off "He uses one to meet one, loser!" The scarecrow turns away from the building, calls him "father-o" and then he is a poor man. We see how this amazing film unfolds from it. He continues killing many people. They kill mainly people who have been hard at work in him and go out to kill some randomly chosen people just to laugh. No laughter here. Everyone also kills punches. Every time he killed someone, he made some karate and culminated in one of his signatures. In the case of someone who had audibility, he said, "Here, have EAR corn!" then pull them in your ass. Or we can actually take an example from the movie! He just killed a cop and was on the way to killing the only person who ever stood up to him. Her father, the sheriff, shouted to the fool to stop, and said, "Hey, stay a minute!" and threw a dagger, tossed his chest and pressed it against a tree. At the end of the movie he killed two boys and threw a punch "I have to divide!" and killed two boys by putting their scythe in the head. Wowzors, this movie made me so good to get it. Perhaps next time this guy makes a movie, it will not be gay.
