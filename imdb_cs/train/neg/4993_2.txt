He came to see this film if he is waiting for action "nothing really," is still very disappointed. The opening scene promised a small action with a touch of comedy. This will keep you in the first half of the cow, until you expect it to be time for action to get in. But nothing like that will happen. The movie stretches and the end just clicks you down to a point that makes you angry. It seemed what the director said. It made no sense. The film had all aspects, it had no real story, and it seemed to be very hollow, although it was "Rambo", I do not think it could help with the rating at all. There's no logic for the movie. The perfect way to lose your time and money. By far the most irritated movie I've ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same look at its endurance. Certainly not for people who have little sense in the film.
