I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen because it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most viewed movie I've ever seen. There was never a fence device without thinking that it was 10 + minutes in advance. There was no subtlety for anything that makes the film, no intelligence behind the scenes. Every intention of a spoken or written line was so clear that it was impossible to "get into" the movie. I found myself laughing at a terribly thought-out false line and blackened attempts to get audiences, much more often than I enjoyed the film.
