To enhance the drama of this crazy storyline story, it is placed in a special department for "difficult cases". The main story is Loretta Youngova; She is on leave from a long prison area for murder. Will doctors save their child at the cost of their lives, or will they regard the husband's request for the opposite? Melodrama and sentiment are dominant, and they are not honest. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psychiatric care department next to the hospital and leaves a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wandering about child theft. It's just laugh and sarcasm to make it recognizable as Warner's movie, mostly by Glenda Farrell, who gives her hot pipe pipes while waiting for the twins to find her disappointment that now is a law against sale. An example of her guardian: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon, of course, is incredibly authoritative as a nurse, but she does not expect her to be given a dramatic moment. The main theme of the film is that the view of the child attracts someone. Even with obvious limitations, this movie should be better than it is.
