There is only one problem with this page, you can not give a negative rating. In addition, you have named it as a D grade film. I say he was too kind. A piece of wood could show more emotion that actors in this film and the money used to produce this film would be better used to fire. It is terribly horrible, 2 hours of life, that anyone who will endure this unbearable blood will never return. After watching for 5 minutes, I and myself guys were wondering if a heavy diving heavy bomb is becoming more fun. Half Cartoon and Bottle 151 later I finally found some of this class G acting distantly funny. It is an insult to the whole planet that the director thought someone might find something useful of more, he should go and buy a rope. And to the actors in this movie, I hope you paid off well for being in this joke, because I doubt you will ever work again. In summary, I think everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points from your acting license.
