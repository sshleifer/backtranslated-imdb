Hm. While the pleasant film that improves the plot of the holes points to horrific gaming, primitive (at best) special effects (which I've seen three times in the past six years), Severed is one of the worst I've ever seen. I never know who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen on a murder scene in a dance park. Overall, I really do not like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are nice, the rest is a lot of confused dialogue and pictures that do not finish the story to a logical conclusion (which I do not remember).
