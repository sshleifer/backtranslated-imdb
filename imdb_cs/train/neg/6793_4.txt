Gray, dusty west of director Richard Brooks, who seems to be deeply involved in the genre while keeping all the usual clich√©s intact. At the beginning of the nineteenth horses, Cowboy (Gene Hackman), famous player (James Coburn), coconut baby (Jan Michael Vincent) and even FEMALE (surprisingly the game of Candice Bergen) are attracted to the beginning of the nineteenth horses. Once the preliminary steps are omitted (with predictable arguments about whether a woman should or should not attend), it becomes quite a delightful entry, though the one who does not have a new reason (instead recalls something from Gary Cooper's time). Good looking if a long piece has a macho verve and a subtle cast, but the plotting mechanisms are annoying relatively quickly. ** z ****
