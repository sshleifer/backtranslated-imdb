It could contain possible spoilers (Not that nothing in this movie is new or even slightly surprising that it matters) Why did Disney feel the need to recycle everything she ever did in oblivion? It is certainly cheaper for them, but after some time you would not think that the overall quality and the way people think about them would fall. House Of Villains is a scornful example of a cartoon that makes no sense at all. Some signs of completely ignoring the previous films are: Voices do not even match up and Iago is bad again (Since?) I know these movies are right for kids, but it was a time for everyone to enjoy Disney movies. Even the musical number of the movie (which has been Disney's specialty for years) has collapsed. I would not rate this movie for anyone young or very young. The only thing I can do is that if more films of the same caliber are released, it is only a matter of time before some small animation studio overcomes Disney in overall quality.
