That was the best movie I've ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not act AT ALL! she had no emotion that it was all crazy as if she were reading from a boring text book. A smart guy and a boy who loves food (there was no reason to remember the names) was so annoying that he was crazy. Whenever there was ever talk of any scientific matter or food. Molly's father did not show enough emotion that his daughter was missing. The policeman and Molly's dad said the same thing as four times. it was terrible. Everything was repeated to many. Beatrice should have had something wrong with her because she was so bad. I just lost a moment in my life watching this movie!
