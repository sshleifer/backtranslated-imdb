Well, I finally saw it. I did not go when he first came out because I was frankly afraid. Afraid of how bad it may be or how disappointing it is. Although it was not as bad as Menace, and better than clones, it was not a little unforgettable or satisfying. I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the initial crawl to the final credits, it was a movie experience that I will never forget. A timeless story about a bored farmer who knows he was destined for more, rescued the princess and the galaxy from the evil threat and at the same time was mentored by a wise magician, a pirate, and various comic reliefs - all in space - operational settings. <br /> <br /> And that does not mean that Lucas is punished by using the old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And to his esteem, he gave new interventions that made it very strange. <br /> <br /> Then came the Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of those great movie twists of all time. The great villain was Vader Luke's father. Wow, no one saw it coming. Of course, I'm convinced that Lucas was not until he appeared in the script. Go back and watch Star Wars. When you know what you know, especially in the light of the first three episodes, you will see if it really fits. Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is a fun movie - huge effects, lots of action, some good fighting scenes. But the film still lives or dies on his plot - a story he says. Of course, really good acting can save a weak conspiracy, but a weak conspiracy along with bad gambling - a burden that no director can overcome, certainly not as bad as I'm forced to realize that George Lucas is (This man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in her career from some very handsome actors - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * Stuff. Oh, my. Understand that he is already disadvantaged by what happened in the first two films, so it's an incredible load. One too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First, we have a total absurdity background. We have Anakin, who is on a tetanus that is the product of virgin, miraculous birth - "chosen." This detail can never be explained remotely. In fact, the nearest explanation of Yoda's observations is that they may have been wrong. Oh, well, then well. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> This time, the same Wunderkind will become the creator of the C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence. And he returns to Tatooine and never knows he's out of there? Wow! What about. Testing of an old willing suspension of distrust there, eh George? By the way, we have that young man, moody, cuddly, wailing a young adult who must become one of the greatest villains in the history of Cinematic - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - a good guy who falls by grace just to finally get the redemption in the end. <br /> <br /> How do you pray, is this happening? Why does he have a dream that his wife will die in childbirth? He is now living in a star-like civilization that deals with gravity like gasoline, but recognizes the "dark man he may be," so he can check with a doctor, perhaps, perhaps, that this futuristic company could do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing she can think of is to kill some children, because the bad guy, at the root of all the evil they chase for two movies, tells him that he has the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> Hell, why would anyone want this sleep to be saved or redeemed. I wanted to kill Kenobi not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. Oh, by the way, Amidala will finally die. At birth. Why? Well, they do not know. A droid doctor and himself testifies to the incredibly high technology to which this company has advanced offers only the conclusion that she "lost the will to live". Well, of course, yes, of course. Maybe it eventually awoke to her with what girl she was sleeping with. But here we are. We have all Kenobi for it. He knows about the birth of Luke and Leia. He knows who their father is and knows what will happen to them. It also knows the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in a few years, when Luke approached manhood and appeared with 3PO and R2 (curiously, the 3PO mind is erased, but not R2 is - why ????) saying "I think your droid belongs to you" Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by what he believed to be "chosen" and a disciple of the emperor himself and who has just become on this planet, says "weird, I do not remember being his own droids." <br /> <br /> Oh, good sorrow. <br /> <br /> Lucas just did it when he went on. As soon as he introduced her as Luke's father, the story began to turn out of control, for he did not know what the story was. The story of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine understood. And none of this is related to the story he originally narrated in the Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's an extra idea and it looks like it. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. She enjoys a funny but completely forgotten movie. Star Wars will always be in my mind. Fortunately, this and the two previous will soon disappear.
