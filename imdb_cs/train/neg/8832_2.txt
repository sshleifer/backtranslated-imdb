I had a really hard time to go this way. It was extremely slow, and occasionally he realized when the plot of the movie really would come to life. This movie seemed to slow down and I still wondered when it would end. I'm normally a person who likes a good indie set once in a while, but it did not satisfy what I was looking for. They seemed to be trying to make the film so much. At one point, it seemed politically that I was not a fan of movies. If you're looking for a slow moving movie with little or no plot, then it's the right movie for you. As for me, I felt I had lost 2 hours when I could do something else.
