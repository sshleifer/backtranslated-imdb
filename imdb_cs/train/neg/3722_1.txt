I remember that I was (literally NOT READY) to see this film by the Southern Baptist preacher when I was a child, and even I loved his horror. It is designed to scare poor, "saved" poor people. The only thing that saved me was the fact that it was finally over, and I could go out and have a real life. Check out the chapter on this film in Sarah Diamond's book "The Politics of the Christian Right." FASCINATING. And definitely more interesting than the movie!
