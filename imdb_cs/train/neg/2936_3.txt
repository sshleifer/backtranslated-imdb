I was also interested in the high (8.5) rating of this film and was very disappointed. I just saw some good international films and I was looking forward to doing three in a row, but it was not. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same. There is no conspiracy, if any. I do not necessarily need it in the movie, but she needs some fun or bring me. The best thing I could say is trying to be Altman's movie, though with a very small set. Sure, there are times, but a few moments are easy to sink 97 minutes in a minute. I do not understand the high rating of this movie. I give it 3. <br /> <br />
