Fortunately, I did not pay to see this movie. I can not even reveal any spoilers because I was willing to go out after four minutes of the film. It was bad. I laughed once when Yahoo! the billboard fell on the guy and the theme song began. But it was just because I thought it made fun, but then I realized it was another product placement. <br /> <br /> I loved the cartoon. I looked at him almost religiously. (although I missed the last episode I heard they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing but Claw, somebody commented on the page of the show) The cartoon had Penny and Brain much more than the movie had. I hated the setting of the whole thing, reminding Robocop. Then Broderick screws up the whole Gadget inspector. He is not as awkward as a cartoon. Another fact is that his aids actually work up to the point I saw, with the exception of petroleum oil. He was also looking at the "Wowsers" tone, which was in an upset tone. I felt so disappointed they had so badly killed the cartoon. Everyone else felt it too. People aged 14-17 remember the cartoon kindly and loved every minute. <br /> <br /> I opened my mind in the film because I knew it would go with the cartoon. I was surprised how the film was slowed down. She relied on looks and stupid dialogue about humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a child's film. Product placement is pointless in this movie and shows it. The wise cracking of a car is not as good as it breaks wisely. Gadgets look nice but they were almost too shiny. Cartoon was a better look. Stupid scenes were bullshit. In 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, no laughter was heard, and they laughed at the preview of Dudley-Do-Right. This film should not be watched by people who want intelligence in family entertainment. I highly recommend "Iron Giant", which was sad, but very good. This film is a travesty to the whole family run
