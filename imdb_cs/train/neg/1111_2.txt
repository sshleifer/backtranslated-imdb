Johnny Rivers' final piece was the one great thing for this film. Unfortunately, it's all positive what I can say about this western film. I have to write another 8 rows in order for my notes to be published, but there are more than eight lines of horror in this western. I'm not sure if the film was a homage to Hopa Along or just a spoof. The hero and the villains in this movie were too plastic. It is not realistic at all. Many supporting actors in this movie looked authentic, but filming was a joke. The previous commentator thought that this movie was great and in comments he had cut down cheaply for President Bush. It was not a democratic or a republican west. It was just a bad western film to be commercially sold. I wonder if he's going to make some money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie from a movie student. If it was, then it was a great movie.
