I had to turn it off after about 15 exhausting moments. I hoped it could improve what I saw was wrong, controlled and written. <br /> <br /> This movie should never even be released directly on DVD, <br /> <br /> The leading character, who is the bride upstairs from HELL, has a huge ice sculpture for her killing. She was such a rebellious person, for which I did not regret it at all. She is filming there in some sky, and she was still repellent, I left her shortly after. Eva Longoria portrays her and I hope I will never see her, nor can she do it. It's just plain Paul Rudd an actor who normally can not do anything wrong, he was also in this bag. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer teen) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedy, but not stupid about fools. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
