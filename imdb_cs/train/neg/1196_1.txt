How can a humorous movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel NEN? Believe or not "House Bunny," this was better and fun. Let's hope the top leaders have had a good vacation and got some money - this movie is for all the hardships. It is a cliché from the beginning to the end. Clichés can work well with the script, or at least with an idea. This film is nothing more than cliché cliché rather than ideas or script. It uses rather existing actresses to develop characters. Bad, sad and garbage. Now I'm supposed to have ten lines of text for comment. Really? Why? As an IT administrator, this is another example of bad coding.
