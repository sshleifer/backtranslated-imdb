Tenants Two writers are trying to finish their books in an empty apartment building. First they help each other and slowly start to create tension between them. This is based on the novel by Bernard Malamud and unfortunately everyone speaks as if they were in this novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, its purple and full shades of meaning. His script was written as an academic English major with a head full of claims. It's terrible and I immediately felt immune to what the film had to say, which is a shame because the movie is populated with great top-down performance. Snoop Dog on the arm are in good shape, unfortunately none of them can bring falsity of words and assumption. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. While it's not really bad, it's a very sermon and demanding to want to leave you. I lost interest in less than a third of the way and I had to try to get to the end. If you're interested, I'll try on the cable, but I do not see good money to see it.
