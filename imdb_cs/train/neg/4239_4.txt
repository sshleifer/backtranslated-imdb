It was better than the average movie I thought about because it's on the cable. I expected something similar to cheese melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as Christmas fever or first daughter / target / shot etc. Cast was well chosen ... I really liked Ron Livingston as the big compressed SWAT commander. It's good to see him return to the same material he's been so lucky with in Band of Brothers. Producers and designers did their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like that day in 1997. So if you have the chance to see this movie and I'm sure FX will repeat everything 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy it.
