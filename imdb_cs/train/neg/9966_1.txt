Although I never want to be such a person who denies another personal taste; if you like something, it's okay. But this movie was terrible and not around him. I do not like Difranco, but he is a great guitarist and composer that I can admit. But I can not admit that this movie would have some redemption. A lot of people think it is an accurate display of the topics faced by high school students. Maybe, but everything is rendered too far. It seems to be a "Naked Gun" attempt - a certain comedy, but timing is off; there is too much space between each line of actors as if they were laughing (there was none). The one who wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to flood so many controversial problems in one film, almost never developed any of them (especially the girl who was taught impregnated). I did not smile once in the whole movie. I was too much offended by this attempt of humor and satire to do anything other than look around the screen.
