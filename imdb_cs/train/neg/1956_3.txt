This movie has one redemption function. At one point, when a character is attacked by a belief that rises, his brother asks, "Why is your bird here, Chuck?" After suffering an hour of bad film, it almost caused my drink to come out of my nose. Some of the acting is not too bad, but the kids all smelled and PJ Soles should be ashamed of doing the movie. The story is weak and no one will do what you think (or what the common sense says), they should. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are lots of stories that are not added. For example, in one scene, the ghosts of small children must intensely concentrate on moving the physical object to prove that they exist, a difficult performance because they apparently can not communicate with physical matter. A few minutes later, they all lift branches out of the ground and beat them. Apparently they can sometimes move through the material and sometimes NOT. Go to the picture. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and intestines, though ... a few nice breasts. But that does not match the shortcomings. If you want a movie about a fairy-tale teeth, go to the "Darkness Falls" rental. I think it's great, though many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it's a mood.
