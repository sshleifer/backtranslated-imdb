I'm giving this demanding piece of garbage 1 simply because I do not believe there's a worse film in the world. I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogue, setup, writing and routing. I hope everyone who participated in this film burns and rotates in the darkest circle of hell. Damn this disgusting waste of time. <br /> <br /> Everyday I pray, just the imagination of my imagination. I pray that I dream about the movie and that she will never have to see her at her local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
