This film is self-service waste. Watch this movie if you just want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy a nice soundtrack. Watch for any other reason and be disappointed. It should be charming, but it is not - it is just irritating. Characters are difficult to handle and the behavior is bad. Stories in the film are also carefree and ominous. I was expecting a cordial family film, but that did not concern my fourteen-year-old daughter. Rarely can not see the film until its conclusion, but this man got the best of both. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is set in the current times, the European film created during the Cold War has the look and feel of a cheap exit. In the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinema it is not enough to make it possible to redeem it. Real pity, because as a film it's embarrassment for Scotland.
