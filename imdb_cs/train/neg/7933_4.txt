I'm a huge fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is crazy. The whole thing has a preserved, fake, sound experience that has a really terrible view of the back screen. He has a good idea that the screenwriter successfully buried himself in a nitwit script, which prevents viewers from diving into action and really takes care of some of the characters. Direction is for pedestrians and only highlights how bad the script is, rather than helping it improve. I've seen a lot of nice "soundstage productions" before, but this is not one of them. The only thing you do is that you appreciate the harsh Scott / Boetticher films. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, ornate and shining the smile of millions of dollars. It's always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films. In addition to Scott, I was another main reason why I wanted to see this movie because of how much I enjoyed Mrs. Wymore in Errol Flynn's "Rocky Mountian." The "Pistol Men" is just as beautiful and you can say she's a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty stupid things, and the blockade given to her by the director was really terrible. I saw only Phil Carey in the Pacific operation and play the same character ... the arrogant back pain you want to suppress unconscious. I think it proves he's a good actor ... forced to hate me. There are some misguided attempts at comic reliefs that, in my opinion, only make the film worse. Although there are many elements I have to click, I have to say that I really enjoyed two Spanish songs singing in musical numbers ... but this is no reason to look at Randolph Scott's movies, right? > There are certainly worse Scott films, and this is certainly not unbearable, but it certainly could not be considered anything but media.
