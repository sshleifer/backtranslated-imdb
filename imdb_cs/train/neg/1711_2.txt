Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy that it would be soulless fun. That's it, no fun. This film is really helpless, there is no development of plot or character, or any kind of plot. The main problem with this film is killing and gore. Basically, every killing looks exactly the same. ZOmbies rip someone. Yeah, that's okay, but you need some original killing. I think it was really lame, every killing looks exactly the same, filming exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love gore and gore in this movie did not do anything to me. It was just boring. No storyline, the same lame scene over and over again with another person. I also wanted to like this movie. I love shooting video clips ... like Redneck Zombies. But I could not say goodbye. This movie has good points but none of them are in the movie. I understand that many of the "zombies" have helped with the flood and there were more than 100 zombies, which is quite cool, as so many people have been involved and helped around the world. But overall, it's a terrible movie.
