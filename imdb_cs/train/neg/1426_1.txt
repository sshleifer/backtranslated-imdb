One question: Why? First, the assumption is not funny at all. They use recorded interviews and take the sound to animate the animals that talk about parts. First of all, the interviews are not fun and entertaining, and even if they were, I'm sure they would be much more fun when they were seen as they were before, without changing the cartoons. How does it give you some joy? I turned in the CBS series on Monday night sitcom (which was the normal way to relax after a stressful working day on Monday) and I found it. Of course, the sitcom would be the same as in the summer, but seeing these episodes again would be more fun. I tried to give the "CC" a chance. I really did. When it started, I thought, well, maybe it would be funny. No way. And then it went on. It was a long half an hour. And I can almost see if there is any purpose if the interviews were full and they had points. No, they were just one-time clips, cut and loaded really fast. It was like a terrible terrible version of "Cartoon Network" Robot Chicken. I was not a fan of the now abolished CBS sitcom "The Class". Whenever it was, it was half an hour I got into the fight. But if it happened that I decided for the whole season of the three or more episodes "Creation" ... let's say I would take a "class". Because it was a couple of hours since it was broadcast, and I came here to see that I was the first to comment ... I think it's a good sign that no one's been watching it and it will not take longer. Cartoon cartoon.
