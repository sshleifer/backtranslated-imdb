Badly produced "blaxploitation" crime drama directed directly on the black urban market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier stars in the lead role that a sister who becomes a woman's brigade after the drug killers have made Coffy's little sister a drug addict. Violent nonsense produces well, with conserved energy and excitement; only Grier's exciting nature gives the narrative a story (there's not a lot of actors here, but it connects with the audience in the primary way). Not so different from what Charles Bronson does at this time, the film was marketed and promoted as a profound exploitation, but he still managed to find a significant audience within the city. Today, however, it is just a footnote in the 70s of film history and lacks a wide range of other films in this genre. * 1/2 from ****
