This series was the CBS network response to Big Valley success. It was 90 minutes west, just like the ABC program. While it was the answer, it was not over until Season 2. The problem really became a reality that was lost at this show. For example - in one episode, Johnny gets his eye trapped by his wand. Amazingly, until the end of the show, Johnny got really well. Together, the stories were not as strong as the Great Valley. This is a show that I do not want a DVD, and I sincerely hope they will never be released. Imagine that, since CBS has run out of lots, it has used many of the known settings again. It was one of the last western CBS series of Western-made series that was not really popular in the 1970s.
