This movie is easily the worst of the series. Although New Line can only look for sales, everyone knows that the only reason why it has caused more money than the previous one was due to its 3D ending. It was not that the 3-D was good, because it was 50 years 3D with red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) It was just that people wanted to see what it looks like. In addition, this movie was so badly done! Bad script, bad characters, bad behavior, worse directing. This film tries to push the camp factor almost to resemble an episode of "Looney Tunes". Seriously, not for a horrific audience, because it's nasty and not scary and not fun fun for comedy crowds. Only a complete mess with some really bad cameras who are still trying to play this whole thing like a camp and have it fall under what they probably wanted. I remember that most of us who were fans of this series prayed that it would end at this moment because of how bad it was. It is one of the films that helped to take the horror of popularity and drive the fashionable belief that the audience really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than to see a good and horrible horror movie.
