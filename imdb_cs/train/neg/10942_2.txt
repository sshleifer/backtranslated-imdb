Lorenzo Lamas plays as Jack `Solider` Kelly ex-Vietnam veteran and renegade policeman who goes to search and destroy the mission to rescue his sister from backwoods rednecks. Horror film is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is the third factor and still has 3 minutes on the screen and even that's not good. Overall, this is a terrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Joshua Belle, hanging from the tree in sacks and thickets, are worth a few unintentional laughs. An improved follow.
