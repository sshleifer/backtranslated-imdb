It's terrible how some people can get rid of these things ... This is one of those overrated things ... And I hate things that are overvalued that are not good ... Why can not we have more TV shows and movies that really have story and excellent music and are well written and are they really something? It took many people to make this movie, series and band all possible, and these people are wasting time ... The bands seem to be getting younger and younger ... I looked at how small they were and I thought, that's 5 or 6. It's sad that the kids act like young ... they're still too young ... The show has a lot of work and they have a lot of other things that they need to do their lives ... The idea that you have a lot a young band is terrible ... They need to stop having such bands ... And I do not like it, not the children themselves ... They are very young and their name is "The Naked Brothers Band" People who are involved , and people who support it have lost their minds ... Whenever this band appears on TV, change the channel, and petition to be forbidden ... And I know it's a very boring note but you get a point .. <br /> <br /> This band sucks ... Get Rid of That ...
