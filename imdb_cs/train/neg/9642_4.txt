I could not believe that some of the menacing dialogue came out of the mouth of the people, and the end bloop reel attached to the body of the film was a real fever. And we'll get small shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (kind of) and Loren Crabtree boot. Angelique Pettyjohn's psychological activated teleportation device brings a foreign container to an underground lab in the desert. According to director Fred Oleen Ray, the remaining compositions from Klaus Kinski, ANDROID, give the film more value for what it looks like cheaply. Inside the container is a tiny alien (played by Ray's son), who began murdering people to death. It was quite funny to watch this little "creature" in a black replica suit with what looks like a big shark of beetles that stick to it and run around in the dark. We'll even see a little thing and a stamp on an ET poster that I thought was jolly. And then it is what looks like a snake, which also comes out of the container that runs the death of William Fair, after the mini creature chews Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. A low budget for the ALIEN, I think ... The whole thing ends up suddenly, it looks like they get out of the movie at the end before the reel blooper comes with the end credits. Talk about lack of funds ... Fred Olen Ray also mentioned in the director's comments that they are also not sure whether Aldo Ray would shoot and remember his lines. He hardly did. <br /> <br /> Low-cost cheese sneezes. It's fun to watch, I'll do it to you. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
