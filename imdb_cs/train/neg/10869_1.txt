My friend lent me this video, and I was pretty excited to look at it, but after ten minutes of James Hetfield and Lars' slow-blowing vocals on the drum, which seems to be slow, I began to think, "Why did I watch am I? "That question will go through your mind at 5? 10 minutes after Play starts. I put the tape back on the same day as you would think it is not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
