The story of "The LOST MISSILE" is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story is a bit dull to the middle and overuse of movie recordings and bad special effects sinks this movie to the sub-par. /> <br /> The film starts with a rocket facing the Earth. In panic because he is about to hit the Earth, the Soviets are able to divert the subject. But this is not necessarily good, for this seemingly unmanned craft has a track on couples that destroys everything on its way And the ship is now in a low orbit above the planet. In other words, with every passage that follows, there is a series of deaths - which could possibly kill us! So it is good scientists in the USA (led by a very young and heavily discerned Robert Loggie) to formulate and plan to save us - and in particular to save New York, who is on his immediate flight path! Unfortunately, they are unable to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can not say if it's a big loss), but thanks to good old American know-how, they are able to eventually destroy the precursor of destruction! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the story is not bad and rather original. But so many old clips of fighter aircraft and boys equipped with radar circuits are a bit old and look like padding. Overall, it can be a decent but heavily inspired film that fans of this genre like - everyone else at their own risk.
