This is the story of two guys who have found a copy of "Funky Monkey". Suddenly, it seemed strange if movie posters appeared in the local Cineplex Odeon. When they saw such classics as "Any Way But Relaxed" and "Project X," these two men realized that movies with monkeys are amazing. These guys were in a long drive when they watched this movie. There was a monkey that was replaced by Stunt MAN when action sequences were required. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained at Shakespearean actress school. Maybe to replace the monkey Ben Affleck, it may have helped boys think. Perhaps a powerful assistant would help Jackie Chan or heck Hulk Hogan as well. Fortunately, this movie had an amazing martial artist, and Jet Li looked like Matthew Modine. While some may claim that Matthew Modine is approaching Jet Li, camera tricks prove he is just as good. When it becomes clear that an untrained chimpanzee can not handle a movie, the film relies on Matthew Modine to become a real star. Did I mention that there is a bumblebee who develops a relationship with Modine and the monkey? Is there a possibility that the child will learn to trust and even lift the girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine should get jealous (because I'm using the pick-up line "I'm the second violin to the monkey," he does not seem to be working with ladies.) Shortly after watching the movie, both guys received a call from Matthew Modin he said, "Seven days."
