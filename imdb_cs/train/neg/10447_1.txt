I decided to see this movie because it got a good IMDb score here. But a lot of people either have a really bad taste or someone fixes the score. In any case, it was a real disappointment. The film is just as stupid and quite attracted as the title suggests. There is really no reason why we should summarize this plot - but here it goes: it was like someone thought: "Would not it be nice to make a movie where the snakes were on the plane? And snakes for some reason would go crazy and started bite and so ?! "And that's it! The story is thin and indefinite. Snakes are bad CGIs (but it makes sense to manually scratch movies that no one in the right mind suggests to anyone). The game is bad and all people are incredible stereo types. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
