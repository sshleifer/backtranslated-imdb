If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend has a romantic mood, let her be a kid. But get ready to bring your hp if it comes with the radio. After watching such a good film as Arisan (2003), it's terrible to see what's coming again in Indonesia. It seems the only idea is to make money, but no one seems to be seriously working on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. The fact that it is a "global" world does not seem to be in the mind of those making films in Indonesia. And because the Indonesian public will swallow everything that is presented to them as "made in Indonesia" with the flavor of the West, they will come with it. OK, the story is nice to start. And it could have been a nice move. But the director never thought that a musician needed live music, OR at least good play, and secondly a good choreography? In this movie, playback is so bad that they want you to cry right in the cinema. Every word you hear is followed by LATER seconds by an actor or who is singing a play, and that is very uncomfortable watching the movie. Choreography is as if they were going to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but eventually thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. You're just dancing as you see, jumping up and down, throwing your feet up in the air and that's about it. Well, at least it's a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic, do it!
