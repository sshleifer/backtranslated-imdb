OK, my girlfriend and I borrowed a DVD and about 30 minutes into the movie, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh what's the movie and more importantly, I do not care when I find out what ends" the views and we decide we will need drugs to we are interested in "plotting" or just ending the pain there and then looking at something else. We chose it. <br /> <br /> I really liked "But I'm a cheerleader" a lot, but Mango Kiss is too stupid and unreal to my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorrie
