Maybe the TV will be brutal one day. Maybe the big brother was just the first step in the direction of Stephen? Richard Bachmann King described the end point. But that's enough. If I spend too many words talking about the serious background of this film, I'm doing exactly what producers hoped for when selecting this material. It's the same with "Day 6". It does not matter how primitive the film is, it raises a discussion about its theme, which serves producers as advertising. We must not be accepted. Social criticism, which suggests a plot of conspiracy, is only an alibi that makes it possible to create a speculative, violent film more for the sale of video clips than for a cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not read a book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading it, but when I saw the movie, I thought that from a good book they could not make such a terrible film: In the typical 1980s with 80s music and some small actors Arnold Schwarzenegger he finds himself as a policeman escaping from the killers in a cruel TV show. The audience is cheering. <br /> <br /> Along with "Predator," it's definitely the deepest film from Schwarzenegger. 2 Stars from 10.
