There are exactly 2 good things to say about fantasies (mentioned by the previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) God Derek's extraordinary beauty inspired by poetry. She's filmed in this movie, where she even gives Catherine Zeta-Jones a way for her money, and that's really a great compliment. Her nudity is short and discreet, but just look at her face. <br /> <br /> b) Greek island environment with sun and crystal clear blue water. <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is unbelievable and sometimes unintentionally funny ("touched you where you are a woman!") and the character of Peter Hooten is slimy smell. Bo is playing the naivety of her character, but then again when you have to collaborate with the dialogue, it's bad that it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she still called the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a big irritation). Oh, and although the film is based on a Greek island, the Greek word is barely audible - apparently everyone, from the children to the old people, speaks English all the time. (*)
