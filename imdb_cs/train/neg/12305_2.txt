I watch this movie just on the WTN, because it was the channel the TV was turned to when I turned it on. It is a very untrustworthy and quite boring story about the wife of the minister (Alexandra Paul) who is lusting with the young stallion / drifter (with the abs sink) played by Corey Sevier. It may or may not be a conspiracy. Corey whips her shirt and Alexandra rises. I get the feeling that she does not think of anything and that is why she is struggling with the poor Alexandra Paul. It's not really important, because as I said she would take a lot of my shirt and I just saw the bruising ass. There are plenty of saxophones on the soundtrack, which is just painful.
