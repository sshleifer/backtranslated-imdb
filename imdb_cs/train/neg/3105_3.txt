I can not believe how anyone can make a comedy about a problem like homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not do a homeless comedy. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in the fantasy, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not get too often. Brooks's films have worsened over the years. That's just another nail in the coffin.
