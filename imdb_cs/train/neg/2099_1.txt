WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILS (Not that you should worry, we also apologize for the cap.) Beginning with an unnecessarily dramatic voice, which is even more unpleasant to talk nonsense, nonsense and unnecessary drama continues. That's wrong, but exactly. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky business. There is a complicated system with great potential for disturbances, irradiation, stress-related symptoms, etc. And unexpected things have to happen in a very unknown environment. They knew things were wrong. In fact, things went wrong. This is called learning. Although Appollo 11 was not safe under today's standards and there was enormous political pressure, the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. Miscellaneous Mistakes / Comments I did not even want to look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon made a speech in case something went wrong. Good. That's what I'd do. That was the end of the propaganda war. 2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 is likely to blow up. (This is only "implicit"). Yeah, so they leave people and compress their watches almost in real time. 3) The capsule ejection does not work. Just as it did not work when the chimpanzee was in it. The one who survived? It was a trial start and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. It's a video you may find on youtube or at least somewhere to look for it. <br /> <br /> 4) One of the interviews says an explosion would destroy a fair part of Florida. I can only assume that it was perceived as hyperbole, because if not, I'm just furious how it could get so bad. 5) Technology has been primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware are still used today because they can not crash. It's even worse for spacecrafts because their computers have to be built of relatively large components that are not susceptible to radiation. (And the craft itself must be handy, so a complex management system like B2 would not do it.) What about using "TV screens" rather than "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. In fact, TV monitors were manufactured with a much higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object was not part of the rocket, it could be just one thing." We see where it goes. Besides, the statement is wrong, who says it's not a rocket part? At least the interviewee will solve that if something is flying and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) Interview with the voices, as well as some erroneous reports, it seems that the ground radiation foil is actually a fuselage. Which would make it thinner than a cosmic suit. 8) Neil Armstrong is almost deadly during a training flight is a record that I can appreciate; I have not seen it yet. As I have already said, any piece of manifest technology may go wrong, especially if it has not been tested enough because it is, you know, unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The mismatch of the landing gear trajectory of the landing gear in the Moon Density) was not at any time acutely life-threatening. It was not "fifteen seconds of fuel left", which was in fact "fifteen seconds of fuel before it had to interrupt the mission and return to the control module." <br /> <br /> 10) "Disastrous chain of events" usually leads to disaster. I really do not know how to say it easier. But this is the best example of rhetoric. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a short sequence of one of the astronauts who walks and skips around aimlessly like a cheerful boy, followed by a voice message that the reason for this strange behavior "can now be revealed." It turned out that he was going and aimlessly moving like a hopeless boy. Merry things. <br /> <br /> 12) It is mentioned that all the contact was lost on re-entry. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon that was well known at the time because it is not possible to bypass current technology. Again, it is the gravity of this implicit, but very deliberately so. <br /> <br /> 13) In Space itself, a shuttle was never lost, while the voice message represents this "reality" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of bullshit. Appollo 13 was almost a loss, but both real catastrophes occurred during liftoff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, the comparison of space shuttles with Saturn missiles is somehow ... well, well, just plain stupid. Even ignoring, it seems that successful pendulum missions are not interesting to the audience. <br /> <br /> 14) What the hell with the UFO? Even in the context of the film it makes no sense. If you do not expect it to be made for entertainment purposes, targeting a particular audience (which seems to include people who can not even understand history, science, or rhetoric). Even the point of the film is somewhat unclear. Catching phrases such as "covered up to now," "publicly revealed here for the first time" come, but the film does not blame or provide a lesson or anything else to expect from such a filmed movie. In a good old sense of stunning, there are numerous interviews with interviews and fragments of records that are often out of context or with people we know nothing about except "NASA scientist." Wonder, so cosmonauts were very nervous before this effort? Fancy it. What does it have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yeah, which point. The summary, in addition to being either intentionally or incompetently inaccurate, is not even good fun. And believe me, I'm a guy who enjoys his dirty documents; this movie is not funny, funny, quaint, it's nothing.
