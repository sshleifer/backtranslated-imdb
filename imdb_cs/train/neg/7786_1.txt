I have never watched this movie. The style of shooting can be considered artistic for some, but it is considered a migraine. I think it could have an interesting conspiracy, but since I could not look at long stretches, I missed a lot. Flashing pictures and film shooting stopped my brain. I stopped in the middle of the survey and did not return to the second attempt. I suppose if I was at home in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy evening, it could just be a ticket ... PS I'm not sure if the lighthouse / movie style thing can be considered a spoiler but I do not want to be on the first review on black list;)
