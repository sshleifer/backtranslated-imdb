This could be a strong candidate for the "Worst Movie Sometime". Perhaps without John Hurt's presence it could be tolerated as a children's film. However, TRAGEDY of all this effort is that John Hurt, one of the biggest actors in the screen, is shrinking in this ... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt showed ... Berem AWAY 8 points because of it did not get fast enough. As for the rest of the cast, they are just terrible. Janine Turner, as nice as she could, can not act to save the soul. And the leading actor is for all purposes and purposes AWFUL. If you can save this embarrassment, please do it. It's so bad, it almost does.
