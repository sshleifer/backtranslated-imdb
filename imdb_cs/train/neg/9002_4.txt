OK .... I have only three words - cheese, cheese and cheeses! The only redemption of this film is Dean Cain. Besides - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME! <br /> <br /> The film has some promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a real breathing dragon with a live fire - basically it gives us more "Jurassic Park" "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great options, but they simply do not follow ... Special effects are decent - even if you know the dragon is CGI, it's not terribly LOOK like CGI .... I would not blame Dean Caine (even though he is one of the producers), I would lay Phillip Roth - Director and writer. It's his job to shoot this movie ... and unfortunately failed.
