There are some Stallone movies that I like, but this movie did not meet my low expectations. I hardly believed this movie. For example, a group of terrorists who hit the desert are ready to survive for at least two days. Also in all of these wildlife, Stallone and the company continue running through bridges and ladders that provide convenient short cuts or fence facilities. Also, the Treasury officers do not seem to coordinate anything with local rescuers. Also bad guys who could not hit the barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons. I liked John Lithgow's cheek at first, but the character is such a complete psychopath that you care for one of his evil guys, or they're all killing. In the end, I just could not believe the figure anymore. <br /> <br /> It is not worth the rent, nor is it worth watching it.
