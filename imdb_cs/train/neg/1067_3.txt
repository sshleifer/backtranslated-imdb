Only a handful of segments are here. The garage service segment from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins doing his twist twist point until the last shot will surprise things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few clips will call Paris. The others are so scattered in the theme, tone, victory and production that you can also watch "The Years Best Commercials, 2006." It's really everywhere. It does not develop over time and no director has a director. No construct was able to connect with pieces ... tedium sets. I'm at one hour, twenty minutes, and Elijah Wood is in some stupid-selling, overproduced vampire shtick. It has to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in Antarctica. Fantasy first appears in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thanks to J & E for destroying another movie) and then too many performances. The aim of being in Paris is that you do not need deceptive things to make your days extraordinary. Why do you share this neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is compared with vampires for a lost director? There is sometimes a genre that is more represented than a vampire movie. Every three years we get the same vicious vampire clich√©. <br /> <br /> It's getting worse that the transition from segment to segment is pretty carefree. Transitions have been lost. It does not feel intentional, she feels careless.
