I first saw this movie on MST3K. And although I laughed behind the scenes for jokes, I do not think this movie was so bad. Certainly it was a bit difficult to understand that it was probably a low budget, but it had a very Hitchcock-like conspiracy and I can honestly say that when I saw the non-MST3K version, I was really amused. This film cries for Hollywood remake.
