I gave this movie one star only because it was impossible for it to be less. Scientists have developed a formula for the replication of any organism. In their laboratory (warehouse in LA) they create T-Rex. A group of industrial spies breaks down to steal the formula, and the rest of the film is an endless pursuit of the legs. <br /> <br /> Of course, T-Rex (rubber puppet) will loosen and begin to smooth out the cast. It has an amazing ability to slip into 2 or 3 feet of someone without noticing them and then instantly biting their heads off. One cast member escapes in a police car and spent the rest of the motion picture aimlessly across the city. He has such excellent mental ability that he can not even work with the radio. He never makes any attempts to drive into a substation or donut and looks hopelessly lost. T-Rex is causing confusion around the city, there are flaming battle weapons and buildings (cardboard mock-ups) but one police car or army, or someone else will never show up. Such an activity must be commonplace in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that the sequel is not planned.
