I bought a movie of this film for my girlfriend, who has the same name in this movie as a girl girl, and enjoys movies about paranormal. The film was filmed exclusively on video, so it has a special look PBS. Special effects are fake-looking, but in the movie we really have a few awesome moments that made us jump in our place. There is a particularly effective fear that includes the statue of the Virgin Mary. But acting is bad, the scenes of "conspiracy" are long and very boring, and I tell you that I have no idea what has come to an end. If you have a movie rent it, if you buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
