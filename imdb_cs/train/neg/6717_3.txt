It was a terrible god. The story was everywhere, and more often I was confused because of terrible edits. I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not well developed. They were extremely superficial people of no size. Syrian, raw stereotypes with subplots that did not go anywhere. Strikerka was just a distraction, though she was decent. I do not know what they are trying to do, but how am I shocked when they showed that Sundance is this garbage? I almost canceled my subscription. Do you think that such a channel would display more quality movies? There are many, much better gay and lesbian themed movies out there. "Celluloid closet" is an excellent document. I thoroughly enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who have missed my mind at the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that it's just not worth it. If you catch him on TV, ok, but do not bother otherwise. There may have been three or four shots that looked really nice (I can count on them sadly) otherwise cinematography would be quite miserable. Illumination was a lot of places. I think some of these effects have been used to try to add something that practically has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (without blond hair of course). It's a shame that his acting did not do anything to me. Stick with real porn, buddy. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
