This film was a great disappointment to me. I was expecting this movie to take years, and I was a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until they started bankrolit. Not only did they cut half the story but changed the information. The statement that Lucifer is the Father of hope is untrue. He betrayed his father, but he himself is not her father. Voices also did not suit the characters, and once you heard the voice of the beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind could never be returned. I can not even remember everything about this movie that was bad. What is important is that if you love Lady Death, this movie does not look. It just did not do comic justice at all!
