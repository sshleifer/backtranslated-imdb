... from this terrible movie! There's so much going wrong, playing, writing, editing, editing, etc. in this movie, that it's amazing that something will rise to the top, and it turns out to be absolutely the worst. Music! I noted that the film contains two composers. That's why each shot has music, absolutely the worst movie style "D". They never heard the word "less is more". It was so painful that I listened, I turned the sound every time there was no dialogue, but the dialogue was so good. You have to apologize for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley. I'm sure they did not see such a role in the twilight of their careers. You see it at your own risk.
