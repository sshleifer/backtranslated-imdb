After the debacle of the first Sleepaway camp, which thought franchising could be born. SC II is excellent in terms of quality. Inspirational killing and much more fun. While it may not say much (compared to the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Pros: Fun, it does not take too seriously as SC I. Inspired killing. Disadvantages: Lots of dirty games and backs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
