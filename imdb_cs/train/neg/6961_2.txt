I completely agree with another comment that someone should do what tiger Lily is with this film. It has to be one of the worst French films I've seen for a long time (actually, along with Brotherwood Wolves, 2 terrible movies in a very short time.) It's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort is my darling, I was bitterly disappointed when I saw them being threatened in such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is as bad as usual, which proves , that pretty face and famous parents can get you into movies but you do not necessarily give talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you want to laugh watching Alain Chabat's place or some nice time piece full of fun like LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
