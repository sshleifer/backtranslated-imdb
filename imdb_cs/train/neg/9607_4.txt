Do not listen to the misleading title "Werewolf". Europeans are well known for placing emphasis on sex and nudity over real fears in horror films, but this is just a little too much. The "Werewolf" appears to have a dirty sex scene emptied by a title character who has gone mad and brutally killing her partner. First, several times, but a hundred minutes of it quickly becomes very monotonous. He is not a werewolf, but a Shizo cat, whose predecessor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can not even decide on its tone, while the first ten minutes of flashback is a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was a classic rubbish), but rather the rather bad characteristic of a female woman who has been repeatedly abused and tortured to revenge a thriller. Finally, the director insists he is based on a true story. Yes, all right. To be fair, there are several fun aspects of production. The werewolf title is a fairy tale and there are several nice effects of gore and naked scenes. But they quickly become quite monotonous. Also, the dubbed dialogue is quite fun at campsite mode, especially the world's most swinging doctor (drinking at work). Unfortunately, the film becomes very irritating. There is no real plot or something else really. It's a pity, because reading the story I felt the film had some real potential. The "Werewolf" is too long, slow moving and a little too unnecessary, even to the standards of journalistic use. (4/10)
