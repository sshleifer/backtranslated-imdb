It ranks up on my top list of the worst movies I've ever seen on Starz on Demand. They seem to highlight everyone straight on the DVD crap they can find and put here. Why? Who knows! It seems that someone with a digital camera and a budget for six people can come up with a horror movie and get it on television. To be honest, it looked terrible from the moment I saw a trailer - but I gave him a real chance. I always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen are movies that have worked around their low budgets, or in other cases only required that the budget be great. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. > <br /> You know the plot already, surely if you read it. Either you heard about Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. This is a pathetic and shy girl we know for 3 minutes in an incredibly bad music video of "heavy metal." Whoever had to think it was really interesting, but it really is not. Anyway, it's killing. Then he has someone. Then some killing begins. It's really unforgettable and totally average and boring as possible. When the first shot in the apartment disappears, it sounds like a piece of popcorn. Was that the best sound effect they could come up with? I could find a better sound effect that you could use free (without copyright) on the Internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Do not let other reviews claim that it is a 10-star movie that fools you. They are obviously either film distributors or perhaps a director who is trying to think that this piece of junk is worth buying. Laughter.
