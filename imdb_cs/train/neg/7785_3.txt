I did not know this was a silent story-telling film. I'm not interested in silent movies - humor, blinking lighting and film, etc. I'm sure it's the low score I've given him. It was Chapter 8 before I found some interest in this story and I had popcorn that I could throw it on the screen. Perhaps it refers to a science fiction crowd? All that was missing was zombies and brain transplants. On Friday I went with two other people and there were 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselinni narrated this film - a nice aspect of the film. No one commented on how much they liked or appreciated an unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
