I just saw this movie and did not read the book. The good thing about the film is that in some parts you think a bit about the spiritual theme, evolution, synchronicity and your role in the world. However, the immersion of the film easily breaks apart and there is a very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book is losing much in this movie. Events that are expected to be synchronized are almost unrecognizable. There is a lot to be done to see the audience see that the scene shows the coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a larger purpose. <br /> <br /> The illumination of the scene is visually flawed and does not make it feel better. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in the Little Buddha)? Well, this is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are badly done. There are lots of scenes that do not actually develop a story and do not help in creating the atmosphere. Better actors in this movie, Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can not save it. The first 2 seem to have gained more scenes than their characters in an attempt to save the film and because they have been paid more, but it does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and the story does not help at all. Jürgen fits in his scenes and sells himself as a bad guy (as always), but the screenplay will not help him. The scene where he first tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just a bad screenplay. The performance of the scene when it dies in an explosion is absurdly wrongly executed. You can not even comment on the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a great passage of time, read a book! I did not read it, but it's about a billion times better than this, it must be. It's so bad that I had to write the first comment in IMDb.
