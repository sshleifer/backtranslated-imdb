Some kids walk in the mountains and one of them goes to a large tunnel and finds some old mummified gladiator. He pulls the helmet of the gladiator and spends the rest of the movie killing all other tourists. This is so totally absurd that it is crazy. Here is a short list of things that make no sense: <br /> <br /> 1) The boy and the girl are in their tent and think they hear something outside. The guy goes out and examines and finds another tourist out there. Then they hear their girlfriend go back to the tent - the next morning? It was just 50 feet! 2) These two thunders then hear the next girl scream (What, 100 feet?), But do not read because they are afraid they are lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another guy and girl are walking around and around the tenth scene, the girl informs the guy that, due to circumstances, the protocol no longer requires her to turn to her as a professor. I mean, what ...? First, it is a really stupid thing to say, secondly, that in the first nine scenes in which they were together, he never called his professor. <br /> <br /> 4) The wounded girl attacks the Demonicus and he stops her and tells her that part of the gladiator training taught him how to hurt without killing. Um, yeah, we noticed she was hurt and that she was not dead because she was awake and walking. But thanks to that information. <br /> <br /> 5) One girl is tied up in the Demonicus, and when someone tries to free her, she orders that person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if he frees you, which will take about 5 seconds, there's no need to help. And it simply goes on and on. The whole middle part of the film was spent with two idiots who were lost in the woods, then fighting, then stretching the tent and ignoring the shouts of their friends, then a little walk around. It's so damn boring and unnecessary to turn the DVD halfway down. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are sympathetic, especially those that get most of the time on the screen. Demonicus himself laughed at me aloud every time I saw him - he looks like a boy in a Halloween costume and scratches his face to look bad. They're running or I have to say they're gay, as if they were gay. Special effects are comical, acting is greatly terrible and nothing makes sense. Overall, maybe this concept could create a nice camping movie if it would give more time and effort to get rid of absurd dialogue, create characters with real sympathetic personalities, have some logical flow to action, and maybe even make Demonicus a female figure in sexy gladiatorial clothes. But no, instead we get an absurd pile of nonsense that will lead you to death.
