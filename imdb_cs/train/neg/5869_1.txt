It's been almost 30 years, and I still hate everyone involved in this film. It remains the worst film I've ever seen. Before I saw it, I never meant the Greeks, anyway. After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I happen to see her on TV. <br /> <br /> I had dragged it - against my better judgment - by, however, they left the theater, these friends swore an oath to never quit my film selection. Almost thirty years later, we still have mental scars from this film. <br /> <br /> In my deadly bed, one of my regrets will be a time when I was hopeless that this film could improve. He never did it. If you ever had the choice, you'd rather put your eyes out, even though this movie. <br /> <br /> I signed up for IMDb comments just in hope that maybe I can warn others before watching this movie. If I can only save one person before watching this, then my existence on this country will be justified.
