This is an overview of Freddy Merkur's The Unfold Story, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the saddest, most inspirational and most important biographical documents I've ever seen. If the movie I saw in the cinema was originally released on television, I would ask with its producers and distributors not to mislead the paid audience with the fake promise of a documentary film. Even as a documentary made for television, the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewers sitting in front of the floral arrangements in the hotel rooms were heard, and a pompous, pseudo-literary narrative about Infomercial's sleeping bed. The only redemption of the aspects of this "Freddy Mercury's Immortal Story" - or, uhm, it was "Princess Diane's Unstoppable Story" is the original concert, video and television footage - undamaged by Freddy Mercury and the Queen. Intelligence interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses, including: "It was a free spirit" (really. I thought Freddy Mercury was a business man ...) aggravates Freddy's testimony Brian May or Montserrat Caballe, and a loving light into the complex life and character of Mercury . And ... what happens to boarding school departments like Harry Potter? How does the interview with the first girl-crush ("... now working in a travel agency") and Freddy's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital mile of his personal life, his sexuality, artistic style and growth, queen, group remain unexplored. These filmmakers do not ask for a single provocative question, nor do they deal with independent or visionary research on their subject, but provide a tedious set of politely pure and utterly empty comments on a mysterious and brilliant rock legend that does not deserve to remember the history of the Channel biography grandparents on Sunday night retreat.
