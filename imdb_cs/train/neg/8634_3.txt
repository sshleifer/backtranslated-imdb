When I saw a photo of a man attacked by a zombie, I had the hope that Lucio "Zombie" Fulci could only be on his old tricks. Unfortunately, in addition to the close-up of a rotting corpse, there is little in this story about the murder of a rich man and his daughter's path to find out who killed him. None of the characters is appealing, and if you find out how they did it (at least that was what was cool), you will stop worrying. The only good thing I can say is that it makes more sense than the Nightmare Concert!
