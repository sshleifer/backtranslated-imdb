The first was the best. The other jumped, because the dialogue was terrible. Though the story was not so bad (in fact, all the stories are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I have said goodbye several times. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial artist, but he's not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was also not good. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, scary acting (But it is based on her script). All the characters were not that good. But some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 are always action and less sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan does not do the things that are good for him.
