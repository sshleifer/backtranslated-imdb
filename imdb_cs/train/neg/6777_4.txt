While I recently gave OPTIK PETTICOAT a positive review, I really did not like this movie, even though it had so many similarities. Both were produced just a few years apart, both played by Cary Grant and both were comedies of World War II. However, the overall tone and style of the films were completely different. KISS HER FOR ME generally looked like a cheaper movie - with poor writing, little energy and a few very wide performances - even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think at least much of that guilt lies in revealing Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her great talents and limited acting skills has really caused this budget type A-budget to look like it was from a third degree. In addition, there was not much chemistry or energy in pairing with Cary Grant - the actor generally loved his grace and class. It's like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
