Ok, I wrote a rough review b / c movie is terrible. As I expected more reviews (for Derrida) to jump, I decided to look at the old reviews of this terrible movie. Check out all positive reviews. They all, I say, come from contributors, they have no other film than this. Crimminy! and wait for the "Rosebud" [sic] review. Continue to check out other Rosebud movies reviewed and had shining recommendations for. Oh, shoot, they are a coincidence for the only other filmmakers of two writers and directors. The Holy Openers of Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, suck as writers and tons, you could not get rid of the bad screenplay. No work for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE LATEST REVIEW FOR FILM LOW PRICE!
