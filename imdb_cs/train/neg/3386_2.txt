Yes, I was lucky to see the long-lasting original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid the film when he got to the theater in 1985. That's horrible. Almost everything fails. First, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right stuff) is a justifiable choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired for MANIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - it cuts songs and CASTING! They are terrible - these dancers are the force of the game - these hungry, talented artists just wanted to show what they can do, and when they get a chance - you could not get rid of them. But this acting performance is just dancing, making "nice" singing, but none of them will burn. In fact, let's look at the IMDb cast - none of them really did much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this movie killer does not capture for one second the spell, the despair, the passion of the stage musical. Full performance! (Even though they are trying to play music - great music is still growing and reminding people how great the score was).
