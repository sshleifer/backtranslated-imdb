Envy stars some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and Christopher Walken. With such occupation we can expect the best. However, with "Envy", no one could rescue this disaster. Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are the best friends and coworkers in the sand factory. Both have a decent life, but because Tim has a better performance at work, he can afford more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always comes up with new ideas for inventions. One day Nick comes up with the idea of ​​a spray can that causes the dog to disappear (yes, seriously). Love for an idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He gives Tim an offer to invest in his idea and share a 50/50 profit. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. Nick's invention, called "va-poo rize" (again, seriously), ends with millions. He spends money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and a luxury wasteland. Tim begins to feel envy with Nick. The name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it still seems terrible. This movie contains some of the worst dialogues and very poor performances of all casts. And then, as I mentioned earlier, none of them would have to save this mess. Even the great Christopher Walken, who played homeless with the name "J-man," made this film funny. The film is bad from the start and only gets worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like bullshit (no game is intended) * you want to see Jack Black in white tux br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at any price but Avoid if you: * are hurt by a humor * love animals
