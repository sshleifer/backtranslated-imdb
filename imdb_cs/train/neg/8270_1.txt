The non-existent conspiracy, tons of badly controlled / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers who can not even hit their targets a few feet away, and what's going on with the end --- a bunch of enforcing organs vandalizes the Carnival Shooting Gallery? technical mistakes (how many rounds can be used in glock magazine? 100+? these people burn weapons without the need to overload). The film is so bad that even an older actor in Hollywood, like Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator), can not save this unsolicited work. Do not watch this movie (I realized I was left with a few good 100 minutes of my precious life on this). Let's hope the director either stops filming or learns more about his next film.
