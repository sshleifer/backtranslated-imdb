I like Chris Rock, but I think he's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​the Heaven Can Wait remake is fine, but filmmakers followed the story of this turkey too tightly. When Eddie Murphy turned Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he did it again - and so they became Murphy's films / cars, not just lukewarm remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris did the same, it could be a much better movie. A few laughs that have come is when he does his routine - and so he could also make a concert film. It would also be much more fun if the white man whose body lived was a truck driver or a hillbilly. So why does Hollywood still do such unsolicited things? Because people see it - because they like Chris Rock. Give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Do not exchange movies that were not so good at first!
