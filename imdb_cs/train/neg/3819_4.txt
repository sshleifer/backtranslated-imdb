T.Z. Post, a college professor, will receive a fake letter stating that he has inherited $ 750,000. Now with the funds he takes his life savings of $ 4,000 and decides to finally come out and live. After his luggage sent to Chicago to train, he meets a passenger of the Vaudeville ensemble and decides he is so good to him that he will introduce himself to Broadway. On the night of the show, a bad professor of mail has to hide from his creditors, to deal with the relationship between the girlfriend Pansy and the ugly diva Eleanor, and still make sure the show has to go on. After watching many of Keaton's quiet gems, this is the pain I could sit on, but I felt it could be much worse. Support for Durante, Todd & Selwyn is very unpleasant at times, but he still likes it. Pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as a frustrated show director. 90% of the script is misspelled because MGM is trying to pass this film as a Marx Bros. movie, where many people are starting out. Compiled with Keaton's drinking problems at the time, this film is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating - 3.
