I never understood the appeal of this show. The effects are bad (Debra Jo Rupp is a remarkable exception), the parcels of most episodes are triangular and unwavering, dialogue is weak, jokes are unfortunate and painful to try even half an episode. Moreover, the connection between this show and the 70s is extremely insignificant in terms of the styles of dress and scenery and background used in the show - it seems to be nothing but a modern sitcom with the same old dysfunctional, cliche scenarios that modern comedy dressed up as show performances twenty years ago in the hope of gaining some nostalgic viewers or something. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique much more efficiently and they are really delighted to watch it, unlike this terrible, poor excuses for the show
