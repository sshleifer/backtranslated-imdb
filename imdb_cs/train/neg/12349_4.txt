Real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of the first woman who ever went through SEAL's naval training. Training is hardest and heavier, as instructed in the lead character film O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no special message or point in this movie, or I could not get it right. It can be some kind of statement about women's rights and abilities, but everything sinks under tired scenes and silly weapons at the end of the film. I really do not understand why Ridley uses so much approach to that last battle in the desert? He looks so stupid, irritable and almost amateurish, so I really want to know what the director has seen in this technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, in battle scenes (which are many) there is absolutely nothing wrong, they are very intense and skillful. The whole final in GI. Jane looks ugly and is nothing but stupid and powerless shooting and killing. This is Ridley Scott's worst film, in my opinion, and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known. Still, I'm glad to see it in a widescreen format, because there are still some great Scott scenes and samples, but there's very little in this movie. Disappointment and nothing compared to the classic (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give GI. Jane 4/10.
