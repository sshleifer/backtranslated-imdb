Joel Schumaker controls the script he wrote together, and has a group of Georgetown degrees confronted with life situations in adulthood. The story line is a twisted mess, but some scenes are really good. There is a lot of unnecessary talent and time. Cast is more impressive than film. Popular favorites include Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most prominent are McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite uncomfortable. The arrival of the age is not so easy.
