This video contains a surprising way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It is a pity that the people who have done so really believe that the American people are so stupid that they believe it, maybe as an American citizen, everybody has to protest against such crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone say ... The Qur'an is public! you can read it yourself and decide whether what they say is true or untrue ... The video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies to manipulate and pool things that are not even related. The music that is used at some points prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they do not know what's going on. They use images that are lost from the original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment I would like to make a reflection ... Do not you think you can make the same exact film with every religion in the world?
