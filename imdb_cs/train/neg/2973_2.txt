I have two very big complaints about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. The fact that my local rental shop has spilled what is a very clear soft core porn in the "tension" category. (If I knew what it was, I would not have spent the time when I first borrowed it and yes, this movie is fine porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. Nobody in this movie does anything that would be either deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of both. <br /> <br /> In fact, do these three major complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. For some reason, I've watched the film for so long to find the second number on this list. Boy, I'm sorry. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistakes. This film is insignificant on virtually every level.
