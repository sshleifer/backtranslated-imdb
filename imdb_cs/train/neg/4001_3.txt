When we heard so much about the Cracker series of the 90's without looking at them, I was looking forward to it eagerly. Sure, the combination of Jimmy McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The poles, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent obstacles, were strong. The production was trying to be supermodern, but flashing boxes and even childish writing irritated. Robbie Coltrane was asleep - spent two hours, coming up with unexplained and unlikely "knowledge" and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional idiot idiots. As a result, the tension never happened, and another scene (no detail of the spoilers' fear) was as badly mixed as the television track I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see more, but I will return to the 90s DVD serials to see if they match their reputation.
