If you like the original cast and SNL performance, avoid this movie at any cost. When my friends first came out of this and I waited for an hour to get into the sold out cinema. in the middle of the movie theater was 3/4 empty. We refused to think it would be better. When the film ended, we were the only one in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all theaters, and then disappeared from sight. In interviews with "Mr. Mike" he refused to comment on this film. The film was an inner joke about the SNL episodes that came out after releasing and closing the films in one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and mail to get a replacement but were completely ignored.
