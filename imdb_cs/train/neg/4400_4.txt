One of Frances Farmer's earliest films; at the age of 22 she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby has a big voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Ray and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in their time, is really cruel today. Roy Rogers also appears - in a singing role. In my opinion, it is worth just watching if you are a fan of Frances Farmer and maybe even a fan of Bing Crosby.
