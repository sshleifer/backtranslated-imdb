I like movies and I'm watching any movie just to give him a chance. I can finally say I found a movie that I can not follow all the way. The game is terribly obsolete and monotonous, CGI looks like a computer geek that made it in the basement of its mother with minimal software and ..... with long scenes just ... walking !!!! And this movie is THREE HOURS FULL !!! I did not do it for 15 minutes until I quickly transfered the DVD. Scenes with aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "war of the worlds," let it name this "long distance warfare". It costs $ 5 million! What do you spend money on, a dramatic opening song? Oh, but beware, one scene you have to watch is when aliens first start killing people. It's funny, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they are still growing after 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So ... as I said, if you are a fan of boredom, centuries-old films without action, here is one for you a collection of DVDs. But I did not write it for you, I wrote it for billions and billions of other people who would hate this movie. It's not worth your time or money <br /> <br /> I know it's a book but the book is not that long and I'm a complete book worm / wrath / geek / anything but why? Just get a version of Steven Spielberg, it's not all good, but it's ten times better than this one! <br /> <br /> I give it BIG, FAT ZERO of 10.
