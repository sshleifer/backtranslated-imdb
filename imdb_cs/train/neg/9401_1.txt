In this extremely low budget (I saw home movies produced with higher production value) Australian total renunciation "Burning" and "Friday 13th", the group plans to make music video while on a houseboat. They are being chased by a serial killer who was fired years ago. This film is even declared the "worst Australian film ever to have" in its DVD promotional material. That's just a point of sale! Complete and complete waste in every significant way. Maybe some giggles here and there for lovers of bad movies, but I still wanted to burn my retina. Eye Candy: a quick flash of barely extensions of nice whips in the lame shower scene <br /> My rating: F
