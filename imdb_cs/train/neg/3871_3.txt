I try to be very objective when I look at a low-budget movie. I also apply a lower weight to independent and low-budget production than large budget productions. I expect impeccability from large budget productions and their studies. That is why I use the most important criteria for the major issue of the studio. But this movie was just crazy. Time. The assumption was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was unbelievable as a college senior with an unwavering desire to solve crimes. She did not have enough depth in her character or the actor that attracted you to her world. Also, to make this film much more mysterious, lighting in some scenes did not create a mood, especially in the storeroom. Another disappointment in the film, which I could only give three points.
