These 2 points are devoted to reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood movies really do not want to be realistic, but I ALWAYS believe that Walt Disney's production is more realistic than this conspiracy. My father dies and does what a good parent gives birth ... he kicks his son out of his son with his wife PREGNANT. A few things that were too hard to swallow - 1. Priyanka's "cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom" and go out of it for a living hungry in her law garden hut ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got a job as a stuntman, gets a biting of looted dogs, and then just leave. This film is INSULT of our intelligence, I really can not believe that I contributed financially to the "people" who shot this movie with their family to see it, we left the cinema with a cloud, please do not do this disorder watching it take my advice and do not lose your "waqt".
