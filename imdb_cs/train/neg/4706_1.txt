That's right, you hear me this film is furious ABOMINATION. First, a band who is going to look or listen to a band called "THE BATTERIES BAND"? Not only is the name terrible, but the musicians can not even play anything! The lead singer is even more girlish than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is scary! Not only are they terrible musicians but they are terrible actors. Led by a filthy director and a thin conspiracy, it must be the deepest film ever. I wish this website allowed you to use the voice NERO or SLEEP of 10, because giving this dirt 1/10 is too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call a comedy movie. If you're looking for a comedy with music, go to "strange Al" Yankovich's guy, because it does much better than these unnecessary tweenes.
