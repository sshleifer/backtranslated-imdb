Rarely, such amazing casts are lost so badly. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped aboard just to be torpedoed with a script that seems to be no more than a Hollywood joke. By joining Martin Scorsese's name, it was probably a draw, but the end result is much smaller than the sum of his parts. Reminding the nightmare terribly bad, each scene looks better than the next time. "Search and Destroy" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self-evident nonsense and the whole movie is definitely boring .......... MERK
