This movie comes directly from the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company won glory and luck in the first half of the 1990s by producing horribly bad and cheese-based horror films. The most famous catastrophes in their works are "Podspeci", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended, and neither is Dr. Mordrid. Hyperactive director Charles Band joined the company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is incredibly stupid and cheesy and almost completely free of humor. I saw it just because he plays Jeffrey Combs. I learned that she can have several disadvantages if you are a fan. For every good movie it seems to have 5 less good ones. Anyway, there is a story about the battle between two ancient witches. One good one, who has been here since 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one malevolent Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I have forgotten. Combs gets instructions from the mentor. The "guy" exists only in the pair of eyes in the universe. Very very cheese, it is! Every moment a blinking flash is displayed on the screen, but it's only a form of special effects that this movie has. The whole thing is just biting and disgust, and when the two wizards finally face each other, it will end before you see it ... I would expect the bad magician to get a little bit off, but nooooooo .. In some scenes you can (for example, Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the moon on the criminals), and if you really pay attention, you may even find some very small but pretty aspects (like a raven named Edgar Allen), but overall it's a terrible loss time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey, and maybe it's a superhero in my eyes ... but it certainly does not have to be a stupid maillot.
