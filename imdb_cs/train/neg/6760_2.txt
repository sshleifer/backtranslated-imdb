Renaissance writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to conquer old addiction and start a new life for himself, as editor of a Maryland magazine in Baltimore. Losses, delirium and rejection threaten his efforts. He would also like to reawaken the romance with his old darling, which is a seemingly erroneous prospect, as it turned out. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious past days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield employs many black and white, color and trick pictures to create a mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (like Dr. John Moran) works well, quite rightly. It is not enough.
