I have not seen the film shoot and I think it may be the first. It was terrible. I did not actually follow the end of it. It was like watching a dirty soap or really good (all the soaps are bullshit). The actors were poor and the plot was bad. The person who rated 10/10 has no idea what it is. The script was terrible. 2 People were in an angry conversation that combined threats and you expect a good kid to say something really good and beat her bullshit, but not. He says, "If you do that ... I will hurt you" Hahahahaha. If the comedy is your thing, beware. Please do not watch this movie because ... It's CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: bad play, bad fighting, bad scenario. <br /> <br /> Do not watch! Of course, that's what I think.
