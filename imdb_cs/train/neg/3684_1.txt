They sell it as a horror movie, it was a thriller, but I found it funny (comedy, do not think it), laughing at the movie, I think it was funny and funny. Even I do not blame actors, I think they are not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad man," I loved his acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! she is beautiful and also good actress, but let's try to be a bit objective, the story mm mm ... direction mm mm ... lacks a lot of good tension, in fact it's really boring movie, but there's one good thing, it's short film, just 1 hour and 30 minutes (it was about 10 minutes underwater for me!) I just do not know why this movie is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what is wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
