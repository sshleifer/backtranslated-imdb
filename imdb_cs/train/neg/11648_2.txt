As if at that time there were not enough of those that were floating at this time, we have another clone clone GODFATHER from director IL CONSIGLIORI (1973), which I watched earlier. At this time, the name appeared at this time, Telly Savalas, who was late in the process and was first seen from behind, rather fragile inflorescences and wearing a beret in the style of French painters! Apart from not looking at Sicilian at least, he did not make any accent other than his familiar interpretation. Antonio Sabato then makes an unlikely gangster - except that he is a tough leading man; his relationship with Savalas, who turns his father's eye, is also unconvincing (especially because he later romantically engages in his spiritual teenage niece)! Besides, for the gangster film, there is little valuable action that is being talked about, and none of this is unforgettable (although the final set at the clinic is well-developed); in addition, Francesco De Masi's score is fixable, but nothing else. By the way, the leased DVD scam I leased starts with half of the credits, so none of the players - even the title of the movie - are not mentioned at all!
