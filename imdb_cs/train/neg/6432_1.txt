The title says everything. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a brand dedicated to a senator who relied on the public's ignorance of WWII aircraft. The rear movable arms leaned against the latch to prevent the rear shotgun stripping off the tail of the airplane by blocking the fire when she pointed to the tail. When the senator one day practiced on the ground, he managed to blast the tail of the plane. He could not do it if the weapon were properly aligned. The Watch Officer responsible for this publicly confessed before the camera that he was responsible - he made a mistake, not a senator. The fact that the film did not reveal this fact shows how unilateral it is. This movie was designed to do one thing, ruining the reputation of a complicated person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was PBS, which was specially done on it. He was a hardworking, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame the extraordinary disadvantages that led to exceptional height. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but tail shooting from the plane was not one of them. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories, unilateral stories so they do not have to think.
