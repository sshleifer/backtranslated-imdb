In what might otherwise be the run of the millers, the average movie about infidelity in the sixties (fine "free-love" period), the makers of this film pile on a ridiculous script after an absurd script and top it all with a trite little cherry top, happily after completion. I have never felt sympathy with Diana Lane or Anna Paqu√≠n in their annoying carefree high school life, nor did I feel like I was redeemed by Liev Shrieber. The story line is slowly spreading to its predictable, pathetic conclusion and the only interesting and observable thing in this movie is the stunning Diane Lane without topless. Here's the Help, it appears about 30 minutes in the movie. Fast forward to this section and skip the rest.
