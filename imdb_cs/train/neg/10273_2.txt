As for horror films, I am more than willing to interrupt distrust, ignore the production values ​​of vapor, and overlook holes for good fear. These films simply do not have any bad deals. It can not be a camp. Poor dialogue, bad behavior, bad direction, killing were predictable and poorly introduced, music was uncomfortable, camera work was incredible, and costumes were bad. I feel really bad for the actor who, of course, was trying but who had to deal with a terrible, fanciful conversation and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they have some test. It's embarrassing to watch, and so boring, to end up with the conventional "surprise," ending a huge endurance. It's pretty easy one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I usually do not review reviews, but this was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, do not miss the opportunity to "Make". The writer / director seems to have the impression that making a killer a woman was a courageous and courageous move. (He saw it.) He and cast play half an hour deconstructing this film as if it were the new age of "Citizen Kane." It's like listening to a group of third pupils who will take you behind the backstage of their Christmas Contest. They really think they created something substantial. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this movie "2" is that I think "1" should be reserved for real atrocities such as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not the movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere in the fifties.
