What a confused mess. I've seen it with a friend a while ago, and we both consider it open to many of the movies, but it's certainly not one of them. Although it could be good ideas / concepts and there are definitely good performances (under the circumstances), it is all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony stretches out too strongly from the same genetic pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar films as far as editing is concerned, or perhaps Nixon's inspiration. Tell me what you want about David Lynch, but at least more than he has a method of madness. His quote about making the film a joke, he says it all. They are not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
