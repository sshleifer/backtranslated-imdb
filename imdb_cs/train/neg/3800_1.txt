Naming the absolutely craziest crap in the history of the film is not an easy task, the candidates are so abundantly, but Nemesis 2 is my personal favorite since I've seen it. It was so funny that we had to get him back the next day and I laughed again so I literally rolled on the floor. (This is usually only happening when I see Monty Python's "Scott Antarctica".) Throughout the movie, the audience seizes everything. I am utterly confused that this clumsy home video has ever reached the stage of production. It is supposed to be a sequel, but it has nothing to do with the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, though it took us half way through the film to stop guessing what with all the muscles and barbaric nomadic gear! <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy at all, it's just a long haunted scene, but it's so slow and meaningful that it's much more interesting than it really is to consider it a persecutable scene. There is almost no dialogue that is as good as its quality, and then suddenly the film suddenly comes to a sudden end after a spectacular action scene with a lot of gas explosions without ever really explaining what it was all about. Fortunately, it's never bored, because there's something silly and fake going on all the time! Terrible movies are usually just boring, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of excessive seriousness and a total nonintentional wackiness that is really fun. Rent this movie or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
