It must be one of the worst fruits I've ever seen and I've seen a couple. It is slow, boring, amateur - not even in accordance with its own simplified reading of the plot. Actors do not. I can not blame them - they get a script with such a complete banality that all they can do is to go through the pains behind their eyes, which has nothing to do with bad departures in SummersIsle. <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this movie that would ring true - not a straight line, nor a single moment when a person is moved. Nicholas Cage's character is so poorly portrayed that he feels no sense of sympathy for him through all his misery. I have no doubt that I see suffering there, but Nicholas Cage was fully aware that he was in the worst film of his entire career.
