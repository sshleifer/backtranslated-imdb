Lolita is a rebellion and she will participate in our wide open eyes of some small sexual stories, between sci-fi and fantasy ... But this Surrender Cinema production is not very good: very bad acting, scary music and a story without any story and any line . But sex scenes are pretty well done, lots of lesbian scenes and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as exotic house wax, offer us a very good final and very hot strip show. Just Lovell fans.
