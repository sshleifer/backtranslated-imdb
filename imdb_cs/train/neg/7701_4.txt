The original show was much better. They should leave a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, overly dramatic and funny parts were too far to relax. This movie really looked as if it was too hard to be serious, and it definitely was not what I wanted from this sequel. Not to say that it was still the same for a long time. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try it again. This movie is rather dull and not funny. Excuse me. 4/10 stars is it. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
