Usually I have a lot better stuff with my time than writing reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent the hour of registering with IMDb just to get it out of my chest. <br /> <br /> A movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet ... well, this movie was just terrible. It is almost impossible to "stop mistrust"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just did not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should hold music, what a terrible performance - no presence as an actor, no character. You can not blame everything on Justin: The movie also boasts terrible plotting and bad time editing; it's definitely "F". When I see it, I have to wonder what really motivates the actor. I mean, surely Morgan will actually read the script before he takes the role. Did not he see how bad it was? What then could motivate him to participate in it? Money? Of course, acting is sometimes more about who you are seeing rather than truly developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets much more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and he really fights to deal with a bad script. <br /> <br /> So far, the audience goes, "What the hell is going on here, do you expect me to believe this bullshit?" In short, except for Justin's great set-up, poorly executed - very disappointing.
