"Fallen persons" fall under the category WOL (WOL). I am sad that I was not amused two hours ago. My other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments on the screen and rooted for the mummy. I'm sorry for actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie than it could be shortened to 25 minutes, so it could take a 30-minute slot on TV without losing the plot. It reminds me of a dish that has some good ingredients, but when served it is a tasteless flavor at all. In my humble opinion, the mummy would have a foot of 8 to 10 meters and improved the conspiracy by pulling out the mystique and replacing it with a few people who want to distort the facts and want DNA samples for bad reasons. The heroes are discredited and thrown there on their dorms. Later after all were bad men. Heroes would save the day and prove they are all bad.
