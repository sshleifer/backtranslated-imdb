Please note that I have not seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry it. However, I really want to say something about it. In fact, I'm doing research for the University of Richard Maurice Bucke's character, and I would like to point out that the person on which the main character was standing was in fact quite different! Hollywood thoughts on people and a licensed art license, real Dr. Bucke fully supported hysterectomy to treat madness in women and never would have done something as liberal as it is in the film. I think it's ridiculous to see various film critics writing for legitimate newspapers who say that this film has some historical basis! The only thing I see is the friendship between Dr. Buck and Walt Whitman. Do not waste your time on the film with such fear of the horror that real women have experienced in the hands of this doctor who has now been celebrated by the film industry.
