The original film (of 19?) Did not show any "monster", but only suggested frightening "things". <br /> <br /> This version shows all the aspects of the "spiritual spirit", including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "The Mystery," as presented in the original movie, was the worst: one simply did not know what caused the strange things that had happened. By showing the face of an "old man," this master completely vanished. Even worse: special effects (crying wooden children's faces) are ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, too obviously magnificent to be as close as frightening as the original
