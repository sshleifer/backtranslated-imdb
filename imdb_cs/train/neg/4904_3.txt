Teamo Supremo are three children, consisting of their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battlefield (Chica! Woopa!) And with clothing and movement. They work for Governor Kevin and are recruited after they wanted to be heroes and play in the game. They lead normal lives and have family and school responsibilities, but most of the action takes place from school fighters. The villains have rather unique and unique features such as Mr Vague and men who never know what their plans are, but they do the same. From the evil robot to the bad baron, three have to meet them and stop their evil and often strange plans to gain power, avenge, etc. The animation itself is pretty pretty and smooth, but the style seems to be simply expedient. The backgrounds have overlapping colors and the buildings seem futuristic. The music is quite nice and the show is not quite bad, although the style is not my favorite. History is almost always meaningless and ridiculous, but in the end it's a cartoon and we can not blame it for it. However it would not be in the same position as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
