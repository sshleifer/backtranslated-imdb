After the initial 5 minutes of the movie, I found it very difficult to track it. I managed to take my stomach for 45-50 minutes before turning it off and disgustedly watching Monster House (which is extremely fun). The story has massive holes in it. The conspiracy line is immensely boring and boring, acting is horrible, especially from Justin TImberlake, who really should hold on to what's good (looks angry and sings like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he danced around for rock music for no apparent reason halfway through the film and Timberlake. Freeman and Timberlake's character seem to have some kind of paternal relationship or something, which is simply not at all obvious, although Freeman's character does not look from the unknown and somewhat stupid nature of Timberlake, seems to have nothing but contempt, never pulls out all the stops to help him reveal a totally absurd cover. <br /> <br /> An incredible interruption of mistrust that could benefit a story, which is simply absurd and blown from all directions. Do not look at this movie, it's a waste of time.
