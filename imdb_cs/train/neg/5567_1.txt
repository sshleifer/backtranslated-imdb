Okay, I rented the movie because of the director ... he made some interesting moves in the past (if you did not see Waxork, you miss her fun ride). Anyway, I had doubts about this movie from the beginning, but I decided to suck it up and look. It is bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie and do not mind spoilers reading ahead. First, the old saying "You can not judge the book about its cover" is true. The box for this film shows that Jill is a stone fox with long hair highlighted. On the back of the box is a beautiful red Jill shot and some other shots. This description makes you rent a movie because it's good. You start watching it and suddenly you find that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a total dog that is not a girl on the cover. The film is not as predictable as it would have been ... and that's not a good thing. Characters make so many stupid things without any minimization of motivation ... it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the Dolph movie and other ladies have sex without a good reason. Also, what he thought Dolph was killing this second lady in the cold blood that helped him. Anthony Hickox, director, should have seen the glowing when he read the script. If it happened in the underworld of the new millennium and the characters would be halfway smart, it could be decent. Setting it up in the 1970s makes no sense and has no effect on the story. Avoid!
