The only thing that occurred to me after watching this disgrace was that I would never get the time I watched, and that again. To see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn trying to make what had to be, then the backups for the holiday home stay tuned. Wood acting, bad special effects, the only comic accent was, while our extraterrestrial hero was in the female form and it ended when she made her mandatory b-film naked sex scene within 30 minutes into the movie. An opportunity for what could be a decent movie will disappear when Nicole Eggbert watches a stranger in the bar in 30 seconds while police, military and Joe public will not cotton that a woman drinking coffee, do not use the handle of a cup and he wears four jumpers at a time. Obviously it must come from another planet. Where would I like to be when this movie was?
