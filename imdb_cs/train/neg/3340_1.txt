This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but angry. First thing, what the hell are the punk guys trying to do with the school? I think the children probably do not realize the gravity of the situation. Deker guy tells the girl that for his responsibility when he asks why he wants to come back for them but right afterwards he puts a gun on a wheelchair dude and wants to go to repair the telephone line himself. Where is the responsibility? I understand that poor actors have to pay for their meals, but why they just do not give them money that would make them silly movies as such, or give them money for charity. Yeah, and none of them knows how to focus. The silly punk guy in the cafe shoots nowhere like a fool. Everybody wants to look professional but they all suck. One more thing I do not believe is that there is no emergency exit at school, the kids are trying a few doors, but they are all locked. What happens when the fire and the crazy security guard are dead? It is illegal to have an emergency exit at school. Anyway, there is much more, but it will be too long. I spent some time in my life watching the bullshit.
