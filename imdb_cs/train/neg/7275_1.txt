"National Lampoon Goes to Films" (1981) is absolutely the worst film ever shot, overcoming the insignificant "Plan 9 from Outer Space". Lampoon has three separate and unrelated culprits, each with different artists. The only common theme is the absolute lack of redemption. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site said the flying shots are nice and true. Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry scatter their property nicely, in the first and second parts. But their charming shows are, unfortunately, unnecessary. It seems that directors have forgotten that even T & A needs a trusted story that surrounds it, and it's nothing. The third segment, played by Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the threat of this film. Benson plays the eager beaver of a young policeman who has clearly reported on the first day of his activity, ready to get rid of the streets of evil. He is paired with an old cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners went out on the first watch together, we felt that we could redeem earlier film failures. Maybe just that the cynical old timer will be reformed by his sad sense of duty and loyalty to his new partner. Maybe they all end up happy. But unfortunately, this film directs straight to the toilet, without redemption, without a happy end, without any contiguous story. Before "National Lampoon Goes into the Movie," I thought I had seen the worst slump Hollywood could get. Unfortunately I did not see half. <br /> <br />
