It is impossible to consider this film objectively. Not that I did not try, but I sit down and I appeared at the age of the VHS and look at the opening ... and suddenly I was five years old and kept my own Care Bear and watched the movie with open eyes and eager heart. I objectively discover that this film is a combination of BIZARRE with plush children's merchandising mascots and scary pre-puberty children with evil powers with a slim story and uninteresting animation. But my inner twenty-five years are going, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - just (cautiously, reluctantly) I recommend this film to those who saw it during their early years, and when they look at it (like me), they can call on the amazing power of nostalgia or those mercifully cynical Gen-X / Yery who deliberately seek extremely bad / weird (the category in which this movie definitely belongs). Those who are really looking for a perfect movie or healthy family fun: You might want to keep looking.
