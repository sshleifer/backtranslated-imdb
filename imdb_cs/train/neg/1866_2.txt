An inexpensive film about exploitation of mothers is looking for a daughter who has been kidnapped by people making snuff movies. The trail leads a mother across Europe as she looks for her baby and we fight in the audience to stay asleep. This is one of the countless fine films that are made for people who want the excitement of porn without stigma or the danger that they appear on their credit card bill. Personally, I would rather have a stigma because these films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. This is probably a sexy thriller, but not. Mostly his people talk about things that follow a lot of steps from place to place and lead to leadership. Every year, the film is filmed by various people who get dressed and everything has more than S & M's touch in driving. Violence and fetish is such that it raises laughter rather than horror or excitement, it is so incredibly false. Even worse, there is not enough nudity to make it interesting.

The most interesting thing was the blonde hair ominousness with a huge bend and a nose of the Buick size. I watched her with a morbid fascination, wondering how she looked like a young girl, and wondered if she had plastic surgery, not what you should think of in a gripped thriller. Avoid.
