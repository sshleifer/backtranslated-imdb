Craven, a cowardly movie. Director Boorman shows that Cahill has scared rich homes, but a male passenger is proven to be a non-believer with a nanny, that's true. The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is thrown into the car, but he is a rat who has a sourpuss, and he does not look like a handsome man, so it's too. Beits, the owner of Russborrough House, scared his money by using "darkies" and digging diamonds, so it's okay to steal invaluable art and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The Garda kills ferrets and is involved in his murder. Moral equivalence is bad, Boorman is looking for a hit film, but he does not have the courage to stand up against the crime of a general who has terrorized the neighborhood and unleashed another wave of piggyback in Dublin. He even joined the son of the generals when he did. Disgusting. Thunder him for cowardice.
