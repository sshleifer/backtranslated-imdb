I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival and I can not decide. We never had to get close enough to some characters that should matter to them. Maybe it was that we were all in our "bubble", but these people did not let anyone worry or shock their different fates. During less than a few hours, the characters were not very well developed. A lot of time was devoted to the fitting of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, blades); and somewhat spooky-looking dolls with surprisingly lively eyes, which most of the characters that nurtured were somewhat more interesting than living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never worked together.
