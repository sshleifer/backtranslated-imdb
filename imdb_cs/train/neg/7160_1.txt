Well, when the portrait of Jason Miller (looks even more eroded than in Exorcist IV) is the top of the picture, what do you got? It's a bit of a country, a little rock n 'roll: mix two drunkards with money pulling their boys all over with a swamp-dried mummy (you think one more - drank in the swamp?) In the basement, Christopher Walken with bad dyeing and a little girl who could be an interesting person if they developed it. <br /> <br /> I understand - surely - that she will come back to visit her relatives. After that .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are some interesting memories of what I have to assume her mother is killed in bombing the car (I think). It's never connected with anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do we need for a grandmother? Grandma could be interesting. They speak Gaelic or Celtic, or something. Maybe you could do something. The best thing they can do is have a tobacco habit. That is all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They take a really good character as a husband. Is he a type cast (sells his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to the trusted fund he manages for her) or is he resigned to the type (eventually having a good haircut and nice clothes)? Drinks, hesitates. He's not a bad guy. It is not good. But unavailable. Why did not they do something about them? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old friend appears. His husband knocks him. He will return to defeat his husband. (It becomes stupid, but at least the character has a motivation.) NOW - is an alcoholic, he is an alcoholic; he could only marry her money. Grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle will bring our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of the witch (you say that?) Which can be revived. In fact, you know it's coming to life, music is growing. A little girl lives in the house, takes tea to her grandmother (unlocks the door to do it) and gives her grandmother cigarettes. The grandmother gets out regularly. But nothing will happen. <br /> <br /> The husband loses the baby in the house, then loses his bedroom. Your uncle gets to the neck in the basement. The leading lady has a nose bleed. Her husband drinks. They both drink. Faced with all the terrible truths mentioned in the first voice is - omigod - abortion when she was a twelve-year-old lady. In spite of all these swarming governments of ingredients, nobody could get the story on the screen. No bridge between situations, no graduation from mild disturbance to terrible horror, only long slow scenes that do not go anywhere. Nobody really cared for it - and they had room to go with this aspect - an innocent child in the charge of drunkards, a grandmother who could be closed because it's a monster, but no, her worst mistake is smoking. She has great hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, no plot. Just a little random (foreseeable) violence in a dark library with rain that dived into the dust and the soundtrack that led us in. You need more than a few drunkards and Christopher Walken to shoot a movie. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were good. Ah. Nice scenery, good cupboard. The cameraman knew at least what he was doing. I bought him. I'm poor.
