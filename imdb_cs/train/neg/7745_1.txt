Where to start? special effects should be labeled as special defects. When the director shouted "action," I think he also told actors to perform the worst performance they could think of. Perhaps he was angry with the producers and wanted to make sure they did not get a single penny from their investment and that this would be a case study on how to shoot a movie. Or maybe he hated arts school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family did not leave him. The only thing that is sure that he who employs him in the future is because he is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all past links.
