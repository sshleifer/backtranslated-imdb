As Steven Segal films go this is the bottom of the barrel. His best was just feeding for the bored youth. She weighs the scales and then falls. All characters are cardboard. The story is double. I can not screw it up by telling you the end. You know how all Steven Segal movies will end up if you've seen them. Here it goes. He's a government agent who knows he's too much to relax and they choose instead of killing him to help him until he can remember the squat. The escape, of course, arrests and is placed at his old general, who needs one man in a million of experience to obtain a secret airplane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan by a dirty air force pilot surprise, surprise, Segal trained. All the heroes, except Segal's character and his quiet girlfriend, die heroically, and Steve-Baby has saved the whole world on one bay shell or fell. It does not matter. Made from a surplus of aviation and naval aviation film. And a lot of booms. Get some Popeye cartoons instead.
