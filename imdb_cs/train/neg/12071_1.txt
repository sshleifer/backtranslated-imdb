Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen lots of bad pictures all the time. The sound is charged, just like image quality, direction, acting ... etc. Only good sprouts (which are laughs because they are so bad) are special effects. Overall, laughs about 5 minutes. The rest of the picture will cause you brain damage.
