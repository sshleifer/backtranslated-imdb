I watched this movie on Sneak Preview and I'm glad I do not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. It is full of jokes and fart of jokes and has no pride in action sequences (for example, shootings in "small Germany"). I made a small list of things I liked in the movie ... and I disagreed. Dave Foley's penis. 2. Fingers Fingers. 3. Jokes poopu. 4. Dude was a pussycat. 5. Not Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Again have fun from Bush. WE DO IT IS IDOT ... continue on. 8. Dude has blond hair. 9. Plot. 10. Killing Minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast was just outrage and out. <br /> <br /> Now it has (little) good <br /> <br /> 1. Dude uses the cat as a silencer as in the game. 2. Lots of actions. 3. Crotchy made a comeback (and portrait of the mail producer) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are several "whats ep" moments <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. He did another hacking game in adaptation of the film. Kudos, Mr. Boll. 2/10
