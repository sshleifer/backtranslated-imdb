I can not believe I spent my time with this movie. I could not even call her a movie. It was so bad that nothing recommends it. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and strange movies, but this one bored me. Bad and bad acting destroyed the curiosity. You have to wonder what these people thought when they spent the money to make this film. I wonder what I thought he was watching. I recommend this film to no one. How did they relax? Was there an audience that likes this kind of movie? It must be because you find it in almost every video store. But why? <br /> <br /> He deserves to forget. <br /> <br /> If you love bad movies then it is for you.
