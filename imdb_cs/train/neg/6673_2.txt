My first opinion on how bad it would be was when the video said it was from the people who brought us the Blair Witch Project, which was a masterpiece compared to this piece of garbage. It was the caliber of the 6th year of Oklahoma's production, and the conspiracy, as far as possible, was predictable, boring and sad. 85% of the script is four letter words and countless variations on them. Mother F seems to be a "writer" favorite because it is used constantly. It would take 10 minutes if you wrote this script during a dive during the last call. Thank God I rented it and I could skip most of it faster forward. Do not waste time or money.
