Before I saw this movie, I expected a fictional drama based on the ideas of the book; instead, it is a book interrupted by dramatic scenes that illustrate various "illnesses". It did not bother me much, but it prevented my enjoyment from the film. One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from a book scattered in the film would be better for me. If you want to create a movie on a psychological text, you have to find more interesting (and most accurate) text than this text. The film stretches in parts where it is just a little bit more than a 19th-century video encyclopedia of sexual psychology, and would be totally unbearable if it was not sexual in nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). Fortunately, there are several stories of the real character development that attract us. But disappointing, Krafft-Ebing's theory of sexuality was largely uncontested. I hoped he would use the stories to show how imperfect his archaic view of psychology still held by many. <br /> <br /> So, what do you have? A detailed catalog of several fetishes and orientations, with some slightly interesting stories that show the attempts and the sufferings of several "sexual deviants" before they are cured. For most movies, the movie moves at the speed of crawling (and mood) awakening. And, apparently, the low budget of film, cinema and acting is not exactly the highest level. Although I was * satisfied with music, costumes and interior. I felt that this movie is an object that's right on my alley, and I still feel like it's an under-average movie. It deserves 3/10; 4/10, if I felt very generous. I can not imagine anyone enjoying themselves if they were not interested in sexual fetishism.
