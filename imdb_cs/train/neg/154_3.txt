He watched it on DVD in the original language with English. Whether subtitling is very bad, or a real dialogue does not create much story and does not create any character. There are relatively few HK stars in this, but the film does not need their presence to make it better or worse. It is bad. Bright and colorful scenes in CG are appealing for total color and brilliance, but they can be overwhelmed long ago. If anything like that makes me think about a children's movie with his non-stop barrage cg, fighting with scenes and leaky conspiracy. I'm sure I understand what happened in the movie, but the whole story was rather miserable.
