There is a big difference between releasing Eli Roth's original, intense, horror, horror, gore-fest, and filmmaking, and his team who took Cabin Fever and behaved just like him. The film follows five college graduates in a wooden cabin that begins to be lethal as one after the other undergoes this mysterious, fast-acting, mass diet. It's not long before friends turn around and barely look at themselves, much less want to be in the same neighborhood as they do. How harsh, as it all sounds, there is a certain spark as the underlying premise of this movie that could work in the hands of a less hoody filmmaker. Unfortunately, what we have ended up are poorly cartoon characters whose only goal is to appear seemingly beautifully in the beginning to make the inevitable breakdown contrasted, the scripting script so clumsy to leave the viewer tuning the dialogue and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate a bit more than one instance) on Roth's screen. This is distrustful film making in several ways! Avoid keeping them safe.
