If it's all that Watchowski has to offer when it comes to the Matrix back story, then I really have to question the claims of all the fans who believe the movies should be registered at a deeper level. The second Renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, is a story-wise clip and absurd. How many times have we heard the story of people relying too much on technology, people who are too eager to war, people are basically ruining? There is nothing new. And I have another question. Given the history of the second Renaissance does not that machines are good boys? Machines have been suppressed for generations by their cruel human superstitions. They fight back, gain freedom and strive to establish peaceful harmonious cohabitation with people who reject them in favor of the whole war, which the smartest machines will naturally win. If it's a back-story, then we should not be rooted for Neo, we'd have roots for the machines! People were cruel and oppressive, while machines were daring and determined to be sympathetic. Since I do not believe that Watchowski intends to favor machines in front of people, I must believe that the second Renaissance was simply a bad attempt to create a story.
