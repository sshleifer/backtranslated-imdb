Unfortunately, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THIS VERSION SUCKS! I do not know who has spent the money on this fleet, but I hope they are proud of them. They took the classic game and turned it into the most difficult melodrama you can imagine. This version is literally so bad that even the presence of the great thespian, such as Maximilian Schell in the title role, can not save her. This movie is just the redemption of the quality is that it made great feeds for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo, and Crow had this great fun. But I'm sure Shakespeare, if he was alive if they did, did not want his name to be associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not so bad that it's good; it's just bad. Totally terrible.
