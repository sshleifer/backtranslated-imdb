What a terrible movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but in addition to some interesting compositions, the movie is mostly taken from hysterical submarines who scream, cry, hook, and generally scared when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take a simplified assistant to make sure the audience still understands what's happening (the scene where Denzel Washington explains to the author of the radio how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek, it's just a joke) and you have a frightened thriller that is not worthy of acting. We just hope the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
