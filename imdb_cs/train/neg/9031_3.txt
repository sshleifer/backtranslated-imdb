Repayment is a game that plays in this drama and revenge is averted by an absurd story that creates a stage for fireworks that will come later. Why would you get involved in a married trophy of a ruthless mob boss in a gangster house with suspicious followers all around? Why would an unfortunate woman encourage the attention of a complete stranger and expect to take her away and leave her husband and boredom to live happily with a new love? Certainly, the hero, here, Kevin Costner, had to expect a reaction from a fragile husband who gives the movie the justification of committing absurd gore and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor who was certainly deserving better, and Madeleine Stowe is a tragic figure that suffers greatly when she closes to her charming prince. Stowe is fine, but her Spanish accent does not work. Players are younger players, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a faded rock star.
