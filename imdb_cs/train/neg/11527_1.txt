<br /> <br /> The film begins as an ordinary comic hero. This is a boy who is chosen, does not have parents, and is madly in love with school girl No. 1. There is no surprise in the movie, there is nothing you can not guess about coming to the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us he's not a good actor, or that no world actor can save a script like this one. Perhaps children at the age of ten can enjoy this movie, but for the smallest it is a bit violent. You can not get away from thinking about movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All titles are better. I almost climbed in the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good was computer animation, but we will not do anything for Christmas tree! So my recommendation: You do not see this movie, even if you get paid for it!
