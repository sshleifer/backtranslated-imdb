To see an intelligent, philosophical discussion of human potential and potential, look at "Crazy Life", which is great. "What we know is everywhere in its focus, misguided, badly written, badly acting, completely rid of any artistic direction, and absolutely annoying. In the least it was not thought-provoking or entertaining. The inclusion of this endless monster "Ramtha" in this film is a good reason to exclude it. No wonder how do the filmmakers decide to look at the fact that this woman worships a 2000 year old Atlanta god or something? What is the old cat's snowflake and what a complete waste of time and money for this film. People responsible for this film should not be able to shoot another movie again.
