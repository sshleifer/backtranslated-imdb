What kind of unwanted movie was. The assumption was fine, but even in the beginning, with miserable effects that combined with the giant people of normal size (even the effects in Hercules were better) I knew it would be bad. But the really awful part of the film is dialogue. He is totally disconnected, stupid and stupid. It seemed like he was writing a 9th grade in the creative class and got D-. I want to stick Casper van Diem and the other actors to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I had my share of cheese and bad movies (I love a lot of shakes), but this ... I do not recommend at all. It's stupid and totally horrid dialogues you're raging.
