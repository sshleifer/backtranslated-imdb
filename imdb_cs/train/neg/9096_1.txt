I think it's probably one of the worst movies I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> Trying to get the same characters with different people is * such * a bad idea. If they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this, they would just cut their losses and say that hell with him. Instead they get NEW actors who are terrible in what they did. I really felt like I was in high school or (bad) college playing with a lever as these guys stand out. Where do some of these people get? Was that their first movie? It seemed to me. <br /> <br /> This film also parallels the original in several languages. I just watched the first and jumped # 2. I was excited to see the other and ended up as the worst show I saw in a while. I have never EVER * EVER * ever released a movie, but this one definitely left in about 30 to 40 minutes.
