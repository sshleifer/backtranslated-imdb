This movie is another movie on my movie list, which I do not have to bother with. He had seen it forty years ago as a teenager, he was late, he was very nervous when he found out that it was about 95% romance, 4% everything else, 1% history, if so. This is what I say bait and switch movie, one with an interesting name, a real movie is a scam. This is a theme that deserves good cinematographic treatment; this film is almost an insult to those who have served. Lafayette Escadrille's own members were not on the run, nor were they dirty home makers, they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them come from a higher class environment than Tab Hunter's character. The flying school is not designed for intelligent alleys, and it knows everything, the person that was portrayed here should not take two days, it would be either a barn or an infantry. Discipline in the French army was often rather furious. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
