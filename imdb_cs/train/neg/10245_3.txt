I expected a lot from this movie. Somehow like Lee as a naturosamic character, but all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can not even explain this movie. It was a wooden actor, horrible script from pieces from the Bible, such as hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But it was in the end! The rest had to wait and hope something meaningful happened, but not. This film is about a couple who are trying to find out the changes that happen in the world, such as places in China where the earthquake occurred, and ended up in a monastery that runs eight nuns and a priest. The monastery will end with a key factor of negligence. The whole movie is controlled and boring. One of the Lees is the worst.
