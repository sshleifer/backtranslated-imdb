This is the film that represents the D & D episodes of the 1980s (and even today). Fear is that people who play D & D (or any other game of play) will be "sucked in" and lose the ability to distinguish reality from imagination (and continue killing madness, child victims, suicide, etc.). A great movie for anyone who likes to blame society's problems on inanimate objects, but anyone who plays a gaming role, a video game, or even play a game will see it as an insult to their intelligence. It's D & D, what Wargames is about computers. Plus as a movie, it's a little crazy.
