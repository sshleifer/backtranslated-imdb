She loved the first part, the Immaculate Planet, but enchanted, what is the disappointment of the second part of "The Satan Pit". There was nothing about something that seemed to emerge from the pit, nothing that had fallen out of the pit. Then the ages were exhausted by round air vents to tell the story, Beast, who was telling a thing without intelligence, so I did not expect a doctor / scumbag confrontation. TARDIS is somehow inside a pit, even though the hole is not open for long until TARDIS penetrates the bark of the planet. And finally, another ready-made solution that did not exist for a logical reason - I mean why not get the Beast into a hole as soon as the hole opens? Why not defile him before all these years, instead of trapping him in the same way. Why not - I could go on but lost interest ...
