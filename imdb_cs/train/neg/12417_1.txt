Any film that begins with a cow's leg and slashes with female bums can not promise too much. As for the stereotyping of the kibbutz, as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it just was not. Okay, every kibbutz had just a little bit of something that appeared in the movie (like the young men who chase the kitchen at night), but you can not show that the whole kibbutz is full of all the - as we would call - nasty traits. Each kibbutz had his own problems, but hardly any kibbutz had all of them. The views of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in the Eden Garden called Emek (valley). Yes, and acting was also good, so you can see that it was not all black - just a bad impression - probably for the purpose.
