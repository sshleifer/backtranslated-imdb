I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First, I want to say that the story behind this film and the creation of the Amber Alert system is good. However, the film itself was poorly crafted and acting was terrible. The main problem I had with the film was the other half with Nicholas Timmons and Father Glenn Park. The events around this part of the story were not entirely correct. At the time, my father suffered from mental disorders and chose Nichole without any intention of harming her. He loved her as a daughter and was thought to save her from some harm or neglect that he probably believed she was coming from her mother who paid her little attention over the three plus years my father cared for and eventually lifted her to her mother could say good-bye. The film described my father in such a way that it would cause her some form or form. The funny thing is that Nichole spent many nights somewhere in her paternal place while Sharon will work or do what she does. The reason why my father was originally considered to be violent was because he had things that could be considered weapons in his car. My father was a tailor. The items they considered to be weapons were the tools for adjusting the terrain he kept in the car all the time to work. My recommendation is that this film gets a grain of salt, it's a good story and based on real events, however the details of the film (at least part of Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate, and show the director's failure to discover the truth when telling the story. The funny thing is that if the director talked to someone Sharon's friends who knew about this situation, they would say exactly what I sent here.
