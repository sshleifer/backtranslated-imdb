As the commentary as the one who was the title of the high school students, they even do it on this page, it was the stupidest movie I've ever seen, it was ridiculous how a fool can sit and say that just because the movie makes you jump, it's a good movie that could be the most odd thing I've ever heard, I might be intertwined and go "Boo" and it would make you jump but that does not mean I'm qualified to write or direct a movie, not to mention Tom, "everything was tied up at the end," there's no good reason why the film should be well received. What kind of movie would it be if they did not put everything together, it's about half the film, not the whole movie. So basically this idiot is a compliment to the film, and I love how today's youth holds the media and manufacturing companies to such a high standard. No wonder the political system of this country can get away with what they want, we have such idiots who get into our country what would happen if this girl really ended up by ever showing up something, that's a scary thought . Get your life and go watch the real movie sometime, try Shawshank Redemption or On the seafront or something like this and do not comment that it's "boring" after you see it, just use what a small brain that God gave you to analyze it a bit.
