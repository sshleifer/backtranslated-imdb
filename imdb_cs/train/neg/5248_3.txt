"Die Sieger" was highly recommended to be one of the few good action films in Germany. I saw it last night and I must admit I'm deeply disappointed. If it is to be the "last best hope" for a fun and challenging German action cinema, it's not that much. "Die Sieger" is trying to be sexy, daring and furious, but it is not like that, the characters are wooden and stereotypical and whenever they do something unexpected (it does not happen too much), it is against their nature. impossible - to track them or even to identify them. <br /> <br /> I think the film is very bad, there is no one I believe in. Maybe it's a senior SWAT officer - but that's right. people who try to look or behave like special units like elite cops - I do not believe them Not for a moment. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad But I think it's wrong. you do not know at all - for example, and when, after a "very dark" performance, Karl Simon (good man) asks his already dead opponent "why? ... why? "I thought the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have answered. I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even with action movies.
