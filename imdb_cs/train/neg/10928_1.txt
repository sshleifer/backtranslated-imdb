He just saw this movie and what it was like to waste time. The film was predictable and slow. Basically, they are Mormon bad bears who play a basketball sanction. Rather than watching this movie, I should have a root channel. Outcomes of heresy were apparently managed by sponsorship / funding. This movie had the potential due to the blatant behavior that Mormons exhibit while playing basketball, but because it is rated PG, the true nature of the theater could not be transferred to the film. The game is terrible, except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the film was totally useless.
