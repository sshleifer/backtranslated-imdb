This may actually be the worst movie I've ever shot. Discontinuity would be a compliment. Even the end had no sense, but it was a huge relief that it was finally over. I looked at him with some fatal experience to see if he could continue to get worse. By the end of this mess, I was sorry that some of the characters survived, and I did not feel too good about the actors. If you want to look at the wreck of a train, I recommend hanging on the train station. Even waiting on an abandoned train platform will defeat this mess. Apparently, I did not get enough to meet the prescribed ten lines, so I'm going to say one more time at the risk of redundancy. This movie is zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. What is minus zero?
