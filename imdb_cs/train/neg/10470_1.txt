What else to say? <br /> <br /> I read all reviews here and most of them are right on. . One man even went so far as to call this film evil, and Satan commented on it (or something like that). Evil?! Guess what shock. . I think TBN basically created this movie. Please open your eyes. <br /> <br /> This is a very low degree of propoghandy nonsense that has come in years. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Omega Code is how much money they've spent to do it. If this movie can be created, there are no limits, so we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest Lose Omega Codes". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are in biblical stories, the new Dogma will highlight where the Omega code has never begun.
