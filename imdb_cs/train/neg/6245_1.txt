The only thing that proves "Uncomfortable Truth" is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "undeniable" experts are not questioned because the reaction to their indefinite hypotheses is generally under real science. These are mostly fake scientists. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - are people, we breathe out, and if you are not willing to start sacrificing your brothers to save the world, there is no need to do anything. We have heard the world end up as the result of a man for more than 50 years. Fools publish a time line for their final day and when time comes, nothing happens. "Inconvenient Truth" is just another vehicle with which an enemy faction of American society can prolong its swing. And if Al leaves the tobacco trade because of the death of his sister from cancer, it is also a burden. Al could not manage his farm better than he could manage. He lost money on surgery because he did not care about farming when he could make more money to talk. The only global warming that is not being questioned is the hot air produced by this gas bag!
