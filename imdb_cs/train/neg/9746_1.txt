I remember this film, which took place in the 1970s in Barcelona (Spain), during the week. Although it may look incredible and I can not offer any explanation, this film was exhibited in a theater dedicated to ... art and high quality film (that is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel, and Designed Man). Few people saw it (lucky people, no doubt) and no reference to this very boring SF film is in the Science Encyclopedia of Peter Nichols or the author of the original novel. Very informative. I remember, after all these years, a non-story, lots of special effects that seem really meaningless and no more. In some countries, it seems that the run time is 90 mm. and in the next 77 min. Well, that means just a little more pain.
