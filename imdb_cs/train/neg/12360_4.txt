Why would you come back to a person who kicks them in teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over again. This film teaches us that to find love, we must accept abuses (not only to forgive but to fully accept). Damn! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Of course, I did not discover my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> As a debut that plays Bucatinsky, there are many amazing aspects to this film; However, in order to justify Eli and Tom's meetings, further development of the character would be useful. We have never met Eli's masochism, in fact we are convinced that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very obvious.
