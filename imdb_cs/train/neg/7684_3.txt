This film simply proves that not every film shot in the famous Hollywood days is worth seeing. Just because you have excellent cast occupation does not mean it can overcome the script that probably wrote the chimpanzee! Think about Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart, and it was still a bad movie! The basic premise of the film is not bad - a private psychiatric hospital, where the employees are more than sick! Also, the subplot with the husband and wife (Widmark and Graham) had a lot of promise. The screenplay was done with all the finesse and the oppression of the drunken buffalo - with military and over the top scenes again and again in the movie. In fact, it was less like drama and more like a very bad episode of "General Hospital". Subtle, this movie is not! Realistic, this movie is not! <br /> <br /> While most of the reasons why this movie was upset was a terrible scenario, but I also blame the producers for being and exploiting veteran actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be the name of a household, but this character actor has had extraordinary talent - especially when playing gangsters in Film Noir. Yet Stewart is occupied as a very unspeakable psychiatrist with some bizarre European accent - it just did not work because it was beyond his acting and his character was totally undeveloped and one-dimensional. Charles Boyer also looked hopelessly out of place. When they saw this beloved romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heart of America seemed bizarre. Overall, it's a pretty awful movie. It's very observable in the ruins of a train, but it's certainly not very nice. My wife and I did not have much of a movie, but they also felt it could be very good if writing was competent. PS - In the case of art imitating life, Oscar Levant played one of the patients. In real life, the brilliant Levant spent most of his life in and outside of the spiritual institutions.
