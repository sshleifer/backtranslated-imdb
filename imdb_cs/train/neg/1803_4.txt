Here is one of those educational short films that taught the unknowns about life facts. This time the target audience is preteen girls, the reality of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently has some sponsorship from Kotex. It begins by explaining how hormones bring you growth and development. Using animation and a female narrator shows us how the body works, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, and why it all leads to menstruation. It is almost awesome and it becomes a comic book on how to avoid sex. Even a word is never mentioned, even though "refined" passes once. I do not know why I saw it, but because it's one of those rare short films that could create an impression of innocent time, you might want to try it.
