I think I was attracted to this film, both because of the sound of the story and the lead actor, so I gave him a chance from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Sunday's Kelly (Heath Ledger), set up by the police, chief superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), is forced to go on a gang escape and go against them to clean up his own name and family. That's really all I can say about the story because I did not pay much attention to being honest. Orlando Bloom plays as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger does quite good performance for what's worth, and the movie has some interesting moments, especially with the gun fight at the end, but I can not say I enjoyed it because I did not look at it. Good!
