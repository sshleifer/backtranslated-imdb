There are three films with this animation style that I kindly remember from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "Dragon Flight" and "Hobbit." He owns copies of both "Dragons" and "Hobbits" (both excellent), and I have not seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. That was until today, and now I wish I did not. I was most worried about the script. He was incredibly choppy and often bad. Things would happen without reason, and other things would not happen without explanation. We are not just talking about small things; we are talking about key fence points! The story itself is not so great, but it could work if the script was decent. Not even close. Besides, the music was terrible! I know that music in movies like these rarely has what could be called classical pieces, but the music in this movie has made me unconscious to knock on a bowling ball. It was one of the films I wanted to show to my children, but it just ended. I do not think I could relive that crap. Disappointment is a slight one.
