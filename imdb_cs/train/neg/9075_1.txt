Slackers as the title in this film are three colleagues friends Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively) who are going to graduate without going through honest exams, but ending up successfully. It goes on until the very end when it is dissimilar, but the most famous character of Nathan (Schwartzman) tells what they have. Nathan starts blackmailing to deal with his fianc√© when he can not normally try. The only problem is when the trio begins to work on Dave falling in love with the beautiful and good heart of Angela (James King) Unfortunately, not brilliant genre. Schwartzman makes movie watching easy because his performance is brilliant. The king's performance is average, I think she was hired to be beautiful. Slackers reminds American pie in a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as in American cake. But are not all used? I think this film warns filmmakers of this genre that they are from originality. Overall, he has a few smiles, but a horror film about acting (except for Schwartzman) and the subject. * outside *****
