Despite being in a heavy rain, encounter with a drunk, as well as a gypsy and monkey organ house and a stay in a sanatorium, this Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, a short comedy short with the support of Buster Keaton and Al St John is just fun fun though it's quite funny the Arbuckle sequence in drag flirting with the Buster, it's the ultimate in the "meet the cute" scene, especially since it's one of the few that we see the Great Stone Face smile and laugh in the movies! Also, many scenes seem to have been modified by a jump, possibly due to the overuse of film material. Still, if you're Arbuckle or Keaton's compliment, good night, sister! it's definitely worth seeing.
