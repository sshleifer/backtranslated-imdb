From Director Barbet Schroder (Canceling Happiness), I think I saw it in my Media Studies class and recognized the lead actress, so I tried it despite the critics' assessment. Richard Haywood (Justin Pendleton) and Justin Pendleton (Bully Michael Pitt) work together to murder a random girl to think of themselves and find out if they can get them without the police finding it. Murder investigation is the murder of Cassie 'The Hyena' killer Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is quite disturbed by the evidence found on the scene, such as unrelated hairs. The plan does not seem to be all right, because Cassie and Sam have relatively quickly Richard or Justin as suspicious, it's just a question of whether they can turn them off. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Calling Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I see the same concept as Sir Roger Hitchcock's roar with the murder of a challenge, but this movie makes it very stupid, and not even a good Bullock can save him from being boring and predictable. Adequate!
