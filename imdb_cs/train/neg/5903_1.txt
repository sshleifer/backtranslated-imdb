I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and I thought it would be nice to see the places I know in the movie. I really knew I was going to get back to it, not to look at the inner jokes, so I was not surprised to sit with the deer in the sight of the headlamps. I was surprised by the fact that this film was the action of the ant-non-Mormons that were placed in this film. I know it's a film of Mormon who cared for members of the LDS church, but I've found a typical stereotype of people who are not their faith. Every non-Mormon who did not drink, smoked, and had a wonderful attitude to selfishness, why? <br /> <br /> That really ticked me on this movie, made the Mormons so clean, but the rest of Utah. I think it's filled with punk psychos just because they do not follow the LDS church scriptures. I can understand that the plots are rotating around all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was a 100% Mormon, which is not true either. And as I said, the non-Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunk, please! <br /> <br /> I think I just do not get it because I do not belong to their faith and I think it's never the will.
