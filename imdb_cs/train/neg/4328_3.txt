Every film titled "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed by the deaths of death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and everywhere in Germany. It may be an institution in the US, but in Europe it is practically unknown to a larger audience. "The National Holiday Lampoon is in Europe" is unlikely to remedy this situation. The detesting Griswalds are just that - terrifying. It's not funny. It is clear that Mr. Chevy Chase thinks he's funny, all Miss B.di Angelo has laughed a lot on her jokes, but she's paid for it and did not have to exchange £ 2.50 for a privilege. The part set in England is typical. The same old same old creators, Mrs. Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman, come from the same old old tired clichés, Mr. Chase is lost in the hotel corridor ... yawns, yawns, yawns .. Bucking - Big Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated that we've never seen bobi on wheels with two ......... red cheeks on a small chill - Dren, do I need to go on? Englishmen are princes, French crazy interpreters who are hated. The Germans are pompous and bloated, (do not mention the war, Clark) and the Italians lecherous of the lower pinscher. Did I forget something? Every possible "comic" situation is treated to death, Mr. Chase desperately sings, Miss Di Angelo sweetly spreads, children are embarrassingly bad. The fact that this franchise has been running for as long as it has done has to bring comfort to those who have suggested that you never lose money by undermining public taste.
