The review was lukewarm at best, while expectations were high: a high budget, plenty of popular faces, a rather funny idea, and the main actor everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's allegedly humorous journey into the world of fantasy will fail in any way to entertain her audience (I have not heard a single laugh throughout the presentation), going through its string of storyline and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign of the spell she wished. 90 minutes of movies are sterile in clumsy direction and some good actors do their best to come as professionals in a position that certainly could not seem like a great idea on the scene, let alone paper. "L'Odysseus d'Alice Tremblay" is a comic sketch of collages, combined with a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or bore you pursuing.
