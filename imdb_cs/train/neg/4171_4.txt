I spent this title 15 or 20 times when I was in Blockbuster and I was looking for something that would be decent to watch. All I can say is that at night I chose to be all in the middle of decent films. I think it's better than Dracula 3000, but it's pretty easy to say, because that was not Caper Van Dien. Other things he lacked were interesting cast, interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I assume you can not have everything. *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The loss of the crew of vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ... go to the number), flew past a mining colony to a mining colony and tried to exterminate all the vampires he found. The crew consists of: a magnificent captain who dies early, his unfinished first mate, said vampire vampire hunter (not a typo), a crazy cowboy and REALLY, REALLY butch Asian commando, a "hard man" woman ... it sounds almost like a cast for MTV 'The Real World'. After the captain died in a violent confrontation with the crowd of bloodshed (and as it turned out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy), his first friend took over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him. blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but as I said it's the same story used in about a hundred other "movies" of this genre. The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside in this film is behind me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was quite hot, but of course, if you expect her to reveal more than just her cleavage, look elsewhere. I can not say it was the worst movie I've ever seen since I really rented Starship Troopers 2, but wait until this guy comes to the Sci-Fi Channel.
