The Power Rangers, a totally terrible show of children from the 90's, continue to disrupt small children by being totally muscular and horrible. <br /> <br /> This show was not fun, it was an excuse for kids to fight each other to solve their differences. Toys were other demonstrations to promote violent television shows and such. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to find out what the purpose of this absolutely absurd show has ever been. As such, it remains one of the worst children's demonstrations ever made.
