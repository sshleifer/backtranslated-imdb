Excuse me. Someone has to say it. This is really a boring movie. LAD BAK funkaly close close I almost wept with boredom when I watched her. The game is pretty awesome, narrative and predictable story, score and camera work are completely standard and harsh. It's one of those movies you can not hate (because it's disabled), but I hate it, I think almost everyone does. Interestingly, the critics were kind enough to this film. I suppose they should not be objective either. It was awarded to receive awards - which I remember doing properly. But it was neither interesting nor funny. I did not see the game so I can not compare it.
