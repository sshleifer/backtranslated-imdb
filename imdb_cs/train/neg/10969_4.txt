Maybe I'm obsolete or just do not know what Electra is in the current publications ... But the Electra I read was much more manipulative and always looks like she has a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work, and more often than a double cross. Just when you think you've made it all up, she drew the wave over her eyes and got into her way. This film was rather weak in the dialogue, the talk was not very convincing, and the action was dirty. I was really looking for something else in the form of Frank Miller's "Electra Assassin" book. Which is much darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> A special effect when it was cool was something interesting at times, but more often than the story and plot were slow or illogical. That hand was not terrible, and Electra was not ... pretty fanatical. It's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story I did not care.
