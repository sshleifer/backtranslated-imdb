The biggest hit National Lampoon remains "animal house", and right. It was funny, daring and adventurous. The exact opposite of every national film Lampoon. Including "class meeting". <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this confused mess. This gathering is about as joyous as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> One Star and it's generous. Then I always thought most of my old classmates were also demons, vampires, and serial killers.
