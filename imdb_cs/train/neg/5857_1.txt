WWF Survivor Series 2001 It was one of the worst events in 2001. Perhaps its biggest defect was the fact that it was not consistent with most of the previous Survivor Series. There was only one series that survived. And this Survivor Series game lasted 45 minutes. What's more, someone with a working brain would know that it would end up with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock prevailing for his team. And do not let me start with the preview before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that no one was going to die. There was no need for all that ridiculous hype. Whatever it was, it was just a match. As for other matches, the first match was a Christian who defended his European title against Al Snow. It was a good quick match and his good to see heel winning the match fairly. William Regal versus Tajiri was boring and we saw it 2 or 3 times before. Edge versus Test was good, but nothing great. The steel cage titles mark was the best match of the evening. The Royal Battle continued for 10 minutes and no one really cared who would win first. The women's match was not great. No, not at all. The main event must be the most hypocritical match in history. The Alliance lost, but guessed what after five months each superstar alliance returned. The match itself was bad. The rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho excluded 2. The rock was too caught up in its talk of being there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who threatened the whole game. If I wanted any 2 to be expelled in the early stages, it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, the Grand Show and the Undertaker were just masters. 7 matches are not enough for the Survivor Series. If such a criminal is ever so bad, I will
