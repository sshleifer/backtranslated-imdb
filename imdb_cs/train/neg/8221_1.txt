This movie is trying to track a low-budget genre with hand-held cameras that have proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one will fail and how. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many so-called "awards" of this piece of rubbish has been smeared on the envelope ..... it just asks you what these critics were on when they actually put it .... /> Words they can not describe how truly horrible a movie really is. Seriously, that's bad. I looked at it in 20 minutes flat, almost continuously fast forward. From garbage lighting to terrible overhead, grainy visuals to dampened sound and, of course, not forgetting that ABYSMAL is acting, it was a completely and completely pathetic piece of so-called filmmaking. It's serious, it has no redeemed qualities - at all. Save money and watch a decent budget for horror, there's a lot - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC to name just a few people. <br /> <br /> Avoid all these garbage. Do not use unnecessary money or time for this piece of waste that pretends to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Take note of all the other comments! You were warned!
