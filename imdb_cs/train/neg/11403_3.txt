I love horror movies, low budget, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s ... but how can anyone think it's a very good horror film? compare them to titles in similar films of indigenous homes. walk, change, shining. or for a similar technological horror film that was FAAAR better, (though still from FAR from the great) Demon Seed. OK, I'll be fair ... compare it to horror films made for television! do not go to sleep .. waaay creepier and better done. selling stuff, night stalker, night galleries, even going down to the basement or the haystack farm, was much better. * SPOILERS * Firstly, because it's such a good scene as a bloody shower scene, you have a scene as an introductory scene .. oh boy! the garden hose comes alive to expose some hideous teenagers! GRAPES. also what we understand about the house .. apparently needs to use their camcorders to see what is going on, and it's a very emotional house. not a ghost, a demon or an entity, it's a house that's "obsessed", but what? are we led to the assumption that the inanimate subject has learned to love suzie / margaret, our protagonist? now that I'm on the topic of suzie .. another scene that has completely disturbed me, this poor old crazy lady comes, tells you that she is your sister, pours out her heart, falls into the boiling pool, fights in agony for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? risking her hands to be burned to save this poor old woman who came there to warn her life? no, she stands and looks! it's mostly better than average for a horror film, but that's where the positives end up. for the least interesting and entertaining horror film about the inanimate object that kills people who look at the bed of death: the bed she eats. I feel that the people who rated this could not see much either because they originally broadcast it, or they remembered how frightening it was like children. this movie was much less meritous.
