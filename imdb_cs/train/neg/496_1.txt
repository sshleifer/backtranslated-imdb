Imagine that you are a high school student, in the back of a dark, troubled theater with my girlfriend. What bad movie should you feel compelled to leave the theater and go home before it ends? This movie is so bad. Really. Movies are often so bad they are good; this film is at this stage of badness. It's painfully bad. Horribly, horribly, the crime against humanity is bad.
