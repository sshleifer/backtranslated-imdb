Spooky are nice baskets that contain some well-directed sequences, ridiculous charts and dialogues and a third. <br /> <br /> The American version shares weak silly land, but executions are much smoother, sexier and I think expensive. Some people describe a faint comedy as a "fine comedy". <br /> <br /> This is a fine spy storyline, the exact opposite of what John Le Carre created. <br /> <br /> Give me Smiley every day.
