I was wrong awake last night watching this thing. The only thing I could say about this terrible film is that it could use film schools to show how to do it. No proper character development, wait, I'm not sure even that they are characters. Set-ups were hokey and sad, and overuse of the split screen was useless, because sometimes they could not even synchronize with alternating shots. If I could give it a zero or a minus rating. It is sad that it is not time for a few laughs. It's just a sad example of the money Hollywood has shed, and now I'm spending time even though I think about it.
