Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, was murdered with his wife by his co-workers. His twins, Chad and Alex, are divided. 25 years later, Chad, the Los Angeles karate engineer, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge the murder of their parents and legitimately ask for a tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich worked together as they had previously done "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films that feature Van Damme playing double roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" are others). The plot is very simplistic to take revenge story, the movie is the only redemption of the Van Damme function as two very different people? a boy rich in predators and a rough, dirty cigar, a tough cigar. Van Damme does not do a very good job in one role, though Alex's taking it is a little fun. It is mysterious that the brothers are mistaken for each other, wearing different clothes and different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung was a good officer for the officers.
