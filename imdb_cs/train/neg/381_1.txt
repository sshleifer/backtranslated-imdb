This movie is a traditional Bollywood fare as far as starry power, sentimentality and the love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me was the absurd notion of a replacement mother. A child who has a child with a child after sex with a man (a family looking for a child) is not a substitute mother. She is not a good candidate for a replacement mother. I have seen Indian movies and television shows that have been more intelligent about 10 to 15 years ago. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely unlikely. I realize that most of the films with dirty objects are not meant to be plausible, but they do not even pretend they are not. This movie wants us to emulate with the characters, but this can not be done with such an absurd, fictitious conflict. I would be better off Abbas and Mustan.
