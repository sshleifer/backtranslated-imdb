1 is very generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, even though it's not really BOOGEYMAN promoted on DVD packaging and we all know it! She climbed me. But this movie is something else. For being guided by a guy who has been a long time and driving a lot of movies, it looks like he was shot on a VHS camcorder for 10 years! Story and acting are unfortunate! David Hess, you left me too. After you played one of the most endangered villains in the movie, did you get used to it? Story and acting could be forgiven, however, if someone had time to make the video look somewhat professionally. There are lots of shots that do not look like movies, or at least not so obvious, that it gets worse from your movie. I can not say that this is the worst movie ever, because I could not overcome the whole movie, but it is definitely close.
