I recently watched this film at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival and be honest that these were the worst movies I've ever had to watch unhappy. Do not get me wrong, fun and fun bad movies (like "Manos' Hands of Destiny") and then horrible bad movies. (This category falls into the second category). Cinematography was incredible and was not good. It seemed to me that the cameraman had deliberately left everything out of focus (except for a free-of-charge shot), lighting was something between "one guy around with a bulb" and "nonexistent". The actors were just as bad as soap actors, but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line is completely surprised for them. The only redemption was the look of a camouflaged killer, the classic look and la Jason Vorhees of "Friday 13". The plot was extremely poor and the end was even worse. I would recommend this film to anyone who needs an example of how a horror movie should look, or perhaps sleeplessness that needs sleep.
