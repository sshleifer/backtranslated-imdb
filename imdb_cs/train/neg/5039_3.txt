Rex Reed once said about the movie ("Julia and Julia" being specific) that it looked like it was shot with pomegranate juice. I was reminded of this when I snored the Purple Butterfly. This story was boring, and it did not help that for much of the scenes of actors' faces they were virtually unblocked, or would only appear for long periods of time. <br /> <br /> Also, everyone looked the same, so it was hard to distinguish between the characters. I call the syndrome of dead poets. No one cared, no one was dramatically interested, and movies were not interested in the historical light of a very interesting period and set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> Complete disappointment.
