This film is nothing but "Office Space" except for the assumptions. Office Space was cheerful. I would not be making this film to anyone because I did not smile during the whole movie. Lord Cornbluth is a suicidal thirst fast becoming more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to see this movie, use a free rental or you can check it out in someone else's home so you can go away if needed.
