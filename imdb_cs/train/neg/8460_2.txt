I only rented the film because of the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that when I see the name RR on the cover (as an actor) that this movie will be good. Sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would do if he'd borrowed it before it was right? BASIC INTENTIONAL LAW. Far worse editing than "Manos's Hand of Fate". The way it was modified made no sense and made the film impossible to follow, and after the first 30 minutes you would not even want to try to watch it. I do not know how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, maybe someone owes them, but they're good for it. Besides, they were just a few minutes in this film and Rodriguez did not even say. So if you want to see a movie with bad editing, bad acting and a confusing story than being my guest, but do not say you have not been warned.
