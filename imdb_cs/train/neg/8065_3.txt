Steve Carpenter can not make horror films. First, casting was very bad for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown girl from the Buffy Vampire murderer. These films do not have gore (usually a key component of horror film), no action, no action, no tension (also a key component). Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and simple that he's sad. It was a couple of parts to be entertaining (continue the teen horror / comedy movies) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought this movie was rated R, and I did not pay attention and I realized it was changed to PG-13. Anyway, check out this movie, if you liked, I still know what you did in the summer. This is the only type of person who could find the movie even frightening at a distance. And seriously, this is for you Steve Carpenter, stop doing horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
