And that's the only reason I own this DVD. Now I did not see the first Nemesis movie, but I checked the information from him and I say here: What? Why? Because in the first film Alex was a man. But the first one was set in the future so maybe this Alex is brand new and the scientist just happens that this time he's doing Alexa's wife. Who knows, at least it was not in the film in any way. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief overview of the plot: Alex, the baby then (or whatever you want, as it was, is in the future) escapes with a mother using a special time boat and ends in the 80s of Africa. There is a mother killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. Then the trunk will kill a cyborg from the future, and then Alex runs and hides and finally kills a cyborg. So there. Sounds good, is not it? "The Terminator is not the only film that is torn here but also its predecessor, and I think the first Fly movie, Vincent Price One, gets special nominations to provide a solid base for building your cyborg. <br /> <br /> It allows Okay, the movie was a fairly standard small budget, but it had bad special effects for the mid 90th movie, it would look good as if it were the 80s The biggest problem is the conspiracy. Nemesis 2 is not the smartest cinematography I've enjoyed (?), To watch, but it's going to be damn near, I'm not gonna say anything about acting because we'll be honest: did anyone expect Oscar to perform here? ... at least I found Sue Price hot in the Amazon warfare and a "real" movie rating: 2/10 There is not a lot of quality professionals above all, and despite the very basic scenario of the film itself it makes little sense of it. Film rating of the campsite: 4/10 I had the occasional laughter of the film's utter badness, so it has little deserving of it.
