The first half hour of the film had a steady pace and introduced figures. but suddenly everything went too fast, the fragile reason for Akshey Kumar to date for 3 girls, very loud when he acted as both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the pinnacle of the film, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. overall, this film was the biggest disappointment that the film does not have the justice of its trailer. save money and watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hunga again! <br /> <br /> summarizing it: a cheap scene shows the performance and appearance of the film no story or substance, the plot was exceptionally non-feel good music from Preetama Man who bought us Dhoom! hold it! the film was filmed in one room, the new guides (female cast) were all right because it was their first film but founding actors such as Akshey and John completely disappointed by the director as Priyadarshan gives his worst film ever!
