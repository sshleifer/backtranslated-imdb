Unlike another reviewer, I think it's well written, especially it's more imaginative because it requires more imagination; and it was good because there were no other characters to share the focus of these monologues in a dozen minutes and plus. But such serious, pious memories simply do not bother me. Everybody has to tell the story and some are more interesting than others. Everybody has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, not very atypical stories and issues that illustrate what life (or part of it) is for the film. Again, I think I'm wrong with the TV reality show. So if it's your bag, you may like it. This is what would be good for phones and / or internet gossip; but absolutely without verbal action. And although each of the speakers is female, I leave this gender outside.
