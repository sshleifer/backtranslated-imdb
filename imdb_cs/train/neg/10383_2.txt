This can be one of the most enjoyable movies anytime, unless you take it seriously. It's a little dated and the effects are lame, but it's so nice. There are giant crabs that attack the girl. and crabs sing the Japanese. It's terribly bad. And the end that has been telegraphed throughout the movie is terribly awesome. Predictable, but when you see the ultimate struggle, you will be left in place. Do not even give this movie a chance and you will love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes she looks naked. Her daughter is not quite good, but a giant crab is attacking her. These are the size of big cats. This is 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for fun, I give it 7. Did I mention that they are a giant crab?
