I do not think it's a bad movie. Unfortunately, for me, I feel that the more you know about fencing, the worse it is simply because it becomes completely unrealistic. I have been fenced since I was 14 years old, and this film is very bad. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some fencing background), but most other actors - especially students - seem to be lost.
