I'm a fan of art films, but with regret, I have to report that this film is demanding. The aggressively slow development of a nonexistent plot based on a promising assertion, the experience is, let's say, try. Even after bad movies, I feel he has learned something or enjoyed some aspect, but there was nothing he would appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends. The game was fine, but the characters were totally boring. The protagonist, who focuses on such a bold goal, is heavily empty. Damage. I usually like films that are informal, but the lack of formulation should not be confused with zero content.
