Underground Comedy Movie is perhaps the worst wreck I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this film and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch again that he was so terrible, but he had to show me how horrible it is. I love the color of the comedy. I thought it would have been and I would have enjoyed it. No, instead, the acting was so horrible that "jokes" were extremely profound, and the plot was not where to find. Perhaps it should not be a conspiracy, so I can not argue against it. It's quite sad when the funniest thing in comedy is an old woman who has a bat hit head ..... Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform that has a bat. Hilarious. Just a genius. I feel like I'm watching the movie that it happened to be its creators and hysterically laughing at him. Perhaps it was full of inner jokes we just did not understand. Or perhaps it is the worst piece of waste ever made and should be locked in the vault and thrown into the Arctic Ocean. Do not buy this movie!
