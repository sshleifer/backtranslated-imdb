What a terrible waste! Who are all these people who are working on how good it is? Yes, it is "art"; and yes, it's "alien", but ... that's not enough. The plot is boring and incoherent, like real estate shows, but not so slickly. <br /> <br /> People are basically uninteresting; but as characters do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, then they like it very much. Very violence (and some of them very violent) seems ostentatious and unjustified. It's like a producer's vision of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think too much about him. And yes yes: If I had such neighbors, I would move!
