This movie can be judged from three aspects: history, like the Amin profile, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It does not succeed as a story, when it comes to crawling the coup d'Ã©tat that has begun Obote, the expulsion of the Asians, and has Entebbe hi-jack as a background, but not in any chronologically consistent timeframe. <br /> <br /> As a profile of Aminu, it could be interesting because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good and if it was a better movie, he would get Oscar. (He got it - which proves that the Oscars do not watch the movies they vote on). Ignoring relevant historical episodes in the novel that watched Amine and Ugandan history from a doctor's point of view. Instead, he tells of the fictitious story of a Scottish doctor and his ruthless life from the perspective of Amin. But the narrative story is the only incident from which Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller there is no plot to hold it together. The beginning is tense - with the film, film freedoms appear, but the story is based. The character of a doctor is well defined, but he loses himself in the second half of the film that suffers as a result. Why does a doctor decide to stay in Kampala is misinterpreted - seduced by power? Why not care for anyone is strange. The character of a friend in the novel was lost because the Scotsman has a matter instead of a black physician - a sad embarrassment that does not seem to be easy to believe, but allows filmmakers to show Amina's wildness near the hand. The man named Horse bit at the end is pure. <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1971, Uganda was on the left side, not so correct, the dials were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the tusks? <br /> <br /> In short - if you have never heard of Amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate playing Forest Whitaker, but the last hour will make you confused. If you know that Uganda or you have read a book - you do not see a movie - it will just suppress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so dirty - he was not.
