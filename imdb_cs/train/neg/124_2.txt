This movie was probably inspired by Godard's man, a feminine, and I urge you to see the movie. The film has two strong elements and they are (1) realistic acting (2) impressive, undesirable good, photo. In addition, the infinite stream of stupidity is most affected by me. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this movie ... it's unattractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality was replaced by stupidity. Without going too close to this topic, I would say that this stems from the difference in ideals between the French and Swedish societies. The film of your time and place. 2/10.
