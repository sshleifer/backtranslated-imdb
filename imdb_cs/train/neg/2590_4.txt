The American pie drove away from the first. At first I believe that actors have no idea what they are doing, and instead it's just a remake of college. The story sets out that two young colleagues (representing a young stifler) are telling dreams of attending college just to experience a late night party, sex and, of course, booze. The story is stupid and goes further than the original cake. In fact, they have never seen an apple pie anymore. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video rental and can rent for free. Keep in mind, however, that it's a waste of time unless you have insignificant sexual movies with absolute nudity and mad drinking. I'm a teenager myself, and I believe Evan Almighty would be a better choice instead.
