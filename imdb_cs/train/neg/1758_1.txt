If you have not seen it yet, I say, go ahead, walk through the park, do not waste your time. Even script or acting does not pay money. * Spoilers * - Can not decide what's worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very controversial, I hope it can improve over time. The story is incredible. Free Cannon An American policeman fights with criminals in Europe on his own? Infamous Slavic Mafia protected by just two hunks ??? Emotional artistic teacher leading unscrupulous gang ??? Spanish policeman executive dumber than sack hammer ??? Give me a break. But this movie is just one good thing: At least the cost of production must be less than the "Oceanic 12", which was just as pointless and over the top as this one.
