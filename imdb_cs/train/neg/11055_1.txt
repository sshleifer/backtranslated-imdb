I just watched this high resolution movie on TV. I'm in a wheelchair because of a neuromuscular disorder and I'm looking forward to seeing some of the films about those with physical disabilities. At first I found the main character somewhat sublime and captivating. His report on people with disabilities and the life he spent in the fight to recognize and integrate the disability into the mainstream labor market is great. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is utterly hypocritical and diametrically different from the message itself that preached that I offended him. <br /> <br /> First, they did not find anyone in the main role with real physical disability. Sure, they were competent actors, but it seems to be totally unfair to preach to hire people with disabilities and then NOT TO ACCEPT INCREST for anything in the movie. It was further complicated by the fact that in one scene in the middle of a movie, one is seen walking on a cowgirl stage and seems to have only one leg. But CGI in this scene is so obvious that it's shameful. What? Could not find any real amputated anywhere for the movie? For a 5 second shot, it was financially better to handle CGI effects than just CURRENT ACTUATION amputees? At that moment in the movie, I found out that it was so fraudulent and against the message that she was trying to explain that I came here to a bitch and yawn about it, like the poor cripple I am.
