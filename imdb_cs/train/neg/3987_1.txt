I left very few movies before it's over, but I could not finish this waste. This was the greatest burden of racism that tried to assert itself as a legitimate film since the birth of the nation. The figures were a bit more than cardboard cutouts. I do not see an actor want to have his name associated with this movie. Lee must have better things to make that waste. I know that I and somebody with my brain have better things to do ... like watching the color dry. I wish someone would make a film about interracial relations that they were realistically involved in. There is much more depth on this subject of shallow ranting of a bitter director like Lee.
