Although I recently put this on my 10 worst film, I must say that it's probably not worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or one of the "Look Who's Talking" sequels. Still, it is quite enthusiastic, even with sexy Drew Barrymore, who plays something about Holly Golightly's horror movie, who moved from New York to Los Angeles but found her pursuing a murderous look. Poor Sally Kellerman, a magnificent actress celebrating in the 1970s, is reduced to a small supporting role, and leading Barrymore George Newbern is the worst kind of sitcom actor who laughs after each line. The picture is full, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts a showmanship, and the identity of the psycho (though from the episode "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But as for the final ... it's real! Who had to clean it up? * z ****
