I never really liked the movie Myra, so I appreciate how he pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Miss Welch's costume has certainly become an iconic image, though I have to ask if many people who recognize the picture actually saw the film and knew what it was all about. <br /> <br /> For several years Myra shifted to the FMC and did not think the summer would get better. It's about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comics segment, where it's a good idea to place such big stars in what was a huge production at that time. However, IMHO, the film is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be turned on, and so busy trying to shock that it does not inform, does not care, nor does it work ---
