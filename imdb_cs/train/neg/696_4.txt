Eh, it's not a strange adventure. So it works, effects, decent, but familiar and unconscious soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In close connection there are three deaths close to the beginning of the movie, which lead to a fairly good scene in which everything seems to go. Besides, a lot of characters walk around, they do not know what's going on or they're chasing after the red sleighs; more killing time than people. There are more deaths, and the killer is a killer with the same opportunities, not just one of the instruments. The killer also likes to make other people kill other innocent people. Identity is not revealed to the end and the motif is pretty thin and we really do not care. It is claimed that the film takes place around Christmas, but this is not an important factor. One scene illuminates Christmas lights, that's probably it. The film is somewhat dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the video tape I watched. Some of the dialogues have lost a bit in some of the opening scenes. The end should be stronger than it was. We think we are aware of what has happened, although there is a chance that something else has happened.
