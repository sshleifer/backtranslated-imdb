Becky Harris plays a female shopper whose misfortune is to be in the shop at the wrong time and apparently only the purpose of giving in this movie is to give reason to wear the remote control! Miss Harris seems to be older in her fifties when she comes to the scene for the first time. As soon as she becomes a red-brown robber, it is obvious that she is not the AARP queen. If it is not the best quality ever seen on celluloid, I want someone to let me. I think it was absolutely breathtaking and I literally wore a copy of VHS capturing her charm. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. The rest of this movie is really not worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and intelligent, but I was disappointed with both counts. God bless Becky Harris!
