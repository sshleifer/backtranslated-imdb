What the hell was that. Someone apparently read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We've got existential anxiety mixed with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each was canceled by terrible music, CGI or gaming. The problem with strange stories like this is that they feel lazy. Even the work of David Lynch feels at times and, just like his interesting shows and movies, it's been running for too long. And unfortunately this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was appealing, and that's the limit. I suppose it touches the feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but it simply does not mean that the characters are friendly enough to be able to care for their destinies ... whatever they are. The last scene leaves the whole thing unambiguous.
