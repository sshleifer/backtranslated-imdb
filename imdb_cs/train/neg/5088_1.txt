The guy has no idea about the cinema. Well, he seems to have made some interesting theater productions in his youth, and perhaps two acceptable films, which have been successful for more political reasons, have made them cheating on Communist censorship. All this is very good, but look carefully: I DO NOT KNOW YOUR JOB! The scenes are unbalanced, without a proper start, and with disordered content and full emptiness. She has nothing to say about the subject, and so she overpowers the violence, nudity and tongue troughs. How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten body that never understood anything about the cinematographic profession and art? Why did they let him submit?
