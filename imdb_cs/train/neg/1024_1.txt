I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with relatively strong expectations. the movie has a great cast and closes at the festival so it must be good, right? how bad I was. <br /> <br /> I knew we had a problem when the director talked about the fact that when he directed the episode of the wise, he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (director / writer of the wise, debut = blah). and the director / writer Edison must have some incriminating pictures of the kevin cosmic killing of the homeless because I do not see how (along with the other actors in the movie) he ever agreed to be in this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is totally awful! it's a mixture of every hard boiled clich√©. Edison is nothing new. acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like the above-mentioned episode of the wise. this was the best movie I've ever seen. Some examples of just bad stupid moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment without reason for rock and roll music ... justin timberlake gets creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj drive a vintage firebird. .. 3 men are shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> This film is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> STAY FROM EDISON!
