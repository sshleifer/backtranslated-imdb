this movie has everything; dexterity of the "warmth", the explosive effect of the bruckheimer jerry film, the funny dialogue of the tarantino script, and the epic feeling of saying "godfather"> <br /> The judge will again mark the character of the fire temperememt, but also shows real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me that robert de niro depicts the jazz motto in a furious bull. The action scenes are really breathtaking, not because bullit has a film depicting such high octane but stylish scenes. Special effects sharpen the boundaries of technology and filmmaking at their borders. Independent day set the standard that clearly fulfilled this film and surpassed it significantly. Overall, great acting from the game list (like the oscars night party invitation!), Classic Locations, Snap Action, and a tight script.
