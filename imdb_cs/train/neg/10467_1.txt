If a bad film ever ringing out about how a stupid human being might be ringing, he would take the prize. The plot focuses on biblical prophecy, which consists of hidden messages of scriptures that call on a group of power robbers to try to take full control of the world. How stupid does this writer believe people really are? <br /> <br /> It was bad. Casper Van Dien lost his talent doing this film. Michael York's work was just for this role because she was the center of the film and she was doing a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was sick and very worrying. No immature or immature mind should see this movie. This is the way the basic principle of good vs. evil slip. <br /> <br /> There must be a lot of mental illness floating around movie circles looking for ways to sell this type of junk mail. There had to be something censored to get the PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
