I expected a bad movie and I got a bad movie. But in my worst fantasies I could not imagine how bad this movie is. I do not even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about. It's not about surfing in the blood, but about a big crocodile. They complain of a fake shark in the Clover, but Spielberg was wise, and the shark did not show until the end. Here is a crocodile shown many times and it is the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen and does not try to hide. If you want to see good fake crocodiles watch Lake Placid. The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark film, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the chance to make an original surfing film, but he wanted to make a monster. So you understand how bad the movie is, does it have some good parts? In fact, it is not a nudity and a sexual scene that takes place directly from a playboy movie. Also, acting is not bad, and Kate Fischer looks good. It was a shame she did not take her to the top. Leading actors are not bad either. They had some potential. The site was beautiful and the movie started well with some beautiful surfing scenes. Blame is on an unrelated writer and director. Dialogue is one of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really badly written, and the director has no talent, neither what ever, nor much fancy. it. Even if you want to look at the beautiful Kate Fischer. It is not worth it. Watch the sirens to watch Kate naked, and watch Lake Placid if you want a good step of the crocodiles. 3/10 because I'm in a good mood and Maureen Larrazabal looks naked and Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi have done a good job with what they had to do.
