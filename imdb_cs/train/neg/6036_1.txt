If they play an unknown cast that seems likely to stay that way, this movie is "another" cheap movie slasher that amazes me as it was released. I have no problem with the horror and movement of slasher, in fact, it's my favorite. But when TOBE's done, it's really a monkey coming in and it's no wonder the genre is so tough. The story is like a clich√© and without imagination, as far as possible, with a group of people in the cabin outdoors in the forests that are destroyed and hacked by this zombie / spirit guy. This is not the story that sucks most, about his crazy acting and dial, home overhead, and a terrible soundtrack. Not to mention ridiculous effects and unbelievably lazy filmmaking - these fools are out in bright daylight, but are we going to believe it is the night? What the hell was the director saying about this? What, he only had one day to shoot this? Was he afraid of the darkness? (It is cheerful when I see a policeman walking in the clear daylight with a torch that behaves as if his black, though) I think the positive character for the actor is that they look like people who work in a local supermarket would at least be able to escape from this movie without ever noticing them. I'm sure one of the "teens" is playing bingo in the local pub - but it's 40-45. Anyway, good for laughs, but for another loss of film and time.
