The only thing that The First Power really is about is that Jeff Kober offers him the opportunity to play one of his beautiful types of psychotic villains he has done so well in the past 25 years. Kober is a dignified successor to Lyle Bettger, who in the 1950s specialized in these parts. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough, The First Power is a concerted slasher film that Lou Diamond Phillips is useless as a LAPD detective specializing in serial killer hunting. Kober is his latest catch, but Kober is in a low-power league and they are going to the team and make Lou a life miserable for him. Even after Kober gets the gas chamber, his spirit returns to all forms. <br /> <br /> Mykelti Williamson is at hand as Lou's partner who meets an unpleasant end, including the demon-possessed horse and Tracy Griffith's psychological and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with thumbnails are about to help Lou. Will he fight other forces? When the movie ends, you will not worry. Lou really got trapped in Turkey. Perhaps the devil made him shoot this movie.
