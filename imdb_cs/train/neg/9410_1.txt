Until you can suffer! If you like watching people, lifting, dressing, showering, preparing dinner, watching, sex in the dark and back to bed ... if you like shiny flats, narrow kitchen bedrooms, long minutes of silence ... if you do not like two hours, bored with the excitement of "real intimate fake art," then you will like it. But if not, try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "While you're here," but do we want to stay? This German film was awarded the Torino gay festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision because the festival introduced a number of talented films. Maybe be nice to the Germans, because they often do not get awards? Well, "Life of others" it ... but this is great, but not gay. So maybe it's a fashion question. Are the Germans again "in"? No matter what? Or perhaps for Hustler's view of some directors?
