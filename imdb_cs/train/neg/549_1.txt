I can not believe that the Indian film industry still has such a tremor as Waqt. For beginners, is the story unlikely? the spoiled son is thrown out of the family home to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does she do? He immediately wins some national talent competition by doing some stellar jumps in front of the judges panel (I honestly do not have jokes here). Meanwhile, his father is dying of lung cancer, but he keeps it from a secret son, but survives to see his son become famous to see his new grandson and also make a new toy with giraffe. <br /> <br /> Is the courage in rank? no effort has been made to get any of the major players in this movie to act convincingly. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge estate, and seemed to be relatively untouched by the worries of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main defeat when such ugly films are made are intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a movie. Actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will still be considered God's people who have nothing but a blind faith in Bollywood.
