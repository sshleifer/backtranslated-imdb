This movie is bad. It has a terrible taste and is hidden and unconvincing in the script, although it is supposedly based on real events - which adds nothing but worsens it. Direction is not done well, because scenes and dialogue are out of place. You do not know what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. Beginning, Williams is not convincing as a homosexual in the collapse of relationships, nor is an interesting relationship. What is worse, his character is forced by a nasty pedophile story that is the foundation and no place as a plotting device. You've got older Rory Culkin, who carelessly picks up "d_ck_smker" - in good fun - which is pretty unpleasant and then laughs with Williams character. Finally, you have Sandra Oh as an advisor to the Angel Guardian of Williams and set off to explain the whole fiasco to the end. Toni Collete's character is simply uncomfortable and re-hash of her 6th Sense performance with a poorer direction. Very missing.
