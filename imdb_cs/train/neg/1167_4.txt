I really tried to enjoy this movie, but in the end it just did not work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura's outputs and found it very variable. Live, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some skillful sequences and a lot of creativity. However, these properties are in a painfully short delivery in Alive. The plot is fine unless it's all original and it could have done for a nice movie ace. Unfortunately, this stimulation is painfully slow and the movie takes longer than it gets to quite predictable places. The action is just jumping, the final fight is pretty cool and the former is fine. The former is also thwarted by the too-fast camera, which leads to less coherence. There are some elegant visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue, but the film still stretches badly. Characters are neither well-decorated nor well-functioning and settings and the general color scheme is rough and boring. The movie is not quite terrible and has some interesting points, perhaps the easy use of the fast forward button can improve it. About twenty minutes, which could be ruled out, could be quite a decent scifi thriller. Full length movie is boring. It is recommended only to very patient and determined Kitumura fans.
