There is nothing worse than renting an Asian film and getting an American movie experience. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but the good thriller is dependent on creating sympathetic, intelligent characters. As far as likability is concerned, the protagonists in Say Yes are quaint spouses. Nice done. Unfortunately, they are stupid for faith. We figure out how badly terrorized by stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After the hitchhiker threatens to kill you, make sure you tell him which hotel you are in when you leave him. <br /> <br /> 2. Avoid hell from the stalker in wide daylight and dozens of witnesses, so let him blame for the attack. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not try to tell the policemen about the stalker and simply assume that the police officers were blamed against him. <br /> <br /> 4. When trying to escape, leave your lady as far as possible to ensure her stalker has kidnapped her. <br /> <br /> 5. After receiving help from someone who is looking for a stalker after kidnapping your wife, make sure you send them as soon as possible so you can face one on one. It does not make sense to be unfair, is not it? <br /> <br /> Now I would never expect someone to be immune to making a few mistakes in these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many incredible mistakes that it's practically impossible for viewers to take care of their safety because they are the victims of their own actions. It kills the whole movie's enjoyment. <br /> <br /> If you were interested, the screenwriters did not stop with dark figures. Since they are sure to be silenced for writing this shit, they have decided to make the situation so absurdly unreal, that all sense of reality comes out of the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Stalker kills a policeman inside a police station? while the protagonist sleeps no more than ten feet. <br /> <br /> 2. Stalker deals with all sorts of dubious activities in the broad daylight and around tons of people, but no one other than a married couple seems to notice their special behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. Stalker survives the absurd amount of violence that would kill a human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The scenes "tense" had no imagination at all. In fact, some scenes came from American films. The only positive thing is decapitation near the end, which was a pretty brutal scene because it was caused by a woman. It's a bad thing the creators followed it with a terribly stupid end that comes out of the left field. Koreans really think they say "say" should be ashamed of themselves. Better yet, they should simply move to California and work with people who make movies with similar disrespect for quality and intelligence.
