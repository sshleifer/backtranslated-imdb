Despite the English title, it seems that this has little to do with Devils and is much more related to the powerful hungry ruler who is looking for Philospher's stone and wants gold made of lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little problem with the fact that people are dying when they think they endanger their position or when they need virgins for their blood. In essence, he is inclined by his love and alchemist he employs, and it is more greed and madness that seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting as jousting and adult men try to knock one another down with big sticks, and the film at least has a good look at it, but otherwise there is little to recommend. A bit in the way of a gore and nothing that does not even have to worry about, and most unusual, for Molina / Nascha, not really any unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
