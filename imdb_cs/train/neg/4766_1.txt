you can say that you have spent $ 5 doing this.it is a waste of time ... ugh .. there is nothing remotely good about this movie ..... i do not know why i still watched it .. the cat is not hot. scary acting .. you can do anything and make better use of your time .. like watching TV playing dirty video games .. I feel robbed. just robbing .. my time. I've never evaluated the movie before you could probably say it but I felt like I needed to save the poor souls who were going to watch it and looked at the IMDb earlier to see if it was decent and looking at the comments . - there was no action - no hot girl - - no budget - -shittttttttttttttttttty concert - screaming a bad movie. **** WHOLE movie is in the room. ***
