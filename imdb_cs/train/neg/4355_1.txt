Grapes. I see many user comments on how great this show is. It's Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are like ... and the plot is ridiculous. Actors, of course, fight to be fun and probably narrow when they hit those terrible punches (if you can call them). Most other users who have commented are, of course, from another planet (or at least from another continent). There are obvious reasons why TV companies will cancel exhibitions ... and none of this is when concerts are doing well. Make sense? Clear anyway - even if it rains and there is absolutely nothing else to do on this planet ... going to stand in the rain instead - more fun.
