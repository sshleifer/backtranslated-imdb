Well, no, not really. It's a really good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I really did not feel torn from my loans and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The story is fine, nothing brilliant or new, acting is pretty bad, but the actors are pretty. The direction is satisfactory, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects that are in the werewolf film is quite a big problem. It was quite a decent amount of nudity, which is a pretty good thing for me, but it was not all that hot. Overall, it's a relatively average direct movie to the movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're bored with a genre fan, check out sometimes. I would watch it one more time. The Horror Bonus, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in several of them) plays a werewolf.
