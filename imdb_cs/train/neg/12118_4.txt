In 1972, after his wife left his way, Elvis Presley and Linda Thompson began. Miss Thompson, dear, long-haired, beautiful, sculpture queen of beauty, is designed to fill the void in Elvis's life. When the divorce of Elvis became final, Linda was already a legendary artist living in a friend and companion until 1976. This is a fragile view of their love affair and society. Linda takes heart with her needs and wishes. And she even put a handful of drugs in her hand and put her into her love affair with vali. Sometimes this film is harsh and dark; a very unimportant view of the "king" and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely horrible as Elvis. Effect on the handle is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist misses Linda but it does quite well. Supported casts include John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. I look at it twice, it's more than enough for me, but do not let this review stop you to check it out. For most of Elvis fans I've been confided with, this is not a popular presentation.
