I agree with the last commentator, which could be the worst movie ever shot. I too have to move forward most of this movie forward. Michael Madsen had to make this film a favor for someone. Image quality is grainy all the way. And what small plot is it is just stupid. I give this movie 1 in 10 if I could give it a lower score I would like. Do not waste time on this movie or you will regret it.
