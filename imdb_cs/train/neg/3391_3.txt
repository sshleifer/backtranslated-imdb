I wonder who, and more importantly, why did he decide to call Richard Attenborough to drive the most unique feeling that he will experience Broadway for many years? He is the director who won the Oscar. Yes, he won for Ghandi! Jeremy Irons is the academy of winning acting, you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh, what a beautiful war" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The film is disappointing, clear and simple. It was not that the ounce of living energy survived the heavy determination to drive. Each character danced beautifully, they were charming, but their screenings were theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw it on the stage, I felt everything. The film was to be cast by stars, unknown, newcomers, but stars with convincing, unforgettable faces, even the most invisible groups. Big actors who could be beautiful dancing. Well, Michael Douglas was in it. I really forgot that I'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like Michael Douglas's musical Richard Attenborough.
