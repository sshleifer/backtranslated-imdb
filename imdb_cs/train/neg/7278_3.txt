This barely traceable film was a bit of anxiety to sit down. None of the segments is good, but at least the first was slightly fun and the middle was somewhat imaginative. The last one was just brutal, and after meeting two weak comic shorts, the third was really painful. Even according to the low standards of National Lampoon, it seemed that this film was particularly boring and joyless.
