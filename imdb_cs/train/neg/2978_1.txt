I'm a big fan of horror movies and zombie movies are my favorite. Zombi 3 is one of the absolutely worst movies I've ever seen. There's no need to say that I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've ever seen. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead," but because the movie was deliberately funny, it's the opposite. He has some of the most exquisite actors I've ever witnessed, especially from the main scientific character. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. The effects are also irritated and in many cases unruly, and death scenes are often simply stupid. This of course makes it even more fun. POSSIBLE LINK - The worst is the scene when the guy opens the door of the refrigerator and sees the chopped zombie head, which then opens his eyes and somewhat FLIES OUT OF THE FRIDGE, latch on the boy's neck, killing him. Zombie heads have the ability to swim in the air now? He rejects every physical law known to man and it is one of the most absurd things ever shot. This is just one of many really bad moments in idiotic disorder. I can not believe there is a lot of high ranking here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do a favor and hire that asshole.
