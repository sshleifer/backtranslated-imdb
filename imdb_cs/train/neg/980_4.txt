My first full movie Heston. A movie that everyone knows ends up. "Sci Fi Thriller". Camping factor. Everything that happened with this movie was an injection of my head when I lent it, and the morning I watched it was the perfect movie to look at the mood I was in (She did not want to move. blankets). And although I tried to understand what was happening, it led to an ending that would be forever destroyed by pop culture, it just did not do it. Everything was in place, the relationships did not have the spine, the end had no ink. Everything was just a little strange and the observer has no choice but to remain partly overwhelmed at the end he gets, because while we all know that they are people, they are quick answers to why people are making a serious attempt to make the movie he could look forward to something other than the stupidity thrown out of the window.
