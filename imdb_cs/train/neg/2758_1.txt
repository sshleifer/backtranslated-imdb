I give this movie number 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this movie was terrible. It was a very bad deal, the story was badly written, the action was incredible. I doubt that even the Salvation Army could fight as badly as the soldiers involved in this film. I will not even write a plot conspirator because the film just is not good enough for plot conspirators. Writing comments on the plot would be pointless. If I compared this film, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire, but even though I did not like Reign of Fire, at least the movie was better than this movie. Some people in the theater left before the film was completed by half. The only reason I did not have it was because I just did not think I was going to do it. I was looking at the CGI feast and fought the championship, but that did not happen. Martial arts lasted for 30 seconds and it was from the exercise routines performed during the flash-back scene, very disappointing. CGI also did not do well. One scene appears. During one of the earlier tank battles, soldiers deny ... ... nothing. Someone forgot to animate on this film, so the street was completely rid of the bad people. I also think that the dirty voice was called by Imotep's voice from the Mummy movies. It was the same scratggly recurring thing. (Somebody owes some rewards here?) Since I mentioned the battle scene, I say yes it could be considered a spoiler, but only with purists. , do not buy a DVD even when it comes out. You were warned.
