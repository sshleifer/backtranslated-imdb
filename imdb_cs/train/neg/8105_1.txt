Rough, yes, but I call them as if I saw them. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the late 1980s and it was really one of the worst, boring movies, watches. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinema is beautiful. The Czech setting is really stunning. Political culture is tempting, but unlike similar "historically defined" stories (eg, Zhivago_ (qv)), this has failed to make a policy relevant to this story, or even interesting. Olin and Binoche are beautiful. This film, however, can even "erotic" scenes grow and slow down. I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I started hoping the Russians would shoot all of them and put an end to my misery. I'm sure if I read a book, the story would make a little more sense. Life is, however, too short to spend more time on this.
