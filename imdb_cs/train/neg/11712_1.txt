The only reason I remember this movie is that it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever made. I was 17 and my buddy was 18. We were the age when the action films of our stuff were as much as possible (ok 2nd largest). We went out, we felt so insulted, we wanted our money back, but time never recovered. Editing is what killed this movie. When a truck is attacked by more and more vehicles with mounted rocket launchers, the film completely offends the intelligence of the audience by making these unfortunate bad guys in the 4x4 VW Bugs shooting rackets at the truck. Please, missiles at a truck known to be carrying plutonium? What's worse is that these VWs can get 15-18 shots from 4 rocket launchers. You saw VW with four rockets fire 2 of them, cutting around the truck with the last one attached, return a second later with two rockets attached, another fire, then go in front of the truck and now it's back to a full set of 4 rockets. <br /> <br /> We tested it so we hope it will have a large surface that never happened. It looks like they just got out of money and stopped. Just ridiculous.
