Not only the best of the films to watch nowadays. I've read a lot of reviews about Shining and expected to be very good. But this film disappointed me. Sound and environment were good, but there was no story. There was no single moment of fear. I expected it to be a horror film, but there was no terrible thriller. The only scene I was afraid of was a "chapter" change during the scene. There are lots of fragments in the movie. Most things remain inexplicable and nothing that is associated with anything. The story does not tell us about women or other scenes that appear. It could be a good film to be seen in the 1980s but not for the 21st century.
