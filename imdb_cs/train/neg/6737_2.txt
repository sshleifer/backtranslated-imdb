If Deborah Messing is no longer occupied as a "grace," it could be an acceptable film. But it's just another story of a frustrated friend who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney), which travels to London for a wedding London wedding in a Time magazine article. How new is this plot? Even funny or remarkably romantic, Wedding Date slides through the act of the bluff sex of the bride and the best man and pays for the escorts to leave the film as four weddings without Hugh, and it is definitely a death for an unlucky woman who does not know the sexual history of her bride Amy Adams). While Messing perfected a suppressed princess, a 30-year-old woman with an unsuccessful history of relationships, her unprotected and drunk moves for another faux beau is simply repeating her television series. If this woman is an actress, you get a role that will not repeat what is already in the main time. <br /> <br /> Lots of drunken women's ties, cricket visual jokes and Mulroney in a towel (dear!) But the film is a hole with an obvious happy ending. Expected Messing Continuation: Divorce Date.
