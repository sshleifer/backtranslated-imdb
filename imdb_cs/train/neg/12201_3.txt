The summary summarizes everything. It's not as good as the original anymore. With a script written by both Stallon and James Cameron (also written by strangers). Most of the events were written by Cameron, and Stallone wrote the political aspects. Sly was in the best condition physically when he did and Rocky 4 and looks great or rises to eyeballs to steroids, depending on your opinion or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo begins in jail and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to go on a special mission that could get him a presidential pardon. He eventually agrees and goes to an instructional camp led by Charles Napier playing Washington's suit, trying to retreat as former ex-forces to calm Rambo. The mission is to find out if any missing prisoners of war still live in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen as a camp that he had checked, sometime before, himself a prisoner. He is told that it is not a rescue mission and he is there to take only photographs. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt to drop out of an airplane loses most of his set, he meets his contact to be a cute woman) and travels along the river with the pirates to the camp. He found out there were still prisoners and he saved one. When they escape 3 of the Vietnamese army on a river boat, the pirates are betrayed, but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to continue picking up on foot after their ship has hit and exploded with Rambo almost on deck. <br /> <br /> Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned because Napier orders the rescue helicopter to be withdrawn. Obviously, Trautman returns to the base to praise him for not expecting to find survivors. Steven Berkoff appears as Russian Colonel Spetznatz and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes, the Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Kills many of them, Rambo finally steals the helicopter and saves most prisoners to return to their base. He refuses to kill Napier for leaving him but destroying the Ops Center. <br /> Weak land and a very weak end as Rambo goes to sunset as a free man.
