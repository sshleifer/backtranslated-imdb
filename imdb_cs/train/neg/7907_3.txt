Outstanding performance Alix Elias highlights the otherwise poorly controlled and confused pile of jerseys. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and I find less and less pleasure in every crawl. Why are the pills so crazy? Is it sometimes explained? Is it a reflection of our crazy "animal self"? If so, why not obvious? Why not allow back just the touch of subtlety that disturbs this movie and make this connection explicit? Another part of this movie that does not bother me at any end - motorcycles. The jacket that the small monster wears on the front cover is apparently indicated to the street passengers. Sunglasses say "a pretty cool guy." With all this information, I'm ready for Easy Rider to meet Muppets. All I have is Munchies (1987). What does he give? Join the Gremlins series if you're a fan of tiny, wise, reptile puppets - it will give you the treatment you deserve.
