This is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It is not that it is inappropriate; it's only about 99% of his work, it's demanding and over-exhausted. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters stand out as an observation of the navel, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I have read many of his works (even his socialist realist poetry. It was really terrible) - I simply do not understand what the fuss is about. The characteristics (like self-absorption) in his novels make angry reading. In the movie, all the things I do not like Kundera are magnified. Maybe I just missed something, but I do not think so. On the side note, I can not believe it is a Criterion Collection DVD collection. No way this movie is crucial.
