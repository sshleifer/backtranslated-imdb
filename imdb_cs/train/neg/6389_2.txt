I've been waiting for almost 25 years to see this movie, I thought it might be an underestimated job, since the animation was no longer the quality it once used to be. He was one of the best film criminals of all time, based on a nice series of children's books and was produced by Disney Studios. What could be wrong with it? As it turns out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price, as Rattigan and Henry Mancini's swan scores are the two rescues the grace of the film. The price is bad and Mancini is more professional than the material he deserves. They bring the class into a project that is otherwise unclear. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the movie is filled with inappropriately adult situations, it still suffers from a totally boring script, generous voiceless voice, terrible songs and lazy animations that are not out of place on any Disney TV show in the mid-eighties. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment for me. It is amazing that this film was almost contemporary with NIMH's mystery. The cost of a non-production independent studio model produced something more creative in its trailer than GMD has in its infinite run. A special star who keeps it "terrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
