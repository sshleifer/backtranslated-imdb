When I first watched the show, the first stories looked promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as a stereotypical "mysterious" vampire, and Sookie introduced himself as an independent woman. The show, however, went downhill and once interesting characters are fun as boxes. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original personality along with their acting skills. In episode 5, Bill's eyebrows are so low that his face is just forehead. Sookie, or rather an actress, is even more dead than her vampire. All these tragic events surround her, and she only responds to how pleasant her loss of virginity is. Personally, I think they did the big characters sleeping too early on the show. The way they were worried about each other was something that occurred to me, and I could be a little more. Once Sookie loses her, she is upset as a total ditz, just thinking of Bill's libido and the size of his attachment. Bill also loses his courageous attitude and well, he's simply stupid. His actions never really explain, except what he does for Sookie. Why? Their love for themselves is never submerged if there is any love. So far, it seems to be the sex that is at the heart of their relationship. Yeah, yes, vampires usually give birth to sex, but they continue. Every five seconds I see some kind of sound. It was not much surprise because HBO is always trying to switch from fine kernel porn to a decent TV show. Bill jumped out of the dirt, and only Sookie got no reason, was not he? I laughed so hard that I was almost moving alone. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is just a stream of consciousness. Characters never include anything. All the events that happen are mostly unexplained. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like is a small character. Tara and her drunk mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I kept watching the show is the development of small characters. <br /> <br /> Minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much better.
