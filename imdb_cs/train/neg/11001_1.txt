I've never seen a comedy that was so useless when she was sitting ... she did not even interfere. Okay, maybe one little laugh for Michael Clarke Duncan is a bit like a big, black, bald homosexual virgin. But the rest was shocking non-funny. In addition to getting rid of some laughter, "skits" go on forever! Avoid this if you value your time and money. DREADFUL!!! Worst!!!
