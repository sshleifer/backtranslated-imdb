And a really unpleasant movie. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (when rotated by the stomach), he has no extra redemption. As with many movies from the 1970s, you feel like you need a long shower and clean your slime. The characters are uniformly unpleasant and the fence is meaningless.
