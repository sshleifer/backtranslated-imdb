Priyadarshan - whenever someone heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy." This is what this person knows or is known for. After stunning comedies such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowly dug out films like Chupke Chupke and several others whose names I can not remember yet. Now, with horror films like Dhol, it will be the first word that our mind would strike after hearing his name. "Dhol is a mix of bad, dysfunctional jokes about the toilet, somewhat dramatic, poor tensions and idiocracy." The only good thing about Dholu was one or two scenes that were fun, though not funny, and second, except for Kunal Khemu and Hysteric Grandmother, When I talked about acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (when compared to others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and finally the two idiots mentioned above. it was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting, his grandmother first reminded her of the spirit, and she was not funny at all, but rather stupid, the same thing he saw before him: four boys for girls and needing money, but with some twists There is a "bad" man who is ridiculously stupid and stupid, and finally a good victory over the bad and everything is all right The idea of ​​having Dhola with the tone of the money in it it's just not funny The worst thing in the movie is its length After a few hours you get exhausted and you want to leave the theater. But as a critic, it is my duty to tolerate two and a half hours of film. The film goes on and on, and the same kind of jokes is repeated over and over, and the situation is permanent only in another place. If your mother-in-law arrived at your house and started mocking you all, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
