I saw this film in 1979 when I was 17 or 18 years old. The theater was about 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes into the movie, I was together with a friend who went to see the film, the only two people in the theater. The movie was really weird and had no script or reason for his script, and people demanded money back. We decided to stay for the whole movie ... why would such torture persist? ... here's why. We wanted to be true film critics ... have a standard to set up all the other movies, it's hard to justify that you saw the best movie (and 10), they always came up with something better. But it's easy to create all the other films from the worst movie ever made (and that's ... best 1). There may be other films that really qualify as 1, but I still have to see them. Now I'm setting up all the movies I see on a scale based on the worst ... I AM ONE TRUE FILM CRITICAL ... he on.
