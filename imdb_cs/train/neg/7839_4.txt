Serge Farnel made very accurate criticism of this film in The Rwandese Night (www.lanuitrwandaise.net). Critics who show how France is in the situation of the United Nations Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The United Nations soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by genocidal forces. The day before, ten UN soldiers were killed by genocidal forces. That is why UN soldiers have decided to protect their own lives by going behind French trucks. In this way, they gave up Tutsi, which is unforgivable, of course. <br /> <br /> However, we must remember that the French soldiers organized this situation.
