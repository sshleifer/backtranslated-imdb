This should be a film about Sam and his wife, the famous Peter Falk, and the so famous Olympia Dukakis. It would be a movie worth seeing. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle with a small Falk. In this movie is also beautiful Elizabeth Perkins, but you hardly know it. I suppose Reiser thinks he's a giant movie star who needs a suitable vehicle. He is not. Even more harassing is that Reiser has struggled to hire some of the best female actors on the screen today and then put them in the background. Dukakis is not showing until the last 15 minutes, but when it does, the screen lights up. The story is about Falco and Dukakis really, but we are exposed to an unnecessary, stupid, absurd trip in which Reiser shows how very cute, precious and oh, so deep with a psychological insight (wrong!) It can be. For example, in the restaurant scene Reiser hoped to be "Cassavetes-like," a fake confrontation between Reiser and Falk is so ridiculous, I was embarrassed for Falc.
