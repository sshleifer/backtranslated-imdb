I tried to watch this cinema abomination when I was five years old; I've never been the same since. Filled at the edge of drug-induced images that arise out of the ordinary fervor of your average asylum seeker, this "film", despite its colorful appearance, is not for people, especially children. <br /> <br /> It starts to go innocently with a poor boy who destroys his classmate's drum (wait for it) and puts his head; yes, through him. But do not worry, my friends! He is quickly consoled by his biting flute, which is pretty weird, I will make you, but still acceptable. <br /> <br /> Then: The film changes in a combination of the Sorcerer of Oz and where are strange things, but loses all the "hot and fuzzy" aspects of one of these two books. So, this seven-foot-yellow relative of Barney is spinning with this poor boy and throwing them even deeper into despair. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> , a former friend of the skilful crew of swinging grandfathers and dragged "dragons". <br /> <br /> The most comfortable picture in the middle of this chaos is the villain, appropriately called "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, it has its own problems: what an obvious plastic mask that narrows face expressions must match with a broom whose gas level has always seemed the lowest in the most unfavorable moments. As a result, it was one of her favorite pastimes that sank into a water body that separated Pufnstuf from her degenerated, decaying home (I do not know where we'd rather live). <Br> <br /> Overall, this movie is scary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has similar effects to your audience like Exorcist, then it's for you. Enjoy.
