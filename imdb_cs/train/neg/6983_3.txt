Revolution is a terrible movie, I do not care if you are a history teacher, a newsreader, a fan of Al Pacino, there is no way this movie may make a legitimate '10'. <br /> <br /> The key that Tom Dobb (Al) is trying to get money from the note he got for the radical patriots who took the ship. Everything turns around that note. Tom's son joins the army to avoid this remark for Tom to join the army, even if they are trying to get out of the army, years after the war, they end up, and eventually return to the ship for their ship. End. It was a couple of bit scenes and was, at best, average. Transformations between the scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters into some famous historical battle. A love story is a joke, and the film as a whole is hard to watch. So save your "Notes" and look instead at Patriot.
