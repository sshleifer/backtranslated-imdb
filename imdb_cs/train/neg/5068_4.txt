I'm amazed to find out how many fans this show has. They did not say friends were in the best "average" sitcom and not as great as others did. Let's see if it was not for Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, and who knows if this show will last as long as he did. I very much doubt that. Although the series progressed, Friends were gradually more predictable, deceptive, and boring, that I could not care less about those characters who are the most overrated in TV history, or about their misfortune, nor about who they are sleeping with. And it was fun in the first four seasons to be fun sometimes. Even if he had all those Hollywood A-actors from the movie world, I still did not bother to tune in. The script in the movie Friends was lost that I lost interest in this show as early as the sixth season and in terms of the end, but it was predictable what she says the least. What was unpleasant was that it lasted for ten years, while some of my favorite concerts lasted only three, four seasons, for example, and eventually canceled and took off the air. The show should be stopped immediately when the cast demands higher salaries. In fact, just as the series had disappeared, it was a show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When I finished in 2004, I was so relaxed that I saw the back of this sitcom. Now we are talking about meeting with friends coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet he is not waiting for him anyway.
