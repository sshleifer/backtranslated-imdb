A devoted fan of TLK films, the first of which is a milestone and the second apparently probably the best sequel to Disney, along with this film ... Now I'm not a quarrel with animation, voice creation, music, but that's no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screw in the atmosphere TLK. Though it's not bad, it does not add anything. Basically this movie is one big joke ... and that's all that saves him. Create Real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
