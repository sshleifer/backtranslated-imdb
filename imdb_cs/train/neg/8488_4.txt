Including virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a limiting society and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed by the fascinating Tilda Swinton, this film should be great. But it is miserable, terrible if you consider the potential! They play - except Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - are tolerant to sinful. The construction of the plot is the smallest - the most up-to-date programmer is boring, but half of the film is spent by adjusting her character, and then, when Ada finally appears, telling her life's events, not giving it a gripping story. You never know her as a real person, just an icon from a student's history. Digital effects such as a digital dog and a bird are miserable and disturbing, since it was 1997 and not 1985. Finally, the script is bad. Poor, often demanding dialogue - especially the struggle between the programmer and her boyfriend that made me brighten me - cold and distant characters and a zero attempt to create a sense of wonder. The programmer successfully contacted the person in the past! Astonishing! But it does not seem to surprise anyone and her friend says, "Be careful." (Although we did not know, then or later why it could be dangerous, and it never seems to be really dangerous.) Despite the fact that it is computers and Ada Lovelace and her love for mathematics, it is clear that no one involved in the script has any knowledge of mathematics or computers - any references to these objects appear to be a complete mumbo jumbo that resists any suspension of infidelity. One scene toward the end of the movie is pretty good, Tilda Swinton's monologue expresses sadness because of the fragility of life, but her joy in this life. Honest, passionate and savvy, it seems he was released from another movie. So I'm disappointed in this movie because it's a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cultural movie. If you find an interesting item, you may want to rent it, but be warned in advance. Take a look at Orlando for another, much better study of gender roles in history with Tilda Swinton's outstanding performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> . But then, the modern programmer seems to be doing it, carrying the memories of his little girl (the name of the film). Am I right that the programmer violated the wishes of Ada without trying to do it? Or is it another confused plot that I misinterpret?
