Listening to the director's commentary confirmed what I had when watching a movie suspicion: it's a movie made by a person who wants to play while shooting a movie. A story is such a thing that fools adolescents when they go through this phase "I could write a book / script / award-winning situation." There is a germ of an interesting idea that is buried there (probably because it is a sequel to another man's film), but is completely buried under a signed, misplaced and mixed-minded scenario. <br /> <br /> The lines are terrible and the performances are uninteresting, although I once again inclined to accuse the director. He does not seem to have ever consulted the actors about what is needed, rather he skipped the script in their hands, showed the camera to them, and told them to deal with it. Who knows, with a little coaching, these actors could have been better off (say what you like about the musicians in the movies, Jon Bon Jovi was great at Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in the Leading Man). /> In the stage, casting has no chemistry at all. A beautiful opportunity to use parallel sex and vampirism goes in parallel when he transfusions to infect the character of Bon Jovi with vampire blood from his paralyzing common hunter. She should bite him. I think you should also look unclear for the rest of the movie. The only real moment of sexual tension, between two women, is that the directors happen by accident. He originally intended to use this silent sequence as a pretext for another unnecessary fence exposure - so I assume the finished product might be worse. But it's not much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as movies go, it's poorly rendered, silly and forgotten. Even in movies that are unlikely are not sexy enough or cruel enough to be fun. It could have been fun and bloody little dexterity, but the director left the comedy rather for all the wrong reasons.
