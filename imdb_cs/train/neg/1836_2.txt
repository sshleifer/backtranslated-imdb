How can Barry Levinson build up the blessed-comedy talents Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the beautiful Rachel Weisz, old for Christopher Walken, and still add that humorous smell? Stiller and Black are friends until they are. invented a splash that caused the dog's mess to disappear and become a remarkably multi-millionaire. Spaces are thin but healthy enough in their right hands to be a springboard for some great whipping between the two stars. everyone is touching the throwing of each hand, every chance they can. Stiller and Black just do not have fun too much time, Weisz looks sensational as always, but it's criminally unused and except Walken as a crazy barfly that calls on Stiller to get revenge, it's a turgid trudge to the end of this tense farce.
