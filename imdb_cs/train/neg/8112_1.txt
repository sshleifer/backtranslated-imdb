Hanna-Barbera radiates life from another famous property. Violence is destroyed, stories are formal, animation is bad, music is unpleasant and repeated, and frankly, the show is simply not funny. At that time, HB gave everyone in his series the same clich√© of the situation, regardless of whether he would fit into the cartoon world or not. Popeye and Bluto appear in a repeat segment like a cave ("Hey! Popeye is popular and Flinstones are popular, put them together and you can not miss!"). Also in the obvious ripoff "Private Benjamin", Olive Oyl and Goon have a regular segment that represents them as a new army of recruits. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Adding a harassment factor is a public service announcement in each episode (standard cartoon practice but still unpleasant). Popeye teaches to his nephew that they walk safely on the street, recycle and - are you ready for that? - the risk of smoking! (I swear I will not do it.) The only spell left out of the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, the voice of Popey from the beginning, continues to play here. <Br /> <br /> It is worthwhile once you get a new award for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
