For romantic comedies, I often rate the quality of the film based on silent eyes until the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date", I can only rate a movie with 4 of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> I apologize to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I did not see many chemistry between their two characters. The premise of the film is "Pretty Woman," where Dermot plays the role of Nick, a precious male escort who hired Debra's character to accompany them to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship is likely to develop between the patron and the client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there was not enough romantic sparks in Nick and Kat's relationship. <br /> <br /> In her supporting role, Amy Adams was like Kat's sister. Whenever Amy appeared on the screen, it served as a spark plug and a catalyst for film energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams was cast in the role of Kat, the movie could have more dynamics. But as it turned out, instead of getting to Kleenex, I was looking for Visine to try to pretend that this film had some true sentiment and romance.
