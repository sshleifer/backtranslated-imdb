It's a remake of things (1982/1951), I think there are, there are so many factors that of the children of previous films deny it. So acting is bad, James Spader does a superlow stargate re-enactment himself, with his brown mug and his somewhat strange thoughts / movements, but that's about the other actors I have not even noticed. You do not feel like you know any of the main characters. And plotting is slow, boring and I know what's going to happen in 30 minutes. Score / music is extreme, as there are plenty of ubertallented people who should score for coke and credit, but that's the main crap. Some of the special effects are nice if they were made in the early 90's. If you like Slimy Aliens, warmth and excitement, do not rush this movie. his boring combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak, and some production by Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay were really bad. Now this combination would be fine if someone knew what they were doing and the only ones on this production who knew it was nobody. Though I've seen a lot worse, I would not recommend this movie anybody, but if you're on a cold night and you'd like to meet someone, it'll be slow.
