As hard as I should believe, with all the terrible facts that have emerged in recent years, it has to take the worst place for the worst. I'm still wondering if this is really a spoof made by SCTV gangs. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was worth it. Can a rock band fall slightly less than INXS has to do such a shameful thing like this? The assumption is simple and sad. The Karaoke Band Concert refuses to become INXS's new lead singer to take over the role of Michael Hutchena (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the group has suffered the worst of suffering by auditioning for a talent group without talent to become the new lead singer of the band 20 years later. So, all the horrible singers (I think American Idol have their share of doozise) are sneaking, making a rough rendition of almost all the classic (and predictable) rock melodies you can imagine. And then they will replace INXS members who seriously discuss the merits of each of these candidates. You have seen better (and more original) rock artists in almost every nightclub in every city in the world. It has all the usual non-drawings of every other reality show. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, lame host / emcee, lame "judge" performances, and lame booting one participant at the end of each show. Can these shows still predict? It is obviously an advertising piece by the band; the last fondness of hope in rekapitalizing their lost hero before they are finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had some dignified dignified life in his life, must change his grave. Not that INXS was sometimes a great band, but I did not know that they were sad. If INXS is at all representative of what has become a rock role, this show is the ultimate proof that rock and roll are once dead.
