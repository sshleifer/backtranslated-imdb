Rarely I was so disturbed by the lead performance I was in the movie Ali McGraw. God is annoying or what? He says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so it's really scary that Ryan O'Neal is great. <br /> <br /> There is not much story. He is rich, he is wooden, both have to sacrifice a lot for love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, her name is called by her first name, if you do not notice the Difference in two of them that they overcome in the name of love. <br /> <br /> Oscar nomination for this film suggests it must have been a bad year. John Marley is all right, like Wood's father, but the nominee? At least Ali did not play. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross should play Jennifer, but then again, if it was to me, Katharine Ross would be in a lot more movies. She's a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I do not even cry when she's sick, I've never been able to feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones look like he was about 15, and the score is good. But this one is so old that he has a beard for a long mile, and the sin is not that he is so old, but he feels it.
