This movie is obsolete and lacks a mark. It's far in comparison to Batman 89, who is trying to kick. A female singer who is her name can not act and see why her film carrier has died. Notice how this movie died at the cash desk no one sees this movie on television. My uncle and dad were expecting Batman, and film impressions are more like Cop Rock. They are not worth renting 3/10
