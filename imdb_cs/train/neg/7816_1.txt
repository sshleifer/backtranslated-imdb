It does not really matter that Superman comics are incredibly naive and their goal is ten years old. What is important is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Dear Readers are asking you how many of you actually believe Superman will be defeated by bare Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Just as I thought. No spoilers. So let's take a look at some of the major issues right now. <br /> <br /> First, this movie looks like a commercial (scene in Superman / Clark Kent, which is just a scene that looks like it is). Imagine Superman advertising, two and a half hours. Note that this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You feel that this movie is too long. And the special effects are not so extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Second, the script is stupid. Sometimes, even if something comical is acceptable, it looks stupid in the cinema. And that's the case here. Of course, the conversations are shameful. I can not believe someone took the money to write them. How many times will we feed the vicious manifestations? How many times will the laws of physics be raped? (Jesus, it's not just a matter of Superman's power, it's also the resistance of the materials his relationship affects.) How many times will Lois Lane Kent be concealed? How many times will Hollywood producers try to make a story in a haunted comic? Because it's hard to make a good story, why have a weak story for the starter? It simply does not work. Boys, grasp. Try it harder, please. Or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. I felt the WGA was constantly on strike. No offense. I have no doubt about the lame of the money they pay, but about the quality of the product they supply. In this case, there is no quality at all. (In this moment, you can ask yourself: is it bad? Yes, it is so) <br /> <br /> Thirdly, acting is weak, which is quite surprising when directed by Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects). Kevin Spacey has fun, but he's the only one. The audience is not in the mood for jokes. The point is that the hero of the comic can develop into a real person, with clear motives, but also with doubts, fears, some depth. In this case, no one has done this work and the characters are not really interesting. Finally, the whole effort of the creators will turn this film into a parody. The second unit is so bad that it attracts attention because there is nothing interesting on the screen. The harder they try (if they try to do it), the more fun (but they can not laugh). Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular film, ladies and men, is a camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money. Stay home, read the book.
