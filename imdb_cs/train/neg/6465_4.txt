This Charles trip is decent, but it's quite a small key performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a underworld with Mire Sorvine and Donald Sutherland, who forgets about development and hurts a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wanted to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" was pretty bad.
