George Brent is the reporter sent to interview with heiress. She is allegedly the heir of bloody happiness. She talked to her yacht. They are among themselves in bathing costumes. It turned out (quite early) that it was not an heiress. It's part of the cold cream advertising campaign. The film follows the ascents and descents of their romance. Davis and Brent bear the picture. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite fun. It's far from her best. Of course, especially in view of its obscurity in her work, it is not even her worst.
