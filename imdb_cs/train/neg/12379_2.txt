Based on the aforementioned positive reviews, we saw a free tour of this last night. Now we know that filmmakers create positive reviews because there is no way an author could write them. "Designed to become a" classic cult ""? "The theater was packed, seemingly with friends and family crew productions, because only a few of us left the first hour." The songs were the most literal I ever heard in the musical "Do not take a shortcut, honey, there is a wolf in the woods ...
