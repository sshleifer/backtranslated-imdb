I have read a half-dozen other user comments on this board and it seems that the views vary considerably. I have to agree with those who considered this film to be terrible. I hurt to write it because I would hope it would be great, or I would be afraid to see it the other day. I like to support indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this film is almost too much to tolerate. Those who left, as I realized he did after about three minutes, probably did not mind spending $ 11.00 or just thinking that it was going nowhere fast and not getting better. Maybe I'm somewhat more optimistic than they, whether it or they do not pay to get first. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. It's a clutter. He's gay. I'm fine with that. The problem is that because the main character in the movie is bored it does not necessarily mean that the film about him must also be boring! There are ENDLESS scenes for this boy, which just look like a load of clothes, restoring everything you've learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc. Atd. Nothing or anyone goes anywhere. NO ONE says something remotely grateful, funny or interesting. Probably the most dangerous of all is that I did not feel a little empathy for Logan. This in itself is a great success. He did not grow up, did not change, did not learn (no one taught him), did nothing, nor did the film do! The scene does not create the same scene. <br /> <br /> And the title does not make sense at all. 1/10.
