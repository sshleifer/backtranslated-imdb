David Arquette is a young and naive home security alarm vendor admitted under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy who made a great sale at the first call - to Kate's widow Capshaw and her son Ryan Reynolds. Things are doing well for Arquette, appearing in advertisements for the company and <br /> <br /> falling in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and his right hand, Mary McCormack, left him in a bit of a secret - sometimes they get into their clients' homes to scare them and get their neighbors to buy the security systems from the company. Arquette decides he will not get to take Capshaw to meet his family and spend his life smiling at his face. Then someone gets into the Capshaw house and murders her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci and set a trap line, leading to a gun on his boss's head while Tucci begs his innocence. Based on the "The Alarmist" scenic game, it is not well opened. The scenes in which Arquette takes Capshaw to meet their parents are miserable and completely unhappy. They are also out of bounds with the Capshaw character as she sings and tells the sexually explicit stories of Mother Arquette Michael Learned. Other than these scenes, Capshaw does not work much, but it does a lot with the little one he gives. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, looking just like Terry O'Quinn, is rebellion as a security company owner. It's a creep that does not really understand <br /> <br /> Arquette has a moral resistance. However, when Arquette seizes himself, he is furious. Mary McCormack seems to have been modified for a bigger role, but she's mostly around and agrees to Tucci. Ryan Reynolds is too old to play a silly teenager, but he's funny, especially when he's telling his own sexual story, Arquette. <br /> <br /> The script soon comes out of a romantic comedy into a dark comedy. Kapshaw, who meets her parents, is totally unmotivated, except that she gives her reason to get out of town to get her home. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the movie just to give Arquette a reason to avenge Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who has proven he is a good actor, is terribly terrible. <br /> <br /> Reliably relying on the constipation that has gotten him through the AT & T ads and is not strong enough to build it. <br /> <br /> The movie around. In fact, Reynolds might be better in the role. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will soon win Oscar. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck is a light jazz score that recalls the type of movie noir this movie is trying to be, and it is really catchy on top of it. Despite the pluses, Arquette's failure as the leading and skeptic schizophrenic quality is decreasing the film. I do not answer. <br /> <br /> This is rated for physical violence, violent weapon, some gore, strong shame, short nude woman, sexual content, strong sexual <br /> <br /> and adult.
