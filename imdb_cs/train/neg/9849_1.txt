This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's bad, even in TV Film standards. The story is diabolically flawed and the well-known names in this movie are useless for confused, uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep this apology of the film together - that's so bad. It's going like a "psychological horror thriller" - it's definitely terrible. There is nothing exciting about it. And it could cause mental damage! The initial scenes that were opening included such a promise - a possible move to see if the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the complete assembly that followed the scene of a car accident is convincing. No matter how hard you try, you do not have to worry about the characters anymore. There are so many sprinkled ideas that the movie is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case, the film would actually bring you to Brain Dead! I bought over 300 movies on DVD, and it's FIRST that I'll have the money again. TOUCH.
