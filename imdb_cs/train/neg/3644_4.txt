This movie is pretty bad. The act is complete and absolutely forced. Besides, filming a movie as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more believable, you can not easily get it, whether you are Mr. Dir. Do not, however, mislead your comments because I recommend that you watch this movie as it casts light on psychology or non-existent psychology for the perpetrators of these crimes. However, the top of the film is absolutely nonsense! There is no other way to say it! It is pure and simply can not capture any feeling of atmosphere! What is happening is no feeling of despair, panic, fear, or fear that I would have experienced in such terrifying circumstances. No, instead, it keeps your jaw drop "Was it so?" pouring out of your tongue, and in any case you are scared by these boys' actions. Rather, you just feel embarrassed about another film that started with the potential, but eventually dropped to the face at the most critical point. Zero Day really ... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
