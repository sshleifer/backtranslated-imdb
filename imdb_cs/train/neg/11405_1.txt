I had to watch it at school. And summarize it ... <br /> <br /> Talentless actors, talented scenario and talentless director. This movie is such a waste of time. Do not even look at the movie. Do not bother. You will be disappointed. My teacher said it was good. How bad she was. She even even slept. The film's actors were just bad. The best actor was the old man, and he does not say much. It's a terrible plot with terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say it does not make sense. The script was unattractive and confusing. There were points in the movie when I raised my eyebrows and said, "What?" There were too many free bonds and hole holes. It was totally terrible.
