This film is very boring and demanding. There is only one good moment when the sailor shaves Barney (he thinks that the purple dinosaurs without his face) is eyebrows. The music tirelessly collapses - it is sad that Bjork, someone with such a great inner beauty, has been brought into eloquent falsity in her art. Tea Service Pump makes a wonderful ritual seemingly flawed. Mythology and culture are not respected in this film are lifted. Not only from Japanese culture, but from another filmmaker ... (stay tuned) In the perfect "art imitates life" moment - the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh * t. This is what the audience found in the theater. There are some pieces that are very folded and heartless - then they're preparing for spoilers - I'm talking to you MR BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! Mr Barney, you are out! I saw Jodorowski's WORLD HORK. And your thin, fake BS veil was canceled. Theft captured his style and his entire catalog of artists from this man. Now that the holy spine is released Finally, we hope that the powers that are on the councils of art in the world, STOP FINANCING! Poor Jodorowski - lost in a financial battle with Beatles' lawyer when he is Lennon / McCartney's film work. And BTW, while Jodorowski's Beatle - You're Repair! An inexpensive, thin, soulless rip only enjoyed the light kitsch students. And BTW I'm a filmmaker. If you are interested in filming a real estate movie - I will legally fight you in a circle that defends Jodorowski - you who defend direct thievery.
