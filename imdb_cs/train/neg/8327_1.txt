OK. So it's a low-budget "movie" (I used quotes because it was filmed in a Hi-8 video). The actor is ubiquitous, the makeup is ridiculous (the blood looks like it comes from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more convincing bruises made from Halloween ghouls) and the lighting generally looks like they're using someone borrowed Toyota pickup lights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I could be able to forgive these low-budget features if there was some real content if the film tried to tell the story. But this collection of videos can not boast any conspiracy, no real signs and no momentum. It's a self-service mess. And do not be afraid - there are no spoilers, because there is absolutely nothing to ruin.
