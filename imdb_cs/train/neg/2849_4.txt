The comparison between this film and the "last detail" is done by some, but "Chasers" is flatter than the stretch of the interstate highway in western Texas. And just like the scenery in the desert, there is nothing to distinguish it from the fact that the woman is carrying two naval escorts this time. Nobody in the cast gets too well; with this chrome script that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, director, does not give this place too much space if he ever writes a memoir, I do not think.
