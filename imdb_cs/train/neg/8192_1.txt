I have to say that this movie was so bad I would have gone if I did not have to re-evaluate it for my work. Worst, I wanted to see it so badly that I was driving all over the city, I paid twice for parking for $ 10, because newspaper listings were bad. Vince Vaughn plays the one he always does - the one time I saw him play someone else, he was in the movie with John Travolt. In any case, the conspiracy has the potential - it looked great in the preview, but it is full of absolutely absurd, predictable, weak pivot points. And I hoped it would be one Christmas movie where Christmas would not have to be saved and Santa needs no exchange, but not. The only cool thing to do was riding a toboggan, and the little crazy guy was the Best Figure. I'm sure this movie will be great for little children, but it's so feeble for adults it's sad to sit.
