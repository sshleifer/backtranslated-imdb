When I saw this movie I could not believe my eyes. Where did those jolly creatures, the toothpicks with their big teeth really want to scare you? Or where they want to laugh good (I sincerely hope). If you are carefully watching, you can even see the strings that control them (drag them over the screen). The whole was rather fun than the scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was impressed by his total inability to have only one good part. It's one big joke from start to finish and I believe this movie belongs to a new category: So incredibly miserable you will laugh from start to finish. (I will not attempt to comment on acting or all other things)
