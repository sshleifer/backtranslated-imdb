Someone actually gave this movie two stars. There is a very high chance that they need immediate professional help, because anyone who does not last 30 seconds to find out if you can give any stars is literally scary. The movie is ... well ... I think it's an attempt at a horrible porn / porn movie without porn or no real terrible bits (except for acting, plot, story, files, dialogue and sound). I assumed it was a zombie wrong. <br /> <br /> Tracking is actually quite frightening in justice; you're afraid someone will come back and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they're going away because you think you're scared watching home amateur torture videos or something like that. <br /> <br /> I'm so surprised to write this review on my mobile phone, so I will not forget to try to reduce the rating by more than current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate I just suffered. The worst movie I've ever seen and I can say (with my hands on my heart) will never be.
