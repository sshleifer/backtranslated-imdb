I was in such great hopes of seeing the adaptation of a classic story as Arabic nights. Instead, I was disappointed in a movie that could not keep my attention from the very beginning even though I tried to watch it twice! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie, but it was not much because the actors lacked liquidity. For something like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras it's much better for action, comic moments and total entertainment. Okay, so the Dragon Syr has a lot of potential fans, but if you're looking for something that might interest you in the martial arts and the fence line you get used to. If you want the kids to settle on Sunday afternoon, maybe this is for you with 3 ninjas.
