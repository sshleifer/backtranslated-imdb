When you look at the little man, you will spend his run and try to find out his lots of holes. And that's not a good sign, because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! You have to laugh! But you? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with a small man is his concept - it's too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoon comedy), so when the loud, strenuous and over jokes come across, they make the whole thing look ten times more stupid than that it is. <br /> <br /> "But her comedy," some of you may be screaming. That's true, but that's no excuse for such a silly plot. I think you look, think about seeing a child with GROWN MANS FACE, you will not be the least suspect? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why did not he put him in a nearby shelf instead of a random woman's bag? And how can a qualified doctor not recognize Calvin as an adult? I really mean ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not a plot or a laugh," maybe you're screaming. No heres to see the thing, there is almost no laughs in the little man, and it just makes a stupid ass make you stand out even more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch crazy comedies returning to the whirlwind, hold on to the white chickens, for at least it has a few decent laughs. What if you avoided a little man.
