No, this is nothing about the fairy-tale trainer, fairy-tale princess and glass slippers, but if I wanted to do it, I'd have to mess up for you, which I did not. But do not let the curiosity get out of you because this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those promising movies before betraying your audience with a cheap tactic of fear and disjointed action. And that's real horror. Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon while the other is your mental, obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like a hand in the glove, so close you thought of them more as siblings rather than parent-child. But things start to be missed (not always) when the Hyun-Soo friends with whom Yoon-hee operated will start beruerky. Maybe it's a warning for viewers and for those Korean ladies who do not try their cap when they go under the knife to be believed by the news. The only really scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, though I thought Time Kim Ki-duk actually had more gore in introducing and describing what is happening during the operation itself. It's a story two halves, with a fist attempting to shock the audience with a standard blackmail tactic, which, I confess, once happened to me. The other half degenerated the film into the mumbo-jumbo's melodramatic melodrama and was quite accustomed to forcing his thoughts to his neck. Some things start to make no sense, and while you're always trying to explain, you probably will not buy it, or horror films are logical. <br /> <br /> The leaders are beautiful and there is a significant lack of male presence besides the negligible role of the police. But hey, I will not complain, even if the plot could be greatly improved. I would recommend that you look at it only if you are a fan of average Korean horror at VCD. Watch out for those faces that are out of the ordinary!
