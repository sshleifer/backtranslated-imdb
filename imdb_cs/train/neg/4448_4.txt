What a strong start to a movie when Julie Roberts is struck in the face of her abusive and anal husband starring Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to experience a strong film at the same level as Mrs. Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was a bad leader. This movie was nothing like The Burning Bed that had the power, and Farrah played part of the woman you really felt about and felt her pain and the need to survive. Sleep with the enemy, after the first events, dropped into inexpensive excitement when Roberts pretended to die to escape his husband and walk to live in Iowa. Her husband first believes she is dead, but she begins to be suspected that she may still be alive and go after her. The rest of the film is basically a game of cats and mice, where Julia gets a house in this small town in Iowa and changes her identity ... there is no mention of how she got the money for it, but at this point I was not so much a movie . He meets a guy (Mr. Nice Wimpa) and falls to him and her husband finally catch up with her, but not before he re-organizes soups and grows the kitchen. I supposed to offer the audience pleasant excitement. But I did not care if she was an abusive wife because the movie, as I said, was cheating on the audience. If it remained, I could feel for her and her situation. The husband is killed, of course, and everything is good for Mrs. Roberts. If it was just the real world ... You see a Burning Bed and you understand what it's like to be the film about home abuse.
