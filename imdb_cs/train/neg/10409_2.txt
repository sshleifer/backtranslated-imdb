As if the story was not depressing enough, this film shows that the cows are graphically killed in the slaughterhouse for five minutes while the protagonist tells his early life as a butcher. Strange things. Then there is the main premise of a hero / heroine who walks and cuts off his bird because he is in bed with a worker saying he would go with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what traumatic childhood did she have? But he was not accepted and had to live with the nuns who first loved him and later hated him because he was indecent. He tries to explain why he did what he did, but it's really hard to understand. Such sad and unusual self-destruction. Was it funny? What was that about?
