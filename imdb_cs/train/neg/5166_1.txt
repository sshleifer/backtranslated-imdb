Striking acting, a lame plot, a stupid story, and just about every horror film that sums up this piece of junk mail. It was unbearable when she sat. Just terrible. Do not lose even a penny for this. The cinema should feel bad when they shoot that movie so people can watch them. This "horror" film was not even the least scary, haunted or disturbing. It was not visually appealing in any way. The game was so terrible to any actor that any attempt to get you into the movie through dialogue is completely destroyed in moments when the actor / actress opened her mouth. Moreover, the whole story, I do not know why anyone would make a film with this story again. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, do not waste your time viewing this movie. You will feel stupid to watch him.
