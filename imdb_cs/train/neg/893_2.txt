When I bought this DVD, I said, "It looks like this is a nice light comedy about love and relationships created in Portuguese standards, let's give it a chance?" I was totally wrong! What a disappointed film! First of all, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese myths! Second, the story is so boring and leads nowhere? Does it have no structure, just flows like a wind in one or another direction? Production is also bad! Mixing the sound is terrible because sometimes voices are disconnected. Did some old Portuguese movies from the 1980s remind me of it? Should participation also be better? Well, summarize, it is not with movies like this that the Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad behavior, bad production? I had no hope for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Just forget it!
