How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! It's the right film for her ... too bad to be out of the job. I did not read Jane Austen's book, but I can not believe it is so shallow and characters are no more than a cartoon. Probably it was not so easy to cut about 600 pages of books in two hours, but I expected more than just to see old pieces of furniture and tea cups. Every moment I remembered the relief when I saw an actor who did not cross the boundary of overlap (a few times).
