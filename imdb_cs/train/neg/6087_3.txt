This movie was not as far as I expected it to be. There are several seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO plot of paranoia-fest. Most acting is average, but quite typical of things in the 1970s, full of pregnancy pauses. The photographer and model show that some strange obstacles appear in the woods and soon become victims of the same paths. Flying plates are seen, more people disappear - but are they aliens or an extremely secret group of cover-up boys of our own government? Soon enough, the reporter and the "UFOlogist" (apparently modeled on the character of a writer-director) have become the target of ultra-secret agents, who are so threatening that they are unlikely and helpless, into this decaying fiasco. Then the fun actually begins. The film, predictably, makes as much sense as the average theory of the UFO plot, but it should be appreciated for taking it seriously. Working with the camera is fine for low budget movie, speed is pretty good, the script is stupid and absurd and there are problems with continuity that are fun. What are the few seconds of brilliance I have mentioned? Frankly, I can not say much to you without writing a spoiler. Just state that the end of the movie is at least suitable for fast forwarding if you can not be in the middle.
