somewhere I read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. after what I saw, I would call it anything else. the point of this movie escapes me. the dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many files seem to be additional thoughts, and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content there is nothing erotic on this film ... everything that leaves me to wonder what the hell is wrong about! the title presumption could be the basis for comedy entertainment (if politically incorrect). instead we treated cheap, amateur, unfinished sketches and corruption and peculiarities for our own needs. if I want to, I'll go buy grace jones cd.
