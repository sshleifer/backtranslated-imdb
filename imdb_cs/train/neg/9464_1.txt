But the previews looked funny and I usually do not go to the opening night movies, especially with my kids because ... you never know it. Here is a movie that does not apply to children or adults because jokes are too perverted for kids and fall flat for adult entertainment. I was really embarrassed when I was 9 and 6 years old and had to explain to my six-year-olds what S H * T looks at. In fact, there will be a total twist of the classical Dr. Seussa. He adds bad and lazy neighbors who want to marry their mother's children for their money. If it was a subplot, then it might be fine, but in the end it's the main story throughout the movie, and the "cat" plays more subplot role in revealing to a neighbor her mother for whom she really is. Take your advice, read the book and submit the movie.
