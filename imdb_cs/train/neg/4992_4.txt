This movie is just another average move, but it could have been much better. When they got out, they really needed help choreographed. Someone like Andy McNabb - who did the brilliant action sequences in the heat as they walk down the street from the robbery - would turn the tedious action sequences into something strange. Because the rest of the movie was fine - predictable but observable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the last scene, the show, the one we were waiting for, but it was like watching the A-Team in the 1980s. He shoots wildly, nothing is threatened, and runs around the house trying to kill each other - the same old, the same old.
