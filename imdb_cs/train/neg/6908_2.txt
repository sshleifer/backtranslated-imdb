This series had potential, but I suppose the budget would not allow him to see this potential. An interesting arrangement that is not different from the "lost" decreases after the first episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, could make a convincing 90-minute movie, but the creators decided to drag them on and on. Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving forward. The music was very uncomfortable and did not work. There were few figures we cared about because their characters did not grow during the time - well, a little bit up. The end was as severe as the rest of the series. The only fairy is the Department of Fine Arts and Hairdressers, they created an interesting look, too bad a writer, and the director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with this element
