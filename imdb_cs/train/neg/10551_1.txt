The torturous man seems to be a fellow who walks on a land where self-harm is manifested as a way to cope with his exploitative childhood. I use the word "obviously" because without listening to director Andy Copp (which I did not have) or watching the movie before watching, the viewers will not have a clue what it is about. <br /> <br /> Gorehounds and fans of extreme films can be attracted to watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh spit scenarios and worrying real life recordings, but if they do not like the demanding, headache, experimental art cinema they'll find this a real crazy job. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly shots accompanied by disagreeable sound, terrible music and an incomprehensible conversation terrible noise is the perfect way to test your mental well-being: if you still have all your balls, switch this waste and watch something decent I'm the whole thing, but I'm well aware that I totally bark!).
