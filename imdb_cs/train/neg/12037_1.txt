This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Scary acting, terrible effects, horrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood, it's amazing. It looks like they just wanted to use Robin Hood's name to attract the audience. It could also be called the "New Adventures of Ms. Bland's acting". Someone told me that if you had fantasy, I'd love to show you. This is a terrible access to television serials. Such visual media should evoke your imagination, you should not force your imagination to do it well. It would be like the Simpsons episode, where he tries to wash Homer's brain with a religious propaganda film, and starts talking about who killed and who. "If the film is boring, I just make my own story." <br /> <br /> Finally: Absolute human waste.
