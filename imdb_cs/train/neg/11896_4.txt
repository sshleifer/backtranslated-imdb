Before I start, I think of Eddie Izzard. I think it is one of the most entertaining stands today. Maybe it means getting too excited, but on this trip I did not see Eddie funny. I think the main problem is that Eddie is too trying to be Eddie. Everybody knows him as a totally irrelevant comic, and we all love him. But in a circle it seems to be more irrelevant than funny and completely lost me in the local places. Many of the topics covered cover earlier - I even think I have recognized several recycled jokes here. If you buy a DVD, you'll find Eddie's tour behind the scenes (interesting in places, but not very fun) and the French language version of one of his performances. Die-hards will be able to see Eddie in another language, but the subtitle comedy is not very fun. <br /> <br /> If you're Eddie's fan, either you've already got it or you're going to buy what I'm saying. If you're just walking, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. He's probably going to be with Circle.
