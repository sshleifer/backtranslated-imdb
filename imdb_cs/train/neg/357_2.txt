We are Sean Connery as Harvard's law professor, Kate Capshaw (still has a job?) As his wife (a slight age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist Southern cop (!) And Ed Harris in a complete superior edition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer. Weird casting, but the movie plays with the audience seriously. (if you do not read seriously watching this movie or sometimes watch this movie seriously because of the spoiler) First, I felt that I had repeated my eyes on liberal stereotypes: policemen are all sadistic black guy without evidence. Criminal prosecutors, witnesses, and even the accused's lawyer work together against him (accusing him of raping and murdering a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard law professor who favors manifestations of injustice against the blacks and the barbaric death penalty. The grandmother of the convicted person approaches him to defend him and re-open the trial. Connery is horrified (yawning ...) by small town officials and a club of good IL boys, but finds out that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now on death, was all made, the main proof being his belief that he was beaten. <br /> <br /> The beat was administered by a black policeman (!) who even played a Russian roulette to denounce her beliefs. Connery finds out that another murderer of the death penalty actually made a murder, and after a few morning dresses with seriously overlapping Hannibal Lectem, like Ed Harris, finds out where Harris is hiding a murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He gets re-trial and Blair is liberated. I think ... movie after .... <br /> < Blair is a psychotic psycho and uses Connery's "white guilt." He made a story with Ed Harris in return for Blair making several murders Harris, Blair is now in opposition, thanks to Connery's fraudulent principles PC Last 30 minutes are a strange action movie attached to a legal track, Connery and Fishburne fight against the serial killer in alligator skins (yes, you read it right) in everglades. It was a weird movie. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is corrupt and ineffective, the cops are only martyrs and torturers like Abu Graib, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to fry. <br /> <br /> Really depressing at every level! The system is totally spoiled, and those who attack it are also seriously deceived. <br /> <br /> Two inches down. Connery apparently had to make a mortgage or something.
