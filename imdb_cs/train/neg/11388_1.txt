This story is about a romantic triangle between the African male prostitutes, the French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and the Russian waiter who speaks without French and never seems to be shaved. As the film is dull, sad and depressed, shot on foggy, winter days or in illuminated interiors where everyone is bathed in strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know it's because the white balance was out. Everyone is pale and perverse and looks furious, shabby and dirty. The bodies are bony and so detailed that they look pretty ugly and uninteresting. Moles, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time either naked or with sex. A story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three characters return to the home village of Stephanie, where through a lot of memories of desolate landscape and predictably cheap interiors, we see a bit of Stephanie's childhood as a boy called Pierre. Mother dies. Well ... and it is, really. Character development is minimal, just like telling the story. <br /> <br /> I suppose the story is not linear (it would explain a lot of non-realizable ones), but really, after paying my seven euros, I do not feel like I have to build the film myself: it's the director I have money. I expect to join the narrative story and have my dirty hands, so I'm talking too much. <br /> <br /> This film is a heap of demanding rubbish that is made primarily by the desire of the epater les bourgeois (ie, shock the straight). I see how it happened for the Berlin Film Festival, and I see why it does not have it anywhere.
