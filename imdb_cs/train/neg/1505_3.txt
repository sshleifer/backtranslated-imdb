It's quite a plain silly Italian-West, a stupid story full of clich√©s and a lack of logic, some bad actors, dirty environments, lots of fighting, and people shooting massively. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German translation, this German edition of DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and Macho Callaghan fights against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed him (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split. And you got to fight Ironhead against everyone, because he's just the bigger and smartest asshole. Yeah, that's nothing more clever in the story, hehe. Klaus Kinski's little role as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two men fighting by striking them and yelling "I said love!" and in another scene wins the horseshoe competition and goes nuts to the other - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also noteworthy that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi made cinematography - I love this master of incompetent exploitation - thrash, so it was for me "aahhh".
