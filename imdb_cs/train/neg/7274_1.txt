"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply the worst film ever produced, much brighter than even the awkward "Plan 9 from Outer Space". The Lampoon film is narrated in three segments, each allegedly derived from a conventional film genre, but each of them lands on the feet badly. There is no rhyme or reason for these distinct culprits and no recognizable stories. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good points about the movie are nude scenes. It is true that Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry are flashing a little meat and it's very nice. It seems, however, that directors do not realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one, played by Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a young, eager beaver policeman paired with a cynical old player who plays Widmark. And for a moment, those of us who are still looking at this bold cinematic exercise will satisfy the idea that we are going to see a ransom story about how a young idealist policeman brings a purgatory change of old timer access to police work. But such luck. As has been said, this movie has no redeemed values. It's bad until the last fade - which is, perverted, prolonged longer than it should take on the screen. Apparently filmmakers knew they had a bad thing and wanted to make it the smallest of them.
