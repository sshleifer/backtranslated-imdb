Unlike my reviewers, I always try to find something to redeem in any movie I see. Yes, the quality of dubbing and lighting is unbelievable, the acting is wooden, and the initial sequence is very misleading with all the lascive female lesbian vampires with blood dripping. Something must be lost in translating the word "Bloodsucker" from the Italian title; almost as if the producers originally shot the Gothic Vampire story and then changed their minds but could not afford to surrender to the dramatic opening sequence, so they turned to the film. <br /> <br /> In 1975 it was recently released on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer, which in some respects is more daring than in the movie! Now anyone who buys this movie has probably already read a synopsis and knows what to expect - the Italian softporn since the mid 1970s. I bought it because I am attracted to Chris Nelli (most often ascribed as "Christ Nell"). There is no cast of characters I considered to be the most frustrating in many of these films by Eurosleague of the 1960s and 1970s that Imdb would show character casting when he heard their names in the movie but without a list of actors is very difficult to connect with actor. I think Christina Nell played "Coru", but under that massive hairstyle, costume and makeup is difficult to make it clear. <br /> <br /> There are mostly two-dimensional views of the actors of their parts and no one really stands out. There may be something lost in the dubbing process. What were the positive points? music was atmospheric and of course when you were into beautiful lesbian soft porn there.The external location used was good and I would like to know where they shot the castle on its island.It purports are located in "Ireland" (North or Republic?) In 1902, so all the sports season piece costumes. Some scenes I found unintentionally funny especially those sexual scenes !! Anyway, nice romp.I rated it 4/10.
