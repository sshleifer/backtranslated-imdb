Recently, they are trying to greet this movie in cable TV commercials. Do not trust the hype. I was one of the unfortunate people who saw this arson in the theaters. This is, in my opinion, the third worst film of all time, just behind Mac & Me (# 1 worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 worst) but I have to admit they are all close and all TERRIBLE! Indeed, nothing in this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else that claims to be like not losing money. The only thing for which it is good is to give your worst enemy. I will not lie about it. Someone you would like to kill or torture was the main candidate for this film. That's awful. If you do not believe me, then you deserve to suffer the misery of watching the one I doubt you can end up. Two inches enthusiastic.
