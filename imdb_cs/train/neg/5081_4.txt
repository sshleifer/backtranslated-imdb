Was there a positive film? Critics who did not know anything about video games could see mistakes in the game. No damage with damage clearly visible at the beginning is a primary example. And maybe I missed something, but it was not Super Mario Bros. 3 Suppose it was a game he never played before? Well, if that's the case, and I'm missing nothing ... how does Fred Savage's character, and even the girl, already know about the game? We talk about things that some people do not know about the second or third round. <br /> <br /> In addition to factual and game errors, the overall quality of the film is generally low. Nothing here is honestly memorable. The kid was not that good when he was playing video games in the footsteps they showed. Many children I knew these days were much more experienced. Moreover, acting and acting in the strongest places are simply average. The characters are still and absolutely uninteresting, the "wizard" (the youngest child) is a very quiet, totally dry child's clich√© of a little boy who almost does not say about the trauma. It's not like it's unrealistic, it's the fact that he had to be worthy of the movie to even start making a plot that would go beyond even 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, the only value that lies here is nostalgic. If you've grown up with this movie, you'll like it if it's good or not. These were children playing video games and you were probably obsessed even at NES when you saw them. But if you have not loved it as a child, there is nothing to interest you, and very little will prevent you from turning it off. No, sir, I did not like it.
