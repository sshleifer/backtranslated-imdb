This is not a horror because the first part was: It is a "campy" of bright and humorous entertainment. As with many sequels, the action begins without any explanation. But there are breasts so I do not have to complain. And real breasts are. If I understand correctly, they are relatively rare among adolescent girls in American countries A. This brings me to the fact that the main actress is Pamela "Bruce's Sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> It can not be thought out without the first movie, so I can compare it. Again there is too little clothes (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to say what decade this film is made of. Again there are really strange characters, this time even more visible "pathological". In particular, camp employees. It's like a summer camp of psychological rehabilitation. People are older: Most actors have to be at least 25 years old, but I think they should be 16 or so. Some "methods" used by Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant. In fact, this movie does not have much to do with the first part, and it's worse than anyway.
