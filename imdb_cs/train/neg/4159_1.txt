In this strangely absurd apocalypse, the world lives in double zombies and vampires, but no one seems to worry too much about this Grade-Z movie, which is less similar to the famous short novel Sheridan Le Fana than my mother's lasagna recipe. Bored staff are still running petrol stations, and doctors still make calls to the house, and helpful police officers still appear with the cooler fluid just when you need it. The story, and I use this term freely, includes fathers and daughters who try to say goodbye to a "general" whose daughter is missing, in the church to kill a vampire who travels comfortably with his father and daughter. I have to admit that there is moment or two true humor between the huge sections of unintentional humor. The film also boasts a lot of nudity to keep the boys of fourteen. Anyone older, be careful.
