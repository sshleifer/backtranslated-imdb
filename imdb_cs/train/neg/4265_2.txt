I'm a huge fan of fighter films. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai, and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is absolutely amazing and which I strongly recommend, I had great expectations of Sergei Bodrova's film. But it was terrible, terrible, not even pathetic, in this case a strong word. I was waiting for something exciting all over the movie, but it did not do it, then at least I expected a great epic battle at the end, but it was a huge disappointment, just a random run around, waving with swords ... There are so many good fighter films, this is not one from them.
