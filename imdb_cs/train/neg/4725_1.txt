Great opportunity and director Indy to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of a star. It could have been a decent film if it was John Livien's traumatic past and torturing his psyche. Instead, it's a funny attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. John Livien was the hero of a suicidal mother, John Lennon, and wished him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of concentrating on John Lennon's musical brilliance and his wonderful ability to wear for others to learn about their own lives, it turned out that Lennon's inheritance is a confused, drug-dependent soul that should look like God instead of a man. I'm a huge fan of John Lennon, and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" person possessed by Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we have to remind it? John Lennon did so much music and honesty in the world and I was refused to see another upset man as the main character in this Lennon film and did not show his wonderful benefits to the world. Yoko Ono kindly remembers John Lennon's memory when he made a memorial at Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay respect and remember John. Instead, the director of this film decided to use this site to try to commit suicide. I thought it so disturbing and disrespectful on Lennon's memory. He was a gentle man who died brutally with senseless death, and seeing such violence near this place seemed like a return of a terrible blow to every fan of Lennon. The film completely destroyed me. It could have been a decent movie, but he left me with a hot taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and remember his ruthless murder by this irresponsible movie.
