I started to watch this movie with high expectations. After one hour, however, I gave up this film because it raised a lot of unanswered questions. It had already begun in the initial sequence and only got worse. Why would Holander be buried under the statue? Why is an Italian comedian present? Why did the wife of the farmers save Hollander? Why, when he is saved, does he not run for his life instead of starting to love a farmer's wife? Why did the wife of the farmers not save Hollander when he was not a farmer? Why did these probably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comedian know the Hollanders gold? Why was he hiding him in a cistern in the midst of evil farm property? These and many other questions have arisen and none of them seem to have accepted it in an acceptable way. So I think I totally miss the point of this film and I will never join this story.
