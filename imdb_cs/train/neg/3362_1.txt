Haunting is another malevolent remake with fake exaggerated special effects and a big cast on the popular screen and has no redemption anything but cinematic. Rebuilding is not bad, but reorganization directed by Jiona Da Bont is sure. I suppose A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) take us away from a boring plot, ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts to scare our audience, but it's a movie, it does not care what we care about the characters a story about two things that missed the movie. The story is like accepting the classical novel The Haunting of Hill House and tearing up four chapters, and then using everything that's left for the movie is so boring and a lot inexplicable. The characters are pretty thin and while acting is good, you really do not care about any character at all. Lily Taylor gives a terrible performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when she delivers her lines without talking about what a horrible shouting. Lily Taylor is not a genre of horror at all. Ghosts are silly and stupid, look like a bunch of Casper. The friendly spirit and spirit of Hugh Cain looks like a fat kid dressed like a gloomy Halloween pupil with a smoke machine. This work on the roof of one of the rooms is a huge purple mouth, and it's not funny unintentionally just sad. The house is pretty and well designed, which is probably the only positive thing about this movie that looks nice but it will not save it from its brutal everything else. I can honestly say that I felt like wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no cost so I would have been even more if I paid to see it, but fortunately it was on Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake trying to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a bad attempt at horror.
