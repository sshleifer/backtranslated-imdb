Such a mess !! Why was this movie made? This and other movies of their "caliber" should be teaching tools on how to create a movie. Children may like it, but anyone who is over 10 can either disagree. The fact that such a great talent, like Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl, was all the more unnecessary in a movie that was not worthy of any warning.
