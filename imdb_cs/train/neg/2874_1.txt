This movie starts quite horribly when a woman is tied and mentally tortured. There is a male full front nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, a woman losing control of the urinary bladder. All shot in a gray, cold color. Effective, but a little too much. Then we follow the youth of the BTK killer and the present and its history of crimes. The tension is totally psychological and scenes the killers enter the homes of their victims and talk with them takes quite a while and it's scary. Here we do not see fantasy or good pictures, it looks like it was shot by a home camera. It does not look frightening, but so much that a criminal has devoted himself to his victim for some time before killing them is quite unusual and cold. What this film does not have is really dramatic. There are some police scenes every once in a while, but there is no excitement when it comes to finding a killer. There is not much arc to this story. It could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is full of real records of the slaughterhouse. It is scattered all over the film and suddenly appears again and again. Sometimes you do not know it comes and you do not have enough time to turn away. And I have to reject it. I'm a low-budget horror, but I do not tolerate the suffering of the animals. It was unnecessary, excessive, and without warning. I'm glad Lionsgate is publishing things that no one else did, but they should pass this movie or exchange the game. Stay away from this waste.
