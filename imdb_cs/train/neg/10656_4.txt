What can I say? Kamal Hassan's film is terrible. It behaves very well, but it's a terrible story along with the awful direction. In my opinion, director Gautham Menon has to give up the direction. There is a lot of tragedy in the whole movie. Besides, we just can not believe how terrible the crimes are. There was no practicality in the movie. Gautham is just exhausting stories. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika work very well. The villains look too ugly, even if their performance was not bad. I do not think it's a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa that you can see with your family. You will not sleep to see this movie! But Harris Jayaraj did a great job again and that's why I made this film 4 out of 10. His song "Partha Modail Nallae" is soulful and reassuring. Besides, great cinematography. Overall, it's just a bad, bad movie. I think Kamal Hassan had to reject this film.
