Yeah, unfortunately I came across this DVD and found it was incredibly terrible. <br /> <br /> First, the characters suck. I mean, come on if an orange hat, called "Orange Sherbert," is the best creative idea that these guys could figure out, then they should not be on the movie scene. Bad "costumes", bad "interviews" and basically there is no "wrestler" on this disc with any shredding charisma. Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing but these idiots gently and playfully jumping together on a trampoline. They make sure they giggle together, so that the experience seems to be more like a toddler than a "death struggle". <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a very nice Backyard Wrestling clone. Only in place of blood, weapons, chaos, and WRESTLING we get a trampoline, child giggling, TERRIBLE audio and some guy called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Fan of matches or not, avoid this DVD. That's horrible.
