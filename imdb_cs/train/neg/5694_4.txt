I'll be honest - the reason I leased this movie was because I'm a huge fan of Kyle Chandler (most notably from Early Edition). Since he usually played the good, I wanted to see him as a different role (of curiosity). The land itself also drew me; wanted to be a hitman (Tony Greco-aka and Mr. Chandler) must kill a man accidentally before he is trusted with life - or rather death - a witness testifying against someone in the "family." The movies were not as I expected. It was bad, I hated the end (if you saw it, you know why) and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically - it was dirty and it did not make sense. Yes, it was a nasty movie, and yes, the weapons go BOOM. But there is more than just a movie. This movie behaved as if it had no time to go into detail - just to deal with it and understand it. The only thing that really happened was James Belushi as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee seemed to be as believable as Angel could get. She surprised me most. And Kyle Chandler was as convincing as an anxious newbie to the "family." If only a fair actress scenario.
