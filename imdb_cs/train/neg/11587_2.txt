This is just like the 6th film. The film is really bad. There is nothing in the death department. Singles are bad and are something that should not be in the movie NOES. Freddy looks like a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this a moment worthwhile. Characters are extremely underdeveloped. Everything better than the sixth but still one of the worst movies in the series. My Review 2/10
