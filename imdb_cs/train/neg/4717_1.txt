And how it's done in production makes me stunned. The main character is an unpleasant show that is not even funny. I can not build the character at all. It's a stupid ass that has nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon on the surface in the past 10 years, no joke. Story lines are badly written and executed. Jokes are as bad as Disney's Sweet Life from Zack and Cody. I could not miss this show, it is terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title is even worse. It's like this show was written by fifty-year-olds who set the character on themselves and think they're hot things when they're really arrogant and lacking creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go far and fast!
