Spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee a terrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. BRAIN is perfectly suited for these words. A horrible script, idiot acting and merry special effects make this a necessity for every fan of BAD. Horror is funny. The post-production team seems to have surrendered. What makes THE BRAIN admirable in the second half, in fact, is trying to be good! Can a little inventiveness and consistency save what's already a joke? It's about Christmas. Mother and daughter are murdered by one of the most adorable scumbags ever. A day later, the teenage rebel is in enough trouble to be sent for psychiatric analysis. If the cop's head is cut off and a stranger with blood wearing and a bloody ax told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as a funny turn becomes dark and tiring until the end of BRAIN is trying to be serious. A child can not haunt a terrifying moment. BRAIN is a very fun concept to try to be brazen. The Institute of Psychological Research is bigger than the main production plants! Our nasty villain and his cohorts get credit for pulling out some of the worst games I've ever seen. Spectacular discretion strongly recommended.
