Marilyn Miller made only three films before her premature death - the amazing SALLY (1929), THE MAJESTY LOVE (1931), and the SUNNY (1930). It is quite bad, whether as an early talkie or as an attempt at a musical - even if it has four dance numbers, sings only two songs (WHO? ONE MAN DISCOUNT). The rest of the score, including the spiritual title melody, is discarded, although we could hear it in the background. Miller looks overweight and amateurs here - no star at all. Even her dance is irritating. The film is very badly written, stock full of junk and unlucky jokes and silly situations. If you are interested in Miller as an artist, look for it, but for general entertainment, stay away.
