Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full clich√©, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes stupid. But if you do not have anything better, it will give you 40 minutes of simple, unlimited entertainment, an endless view of great male and female muscles and a very good photo of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. On the other hand, if you are looking for something more than that, stay away ... <br /> <br /> And by the way, if you have ever worked in a hotel or knew something about it, you have two choices: 1. You will have fun every two minutes in the utter stupidity and stupidity of how the show represents Hotel Business or 2. See it as a science fiction comedy as I did, lie down, relax and laugh it!
