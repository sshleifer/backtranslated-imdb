Just because someone is under 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this movie, you should try it. I am constantly overwhelmed by how so many people can be involved in something that is so bad. This "movie" is a showcase for digital magic AND NEVER. Writing is terrible. I can not remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The pies are out of havoc. It's a pod, but the actors were not too much. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone? He can not sing and is ugly as a sin. The worst thing is the manifestation of all. It's as if the writers have gone out of the way to make everything as stupid as possible. Great children's films have been dirty, clever and full of humorous films in recent years, such as Shrek and Toy Story, Willie Wonka and The Witches. But in the constant shaking of Americans, there is more danger, such as Finding Nemo (yes, that is true), the recent chocolate factory Charlie & The Chocolate and eye-crossing garbage like the Red Riding Hood.
