I have to tell you right now, I'm definitely not the author of Bollywood movies, and I see only a handful. However, if you have never seen them, do not start with this! I really liked the ones I've seen up to this one, but I could not stand it. I also have to say that I could not finish this movie - it was unpleasant. So why was it so unpleasant? <br /> <br /> 1. In the movie is a character called "Rambha". It's even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would never believe was possible. He is so # @ ^ !! # Annoying! He spoke in a falsett voice, and I think he was supposed to be a comical scandal. Instead he just leaned my nerves a little and wanted him to die ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his inconvenience - he just did not seem to shut down and control every scene he was in - and he needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes had an amazing ability to avoid AK-47 missiles with ease. I left you - there was a scene where some unarmed guys took a small army of guys with these rifles !! And again and again they avoided making a single ball and beating ruffs !!! This caused Stallone's action in "Rambo II" to look nice !! <br /> <br /> 3. The film was so deep, loud and intense - it practically caused my brain to bleed! It was as if the film was created by people under the influence of meth! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and events, events, events ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can not make a movie with a story and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. Two main characters and their acting and motivation have no meaning ... none at all! <br /> <br /> Maybe if you are the brightest act and the Bollywood fan, you can build this film, but as for me, I can see why it's on the infamous IMDb Bottom 100. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad !!
