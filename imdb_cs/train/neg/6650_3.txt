I think it would be a much better movie if Cajunsy were shown in a more credible light. My family is from southeastern Louisiana and lives in southeastern Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard the people I grew up around talking like these people. Cajuns were drawn as back wrinkles. Most Cajuns that I know are well educated, proud people, and they do not even sound when they speak the way these people did. Overall, it was OK, with great scenery and music. I understand that the writers came from Lake Charles and they knew the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, please let the actors study the language, live among the people you are viewing and get around to understanding how they are before you try to act like they. In my opinion, when the actors believe you are the person, it's a much more fun movie!
