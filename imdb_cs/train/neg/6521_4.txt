I probably do not give this film honest shake because I could not look at it all. Maybe if I saw it in the theater, I would appreciate it in its original presentation, but it was too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book 25 years ago and details of the plot faded from memory. The film did not help because it is less than lively and clear in its presentation of events. These are really four related films or a four-part film and I was, in my view, intended to be seen for four nights in a theater performance. I found the first part to be pleased, but it was all I could do to sit in Part II, which is constantly stretching. Reading philosophy of Tolstoy is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, its great font prevails over any problems it might have with the story of the story. But it's hard to reproduce on the film without being a bit rough. I have other issues with the parts of the movie I've seen. It's really angry, with a lot of hey-ma-look-on-this work with a camera that points to oneself instead of serving to improve the story. <br /> <br /> Sure, I miss something, but I could not bring myself enthusiasm to wound parts III and IV.
