This movie was terrible! I did not know what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie, and I knew it was a bomb. The actor was bad and there was no fence. your mouth is not moving. So why doctors who play xylophone should kill the monster. Just plain wrong or do not waste time (1 in 10)
