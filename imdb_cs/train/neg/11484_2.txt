Is it just me or is the kid really annoying? Hideos sister, spend most of the time running around after disobedient little so and so. As for him, I know he is a child, but his ability to act as wooden as a dead tree. I'm only halfway around and I'm fascinated by the story, but the people in it have let it go, I hope it will eventually improve because I do not know what it's all about. Although some supposedly secret messages in the scrawls on the wall and the laptop indicate that everything is back, that is, Dog is God, Living is Evil, etc. ... It seems that at this moment it is a little obvious but no one mentions its obvious meaning . While my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I update this post, but if you read it, then well ...... See the above statement.
