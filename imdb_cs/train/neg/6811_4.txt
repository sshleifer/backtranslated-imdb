When I first saw this movie in the cinema 11 years ago, I loved him. I still think that direction and cinema are excellent, just like music. But it is really a script that has started to bother me more and more in time. I suggest that Emma Thompson ingested herself and did not believe the original book; she lowered Marianne to a side figure, a second violin to her too old, too strong Elinor - in the film she received many kinds of "shy moments" and often seems to be there only to show Thompson herself. I understand she cuts off a couple of characters from the book, but leaves a scene where Willoughby is redeemed in the book? For someone who book the book long ago has reached out, these are things that are always difficult to spend. As for actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. He can not give him the best scenario he's working on, but he still pulls it up with no sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a bit old, but plays a beautiful role. And Elizabeth Spriggs is absolutely fantastic as always.
