I've always loved an account for my great script and characters, but recently I feel like it's turned into an emotional type of soap. If you look at the promotional images / posters in your account, you will see that two of the officers embrace / kiss or what to do with friends, while the promotional images of the law have long shown that they have something to do with crime. This proves that much has changed from an absolutely amazing police drama to the average type of TV soap. When I look, I feel I'm looking at the police version of Coronation Street or the like. I have to say that I still like the bill because I am interested in police work and such a thing, but I really miss the size of my account. I want to rate it as 2 out of ten, because you have to admit that the people who took over the account were completely destroyed. As for the script and characters that both have left, most of the big characters are now gone (although I still think a couple) and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or whatever, because they are not, it's just that they lack a hard look , personalities, and script lines that all old characters have, because most new ones are currently included with silly relationships and family issues. Overall, it's one of the only police programs on TV these days, Bill will always be an interesting thing to watch, but like I say he has lost a lot of his own uniqueness (if it's true spelling) and now he would be classified as horrible, unreal TV soap. <br /> <br /> We recommend watching good laughter over the stupidity of participating policemen - 2/10
