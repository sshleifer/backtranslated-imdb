The "mathematical" aspect of this is just a trick that tries to set up this television show in addition to millions of other cops. The only redemption of the aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must be (ineluctably) to descend upon the northern exposure if he enlists to this discovery. The blade of the "mathematics" aspect of the show is encapsulated in one episode played by Lou Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that this show is the last shelter of the damned.) To "catch the fugitive," the "mathematician" uses some theory of "bubbles". So it gives this long explanation that if we saw a suspect at A, B and C, then we can use the "theory bubble" to calculate where it might be. It does everything on the board, or perhaps with a wand in the dirt (I can not remember). Anyway, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three points and chose a point in the middle and said, "Okay, mathematically, here's where we can find a refugee." At this point, one more sign points: "Oh, this point will also become the cabin where the guy lived." Is it a math? Its not even connect-the-f ** k ** g-dots! This show reminds me of the mathematics I was working with in the field of banking, which had a mathematical analysis that he could do to "support" points that everyone else had agreed on either less complex analysis or basic common sense. > <br /> Just show it - When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait for the NUMB3RS team to OSAM ... They'll use calculus, call an air strike in the middle of the mountains and hit Osama, and not scramble the five children they use as human shields ... cuz hey ... all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> A funny TV show.
