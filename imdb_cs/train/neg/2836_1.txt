I saw this obvious fest on the shelf. And before I got my first video recorder, I decided to crown it with this little jewel and it's a bad movie shooting at the very best! The dialogue is inadvertently cheerful. And it includes a portrait with Donald Trumpe. Anthony Quinn is inexplicable. And just as Christopher Walken seemed to want to play in all the bad movies in his later years. This movie is Country Bears by Quinn. <br /> <br /> It contains lines like: "Shut up and let me fight!" And "You say a lot of shit!" <br /> <br /> And a precious return: "Unfortunately this is sh_it, heavy angry sh_it!" <br /> <br /> You will have fun with the battle scene as Bo makes SOMMERSAULT over the pool table! And he'll make a nice kung fu when he's out of the roles! Chop Socky action and T and A excitement! <br /> <br /> What fan of the schlock movie could ask for more? And when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and returns to the ghost as a ghost, he asks him why he killed himself than to deal with his exhaustive illness? He says, "The real men do not eat." <br /> <br /> Uh, aaa, yeah. If Bo was a smart cookie, she would call out for an exorcist!
