I just watched the thirtieth anniversary of the Blazing Saddle, one of my favorite times! The TV pilot for black Bart stopped. The story was not at all and the acting was not good. It was obviously an attempt to succeed the success of Blazing Saddles and there were TV shows that managed to make big movie takeovers, but that would never work. Since, after so many years, TVs will not even play sounds when they broadcast a movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could say 'N' in the TV show. On the other hand, I enjoyed a lot of familiar faces !!! There were quite a few actors / actresses I have recognized over the years from other performances. I had to write down all the names and perform several searches. It was fun. I was quarreling with my mother if Steve Landesberg from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
