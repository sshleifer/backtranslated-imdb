Due to its popularity, I found this film a great disappointment. Maybe I expected too much of this movie. After all, it is one of the most famous martial arts films of the 1970s, but I have never been able to find out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very thin film with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the film was that the story does not offer a character I could root for, because the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style and is unable to hide the obvious flaws that appear in the story. I know it's not a great art, but I found the film boring. Definitely not the best example of this very beloved genre. Cult status fails me. I recommend you leave it out.
