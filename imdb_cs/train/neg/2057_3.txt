I'm sorry I'm against the flow, but I thought this movie was unreal, boring and too long. I'm tired of watching Gen. Rowlands struggle for a long battle with him and the crisis he's experiencing. Perhaps the film has a certain cinematic value or represents an important step for the director, but for the pure value of entertainment I wish I missed it.
