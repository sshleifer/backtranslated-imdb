Sarah Silverman is really a comic "taste of the moon." Is it really worth the humor? Yes and no. It is sometimes fun, sometimes cheerful (such a routine is really quite interesting, though not always fun). Otherwise, you feel that the media is cheating that they have overtaken another artist. She's one of those really cute comics men have gotten together with, and they say they dig her intelligence and joke. But if you finish them, most men admit they just want to sleep with her and they're watching her. It reminds me of why many men have joined Margaret Cho and Janee Garofal, even though none of them are really "hot" in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she's 60, so her fans (especially men) can enjoy it. As for this show, it's very like her comedy. When it works, it's funny. If it is not, it is a full blown body and very, very boring. The AIDS episode is the best here. It's funny and has a really good satire in it. Brian Poesna's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's funny to see him in Tab's T-shirt. Never, however, they never come to any place, and eventually they will welcome it. Sarah's character in the series is somewhat annoying, a gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seems to be strapped and never really anything for the show, and supporting players (including Sarah's real sister, Laura, who does not look like her) are OK. When jokes hit, they are great. If they do not, they are terrible, and I mean very horrible. There is also obsession with coprophilia here (aka vaginal jokes) that seems to have replaced the real joke and intelligence in comedy today. So you should look at this show? If you have to crush Sarah, go ahead. You can look at her and pretend to be yours. As for her idea, she ranges from good to absolute zero.
