It's running a lot. Poorly conceived adversary with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communication, sends signals to the universe and receives them, is captured by aliens. Together with his pretty wife, he penetrates into his own territory and gets a secret. In this process, it becomes rather treacherous. He is admitted that he is not. There is a scene where they give them everything they want. It's a boring film with lots of long sections where little is happening. This plot is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, trip to the forest, and explore the construction. This is about editing. I suppose the story would not have supported much more technically. There is not much here.
