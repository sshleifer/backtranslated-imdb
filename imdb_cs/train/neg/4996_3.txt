I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but, wow, it was a revulsion, or I should say "just stupid". This is just another example of obsolete humor. It could have been fun in 1940, but not now ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I loved it as soon as he began to move from his boyish appearance and the high voice of Busby Berkeley, where he was mature and sounded like that. It was like "Jimmy MacDonald," but the rest of the cast was playing silly characters, the worst was Maxford House Coffee Company's boss (Raymond Walburn) who kept shouting. He was brutal to hear, and it was a great deal of damage to the movie.
