Guy Richie's third regular film (not counting the painful "Swept Away," is a complicated action thriller dealing with gambling, gangsters and chess.) Richie's previous efforts are likely to hate the Revolver like me, with his twists and turns . Richie Jason Statham plays Jake, newly released former ex-con to avenge a laugh called Dorothy Macha (excellently OTT Ray Liotta), but instead got involved with several other drawbacks (one of which is Andre 3000 from rap Outkast) who he and the audience throws us, a number of red herrings in the film that are very tiring. and in favor of a great shot, a slow-fire shootout set at Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Overall, Revolver is a bad job, not really terrible, but far from Richie's best, it would still be Lock, Stock. The school's task would be to be a grade "must try more!"
