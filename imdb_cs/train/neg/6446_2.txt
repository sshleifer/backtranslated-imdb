Western society was fed up with the thoughts that India is a poor country. Films like these just make these beliefs stronger. Such an illustration renders Indians more difficult to accept abroad. They agreed that there are poor and homeless people in India, but why there is no representation of educated people if not successful. <br /> <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​a film in which Patrick Swayze portrays Teress as another mother. In my opinion, this film has shown India in a very bad light that gives bad concepts. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Exactly why people are asking me: "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right in front of the airport so we do not have to go through roads so full of dirt and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want to have a second opinion on the current Indian company should watch "Monsoon Wedding".
