This movie was so bad I could not sit through it without doing anything else. There was no conspiracy and no point. I was bored with boredom, and because of the movie about a comedic comedian, I could not remember a joke or a witty line worth describing. Politicians without any charisma of technical jargon can not be less entertaining. So how was it done? Is there no quality check in the movie? Watching a bikini girl was the only scatter during this terrible experience. It is hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in excellent comedies, was able to survive this kind of exposition. In this film he was not funny, so he proved that writing is so important in an effective comedy.
