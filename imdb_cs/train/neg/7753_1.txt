Everything about this movie is pig. Pitiful acting, horrible dialogue, nasty indigenous girls. this movie is falling into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director had to be a weekend bender. Robert C. is totally lost and has no idea what's going on. College children are the worst. No actor talent, very stupid thinking and just right dumbbells. Special effects are for birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs to the land of toys: with stupid weapons, with radio transmitters that are useless; and a computer system that fits the role of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother to invite potential clients until everything is complete. writers should be the first victims of disorder along with producers and crew. The whole movie belongs to a septic tank that was filmed on another planet for viewing. What a gem. Residents should monitor this in order to commit suicide.
