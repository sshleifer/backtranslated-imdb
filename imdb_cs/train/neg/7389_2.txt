I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He went out with a bunch of good movies and then went down to bad stories, poor camera work, and walk through the personality, almost lost me. Before some movies he remembered how to make a decent film. He had forgotten them now. This movie is really dark (at any level you would like to name). There are plenty of slashes and the shot is happening here with no recognizable purpose, unless it is seen as a warning against the army. Seagall might have been in stand-in for many of her scenes, as it was often too dark to tell, and most of the time used by someone else. Unfortunately, the only interesting person was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape the custody, and then he continued the uprising everywhere. Well, when is the armed guard placed in prison with the prisoner? Anyway, this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused. There's a lot of gore if you like the king of things. It seemed to me, as if all the bad boys were ever ripping the same line. I'm just glad they did not experience blood from their unfortunate victims. I'm guiding you back to my summary. Basically, it's a horror film disguised as an action film. Dec 6, 2006
