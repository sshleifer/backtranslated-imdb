All right, I recently got the chance to rent it and watch Santa Claus conquer the maranas. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a Spanish task in Spanish 5, we all had to look at it. I'll tell you, usually when we look at the film, we all talk and eat food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept their jaw open and wondering what bad Mr. Pitch would do. Helped Merlin Help Santa Claus !? or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? I would recommend renting it because it's the biggest piece of waste I've ever seen, and I love it. : D
