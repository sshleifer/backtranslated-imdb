Basically, "Caprica" ​​is a story of Cylon origin. The premise of the exhibition is interesting. Writers, however, are watching so many stories and blocking them with too many POV letters that are out of the reach of stories. The plot creeps at the speed of the glaciers and scatters what tension it might have. In each episode, something or little will happen. Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is powered by the AI ​​version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bomber attack by the Strongholds of the One (STO), an underground monotheistic extremist group. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (the father of Commander Adam in Battlestar Galactica) tries to keep his family together in search of his daughter's AI version (which also died in bombing) in the Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica (which closely resembles 1930s Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to writing, Caprica has a similar problem as many original stories. We know how it ends (ie Cylons develop their own civilization and rise up against humanity).
