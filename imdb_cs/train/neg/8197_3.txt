Today I've seen this movie and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn but eventually ends much more uncomfortable than funny, and the movie is more than a remake of the classic "classic Santa Claus" movie but without the camp or poor song by Sheene Easton at the end. The story is your run of a black sheep mill in a family who returns face to face with his family for a holiday, but with the North Pole as his setting. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a family who returns home after a series of footage, including his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a roll), so he returned home in the face of his parents and his more successful brother, Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti ) and frantic tall jinks follow with a little sibling rivalry and a little ankara also threatening all Christmas. Now, if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you would be right because it's predictable uphill. As for acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same sweet loss he always plays, but this time ends up much more unpleasant than he loves, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than just one note, Elizabeth Banks plays assistant Santa, but there is not a lot of character neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey basically ends up playing the same person he plays in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross," but a bit more anal. The only two actors who come out of this film with dignity intact are Paul Giamatti, who brings true sincerity and heats his role as Santa Claus, but he seems somewhat embarrassing in the movie and you can not blame him and Rachel Weisz, who can do much more with a very a little role than most major actors doing with them, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserve much better than what this script gives them. <br /> <br /> In order to be in a nutshell, the main disappointment.
