Visually interesting but falling in the originality department. These tedious drills in the technique narrow down after the battle begins. Jude Law has the charisma of a burned toast, but to protect it, this film contains the worst dialogue I've ever seen on the big screen. The script is actually so poor that it still does not give you away from the movie, and I've been thinking about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream the bluescreen. Paltrow's as wooden as they get. It could have been saved by a prominent film interview with Nora or through the top camp. My only complaint about the technique is that the black and white film (sorry, computer) would help me because it looks like Turner's black and white color. Just a big messy clich√©. I'd rather break my femur than resume this endurance test.
