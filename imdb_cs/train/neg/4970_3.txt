Good people, I came across this movie tonight while I'm sorting papers. My academic focus is Anglo-Saxon literature and I can say that none of the genres have ever done the honor they deserve. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I've ever seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version is a version of Christopher Lambert. Yuck. What I did not like? CGI for one. Amazingly bad. More important is the fidelity of the story, not to mention compressed acting. I'm used to both with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Pleasant Whatever, Peter
