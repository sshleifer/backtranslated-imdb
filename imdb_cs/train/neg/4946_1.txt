It is true that I have watched this piece with very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather undisciplined composer, whose lack of talent is overcome only by the size of his ego. It was the first animated movie I watched that was 100% humor free. It's gross, insulting, red-headed and obviously against women. As such, the creation is suitable for Bohlen, but the average viewer will rather be postponed. No wonder it has never been shown in cinemas: It will bomb the BIG time! <br /> <br /> Not even the cost of 6.5 MegaEuros was able to save this whole piece of crap. Save time and money!
