I missed the beginning, but I saw most of it. A friend bought it on a DVD in the left room at FYE. <br /> <br /> Skits are very short and yet most of them are still too long. Most of them seem to have forgotten something funny! It's a lot of racist / sexist / homophobic humor, sketch based on stereotypes or skittles that use racist concepts for people. I try to recall everything I thought was fun and I have problems .... The logo for Tunnel Vision is a lipstick with eyes in it. The mouth opens and closes across the eye like eyelids. Kind of haunted. What a disappointment. Most actors have gone for better things, and it's fortunate that they have not kept this bomb.
