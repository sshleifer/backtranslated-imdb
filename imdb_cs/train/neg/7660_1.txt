0 * is Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Director Uwe Boll. Based on the video game director, Uwe Boll, he is trying to re-create the game into an accelerated nail bit, unfortunately he will not succeed. Instead, he makes one of the worst movies ever to have! Although he has a small celebrity such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the necessary foundation that the film must be good, like the story line and some basic relativity of what's happening in the dark and the light. The film is reflected everywhere and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used in monster formation. Even though they looked good and the feeding was good, it was a little chubby. Хме jsme Systému Tě nějati. My final rating 0/10.
