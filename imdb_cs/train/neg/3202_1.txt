If you've ever heard these three words to you ... "Joe Don Baker", you are afraid ... Final Justice is a low budget action movie based on a sheriff in Texas named Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). It is an ugly, slimy, crude character that is on the hunt for criminals in Malta who killed their partner in Texas. His partner, in fact, twice drops in the film. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) will end up in jail as 4 or 5 times in this movie, making plotting nowhere fast. Plus, he shoots everyone as if he was in the wild west. I think no one told him it was 20th century. A female cop is assigned to point him to Malta (who looks like Elaine of Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can deal with red. They must be crazy! Removers in the bar are the most fun characters in this movie. Their dance is portrayed throughout the movie, and I started to bind with unkind women. Well, at least it was better than to try to avoid Geronimo. The end is bad and somewhat predictable and I was happy to finally finish. You will never forget Joe Don Baker's last line of film. It's so hard to imagine how the Three Bonds were ... very strange! Anyway, if you're laughing, then look at the MST3K sometimes. I also heard his other bad film (among many), the "Mitchell" MST3K version is released on DVD Rhino. I can not wait to see it!
