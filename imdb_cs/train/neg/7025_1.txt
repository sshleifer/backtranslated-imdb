I wish I could zero this movie or even lower it because it deserves it. I honestly never go out of the movie, but this was terribly terrible that I could not stand for a minute. Please, please - in the interest of humanity - skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can truly immerse in, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> He has an unattractive, steadfast leadership, a truncated structure, a ridiculous dialogue, and is totally unconvincing in every imaginable way. At the absolute basic level it does not like it. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so scenic, it's GOOD than any student movie I've seen. As if that's not enough, the whole movie depends on a constant (and I think constant) voice over the narrative. The script writer can also write a novel because he insisted on saying everything instead of showing it. We only have to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and have special connections, although there is no development of character to illustrate it. Also, this film continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, not in a natural way, but in a chilling frame of characters whose name is written on the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any character. We will not recognize any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. I'm a homosexual woman who looked at this movie by my roommate (another gay woman) and they both found this movie as a depressing performance of strange cinema. I begin to think that lesbian and homosexual films are much like Christian rock - no matter how horrible it is, people do it well and fight it, no matter how bad the quality is. Please do not lend it! Instead, we will promote the production of gay and lesbian films QUALITY by renting "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creation," instead of swallowing any soulless concentration that they think of in the gay community (Queer as Folk).
