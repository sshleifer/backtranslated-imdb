as an inspiring director himself, this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with the low end of a digital camera probably with a 35mm adapter for DOF. Editing is decent and decent, the sound effects are not too far-reaching. I'd give him 7 for an indie movie, but the story is not that exciting. It's more dramatic, character development than horror. <br /> <br /> It's not for those who want to get a scary surprise scared of exhaustion, or sit down with popcorn just to enjoy. <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> This movie would be good if we were still in the 1950s This film is about a family that has a dry field, and that's what it is.
