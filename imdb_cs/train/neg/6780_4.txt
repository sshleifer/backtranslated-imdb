This film was a critical and box-office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that was later changed to a game - which flopped on Broadway. The story is about some navy officers who left San Francisco during the Second World War. They have a 4-day vacation to spend at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The movie moves a lot and none of the characters look very real. Cary Grant is generally great in comedy and drama - but he plays a leather shop here and does not really pull it off. Tony Curtis or James Garner would be a better choice. Audrey Hepburn initially had to play against Grant but had other commitments - and so Suzy Parker entered. She had never done before, but the then American photographic model. I think she did a good job when she considered all the pressure she was under it. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in several short scenes - it really did not work. The studio tried to give her a class by dealing with Grant - but the character had no substance at all.
