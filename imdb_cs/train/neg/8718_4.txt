The third part of the Carnosaur trilogy includes a bunch of Keystone Kops military commanders who try to kill two Velociraptors and T-Rex. I give him 4 of total sympathy and my relationship with dinosaurs. The film is definitely the worst of a trilogy, but it really can not be taken seriously. More importantly, however, when watching this film, I can not even get to know the interesting parallels between the trilogies "Carnosaur" and "Xtro". The first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing movie that became cult classic, the second is "Alien" ripoff, and the third is language-in-cheek, almost slapstick (whether intentional or not) floor and laugh. Like the "Xtro" franchise, all "Carnosaur" movies are totally incoherent. They only have the name of a franchise interested in "continuing", I think. Of course, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups here, but if you've seen all three movies of both franchisees, you will find that you are dealing with them.
