One of those "upcoming age" movies that should have adult nostalgia and promise to children. This film has not one. It's a bad excuse for Sylvie Kristel's body to play with Eric Brown twice. To make things worse, the movie is either stupid or stupid when trying to be funny, sexy, or dramatic. To laugh ridiculously because we should believe that the teenager would walk alone and play with the dead woman in the front yard. They thought strongly about why a woman known for Emmanuelle needed to double the body. As the film went on, I began to imagine the hybrid private lessons and Miss Missions that Sylvia Kristel had to pick up Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP. Check out to laugh at the stupidity of other people or accompanying performance by Ed Begley Jr. or wonder how Sylvia Kristel and Jennifer Love Hewitt would look like. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, to stay away from movies that look at Sylva Kristel who are not Emmanuelle.
