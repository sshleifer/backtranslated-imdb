I want to know the secret? This movie is upset. Actually, I do not know because if you allow yourself to enjoy the plagiarized versions of the original movies, maybe this movie will be overwhelming (this is a plagiarized copy, I know what you did in the summer). The first 30 minutes of the film is based on a typical story; a lot of so-called cold teenagers who enjoy a Florida vacation and behave very similarly to the teenagers who are. The only point we get at this moment is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating the demanding sense for teenage decadents in attitudes. The second half hour of the film gains momentum and begins to illustrate the beginning of ruthless murders. The third half-hour of the film will definitely be a mystery to me because I turned it off before I could wrap myself into thinking that the film might have something interesting and original to show off. As for the story, it can be easily explained by several lines. A lot of teenagers go to Florida holidays. While they are busy, slowly (and I think slowly) they begin to be killed because they know some stupid secrets. The only thread to kill is that all victims were matrices of a common secondary school. One thing that amazed me about this movie was how much Betty (she is not sure her name ... blonde figure) looks like reese witherspoon. Another thing that amazed me was that she jumped me a few times from my place. Does that make artwork? not because my 12-year-old nephew caused me to drop a glass of orange juice because it "floated" me as I walked through the door to the guest room ... which is the difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece? <br /> <br /> Want to know the secret ??? I'm not sure about you, but I'm not.
