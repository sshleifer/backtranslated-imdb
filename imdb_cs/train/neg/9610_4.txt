In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can do western, except Warner's brothers. It's always been ridiculous (except maybe they died with their boots - the Western Empire.) I read that Humphrey Bogart, who James Cagney saw with his metal hat on his head, said he looked like he was mushroom. Real! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, just like XX. Century to be credible in Western film. The story was not surprising here, and it helped. Every 10 minutes, I think I can see that Bogart and Cagney are dropping their small arms and putting their hands in a machine gun to get out of a black car set in the 1930s.
