I spent almost two hours watching the movie I thought, with all the good actors in it, it would be worth watching. I could not believe it when the film ended and I had no idea what happened ..... I was crazy because I could use the other time to do something else ... I was trying to figure it out but he really had no idea. Thanks to those who understand and explain it ... right or wrong, it's better than you know nothing! Who was the lady in a movie with dark hair that we saw several times when we left? How did the first lady know that her husband cheated on her? At the end of the movie, Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does that mean that we will be subjected to End Game 2?
