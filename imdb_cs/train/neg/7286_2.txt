<br /> <br /> In youth, the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbids it. A few decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon the sister is bored with Brother # 1 and jumps to Brother 2's bed. One could think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on the remote island. But no - they are top Europeans who go to college and are busy in the social world. We never see a flirtatious moment between a disconnected woman and two brothers. We never see a flirtatious moment between any unconnected man and one sister. All flirting moments are shared only between brothers and sisters. The weakest part of GLADIATOR was incest. The young Emperor Commodus will have hundreds of slave girls all over the world and a city full of married girls, but not just his sister? If film incest is your cup of tea, SUNSHINE will (slowly) excite you.
