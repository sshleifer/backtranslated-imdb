I did not know that Willem Dafoe was so hard in money to be disgusted with such a shocking swing in this monstrosity. Hell: I'll give you the money I wanted to send to Ethiopia if it's so desperate. I've never seen such a pathetic and disgusting movie for a long time ... who paid for it? They either download a tax scam or a madman. Five years old will be ashamed of conspiracy, and I'd rather get cancer than sit for more than an hour I've suffered. All participants should be locked up for one year in the Sodomic Wing of Third World Prison. Avoid at all costs. I'd give it, if possible, minus 10 ... unbelievable.
