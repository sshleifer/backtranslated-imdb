Since I have suffered for a few hours and 80% of that time in utter distrust, I can give this waste awards to Turkey of the year, no problem. To say that the story was unbelievable is a great understatement. I honestly lost myself because of words to describe it. Not only are the figures completely and completely without any hint of originality (this kind of thing did much better in dozens of "serial killers"), but the acting was terrible. For those who pay, I hope you will get your money back, for those who have been paid for it, I hope you will give back your money. Believe me there are many new releases that are much, much better. Go look.
