The film is a bit tedious. It is a mostly silent film whose bulk story is passed through a series of voice messages. While such a silent film is not such a bad idea, it is one of those films where a lack of dialogue and repetitive initial scenes make it simpler. You do not understand the reason when we get into the picture, and then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie is something of a slow piece of Mexican fine porn, and it is a non-magnetic fine porn. Later in the movie, the style of the first 40 minutes begins to make sense, but it is too late because the audience is lost. There is a nice shooting spot at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I have often wondered why there are no more movies. The premises of the buildings are built on the edge of the lava fields, which lend the school complex a very different feeling. My biggest problem with this film is that the director / writer shot the movie the way he wanted to see it, no matter how the viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can not ignore the audience when telling the story.
