I chased the movie to find out what might be a bloody, non-stop action movie, and got it too sentimental and super cheap cheap low-budget action-drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and when Lou strikes Reb from gooks, he gets into the head in one of the worst effects. Vietnamese scenes are shot in a backyard, I swear! Lou is now brainwashed and Reb lives with him and his own bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced he is fighting in the cage for the money and Reb goes to kill to get him back. There are no good combat scenes, the punches are two centimeters from the person. Character characters change in seconds. One guy is bad and he's good at the next scene. The actor is scary and the music is a bit sentimental Frank Stallone that sounded like a song that would make you sick. I hated the movie.
