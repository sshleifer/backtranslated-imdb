I grew up with Scooby Doo all my life, my father grew up with scooby doo. We just watched the first episode of Travesti, which says Shaggy and Scooby have a clue. Which planet is Warner Bros by letting it do so. Those characters could have been better drawn by my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my three-year-old twin cousins ​​(who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are just not !!!!! if someone except Casey Kasem does Shaggy's voice it just will not work people !!!! believe me. <br /> <br /> This program was shameful. What's new Scooby Doo is much better. Why change the winner's format. Bin this waste and return to the real Scooby
