Serum is about a crazy doctor who finds the serum to cure all diseases by the power of the mind. Instead, it creates some kind of monsters that need to eat the human body and brains. Crazy doc creates zombies from dead bodies and has some problems. All the events are a very long way and many scenes will bring you to the characters. A crazy scientific nephew gets into a car accident, and a crazy doctor tries to use his new serum for a guy. The results are not good. This is a class C movie with OK, but some of the troubles and some link errors. There are not many zombies and effects in this, although they are adequate, there is nothing special. You can quickly move forward with slow parts and get some fun from action scenes. Beware of some nakedness and bad language.
