This film does not really encourage children to be nicer and have a better attitude, like a family film, and it would not be considered a family because it has some things the kids would not see. Best ABC Family movie if you ask me. If there were less sexual motives in the movie, maybe it would be better. Hollywood will not do anything to improve the film by adding to sexual situations. There is no reason for them. At least this is a television movie. I do not want to have money for this garbage by borrowing it. If you have anything to do with watching this movie, go to them.
