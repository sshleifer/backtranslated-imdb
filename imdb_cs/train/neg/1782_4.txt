A charming boy and his mother are moving to the center of the city, cats and death are soon following. That adds to me. <br /> <br /> I admit that after watching this movie I'm a bit scared of cats. But with a lot of seriousness, despite the many things that are wrong with this movie, and believe me there is a lot of what to go around, it's a very pleasant watching experience. <br /> <br /> The characters are more like cartoons here with just their instincts base on which to rely. Fear, greed, pride, lust or anger appear to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that a seeming mistake actually serves to tell the story. The supernatural assumption and the fact that this is Stephen King's script (not that I have something specific against Mr. King) is quite well supported by some interesting FX creation, make-up and pretty good music. The absolute jewel of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige, who plays Mary Brady, a mother from the other side. <br /> <br /> The King is able to take a simple story of outsiders or people who are a little different (well - much in this case), trying to fit in and trick it into the camp over the top of a small horror gem that must be in the collection of some horror fan.
