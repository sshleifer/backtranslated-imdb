The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in real life on IMDb just makes me realize that their junkie employees are working hard to keep people watching this really horrible movie. , no idea where to start describing the really horrible movie I sat last night - Dan in real life. Steve's characters in previous films have led me to believe that I feel something for my character and enjoy dialogue, but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassing. it was Walton's family and the movie was so many times before I was shocked that someone thought it was an original idea. Make a favor and go through this horrible bad movie Do not believe everything you read on IMDb because the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in another theater watching a good movie.
