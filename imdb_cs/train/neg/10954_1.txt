If it were a 0 star rating, I'd like to take it to this terrible pile of rubbish. The fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it were otherwise, it could be brilliant, it only makes it worse. The basic task of blocking a group of people in the experimental chamber is fine, but WHEES THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a lot of unintelligent surfers and blondes who talk about music and culture I do not know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and stupid. The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY. If you set a "challenge," you will not play them with overpriced food props and stereotypical cultural elements in "Friday night games." makes them a real challenge. And in terms of "making money", that's fine if it actually happened! These people are nuts. If only they did the show better, the real idea would be wonderful. But that will not happen!
