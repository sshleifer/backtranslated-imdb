Dolph Lundgren plays as a tempter who comes to New York when a key pops up to unlock the anti-Christ, an archaeologist, of course the demon is only a few miles away from Dolph, and is not killed as easily as he carries the body out of his body. (Just like the fallen without tension) Of course, Lundgren is out of his element and the film is completely inconsistent. I admit I'm a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, trying to watch his movies everytime they are on TV. I caught The Minion and I was sometimes disappointed. This movie is absolutely terrible. With action sequences so poorly organized and poorly edited, you can hardly fight in a duel for a consistent meaning. The worst of all is Lundgren's pitifully unconvincing performance as a hard priest (!), Which has made it worse that the film is such a break from Fallen (The Good) and End of Days (which was bad but better) This film is the worst film I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. It literally has nothing to recommend. It's terrible and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters of the Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out Of 4 - (Awful)
