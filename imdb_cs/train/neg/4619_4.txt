Let me first say that I like stories about Western and civil wars. I also consider John Ford as an excellent director. I also have the same feelings for the acting ability of John Wayne and William Holden. I can not remember seeing this movie when it first appeared in 1959. Last night I saw it for the first time since then. <br /> <br /> According to my 4 ratings I can say I do not like the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I try to explain some of its shortcomings. <br /> <John Lee Mahin, who wrote the script from the Harold Sinclair novel, was a very gifted writer and wrote many fine scripts. This script is badly written and badly researched. He mentions the terrible prison conditions in Andersonville. At the time of Andersonville, he was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been driving movies for over 40 years and has won 4 Oscars. He had to be sick in making this. His usual style was missing. It could be that it was a movie in the south and east, not Monument Valley. Usually, a stock company of players he used almost in his movie, this time was missing MOST. This time only the tiny cowboy stars Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have a role and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There was no known face except three stars. (see below) Lord Fords joint stock company produced most of his classic movies they were; Unfortunately, it is missing here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. The Duke also had to be sick, he seemed to have no place. This type of roll is perfectly suited to its style perfectly, just enough. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as usual. <br /> <br /> It was necessary for this type of movie to be an actress. Here in her first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, but not really an actress, she still has a role on television. Let me be kind and say she had a long career, based on her appearance rather than the acting talent. Also, as Miss Towers' maid is Tennis star Althea Gibson. I'm glad she got stuck in tennis. The remaining part of the production credits was far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films. several military songs that allegedly carried out a marching run, nothing good at all. Action scenes were good, but at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
