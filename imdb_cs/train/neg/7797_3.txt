This is one of the worst movies I have ever met, but I would like to say that some of the critics I have heard proved to be unjustified. As regards pure film technology, this director is responsible. He is held back in a limited budget and VHS camera, but actual adjustments, camera angles, camera movements and staging are pretty professional. I've seen many movies where "direction" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not matte and has some clever shots back and forth. Also, the forest scene contained a decent atmosphere. There is just about what you can do with a VHS camera and does a nice job of a technical character. As far as artistic merit is concerned, it does not exist. Scene where the camera stretches so that we can see how the guy in the forest urinates for 15 seconds, embodies the artistic style of the whole movie. This is pure waste ... Total waste. <br /> <br /> Gore is decent for a movie within this budget range. , of course it's a fake, but it's a lot, and it's very extraordinary. I've seen an American version with deliberate camp dubbing. It was a good idea (and that's the only thing that allowed me to go through the film) ... Unfortunately, it's exaggerated, especially to the end. It's really a terrible movie, but I recommend it for it's camp value. It is really hard to find a movie that is worse than this and so it puts it in a unique category.
