I'm giving this marriage in 3 years and it's pulling. Adrianne Curry is a polluted mouth, corrupt, controlling, loud, and her bi-sexual past laughed at me. He tells Chris that he has a picture to protect, and he has to avoid straps. He married her. Chris has low self-confidence and a different timeline. I have nothing against Adrian Curry, but this combination will not be happy after the end. Her mother said she was an old cock and thinks it was his last attempt to regain his youth. Here are two very good people who end up in an indignant divorce. I do not think his old "Brady family" will fit into a new life. I see they are excluded. Chris said his friends are more important than his family. He supported him and was there for him.
