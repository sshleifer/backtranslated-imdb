There is not enough gay movies and there are not enough movies available. Each of them is a welcome addition to this genre. Even though the production values ​​are high (movies look good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks REAL in jeans, it's bad. This is a period: gay life under the oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) life that seems to be 40 years behind the West This is how we see our own history, what could be like homosexuals in the 1940s and 1950s (it often reminded me of "The Last Exit to Brooklyn: The Book Is Not a Movie.") But it's a constant depressive and slow, it was the old SCTV show Ingmar Bergman, which is so remarkably edited, I wonder if the director just did not want to do it, yes, it's a miracle that it was shot and released before The Wall, and yes, life behind the "curtain "he was gay for gays, and a good director could do it without suffering the audience, and a good director should call me one of those great incoming movies and not one of those mistakes.
