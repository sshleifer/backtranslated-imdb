Frankly, I can not understand why this movie looks so good, or why Bakshi himself thought it was his best film. I'm a huge fan of Bakshi's earlier work - especially "Heavy Traffic" and "Wizards," but frankly "Wizards" (1977) was the last good film he made. He then turned to the mainstream, began with the evil Lord of the Rings, and then knelt with the sword and the heavyweight wizard Frank Frazett for "Fire and Ice." What can I say? The story is crazy, the animation is television quality - I insist that it is considerably worse than its 70s - and that "Wizards" have real imagination, delight, some beautiful artistic background, and underground sensitivity for adults "Fire and Ice" only for 14-year-old boys and has the intellectual impact of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you like Gor, you may like it. In my opinion, however, it was just another blip in the quality of "wizards", of which Bakshi had never recovered (though he did decent TV stuff quite recently) 4.5 out of 10
