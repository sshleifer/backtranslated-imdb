Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is studying something in Africa. He watches him down (how?) And he tells her about native stories about the giant monster, whose night gush is heard across the jungle. Looks like he's the monkey alone (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best film dialogue) to save her from the evil guys and fall in love with her and give them enough time in this tough two hours, the horny monkey looks and sighs . Under normal circumstances, I'm very open to different opinions about any movie, but it's the only exception. This is the worst movie ever shot. If you disagree, you did not see it. (Notes: Newsday called it "unbearable," which is the best overview of one word I think, Maltin Film Guide comments that they almost had to think of a lower rating than BOMB.)
