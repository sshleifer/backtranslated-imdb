Okay, I remember watching the first guy and sucking it. After watching it, I just laughed and said, "Oh boy, just another low-budget B-movie I can never see part 2 of this." Then about 1 1/2 years later, Part Two came. Bear even more. But I just laughed again and said, "In this case, I can not even see Part 3." About half a year later, part three was released. I was stupid enough to rent it and boy, just after watching. God, I've never realized how many movies I can suck today. Just save $ 7.50 and borrow the whole series. Believe me, it's worth every penny.
