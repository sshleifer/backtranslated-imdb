I'm a big film fan of the 1930s and will be watching most of the things I see on Turner's classic films. So I shot it, eventually it's a great Harold Lloyd, who compared to Chaplin as a great comedian of silent film. I watched much less of Lloyd's silent films, but Chaplins, but I must say I'm a much bigger fan of Chaplin. Anyway, this movie has become so flat for me that I have not finished it. I can see why his sound career was so limited that he did not get very good material. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, Three Stoog, Martin and Lewis, Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy making boxing spoofs (or violence in general), it's very forgotten. I was also interested in watching Adolf Menjou because I really enjoyed him on the Paths of Fame, but his role here did not do anything special either. Maybe they should get into the box earlier, because at least half of the movie (at least that looks like that) is before it gets into the ring. I can say there's a lot of Lloyd fans here and this is not a popular review, but I have to rate it compared to what was at the time of that time, 4 out of 10. Do not look at it with anyone trying to get you like old movies , because they may never be able to watch another, very flat. As an alternative to who really liked or was looking for lesser-known comedies, I recommend "Kelly The Second" a few years ago, and no one will become a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and supporting role Charles Chase. These were both on the Turner Classic Movies Channel.
