This film shows how racist John Singleton is. It portrays white and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our education system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same education system that has done him what he is and has failed. The nature of the ice cube is an example of an instigating black man who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched the relationship between the white and black characters that they tried to each other. When Omar Epps says, "I must be with my people," the racist remark spoke loudly. And John, do not think for a minute that the image of Thomas Jefferson in the tower staircase was not paying attention to me. Nice touch!
