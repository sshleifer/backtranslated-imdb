Ugh! Another of those DVDs that "killed the cover". I expected some kind of action, at least with bears, cats, and those on the shelter. I have nothing! Bad film! <br /> <br /> I have to look at it all the way by thinking that something will eventually happen ... no luck. Now I have given this 2 is due to the landscape; otherwise it was saturated. The child was terrible and spoke to herself (though I suppose they can not just run a movie with silly music and no dialogue at all), making their lame karate stance towards the stump tree, threatening the raccoon, banging on the worms and (what a stupid thing) to dig a porcupine . And he would not take them so easily that they would either ... hold like fish veins. At least several times he fought a bear (weak). What happened to the retrospective thing? Worse bad movie. I wanted to see a movie about survival, not some dramatic bs about a child who suffers from divorce. What else can I say? Well, maybe a bear should eat a baby or something. At least it would be very exciting. People, do not waste time on this.
