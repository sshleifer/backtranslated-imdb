What is a dark video at the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? It's as if someone put muddy water on the lens. Violence and nudity could destroy some people, but along with the most common misconduct is what makes a good cult movie. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin Vampir: "Unfortunately, your breed is silly." Well, no one should ever say "alas" in the movie if they are not English and live in the 18th century. The acting position of Van Helsing character and the bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also liked Master Little, who played Ron Little. Bad martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and enjoy it.
