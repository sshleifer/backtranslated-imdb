This is the biggest piece of lam I've ever watched. It's unbearably boring to have a seminar on creativity rather than watching it if I knew it would be as boring as it was. Even 40 seconds of hot cats in bikinis with big ta tas buy it all under 1. The review of this film claims that this movie is "unintentionally funny" are absurd and simply wrong. No thing is ridiculous about this movie. spends the first 50 minutes of walking through the woods and talks about things that you would not understand or care about, and it's also a shame when people start dying because you do not even know who they are because they are NOT so LOVED. Frankly, I was not looking at the end, but it should say something about how terrible it is. THE BEST FILM OF EVERYONE. Immediately after I dropped this dirt from my DVD player, I started scratching it against the cement in front of my house and did not want other customers who appeared on the market to have the same mistake I made as a rental of this movie. Then Zach cares for his pants. Thank you for your time.
