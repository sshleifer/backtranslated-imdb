All logic goes directly from the window of the train in this British horror, which is located in the London Underground and plays usually a reliable Frank Potente (Run Lola Run), Frank plays Kate, a businesswoman on the way from an office party meets with friends who sleep on the metro station just to wake up and find out that she is locked up and finds her being persecuted "by someone" or "something" with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Plot holes and incredible are full and there are very few moments that are actually jump / scary but lots that are just boring. <br /> <br /> Everyone in all the unpleasant film that should remain locked under the ground forever and make us all kind. > <br /> The only plus point here is the inclusion of popular veteran Ken Campbell in a cast that is better than this one? it even includes "Erasmus Microman"!
