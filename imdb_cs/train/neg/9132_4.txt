Fiendish Plot Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a spoof of characters created by Saxe Rohmer is injustice towards the end of his sales career. The plot was very simplistic, and if it did the right thing, it could have been nice, but it was badly done instead. The reasons why this movie was not that good was a weak dialogue, cheap laughter, torn directing, and an unpleasant feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. On the contrary, it was really the only thing that kept me interested in this confused image. I found the seller of the diabolical Manchu performance brilliantly done, with occasional lines to be remembered. For example, there is a scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is, in which he says "Ah, you all look the same to me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed loudly with this line. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, the five strong supporting characters really caught my attention like Helen Mirren as a return guard, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last film is not a way to end his career) and Sid Ceasar which gives somewhat moody performance to a relative of Al Capone who works for the FBI). These characters also kept me alert. <br /> <br /> The sets were also nice. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 were depicted by elegance in this bag-of-a-picture. In my sincerity, it is my advice to watch the movie if you are a Peter Sellers or a Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you should better deal with the aluminum foil chew.
