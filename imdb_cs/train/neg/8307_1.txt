This show is incredible. . . what it does and what it focuses on and. . words can not describe how a mad ET is. They will report anything. If the celebrity is even remotely linked to the story, the ET will inform it. If a dog appears on the Tom Cruise pavilion, they will inform you. If the celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for several weeks to the point where public envy is that celebrity. If the celebrity is tested. . . ET will be informed about MONTHS at the end of the month. There is no end to what this show will report and no time frame that determines how long they will focus on the story. Is it even considered legitimate reporting? The news is so bothering that they have harsh voices and ends with an inappropriate pause that is important. I can not follow this show without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is one of the great reasons why I avoid eve shows in general. I regret that IMDb can allow at least one star, not zero or even negative. For this show deserves -10 stars.
