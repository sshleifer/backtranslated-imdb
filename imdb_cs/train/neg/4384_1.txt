The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad screen is out of my reach. It really has to be one of the worst movies except the "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. BAD actors and a really bad story. There is no normal reaction to any of the events in this movie, and although it is Halloween, normal people would have more reaction when they see their father killed, not to mention gurgling, people with a band covering their airways, could not breathe rooms with at least 50 people I could add) and someone dressed when Satan attracts dead people from his house, even an eight-year-old would see the difference between the virgin and the person. Not to mention that no one could be so naive and stupid to believe the facts of Satan and Jesus' performances the same day as this child does. When I was 8 years old, I had more brains. <br /> <br /> But the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling because Satan looks similar, no questions. The question in the whole movie is, is it really Satan, or is it a crazy person who kills people whenever they feel it? Well, it has human hands, weapons, and whatever, so I think it should be in the movie, otherwise they would do a stupid job to hide it. After this person was a man and everyone, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!! ???) policemen (all with weapons and training) and a few other people. ... and obviously everyone just stood there waiting for him, or what? The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, and I would never recommend anyone throwing an hour and thirty minutes of their life to watch this crap.
