This film portrays Rutha as a female, hard drink, gambling, overshadowing a sporty character with a small baseball that was worthy inside. Babe Ruth's early life was quite interesting and it was for all intents and purposes omitted in this film. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered, and it was a well-known relationship, good or indifferent, better off than it was. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon he had taken a lot of baseball giants in his life. I feel like I am just to remember a great baseball player who completely ignored this movie. It is a pity on the creator of this film to take advantage of its mistakes and not its size.
