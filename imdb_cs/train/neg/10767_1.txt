It was not only the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in the BC, but easily the worst, never seen the light of day. The director is neither Canadian, but British, and the boy will show it. We are all proclaimed as many over-sexual drugs and fools. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and that's why we're funding this bed. Of course the British figure is normal. The rest is the fruit of the sitcom stereotype - can you say "Norm!"? Cinematography ranges from handsome looks to deep silhouettes. It seems the actors are always nervous. Are they bored as a viewer, or is it the director's idea of ​​cinema? Avoid this clutter and look at some Bruce McDonalds movies. A true Canadian boy with something original that says in film. After 10 minutes, you will not have to go to HIS movies.
