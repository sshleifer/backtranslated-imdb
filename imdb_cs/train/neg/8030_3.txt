He does not like this much. The story is pretty awful and unconvincing. I liked the first 10 minutes, my account is good. Then it was pretty scary. Tim disagrees with the role, she hits herself as her own inflated ass and Pruitt taylor vince is totally unconvincing as a trumpeter. It's an idealistic film, and as a musician, after watching him, he's a little offended. There are scenes from the 1900s to practice or play with colleagues by a group, is totally self-sufficient. It's hard to build a relationship with this kind of character, maybe I'm watching a bad movie. If you have no real passion for life or the sense of what the musicians then all happily indulge in stopping mistrust and watching this waffle.
