When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking for her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes". The closer he gets to the truth, the greater the threat he becomes to his brother-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line) and other local Satanists. They will do everything necessary to stop her exciting ways. If you are on Satanic themed movies, Black Candles has much to offer. The film is full of lots of nudity and ritual soft-core sex. One scene, which includes a young woman and a goat in particular, must be considered credible. Unfortunately, all the stains in the world can not save the Black Candles. Most of the film is a complete hole. In addition to one scene I've mentioned, many sexual scenes are not shocking and definitely not sexy. Actor acting is the best. Even the popular Helga Line genre is disappointing. The story does not really matter. Its main function seems to be to keep the string of mature sex scenes together. I only know one more film by director Jose Ram√≥n Larrazo. Compared to his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror, black candles become amateur. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
