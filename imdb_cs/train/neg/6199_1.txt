First technical review. The script is so slow, it's really a 25-minute story blown up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. "Acting" is pathetic, it seems to have really picked out schoolchildren out of class and read several rows of idiots. As for the whole "point" of the story, "war is wrong" (oh, there is a shock!) It is really nonexistent. Without being "shocked" and getting great publicity, no one would talk about this movie. It's so bad that it makes me bother to think about what better things money could use. Believe me I've seen some bad "imperial new clothes" movies but the only thing I can say to them is at least that they were well shot and well made when the camera in both scenes! Read all other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
