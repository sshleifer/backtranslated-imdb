The premise of this movie is revealed on a DVD box. A textile worker develops a miraculous substance that does not decompose. But the movie does not meet him. Instead, it falls 45 minutes before making a great discovery, overcrowded around the preamble. Since viewers do not benefit much from seeing the boy who is reading things, it is a special step: the film has been successfully prevented from engaging any subject. Once the fabric is discovered, the film is proving to the point that both the bigwig and the blue collar workers want the invention to shatter and leave the film with only two frangible movements; chemical fabrication and run from oppressors. I do not understand why anyone would describe it as a comedy. The tone is not fun or funny. It's a rather serious social critique of that day: that capitalism is threatening both supply chains and production. This in turn hinders innovation in achieving and improving the world. Yes, that is probably true, but without anyone guessing this fact, it's just a serious argument. You'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find somewhere. <br /> <br /> This is more like a British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
