Though the book was not strictly accurate in relation to the real situation she described, she still had a feeling of Japan. I think it's hard to believe that someone who was involved in filming this movie was sometime in Japan because it was not Japanese. Almost everything was terrible. I admit that the actors were generally pretty good, but they could not have the chance to save them. Before the start of the movie, I was surprised that only ten people had been in the cinema on Friday night shortly after opening the film in Japan. For 30 minutes I was surprised to stay. I stayed, so I had the right to criticize it. The whole movie was interrupted by my moans and suppressed laughter not believing my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone who saw me leaving the cinema looked confused and disappointed on my cheeks. <br /> <br /> You owe me two hours to the filmmakers.
