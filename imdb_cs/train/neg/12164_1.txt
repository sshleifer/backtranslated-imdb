this movie is not good. The first of them was almost exhausted, but it had a real end to watch it. This guy has nothing. Here is zero fear, zero voltage or tension. This is not really a horror movie. do not show anything. It's nothing to talk about. It could have been almost television, except for some nudity and a little violence. Even acting is not very good, and you do not even start me. dialog.as for a surprising end, surprise, there is not one. I suppose it could be worse though I do not see how.but then again, it's less than 80 minutes, so I think it's a good thing, even if it was longer. it's probably a cut version of film.i found it at a very cheap price, but it still is not worth it.you need pending more graphic version, check out Anchor Bay edition.anyway, this version Sleepaway Camp II: Unfortunate campers get me big fat . When you look at this movie, you'll probably be a bored and unfortunate camper. If you are a real fan, you may want to pick up an Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp (with a surviving set) with three discs that do not include the first three movies. Special Features
