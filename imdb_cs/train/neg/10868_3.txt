With the story and script that seems to have been written by a college teacher, "Art of Sitting" can not provide a romantic and sophisticated experience that he tries to charge himself. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - men's and women's leadership are "swinging singles (or women's involved,") but "The Art of Seduction" is not even trying. Starting from the sincere exploration of the characters of these two characters, "Art of Seduction", he avoids anything that is the basis, based on a thin, slim stereotype. <br /> <br /> "The art of seduction" is insulting - insulting her characters, insulting men and women and offending the expectations of her audience. It requires the terrible beautiful people we all know and plays their painful interactions while waiting for us to pray. Ji-wan is an immature, corrupt, manipulative female. The viewer is expected to like her and forgive her mistakes because she is pretty. Min-jun, well, it's exactly the same. They're not nice people either. "Humor" in this film primarily focuses on Jiwan and Min-jun extraordinary attempts to overcome each other in the honorable art of lying and manipulating. There is no development of the character and we will never know why the Ji-wan and the Min-jun are like this. We are simply expected to take them as they are and do not ask questions - they are cute! And that's all important. Extensive references to the celebrity of the main actors in the Azzur scene reports can reflect you from "Art of Seduction's willowness". <br /> <br /> If you are still in high school, you like lubricant, or you are a victim of yellow fever, you can enjoy this movie. Despite its "Romance" tag, this is not a good movie.
