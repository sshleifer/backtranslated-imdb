I now look at the pink (Serbian TV station) and I have to say it's crap. Fluent, no acting, effects too careless I think who did this series? It was a stupid attempt by Studio to give even more money to the success of the film. OK. The film was great in 1994 when it was released. But the series? Sometimes you can see how idiotic lines are in the characters' speech. I think they actually paid someone who wrote it, was it a relative in Studio? It's not SciFi. The film was a bomb, the series is being vacuumed.
