I ended up watching this movie before I went through some reviews at the request of a woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me know if there are people who really recommend others watch this movie. I am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that I can conclude that this is a scam. As for my opinion, I have to ask, "Are these filmmakers slow down or do they assume that viewers are slowed down?" The film is so steep, and I'm not even talking about the story or the presentation. So this group of boys plus one girl (the main actress) is a musical group; guessing from the constant presence of guitars is the ROCK band. Hell, when the dancers started to become part of a rock band ??? Anyway, let me take it as a rock band Bollywood-version-of-a-Rock, but fun enough all the scripts that these two guitarists actually do great "ROCK GESTURES" and I guess they play the instruments, the sound of the guitar completely missing !!! I just can not understand the amount of stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I'm just going to end here because it is not entirely justified to point out other bugs in the movie. Bollywood directors have no shame anymore !!!!!!!!
