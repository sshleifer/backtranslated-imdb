This movie is now my benchmark against which all other films will be compared ... as in "Was it as stupid as Revolver?" I was last night at the Toronto International Film Festival where a room filled with more than 2,000 people set off in a mysterious silence after being absolutely stupid after 2 hours of utter nonsense. Jason Stratham would be amazing if he only had a purpose. During the first 10 minutes, Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (soprano fame) made NO SENSE ALL! Then there is some shooting and then Ray Liotta is wearing indecent bikini trousers, then there's some animation, Ray Liotty's naked back end, a lot of shooting, throttling teeth, artistic house wanting to be demanding and more Liotto's tormented body that caused laughter every show . Everybody in this movie they think they are smarter than the average bear, and Guy Ritchie thinks he's a Yogi Bear incarnate. Story lines might not be anywhere, but posing was out of sight! The only way this film could be even worse is if she was Madonna herself.
