I am surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series would really take responsibility. The script is so unfortunate that it has to be written by someone who failed in the Canadian Comedy Writers' Comedy Exam (and that's what it says!). Take a binocular if you want, but nothing that looks like a joke is out of sight. Ronnie Corbett had to be broken enough to be disgraced with this waste. The rest of the cast does not have any kind of acting or comedic ability. I am amazed that it took the first episode - the repairs, the bankruptcy. All I can say to those who are amused is that they have to be very entertaining. It is obvious that the production costs must be up to 100 euros per episode. And if someone thinks I'm commenting as a stranger who is not familiar with English humor, I have to say I'm really English.
