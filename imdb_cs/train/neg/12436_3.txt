The first Home Alone was a pretty decent movie ... the sequel was almost the same in a new environment. This time it tries to be original and to a certain extent succeeds ... of course the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching this time a little changed conspiracy this time. The new score is quite poor (although the new entry "Trap setting" was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the first score of the first and almost - but not quite a good score of the other. It's (almost) invented it with some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same. This conspiracy is fair and somewhat original, but it's still essentially the same movie as the first two, with a worse actor and a less impressive example of "spooky characters that turned out to be good." Playing mostly unbeatable. Characters are mostly cartoon. New thieves are less entertaining than the older ones (and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given that there are a lot of spies and how dear few are). The fact that there is more of them (and more passages) is just a weak attempt to try to go one higher than the first two movies ... and it does not work. The idea of ​​thieves and their mission is also ... adult and serious for children's film (and there was a sexual joke or two, although it's not the first time in a series). It is also unnecessarily complicated as well as conspiracy in general. I could watch it, but I doubt the child could do it. Some of the exposures are so obvious that even children may find it stupid. Animal things are generally not fun. He is less siblings, which means that these people are developing more but have fewer personalities than the best films of the first two films. Overall, it's simply not particularly good or worth watching if you really do not like watching the criminals who are hurt in cartoon violence. I recommend it to big fans of the series. 3/10
