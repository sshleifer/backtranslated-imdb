(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "shareholder" (and I use the term freely) that I have been trying to track for more than a year. I finally ended up and now I wish I did not experience a repetitive effort. In an effort to save two hours of my life, I'll tell you, a guy who has the ability to pull a long blade out of his arm will come home and see his mother. Things get ugly after being defeated by a mafia friend of an old friend. Avenging the men to bring the girl home. Mommy Mafia guys send their men out to avenge while the cops start looking for him anyway. Very little is said. no explanation is actually given for nothing (for example, why they block id friends in the asylum) and the action is largely out of the screen. The film basically consists of a man who looks like Adrian Brody looks intense and does not say anything killing people (outside the screen - most of the action is going off the screen). It looks good, it works well, and there was some reason why it could be a good movie. Damn, I'd like some sense to develop a real character or a story (all we know the guy was chosen as a kid). The film runs for two hours and it's like his six. If they did not tell us anything, they could at least lift the pace, so it seemed to be moving too fast. No, instead, we get a hero to the ship. The hero in the bus, the hero walks, the hero looks upset. Hero with his girl. It really annoyed me because I think it could be a good movie if they just did something, or if someone actually said something meaningful than giving instructions to "get that guy." 4 out of 10 It's about four hours (all my attempts to see) I will never come back. Only for those who want to see an upset Russian action movie with a very small action
