It is a shallow hedonism and / or a social commentary wrapped in a tragic story about how a jealous young woman divides a father and a fianc√©e. Is it incest or just the eyes of the daughter of the Electra complex? Who cares? All the characters except Anna (Deborah Kerr) are empty and ugly. Seberg is poor (I agree with the note "boys with breasts" from the previous review). The conspiracy crumbled. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of the movie, which was unfortunately spread over an hour and a half! If you want to see great gowns and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend "Catch Thieves," in which you will receive added bonus entertainment stories and famous characters. <br /> <br /> I like to have fun on my movies. I personally do not really care where the film is set up. Regardless of time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It will not hurt if I can connect with them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a good performance as well as David Niven in disdainful roles. <br /> <br /> The "2" rating is exclusively for Kerr and Niven, and for cinema - rich color scenes and dark, predictable black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography in the world can not save a bad story with useless characters. Sows are still sows. As a result, I was following this mess with a serious waste of time.
