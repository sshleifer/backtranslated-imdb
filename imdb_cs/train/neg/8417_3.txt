I was expecting a movie release just like any Broadway fan. I waited and read several months of reviews of award-winning performances. I mean the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie could not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? POORLY! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not correspond to the publishing hype, which was dedicated, and the only saving mercies were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. James Brownesque's Eddie Murphy's performance rescues the movie just when Jennifer Hudson's quiet and performance forces you to always pay attention every time he's on the screen. Her performance "And I Tell You" was the only time I felt the hype deserve. You broke up when she asked no good man to let her stay in a group and in her life. As many reviewers have said, they steal a movie from experienced actors and deserve all the awards they receive for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with great voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, are going through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film apparently preceded his extraordinary "Ray's" performance, and Beyonce Knowles was on an expanded fashion shoot or video, she imagined and shimmying her way through the film. Her performance was not so strong that you would take care of her character at any moment in the movie. The movie was too slow, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's "hearty" solo Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
