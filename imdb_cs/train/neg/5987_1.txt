I really did not like the movie. The disruption was very predictable. A typical American conspiracy, I'm sorry. Guy gets the girl in the end. And London has Monorail? Bank of London ??? The Bank of England is what it really is! - But I like the look of Tracy Island and Thunderbirds myself. And the British were bad? (except for Parker and Lady Penelope) What was that about? Oh and they still say things like "Here comes Thunderbirds" - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series why it? I would like to see that it was done again in 20 years with more British people. I prefer the original series. Excuse me!
