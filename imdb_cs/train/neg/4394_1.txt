The John Goodman program was pretty terrible, but it just smelled it. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who has garbled memories of child resistance, but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in recent years. Paranoia directs the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everyone is unpleasant and unreasonable. The plot is predictable, but the show is based on one inexplicable, unrelated scene to the other, in a meaningless way. The worst thing is that no one in the production team seems to ever see snow!
