The game Honey, I Shrunk the Kids was a huge deal, not to mention being very famous. I loved Sweetheart, and when I was young I lost my kids. It was an original story and had such an exciting plot! The series was so amazing and the cast seemed to be talking to each other. Now, honey, I kicked the boy pretty stupid, so I think they want to go back to the story everyone loved. Essentially, Adam is a little older and his mother is about to leave his wife with his children. But when Wayne's favorite object threatens garbage, he wants to shrink and keep them, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the spouses return after forgetting to give their sons some medication, they get into the machine too, and the children stay in the house themselves! The plot is stupid, but as I said, it was just a family movie that I think someone could get a kick. The original baby, "Shrunk the Kids," is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third one was not that bad, I would recommend it at least for the movie Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, it was a bit more fun. 4/10
