It was at 9:30 at my friend's friend's camp and we were so encouraged to watch South Park (the new episode). The point is that South Park will be in my country at 10:30 and we have decided to kill time by watching the show we are now broadcasting, Father of Pride. I'll start by watching episodes only. The first time I watched it, I considered it unfortunate and cruel for nothing, so I thought "Holy sh * t, I have a football match early tomorrow so I have to stop watching silly cartoons." But yesterday I tried to give Father a second chance. I found out that it was the complete tear of The Simpsons, replacing instead only the yellow human lion characters. The second thing is, she wondered why it was TV-14. Simpsons I consider to be much more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is some humorous homosexual jokes. The Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween specials) and raw. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, and I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better, and I think he stayed too much in a thematic family. But I have to admit that Father of Pride has made me a smile three times or four times (even once laughed). Overall, I do not mind, Father of Pride. I hate it, but I do not even like it. I've seen a better way than "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
