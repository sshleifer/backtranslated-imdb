Here's one that you can watch with a straight face, a script so bad, and Will Ferrell would not be in it. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. Punch-Dance. Rod "must go to his quiet place," and before someone can call Kevin Bacon, he signs a passionate, transformed body to a band wishing to have European hair rods. > <br /> 2. John Farnham's You The Voice. In one of those epic sequences, where the star and its cohorts make The Slomo Walking along the main street and the city watchers watch the heel, there is a gag soundtrack. How did the filmmakers meet this artist who is recording the Aussie? A great Australian singer (and true talent) who made the glory in the early 1970s and focused on Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You Are The Voice, John Farnham's Anthem so charming, it compared to the peaks in Switzerland. In addition to these two highest points in the movie - however destroyed by the letter slipshod - the rest of the film is like sucking on someone else. <br /> <Andy Samberg is Rod, an unsuccessful stunt jumper who has never made a jump. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it drives the moped into the darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yeah, someone actually thought it was funny. Without a single jump below the star belt, he plans a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a less-bad comedian, such as Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and at the same time erase cancer and anything ... who watches the plot? On the way (as usual for moronics leads in these comedies), he scores a harvested cat (Isla Fisher), which must surely be slowed to consider the exchange of chromosomes with this loser. Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to call her in her performance - then she changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane had to lose a bet to be here.
