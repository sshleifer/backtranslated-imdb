I never sent a review but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is so bad, I found out that I'm trying to justify how bad it is by treating it as a kitsch or a parody. But it is not. It's really, not-yourself-consciously BAD. This is a serious attempt that jumps heavily. Other reviewers have pointed out many shortcomings of the film, so I'm trying to repeat these things, but I urge you to see this movie. During that time, I was either still, literally exhaled in disbelief, or hysterical on the floor. I have not had so much fun watching the movie in years. Actually, I'm trying to get all my friends to see it because it's kind of a movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur competes as he goes - Boy (his dance is incredible) - Bleed nudity (director / front actor just had to get naked shot) - Office of preacher with cardboard and crayons rendering of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding scene with palms and forgotten rings (what narrative function it plays?!) - The match of the former woman's fight with Ben to get their own weapon - Detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; apparently burning him with this incredibly gruesome death - Yes, gay brother with fantasies and fans with white hair and WeHo fashion - And my favorite is the use of Joplin's "The Entertainer" as an opening soundtrack and "Pachebel's Canon in D Major" as the final soundtrack! - the list goes on and goes on - YOU MUST SEE !!!
