I'm still trying to decide if this is really the worst movie I've ever seen. A very worrying problem with this film is that real scientists are being talked about, but their shots are modified to look as if they supported the thoughts of many BSers who captured this film. The ratio of BS to the interview signal is about ten thousand to one - in the end, respondents seem to say, "We want you to think!" But they themselves are too lazy to simply examine the things they claim to be reality. If you feel that you are open and want to expand your consciousness, please be open enough to read some real books on quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe," Nigel Calder (a Thin Voice, not a Call), "Heaven's Code" Pagelse. If you can not read the book, please do not complain to reviewers that you are "open". <br /> <br /> To recapitulate, this movie is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Do you know what is really a good film that questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor," directed by Roland Emmerich, Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, thinking.
