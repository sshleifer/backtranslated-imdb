It seems to be little in the middle of the country where Watch On the Rhine is concerned. One is either very fond of, applauding his sincerity, his liberal view and subtle acting, or otherwise despising his obvious propaganda, average dialogue, cardboard characters and overall tendency. I find myself very much in the second category and I found the film and play - about the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war - a creepy boring spring that was most suited to acting and even intermittent. This author, Lillian Hellman, was angelic, is irrelevant. Her games were written for people who shared her opinion, and she rarely explored ideas that were not already held by the author and the audience, except to point out how awful the "other side" is. Even if I find myself in a hundred percent agreement with what he says - as in the Rhine - I still can not stand the way he says it. Her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows some possibility for people talking that she has no real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new. I agree with the late resignation of Mary McCarthy, who had destroyed Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who think the theater is dead or in extreme situations and longing for good old times, I urgently need to look at Watch on the Rhine, as bad as in the way of Angels In America, which only shows that the theater had one leg in the tomb sixty years ago.
