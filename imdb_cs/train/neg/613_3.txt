Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a shitty piece of crap. I'm surprised it was as high as that. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: What's wrong with this movie. The story itself is just stupidity and clich√©. Here's almost what it's like ... Some nerdyd boy without buddies is picked, kills and returns like a scarecrow for vengeance. "All" is packed in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time watching. Also, the other is not much better, so do not bother to watch that either ... I rated this movie three because I liked the scarecrow, not because the movie was good. I think you have a picture.
