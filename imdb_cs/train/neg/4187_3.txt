The film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is just over 87 minutes of music video set to doxen or so author songs. Instead of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on Young's texts, which are strongly linked to a sociopolitical commentary to tell a "story" while actors act behind the scenes. Since the musical performance and dirty grain image is an effect equivalent to the fact that Young blows some of his home movies and releases them for public consumption. Although there is a supposedly "story" that is filming through the film, we have no idea what's going on, mainly because of the unappeared appearance of the film, the lack of dialogue, and the amateur obscenity of acting. Everything we get in eighty-seven minutes is a lot of aging hippies, who are quietly banging through disconcerting narratives, while Young's songs endlessly play on the soundtrack. The whole thing turns into a boring exercise in self-responsibility. "Greendale" publishes off-Hollywood, a low budget movie making a bad name.
