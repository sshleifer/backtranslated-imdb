My comment has nothing to do with the political opinions found in the film. In fact, they are quite the same as mine. What happened to me is that when it comes to film, it's stupid and free of any form of story, theme, or dialogue. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that replacing song lyrics that inspire no one but a gathering audience is the same as creating characters that are motivated to talk about events created by a writer or director. The stupid narrative remains irrespective of the iconic heritage of Neal Young. The most childish scene is where the demon dancing to the bar spreads the tonic to an unsuspecting hero who then finds his way to the dance floor to embark on the song Young Song to the hero who does not realize what's going on. Some of these two dream schemes where they will go to the West Coast in search of ????? I apologize to Neal, stick to music and let Steven Stills film.
