If you like to see what had to start as a two-hour film in discontinuous explosions of incomprehensibility, you will love this movie. Otherwise, you would wonder how they could make such a film from something so simple that it could convert to a big screen like Inspector Gadget. The film's views showed many scenes that were not in the movie and in the movie, some scenes just do not make sense. While the movie is somewhat less than 1 hour and a half, I can only think of one really unforgettable moment, and it is just before or during credits! <br /> <br />
