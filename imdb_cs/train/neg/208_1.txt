A terrible movie with Ramones scattered around. Your worse than the average 70th and 80th year of the comedy format of cold children who took over the school with some moody plan. This movie is terrible. The conspiracy consists of a girl who has Ramones and a school trying to fight against her oppressive administration. Forget about this movie and look at something like Wild Zero where Guitar Wolf plays if you want to have a funny movie B. Horrible acting, horrible writing, a terrible plot with a Ramonese approval stamp that probably needed some money fast, so they said yes film. That's the only logical thing I think, because this movie is blowing.
