How can you say that the horror film is terrible? when you can not, of course, laugh! The plot is well covered by other reviewers, so I just add a few things about the merriment of all. Some reviews have placed locations in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens, it seems to be a secret. The Cannibal tribe has adapted to a couple of black women, some blacks, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa who fucks drums ... God the devil is a big black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the "bloodiest" moments in the movie is when "Pablito" finds her partner hanging from a tree covered with an orange cloth that I think is blood starts shouting for several minutes (that's really funny), and then his partner's head falls into the ground and "Pablito" it kicks a bit for what I suppose it's "bullshit" and the eyes are actually moving ... But, of course , then "freak" is gone when you realize that your eyes are moving because the movie is just bad ... <br /> <br /> I did not laugh like that in loooong, and I definitely recommend this movie for Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... catch the beer case and start watching this movie, you will love it! If you're looking for a real horror or gore movie, though ... you do not have to "bother.
