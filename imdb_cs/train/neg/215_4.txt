I have no love like me. Finally, the film expresses the sexual relationship between Alex, Kik and Sandu, their triangular love was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, finally Alex woke up and realized that they had no outcome and future. Going up was sad. <br /> <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was on Sunday at 12:00 AMC in the AMC Theater. On October 8, 2006, we watched the film together. After the film, he told viewers that the effort to create this film, which would express sexual relations in Romanian, was a bit complicated. From my point of view, sex life is always complicated everywhere, I do not feel any movie and no special effect. Alex's and Kiki's and Kiki's love affairs and her brother Sandu were the kind of story of a nearby neighborhood. The two main reasons why I do not like this movie is that the movie did not tell us how they started to fall in love with each other? It seems that when Alex moved to the building where Kiki lives, then two girls fall in love. It does not make any sense at all. How the girl fell in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, you have to imagine and attach these stories to your mind. Secondly, the whole movie did not have the scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that's what I expected? Still, they still had some parts that they deserve to recommend. Part of the "ear piercings" was a little interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of hearing piercing to appreciate Kik's love. It was a moving scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Also the scene they lay on the football field, the interview to express their love was true and passionate.
