Columbo films have been down for years, this year it can get to the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same untrained performance and he's creepy in this movie. As is usual in this series, protocols on criminal acts are unheard of, so sensitivity is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and pulls pantomimes, and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady. (His weak, however, was a horn!) The script was numbered and his supplies patronizing. They should never bring Columbo to the nineties, they left us all with one or two happy memories of clever drawings, better scripts and sharp characteristics.
