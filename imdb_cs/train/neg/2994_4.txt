I've seen this movie twice and I have to say I enjoyed both of them. It's fast and fun, but ultimately hideous. I said he deserves to be damned, because it could be dispelled what might be a good follow-up to the keynote. It is clear that for those who have seen terrible "zombie creeping flesh" it is possible that massive film deficiencies may be owed to Bruno Mattei, and that little that is commendable may Fulci be owed. It's not the inaction of Fulci sycophancy, the styles of directors are sharply contrasting throughout the context, and you can tell who did what, especially in the case of Mattei. The film is centered around the outbreak of the virus (specially referred to as a "top secret" scientist; it is a mystery that is perhaps more remarkable than its potentially apocalyptic effect on humanity) somewhere in Southeast Asia. Virus causes similar zombies in the affected behavior, and the virus spreads rapidly over seemingly any area of ​​the earth. Our protagonists unwittingly go into the endangered area and have to fight for their lives against the hordes of infected Asians. The film seems to be stuck halfway between being a zombie gore flick, and out and out action adventure, and this confusion is best captured by the zombies themselves. They do not seem to have a set common to all. Some of them are regular, soulless mixing of the variety, so well-drawn in the original and probably Fulci's creation here. The second major group consists of those who lost all sense in the infected virus, but suffered a wild aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: They jumped indecisively about whether they would continue to hone their top round technique or engage with their brothers in what looks like a mass applause for their unfortunate victims. Martial arts skills are not their only talent, they are well controlled by tactics of guerilla, they are hidden on rafters and under haystacks and sometimes inexplicably fall from nowhere, but the heavens themselves. This is definitely the work of Mattei. <br /> <br /> There is a third, more shabby, different zombie. This type obviously preserves a sense of irony: "I am really thirsty ... FOR BEAUTY". Sensual intervention at the end when the DJ turns the zombies, but continues to preach about the destiny of mankind, once preached unimpressively, serves only to strengthen the WTF factor and eradicate any hope of serious resolution. <br /> <br /> Then there is an infamous zombie head that slowly drives itself through the air, a funny skeletal smile formed over his face as if to say "Yeah, we know how bad it looks." The characters are absolutely no way you would expect. But it is a pseudo-dynamic dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from seriously taking our misfortunes. He said the first soldier who died had set up an impressively brave display against the indomitable zombie threat. Indeed, this is the first time and perhaps only the time when we hit real zombie agro and one of the best scenes in the movie. The one who plays the principal scientist has a heart, but no talent, uses pauses in his lines quite randomly, so he ends up sounding like a confused asthma. Researchers "on the screen trying to find the antibody are totally unconvincing" now allows to put together these two molecules! "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < fired in the atmospheric scattered light, silenced by the appearance of a fast-paced maimed-in zombie who, in his disgusting despair, grabs everything he has, his utter aggression is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. the hotel that participates in the oldest stage of the outbreak and later as a haven for our protagonists is permeated by a dense, humid atmosphere There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a room that clearly contains the undead hordes and that is quite Things become much more dramatic when they get their eyes they do not know what's going on at the top of the hotel, but it's easy to manipulate and it's not as effective as it could be. Overall, I would say that this film may deserve to be called the royal scale of the potentially effective tropical zombie fest, rather than just a translucent and a bad film. If nothing else, he has a lot of unintentional laughter I have been expecting since the eighties of anything that has become Italian and cruel.
