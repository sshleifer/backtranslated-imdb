I was looking at this film when I was a young boy full of furious hormones and it was probably the sexy movie I've ever seen - or when I saw it. Perhaps it was not a great movie. My guess is that it was not. I do not know much to tell you the truth. I remember only the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie has ever done it to me as incredibly sexy Cathy in this movie. I have not seen it since I first captured it on television in the 1970s and I do not think I want to see it again because I'm sure it will be disappointing - my hormones are not so desperate and I've been through the years has become more poisoned. Still, when I think back on the shower scene, I still remember how great it was when I came back. I set myself up later: After watching the movie again, I found it dangerous to return home again. What has once been erotic is now quite tame. The older woman, the younger man, is still working for me, just not as it once was, probably because I'm not 12 years old. The older woman is now younger than me. Also, the amateur of the whole thing has not been perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Morale: Sometimes it's better to let go back to the past.
