The film is not really horror or science fiction. With a very strong Christian religious theme, this film delivers minimal content and no tension. The second level of actors makes half the decent work when they read their tedious roles. The only good performance is Sydney Penny, who plays the role of mother ... I'm not threatening the movie, it's either Christ or Antichrist. Avoid watching this movie if you are a Christian religious fanatic obsessed with the apocalypse. Being a non-Christian, I had to watch this film just because I wanted to write this review. It is a pity that the Sci-Fi channel had to broadcast this movie in the highlight of the evening.
