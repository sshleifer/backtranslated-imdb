Action: A 4-hour film covers in sufficient detail the event in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999 when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LOC and entered deep into Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To learn more about this story, I suggest to readers to read Kargil reports. <br /> <br /> Comment: If you're looking for an example story in this movie, then you can be sure it's not present. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and lots of charges and blood. The movie hall, where I saw this film, was full of sands and cheering when the film shows Indian bravery. The viewers looked similar to viewers, such as the cricket match between India and Pak. Watch the film as a tribute to the victims of the army and to characterize real war heroes (4 PVC honor heroes) who sacrificed their lives to see this day. The film made a brilliant idea of ​​the army that fought in all circumstances under unfavorable weather conditions. The film's negative is that it's too tight and the songs are extremely boring.
