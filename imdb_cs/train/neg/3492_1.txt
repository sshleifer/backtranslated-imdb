I do not buy kung fu films for conspiracy. I buy them for battle scenes. Bad land can be forgiven for excellent combat scenes, but not vice versa. The story was decent, but it moved too slowly to my taste. There were about 3 or 4 average battle scenes throughout, lasting only a few minutes per second. The last battle was a little longer, but at that moment I was so bored that I did not even pay attention to her.
