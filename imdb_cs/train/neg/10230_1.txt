It happened on this copy. Not mine and if I spent my own money, I would find responsible people and ask them back! All I can say is that it would be a terrible student film. Any understanding of the film's media is missing. The act is god horrible, the story would be rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as non-original and lame, and the change in the tone of the reaction of the lead character to the "spirit" is ridiculous. only agree that "shining" reviews of this movie are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> Amateur in an extreme situation! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
