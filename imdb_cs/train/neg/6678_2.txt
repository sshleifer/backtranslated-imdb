This is a copy of the classic Doris Day in 1948, Romance on the High Seas. The storyline is more or less the same, but it is current. Govinda plays a sharp fellow who will replace her husband on the way. While Rani plays a tall girlfriend of a woman who makes her the same kindness. They seem to try to catch each other while the real husband and wife are trying to train each other in Mumbai. Govinda on the way missing another girl for Sanjiv woman and spies on her while she fell in love Enjoy Rani. Leo plays the dual role of father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are set against each other for a fighting couple. <br /> <br /> It's a bad attempt to copy the original classics and the songs are pretty scary. The comedy is slap-stick and will not laugh too much.
