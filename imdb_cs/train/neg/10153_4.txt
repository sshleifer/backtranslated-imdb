SLASHERS (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> It's not really a good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the creators looked pretty good considering the small budget they had to work on. The film is a seemingly "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants to a closed "dangerous zone" and has three then finally sent to kill them. A survivor, if any, wins glory and wealth ... everyone else just winds dead. The main drawback of this film is that acting is bad. None of the "real" people ever seem to be real. Actors playing killers are a little funny ... because they portray the hilarious and timeless cartoons of popular modern types of horror films ... and that's exactly what they would do if it were a real show. The film pretends we're doing it all in one ... there's a cameraman watching the racers around the "dangerous zone," and everything is seen from the viewpoint of his camera ... but the lights are flashing farther and farther (to hide "cuts" from one take over to another, I would imagine).
