Holy @ #% & this film was still warm and juicy out of pile it was made. I tried to keep track of this wasteful pile of rubbish, but it was better for me to knock on the wrist and the slug back the shoe cleaner on the Lysol floor than to withstand more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I find it very much like anything I've ever watched on film or television, and it says something. Once I saw a cow in the field. I was looking at the steam pile for an hour and a half who knew ... something could be different. Well, the time was spent better than watching this tribe. The act did not exist, the plot was somewhere else than on this film. I think I saw a cut seen early, where he managed to escape and drove back in the back of an old pickup that heads to Portland in the hope of becoming Steven King shi77er. Say the director gets the drugs he desperately needs. It is quite clear he needs heavy drugs and I wanted to avoid the money needed to reverse his lobotomy. Bah ... I can not give this insight the full stroke she needs because nothing so painful can ever make justice in the written word itself. Let me just say that if you want to look for some time and see Chilton on the stand, go to the car, start the engine and then pull both fists straight into the fan until you feel your bones vibrate. Make sure you have your wallet in hand also because you would like to exchange money. You could have the advantage of wasting them yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched it after my "friend" sent my girlfriend to see it. Jesus was coming, he had. Even worse is that you have to look at this $ & @ thing TWICE! I hear they marry and visit their balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
