Anyone who wrote "Redline" as a great car movie, Daniel Sadek must be paid to support this ultra-flamboyant, hot pile of amateur crap. Easily the worst automobile movie or any other movie. This means Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. Take every sizable clich√© of the 80th Action TV Series, put in yourself really dirty special effects and lame characters with no meaning, and you have vivid proof that Daniel Sadek would not write scenarios and produce movies but he should stay in the real estate business. This is such a lame film with such a lame conspiracy and the most invented action sequences. What offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots, but that they consider a movie that is public enough idiots to make it fall.
