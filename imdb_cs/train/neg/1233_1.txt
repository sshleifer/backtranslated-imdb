Oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. except for a point that seems to be written for five years. script, acting, and even the props and filming of this movie were unnoticed. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually critical of any movie because everyone has their own style. But this movie was probably the worst movie I saw in 2008. I can honestly convince you that this movie is unknown and I think it should stay like this because movies like these make the thriller genre a joke. /> <br /> I advise everyone who is a fan of thriller films, or even simply movies to get away from it.
