Burt Kennedy was a very good director, but you would never know him about this carving mess. Not only is this movie looking cheap, it's cheap - most of the fighting scenes have been picked up by the far superior "The Last Command" since 1955, and these shots, taken 32 years ago, look more contemporary than anything in this picture. Several action scenes that have actually been shot for this film are disordered, confused and incompetent and look as dirty as the rest of the picture. It has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget does not seem much more). It moves like molasses, it's mostly over ham or under coma - though Raul Julia looks better than most of the rest of the cast - and it's full of annoying historical inaccuracies. Moreover, it is too long. If you are going to make a boring movie, do it in an hour or an hour and do it - do not overdo it in three hours as it does. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, check out the John Wayne version of 1960 or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. It is hard to believe that six producers shot a movie that is so bad. Skip it.
