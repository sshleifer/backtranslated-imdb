The film itself is not too bad; many comments pointed to the obvious drawbacks of the scenario, but it is observable. What really makes me a mold is that people like Justin Timberlake even get into movies and movies like this one. I have to admit that I have never heard the name of a man before I was watching, but when he appeared, I was just angry. The voice is dirty, the face is a bad reflection of Legolas, the posture is terrible and even can not properly coordinate all three. I said I was pleased to have jumped out of the disco because I had hoped that only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey would be there. Pity I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give very good performance and are the main reason I'll do it. 4. I'm recording many new movies with little actor Timberlake ... and I can not believe it.
