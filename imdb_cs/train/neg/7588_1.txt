Notice to potential viewers: If you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The Most Dangerous Game", look elsewhere. The "Seven Women for Satan" only superficially solves the original work using the name of Zaroff and those mentioned in the murder of the character. Some of the following may be considered by some of the spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff plays writer / director Michel Lemoine. While his predecessor hunted men, because it was the only prey that was really demanding, the victims of Boris are usually in a position where they can not resist. The film stretches from scene to scene with almost complete lack of clarity. It seems that the director completely ignored the stimulation and left the audience with a soulfully boring film. Several individual scenes are slightly interesting (such as the Torture Rake Sequence), but as a unit the film does not succeed. Viewers who are more interested in the range of attractive and semi-attractive actresses at various stages of stripping can find the movie traceable. Most of them will probably find that their time is better spent watching Mentos ads. <br /> <br /> In the second letter, the DVD Extras contain a great deal of information about the history of the movie. It seems to have been forbidden for several years in his native France, which has largely destroyed any chance he has for widespread dissemination.
