(Avast, light spoilers forward) I got this tape from my local library that keeps a copy for obvious reasons. Once I went to Matewan in West Virginia and in a small museum I saw a schedule for Citra City Theater in May 1954. Movies would change in the theater every day. Since there would be no television in the next ten years, it was a lot of the entertainment available in the city. "Raid" seems to have been created for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although it was not mentioned for this month, I'm sure he showed some Monday or Tuesday night for an audience that was probably not too demanding. Historic attack - courageous and remarkably successful - does not seem to be very well explored, so the film is full of Hollywood decorations, including a free cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice as Liberty Valance. It seems that St. Albans had more Yankee soldiers arriving and passing through the city than Washington DC. What really made me when the robbers turn into Confederate uniforms. Only in the colors of the civil war, the Rebel uniforms look so inviolable. When Anne Bancroft's son caught Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. And then there's Anne Bancroft. When watching the movie, I actually looked at IMDb to see if there was another Anne Bancroft. Student contract studies do not look like in her later films and she has no presence she would later have in "The Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God" and of course "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> You only need to see 1). you live in St. Albans and 2). you have to kill a few hours at the Hollywood Ficcialization of the biggest news of your home town.
