In all low budget history. this film must be one of the worst. The truth is some humorous movies, but in general it was just horrible. I just can not understand what one can not go out with a lot of slugs. I think he must be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part that is worth in this film is the close-up of snails trying to bite a man's finger. That was quite fun.
