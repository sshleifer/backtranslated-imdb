As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected this movie to look and shout laugh, as AMC saw it as a comedy. I was never disappointed with the movie! Cary is the usual charm and effortless comedy AWOL from the whole movie; he finds himself tense, bored and not alone. The Mississippi character belongs to one of the worst stereotypes I've ever witnessed - its accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, according to which the Mississippi part claims to come from) and whenever it delivers the line, it's a few decibels higher than any other cast member . Mississip tried to stand out in the film as a pretty goofball country, but eventually he managed to frustrate himself from a weak conspiracy. Mansfield looks more like an obscene blowing doll than a Hollywood sexual kitten, and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability, she screams that she never had this ability to start. The nature of Ray Walston was sweet and confident. For the four men on the shore it was the holiday I had ever seen. I have been watching this nightmare until the end of her conclusion, and while I'm not going to spoil anyone, I'll tell you it's the smoothest thing you ever see. The film is trying to revive patriotism and a sense of debt to men fighting, but this film lacks this point entirely due to its weakness and weakness. Sorry, Cary!
