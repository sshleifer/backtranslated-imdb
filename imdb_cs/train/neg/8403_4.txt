I gave it to four of the historical context. It has been considered lost for many years until it emerged from blue on Showtime in the early nineties. Moe is a direct man and Larry and Curly act as a duo. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I think it had something to do with ranch work. I'm not entirely sure, because the conspiracy is so minimal that I do not find anything in my mind. I vaguely remember it to be a western musical comedy. Stooge seems to be moving. Overall, there is nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> If you are not a Stooge fan then do not bother. If you are a Stooge fan, keep your shorts.
