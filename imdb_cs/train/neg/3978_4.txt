When there is a certain improvement in achievement in Rome. As it got there, I found out that it was too predictable, sad and slow, and I still consider it the worst twins of Olsen. However, while there is not a terrible movie in Rome, it's not even a great movie. If I had to summarize it in one word, I would say that it is simple. It's a good fun for teenagers, but I think adults will not find much that could go on. Having good points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are really a decent actress, certainly very nice. I admit, when I was about ten, I really liked them and generally like it. And I enjoyed some of their films like Passport To Paris and New York Minutes. At the target, both girls do not do such a bad job, in fact they are very attractive. And their clothes must die and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is not even bad. <br /> <br /> However, where the image is reduced, it's on plot and script. The script is mostly clich√© and has hints already in vu. The imitation, like most of Mary Kate and Ashley's films, is highly predictable, and anyone familiar with any other work of Olsen's twins can find many non-original elements. Most of the characters are thin cardboard and you do not learn much about them, and sometimes the tempo is uneven. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery is spoiled by a slapdash camera that seems to be constantly moving. Overall, she has good points and is certainly observable. However, for my taste it is a harmless and predictable teenager fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox
