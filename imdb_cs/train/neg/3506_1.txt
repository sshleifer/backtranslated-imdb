I would not be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say that it can be a good show .. This show is good only if you do not know what "talent" is ... I will not even say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to many people) because it's not really what bothers me on the show .. What troubles me is that people are watching it and thinks it's funny. It made me feel like ours Generation gets stupid and I'm actually afraid it will someday be driven by people watching this waste. Basically, the conspiracy is simple .. it's about offensive, center-worn, frightened women ( Sarah Silvermen) goes through everyday life .. <br /> <br /> So it is not done a million times .. In fact, almost every joke is either finished or racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing .. I like her voice .. it's .. no lyrics .. Lyrics are horrible .. she likes to sing about a lot of things .. <br /> <br / > If you want to see hot women, you put others down and make it feel like crap while at the same time farting and saying crap about each race, then this show is for you ..
