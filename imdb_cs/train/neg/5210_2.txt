First let me be honest. I did not want to watch this whole movie. I watched for the first five minutes, and when I realized I was almost asleep, I decided to see it so quickly and see if it was later interesting ... No. This film is just a collection of humble attempts to record a story that is already uninteresting and misunderstood in something that would never happen: a decent horror film. Because I feel it is important to say that even a film with bad special effects can be good if it is well made. This movie is not and will only be in deep sleep if you try to watch. Finally, I think it's important to say that I think this movie is in the publicdomain, so if you feel you have to absolutely watch it, than littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you do not have to pay to watch that stack of cinematographic dung.
