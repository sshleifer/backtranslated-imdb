First there is the Gujarati Theater and then Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fans. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theater when he produces Bollywood production. He first created Aankhen (adapted from the Gujarati game) - which had a unique plot but could not hold it as a Hindu film. Now he has adapted it to another game of Gujarati and named her Waqt - a race against time. In short, emotions are alien. Land development is not intended for Hindi movies. For example, the role between father and son is best left to the Gujarati theater - do not bring it to Hindu film. Even a comedy song is best left for the Gujarati scene. All performances are average - nothing we should scream about - to prevent Shefali Chhaya Shah, which is fantastic.
