OK we get straight to the point. We have five newest college degrees (we have to specialize in word F) who are going to a weekend camp trip. They enter someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to set it on fire. A nice group of people. Some of them begin to go sick - something must be in the water in the cabin where they are housed. But neighbors seem to be alright. Well, when things start to get really bad, they lock one of their companions instead of helping (trying out a neighbor by the way). Some locals do not like it. They are driving at high speeds in the forest for many miles until the truck breaks. Somehow, after ten minutes, he appears in the cabin (how he can find and how he can travel at the speed of light to get a secret there). Another type of brain in the cabin realizes that there is something wrong, so he is hiding in the cave to keep it. Then the next day he decides to return to the cabin because he believes it must be some type of sanctuary. He is skillful with the relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24-hour mistake). Unfortuneatley meets some friendly policemen who are not so friendly. Another couple decides to have sex while the massage is working on their magic, and then women realize they need to shave their legs (they take a lot of sick skin with a shaving cream). Anyway, you have an idea. Nothing makes sense to us. These are five people I do not want to be friends with. I was rooted for bacteria consuming meat. Other characters were introduced, which were also somewhat fun, but totally unattractive. Nine minutes of good life are here.
