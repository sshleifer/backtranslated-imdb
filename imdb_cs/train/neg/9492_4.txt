One star for "fence". One star to play. One star for dubbing the American whistle. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with a tendency to take off all the clothes. And ten out of ten behind the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before she did "Manon des sources". Béart is also stripped several times, but even fully dressed her presence is enough to make this film extremely observable. Watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three "first times" for the girl. It's a terrible but much more erotic than a ridiculously choreographed "love scene" in which Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau play. By the way, cinematography is not great; The photos for the final credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton can do.
