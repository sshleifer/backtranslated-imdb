First is the head of Brad Dourif KOOK. If you are trying to take this movie seriously, then it will guarantee it will destroy it for you. If you do not take it seriously, then it's really fun to watch. As with other reviewers, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif claim their love for each other - in that they avoid flames from the flames in the car. Another great camp scene was looking at John Landise, who, as the governor of the radio show, was bothering around the room. In fact, I found out that the last 15 minutes of the film is a constant laugh - I'm not sure if Tobe Hooper thought it.
