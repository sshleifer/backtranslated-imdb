Imagine pulling a deadly murderer's mask and find Barbara Cartland ... that's what happens to this movie. Success has shown promise, but soon all the pretenses will fall, that it's a thriller (or even an imaginative love story), and the only reason she did this story is clearly clear: filling the gap in her female market with a woman's view by creating another re -Hash of a "bad-guy, annoyed bad boy" (Andrei) meets an innocent, moody beauty "(Paula). <br /> <br /> Rather than waste time creating the original premise, filmmakers went straight to the money : A bad boy was twisted by this moody beauty, followed by a series of unexpected and heavily cliché of love scenes sprinkled with pseudophylosophical / poetic fuzziness.Andrew's admission to being a "poet" is poised to capture perceived qualities that would the Byron hero should have been - but although we are in hard and underlined writing, who and what is, it's still hard to believe - or care. <br /> <br /> In order for the Byron hero / anti-hero to work, the story needs gentleness, style, and innovation - all missing here. It's not a modern Phantom opera, it's exactly what happens when a weak and fairly stupid woman (with a free elastic button) encounters a bad man who, after meeting with her, looks dangerous as a bunny slipper. <br /> <br /> Performances could save this movie if they were good: a female leader is interested in looking for sexy and "alien", no matter how forced or ridiculous; and Poor Dougray Scott seems to have been a drug when he shakes his part. That's not his best job. Flashes of interest brought Jürgen Prochnow as "Vashon" and Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / brother. A better film would have left his sister and brother instead.
