It must be one of the worst movies of the nineties. When my friends and I were watching this movie (the target audience they were targeting), we sat down and watched for the first half an hour when our jaws touched the floor as badly as it was. The rest of the time all the others in the theater just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying in their popcorn that they actually paid the money they were trying to watch this weak excuse for the movie. It had to look like a great idea on paper, but it looks like no one in the movie has any idea what's going on. Crap actresses, costumes. I can not see how to fight it. Save your hour and a bit of your life .........
