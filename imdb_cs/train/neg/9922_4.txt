He grew up, Joe Strummer was my hero, but I was even cold with this movie. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward documentary "For Music". Rather, it is a biographical artistic film, full of conversations, executive shots, home movies, and mostly unnecessary animation sketches raised from Animal Farm. The film is coherent, but it lasts for about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The campfire format, while touching thought, is actually quite uncomfortable in execution. First, without titles, it's hard to even know which of them are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack in his butt licking hosannas about men? They were not important to Strummer's life, and their opinions did not contribute to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture is best when Strummer, through interviews and interviews, touches aspects of his life that most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother who is coping with the deaths of his parents, the joy of paternity. For me, it was the most moving thing because Joe Strummer showed it not as a punk icon we all knew and loved, but as an ordinary human being who has to cope with the joy and sadness of life, we must all face it. <br /> <br /> There were better and clearer documents about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends and the MTV documentary Kurt Loder from the early 1990s). Joe Strummer: The future is unspoken, it's just for life.
