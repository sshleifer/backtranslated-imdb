As a huge fan of only the first two BSG seasons and a separate BSG Razor show, I was hoping that this edition will return the franchise to its original glory days. I usually have no problem with science fiction, which is mostly dialogically controlled over the visual fancy of special effects. If the scenario is tense with some original ideas brought by good actors, you can create a deep film with small amounts of CGI expended. This prequel does not have any of the above requirements. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply designed to increase the release rating to Restricted. Not that teens do not like virtual reality mosh pit full of sex and violence and heavy dance music. Its part about the very teens who have intellectual depth and intellect or political and religious passion to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers who confuse me. These kids are definitely not on this planet. The movie is played as a soap opera which has been a little interesting in the past 10 minutes. The scene with Eric Stolz, who gives his cyborg, becomes a conscience by upgrading student firmware, was fun, if not fun. But this old concept was much better rendered and much more believable in the brilliant, classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica tears off her only interesting idea from old Hollywood horror. No surprise! Overall, this film was lighter and non-original and cheap looking, using the recycled CGI Caprica from BSG. I doubt I'll be watching this space soap when it's premiered on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless, of course, I'm going to suffer from a bad bout of insomnia, when this show is definitely a cure. Zzzzzzzz
