The psychology of this movie is really strange when we try to find out. It's often billed as a RPG movie, but it's really not that easy. There are obvious contradictions that make me think what (if any) they are trying to do about the game. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is probably the worst when he just did not succeed from another school and still deals with a brother who disappeared and could be dead. <br /> <br /> Several times he mentioned playing the game and working on real-life problems. Finally, when they look at Robbie (Hanks), they are all happy and well adapted, starting to devote their teenage career, solving problems, giving away games (Daniel does not want to design a computer game), and even Robbie's mother who was constantly drunk and unhappy, is suddenly happy home, looking for fresh and bright and arranging flowers. <br /> <br /> Sure, JJ suddenly (and looks cheerfully) decides to commit suicide, but the reason seems to be entirely because he is a lonely genius who can not get the date and not because his character dies, as well as in the famous Jack Chick tract (which happens after all, and it seems to do so intentionally, so he can end the Daniels game and bring him all to come to play his.) In fact, the prospect of playing live events in caves seems to be the only one a thing that saves him before he's killed!) And what's the best script in the whole movie, Kate looks very good in the chain mail, looks directly at the camera and says, "The worst monsters are in our own minds . " <br /> <br /> The greatest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers who walk through the rich couple to rob a dirty, homeless boy looking at his magical beans. The recurring theme ("The road we were" for the 1980s) could be definitive at the end, but as a way to start the film is totally depressing and seems to be in place. And for one mysterious mystery, our hero, full of Parada regalia, has a psychotic break, becomes his character completely and embarked on his quest, so of course the first thing he does is change to 20-year-old street wear. <br /> <br /> So perhaps the movie is irrational, but I think its dealing with an irrational theme. In those days, the circle of dice and pencil children was considered to be corrupt and possibly obsessed, and you might be crazy if mumbo-jumbo were talking to you. Paranoja against the game is largely summed up in the first scene where a reporter asks the policeman what is going on, the policeman says the children in the tunnels have lost and there is a chance Mazows and monsters are involved in some way. The reporter admits that the game is very familiar (although it allows its children to play it), then turns to the camera and leans from a polished game that blames the game for everything and does not allow any further explanation. Ultimately, his masterpiece, but interesting as films made for television go.
