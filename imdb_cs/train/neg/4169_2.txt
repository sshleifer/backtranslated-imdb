I gave her just because Natassia Malthea (as Vampire Quintana) looks in this sexyoo sexy movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, there is very little logic for this movie, but it's also the most sci-fi vampire flicks. The film is probably too trying to break away from traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only absurd but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are too many gore and too many scenes that made me feel sick. A good movie about vampires should be far more sensible than to see a lot of blood - we all know when the vampire jumps to the guy who does what the vampire does. Several stones or screams are all they need to describe the scene (as at the end when Quintana tries to sexually awaken Rosa, all he needs is a few stones, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
