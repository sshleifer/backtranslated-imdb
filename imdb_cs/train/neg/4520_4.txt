Irwin Allen was great. All his TV shows had a great pilot or first episode. the rest was basically rip offs of his other shows. Several episodes of the Robinson family in Switzerland were the tearing of older television shows. One episode of the Swiss family is identical to the Land of the Giants episode when a party member needs a surge operation. The show had a high budget and was too expensive to continue. Irwin has lost touch with TV shows since the 1960s. Playing with Martin Milner is strong. The child stars who got there start with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. one bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his catastrophic scenes like typhoon and volcanic eruptions that copy him "Master of Disaster"
