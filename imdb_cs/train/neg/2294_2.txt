Poor Paul Mercurio. After landing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find out he was doing a lot of rubbish. None of the characters in this movie is very insurmountable or even hateful, but Mercurio's lead is a kind of person you do not want to ignore - completely unmanageable and wearing OVERALLS. Big mistake in costume design.
