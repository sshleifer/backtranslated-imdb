I'm usually a very generous critic, but in the case of this movie I must say that it was incredibly bad. I am amazed at how the majority of reviews seem to be positive. There were some beautiful shots, but it's bad that they were unnecessarily lost on this film. Perhaps it would work if "Daggers" were a purely action film, not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between the two couples that exists between Mei and her men, it seems to be more desires than love, and for the most part, the dialogue is just stupid. This can only be a translation problem, but the frequent use of the word "flirt" reminded me in particular of the 8th class, not the head above the heels, together forever, the worthy-dying - for love; I also felt that we were overcome by the wind metaphor. The audience has very little information about attitudes that really matter, and therefore very little emotional investment in the film as a whole. I wanted to take control of the fast forward, I had fallen into my place, ready for snoring, but mostly I was just crunching a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, the ice on the cake. Or rather by adding insult to injury. The end was really one of the worst, more mixed ones I've ever seen. The boys have their struggle with a deer and scream, scream and hook each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger in the heart) suddenly jumps out of the weeds. He then throws the dagger, which seems to take about 5 minutes to reach the target, and even slows the midscreen to hit a small blood drop. Wow, cool. Well, finally, Mei dies, I think, because she threw a dagger that was stored in her chest and bleed. Jin sings, sobs, keeps his body close, the screen is empty. Me and the people who surround me are giggling. It's not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning but ultimately failure.
