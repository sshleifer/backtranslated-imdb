This film deserves work at the Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it's worth watching, because it's an unintentional conversation. Really! It's worse than "Destroy All Monsters". Make sure you realize the following: a cheese medallion (looks like Shriners), of course the Norfolk polyester jacket on "Allan Quatermain", David MaCallum is a bad stutter (which draws attention from his even worse acting) incredibly bad process works on all the monsters, the monsters - a hand puppet that threatens a girl, a huge snake that threatens the Macallum, sinking in oat, red eyes on motorized crabs, an amazingly cheery ship (oh, brother!) that seems be made of plywood mounted on old sand and looks like the remains of Jr.Sr. prom ("Traveling to the Future with the '71" class), the Phoenician city - where the Roman imperial armor is worn, but inexplicably Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come!) and the worst of all, Macallum and Ekland ) playing smoochy-face-oh horror! The best thing is that clumsy explorers manage to lose a comic Frenchman, and the African guy - Snuffleupagus or whatever - apparently decides to die heroically rather than be in other scenes.
