I was probably spoiled by seeing the 1973 version for the first time with Michael Jayston and Sorce Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is so disappointing. I just did not have any chemistry between the two major stars. Lots of observation and theatrical acting just do not do it for me, and that was all about being Tim in Rochester. If the director of the movie actually read the book? Very strange! He's a good actor, but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! And Zelah was simply, well, strange, a little mixed pair. In his favor, the support cast was quite good, and the scenes for me, Lowood, were the best of the adaptation, but overall she did not get any charm of the novel. He certainly would not ask anyone to see her as a true adaptation of the novel. Great flight!
