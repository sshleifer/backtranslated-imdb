Someone actually compared this movie in some ways with High Noon. Now it's a real stretch! I'm a big fan of Sinatra, including some of his acting roles, but maybe the only person who could play this role would be Don Knotts. First, as somebody has pointed out, Sinatra simply does not have to build a western bad-guy wannabe. At this point his life is too "mild". Perhaps she was the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a relatively rigid structure. Sinatra meets a big talking little boy who no one should take seriously. The story is uninitiated and is not really credible. I do not want to spoil it, but I think the end and how the city's inhabitants react in this story is useless. Another thing, these people are always allowed to be completely controlled by some "bad guy." It's just a small town, so I do not have the attraction, I do not even understand why people would be so controlled. <br /> <br /> There is "love interest" in the story, and if I watched it right, she was upset when the main character refused to admit who it was that someone else did not kill him. Now there's a real love for you. "Stand for yourself! Tell him your name to kill you!" LOL. Stop, you're killing me. Unfortunately, the basic concept of the film is not good enough and no matter how they tried, this story did not have a logical path that should follow otherwise than in the trash bin. Want to know why this is not on the video and never seen on TV? Critics in 1956 seem to have stepped in and were right - this film is pretty bad. I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone as deep as six as much as possible. Do you want to see a good western where the city is against a bad guy? Try the Tension on the Rock Table or Gunpoint - two really, really good Westerns with this theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you've been the greatest singer ever - but you did not belong to such a movie.
