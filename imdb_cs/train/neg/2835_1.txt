There was one scene where -dolphin- probably claims Bo (or Bo Dolphin) to ask "to go make eggs". When we read the script, we've - we heard ... <br /> <br /> We did not do any part of this movie in our facility even though our dolphins were - in "The Big Blue!" <Br /> <br /> It must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he has fun in this movie because he definitely did not do anything for his link.
