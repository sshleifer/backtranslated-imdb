I heard about this movie sometime ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of expectation and excitement when we both heard it was a terrifying movie, really scary. How was I disappointed? VERY!!!! In addition, one scene (we all know which bit) NEVER happened! I was expecting to see the woman in black in a couple of times, and she was going to do some jump scenes, for example, she would appear at the window or walk along the corridor or something. what is a spooky, gripping, atmospheric film. I just did not see it, I'm afraid. Perhaps there is a difference in what people in the United States are doing terribly here in Britain. Great after all hyped reviews :(
