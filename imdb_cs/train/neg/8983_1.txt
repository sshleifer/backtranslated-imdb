Ulises is a literature teacher who arrives in the coastal city. There he fell in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in town. The torrent romance begins, ending with the tragic death of Uli≈° by the sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in town, living in a quiet, happy life surrounded by money. One day, the revelation of Ulises causes her passion to rise and act without thinking about the consequences. This conspiracy is quite absurd and none of the actors play a decent role. In addition, three-quarters of the film is a sexual act that is still well recorded, quite tedious because we want to see the story develop further. It's just a bad film Bigas Luna who has a lot of sex, no arguments and silly characters everywhere.
