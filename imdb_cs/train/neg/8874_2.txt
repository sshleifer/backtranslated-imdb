but there is not much of them. Probably the worst "major release" movie I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. It does not make sense to comment on story, cast or acting. The problem is over everyone. It's the absolute stupidity of an annoying kind (not a funny kind) of what's happening on the screen. I do not know why I gave her 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably due to Steven Martini. He really tried it. Bottom line - 95 minutes flushed the toilet along with several brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
