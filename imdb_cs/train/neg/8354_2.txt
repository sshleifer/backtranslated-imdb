Any movie in which Brooke Shields emerges from Fonda will be both an anomaly and horror. Shields are in fact just bad because they are young, inexperienced and apparently not well guided by their stars. Peter Fonda is bad because it's good because it's bad. I loved it in Ule's gold, a few years later, but Lord, it's terrible. Not that someone else is good. There is no single performance (except Henry Fonda's beautiful portraits), which is even acceptable. I have never seen a movie with many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the main villain, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and direction because he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is embarrassing ham. Writing is simply bloody and actors can not be accused of the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! Editing and direction are worse than pedestrians. The shots are too long for no dramatic reason or cut off before it can hit the scene. This picture was far worse than I imagined and would be completely forgotten (and probably never) without the participation of several famous names. One clear point: Grand Canyon's cinematography is beautiful and captures the beauty of the area, even in large-scale Imax productions. Finally, either this is a bad version of Moon paper, with a cute pair of father-daughter types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a significantly more icky romantic relationship between forty-something and 13-year-old. It suggests more than the other, and is therefore quite worrying.
