one of the worst movies I have ever seen. An amazing action scene and really bad dealings do not help either. The only good point is part of Gary busey, but this movie does not really raise. she lives up to her B movie and passes the flying color test. I lost my money, even though I found the fun to start bothering after a few hours. I do not recommend this movie if you do not miss it or its gift. (you can request a receipt for a gift and send it back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
