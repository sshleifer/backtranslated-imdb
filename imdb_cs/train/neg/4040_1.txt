I find myself a little snob when it comes to everything and although film experience is more suitable for explosions than high drama, I can also be very crazy around the movies, too. <br /> <br /> Not all art movies are better than King Kong. I think it would probably give Kong two stars, double this movie. <br /> <br /> My guess is that people have been so upset because it was almost identical in style to what you see in the game. For less demanding artists, a movie that looks like a game is "great art". The film was useless. <br /> <br /> so he relied on high drama. The only drama in this movie was whether a cat would fall out of the roof or not. So a deep and meaningful dialogue? No, great acting? It would hardly be too much. Some sceneries were interesting, though: Communist dwellings, city outlooks (Petersburg?) And Soviet trams are still in operation.
