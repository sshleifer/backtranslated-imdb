This film is described as action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi show that it's a humorous gangster film. The introduction of ridiculous female lead, however, begins with a series of ridiculous plots that hide little to hide the end. The film moves between comedy (the description is used freely) and the surreal drama with some out-of-context adult scene throw in. The lead woman (Angel of the title) is mistaken and the actress is not helped by a script that requires some incredible, extreme extremes of character to be displayed. James Belushi is the only one who can handle his role well but is also disappointed with the bad screenplay. One to avoid.
