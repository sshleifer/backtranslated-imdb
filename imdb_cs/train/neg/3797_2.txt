Years since Alex Rain (starring Olivier Gruner in the first film) came across a terrible plot that included people's replacement, but since then there has been a war between cyborg people and humans, and we have lost, now a supermomanian species that is a daughter the character of Olivier Gruner (which also emphasizes only half of her minimal acting ability), which in my opinion represents the film's minimal connection with the first, but when the superflora is created, it is hidden in 1980, while the hunter of the future is hunted by this confusing sci-fi clunker . Nemesis became a cult hit that I see why people liked me even though I was not a fan of this movie. Nemesis was very ambitious to come up with various ideas, develop a beautiful look and provide a lot of action, almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have this ambition, it's a cheap tear-off of The Terminator with a muscular woman who is so low on the acting ability that Olivier Gruner looks like a master of thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive range that was the main selling point of the original. I admit I was not a fan of the original, but I deserved a better result. Also in the original, a good actress like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and Jackie Earle Haley, who is not interested in this, is a boring film with a challenging atmosphere. In fact, after seeing it, it inspired the addition of half the star to the original. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
