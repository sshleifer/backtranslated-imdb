Pictures that usually celebrate the hero are important. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde celebrated dynamic bank robbers, and you really felt sympathy for their evil deeds. Why? They were two people who were caught in depression when people were desperate to survive. This film has absolutely no substance. The character Viggo Mortensen will soon appear as a folk hero. Why? He quickly drove along the Idaho highway on his way to the hospital where his wife suffered. Nobody bothers to understand why they try to escape everyone. Worse yet, when it turns out he's not a red-throated terrorist, no one in government wants to help him when he tries to save his back. Jason Priestley likes to play Emcee, who builds the story to support our hero. <br /> <br /> The end is totally unbelievable.
