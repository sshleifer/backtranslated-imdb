this movie is terrible. The characters are totally unbelievable and wildly inconsistent. The plot is terrible and some of the scenes in the classroom are clumsy and cause uncomfortable viewing. In fact, the quality of the script and characterization would suggest that this film was written by high school students, only the complete lack of credibility of the school environment would suggest that writers probably never went to high school. Most of them were weak, although much of this was a bad scripting and plot, I'm not sure any of the actors could make this movie traceable. <br /> <br /> He said the track sound was ok and the cinema was nice on the site (though the editing was bad).
