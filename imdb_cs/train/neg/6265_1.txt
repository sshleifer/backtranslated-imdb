I became a nephew of the director. It took me years to get my hands on a copy of this movie and I can say it's really one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle no longer has one copy (I have asked). I look forward to his copy. <br /> <br /> At present, the average movie rating is 1.9 / 10. If I can say, it should give it somewhere in the mid-1930s in IMDb "the bottom 100", but only with 206 votes that have not yet been . <br /> <br /> It's sad that the film does not even have respect for the lower 100. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I give movies to members of the family a copy of the film this year for gift presents. Best / worst gift ever?
