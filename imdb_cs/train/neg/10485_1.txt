The dark, comical memory of a vendor of cosmetics with strange ties to Elvis Presley, who spreads to the sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while talking on conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them with a small mistake. Kim Basinger, still an attractive actress with great credit, likes to pick the special films that are being played, but this dreadful script (Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have a good humor. Stereotypes and gags with low balls are not thought of as classic comedy, but also on a dishonorable, shameful level, the image is rough and careless. If you look, you will see if you can count how many other shots the Basinger is behind the wheel of the pink Cadillac, the hands are always in the same position and do not accumulate on their faces. Hopefully she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS from ****
