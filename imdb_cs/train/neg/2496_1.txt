I would put this film under the horror film genre. I did it because I do not know about a horror genre. Since the horror genre is closest to the horrible, I decided to put it in this category. The game was amateur. You know who the villains will be in the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Students of film making should have this film as an example of what they should not do in the film. It is bad. A bad word is an understatement. The villains take the ocean line and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered to the populated Rose Island in the Pacific. After spending money, they will sit. There is no escape plan. How stupid. Female director Cruise is a former police officer, naval seal, kung fu I am afraid of. The cheerful part is a way of devaluing a time bomb. He says he knows what he's doing, and he still holds all the wires one by one. Then he puts it in his pocket and according to the film with all the joins connected. Is he crazy? Like a mad man who watched the BROWN. If you have M-i-L, you do not like it. To bother her renting this movie and pretending you like it. I assure you that she will tell her husband that you are so badly and that her son / daughter has married a person below her family standard.
