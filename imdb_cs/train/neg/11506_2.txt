This movie story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I do not quite understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is a reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and could do everything she wanted, why did she fall in love with that evil man. 2. How can the story be so weak? She was so rich, she could do everything she wanted but did not dare divorce her husband, which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words that love you do not mean anything in this movie.
