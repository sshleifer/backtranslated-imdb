We should have been suspicious when we found out that with only two minutes we were the only one. Only five of us joined the movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to buy this movie. The game is terrible (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is banal. The effects we've seen a million times. Film direction is the worst we've seen. Meandering and division. No one even smiled with children. We left after 25 minutes. It would be so soon if my wife did not go for a hot dog! <br /> <br /> Do not waste money on this movie. If there is nothing in your cinema, then buy some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and watch some people. You will have a much more pleasant time !!! <br /> <br />
