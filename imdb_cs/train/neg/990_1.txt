Do not waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was another movie called Descent (about some of the traveler who was caught in the cave). so we have decided that we will always think it can not be that bad. It was. I can not believe that this film was actually produced and published. It was so terrible that it was almost like a crash where you would want to avert, but you just can not recover. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. This was from a low budget film in which college gets attacked by a boy she dated to everyone out of porn flick. And he's really not good. I went out of hate that hates to almost feel sick. Nearly. Overall, it's a terrible movie that was definitely labeled as NC-17 for some reason. Do not waste money. And do not let your kids watch it.
