........ and it's very bad! How long does this wreck last? 14 episodes or something? I see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought the episode "Serenity" from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. This is just a good thing about this experience (incident?) I will not really comment on acting because these were, I think, quite new people who really did not get the job yet alright. At least I've never seen them before in any big show, theater, or television. If I did, I forgot them easily. But the special effects were totally terrible. True, this is not exactly a million million projects, but the original Star Trek did it better than this, and it was thirty-five years ago. Especially I laughed at bad guys (pupils or something like that) of the boat as he pursued a cheerful look at the Firefly, the smoke that came out of the engines and looked like a gigantic model rocket. I was fully expecting to finally see Wiley Coyote at the top while I was hunting for the Roadrunner. Modern jet / rocket engines will not do so. <br /> <br /> And that was not the worst. The wild west shot wondered if I was really watching a sci-fi movie or Gene Autry. Regardless of the hype, do not waste time ... ... all 80 minutes of a disaster called "Firefly".
