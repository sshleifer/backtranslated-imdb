Soldier Blue is a movie with fake claims: claims to make some deep statements about a human being to man, the exploitation and brutality of a white man against native peoples; a biting, steadfast and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, I'm sorry, but it's unfortunate. What Soldier Blue is actually is a malign, tortuous, ill-made, dishonest waste. Another reviewer came across a nail when he said it seemed to be a hybrid of two entirely different films. What is basically a laughing, unfair novel - "a terrible couple" - Strauss and Bergen overcome their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and fall in love (ah, bless) - leaning on two sinister massacres that would not be ruled out instead of Lucio Fulci's splatter splashing. There is no excuse for a repellent, prurient, gore-elevated climax in which cute little native American children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in love and graphic close up and large-scale native Americans are harassed, raped and pulled - without justification, that except for boxing. (The massacre itself, though repulsive in its bad intent, is very poorly presented and shot, a bunch of actors lying around with a bright red color blurred on them, cut through several sequences of special effects of scraping / cutting - by the way, using real amputations in <br /> <br /> Forget everything you heard (including the sad commentary that begins and ends the film) about it being a "protest", the accusation of American brutality towards the native peoples.This film does not provide information about the Cheyenne situation, and if it did so that some of the native American characters would appear, we would be familiar with and care for the blind, blind, innocent, Instead, we get the crazy white bread romance Bergen and Strauss (at least black actors), with a lot of blood, intestines, and broken heads that fall to attract curiosity. is a ghastly shame because there is a movie about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real-life massacres that the US (and Britain and all the so-called "civilized" nations) have been participating in for centuries (Iraq?). this is not the movie.
