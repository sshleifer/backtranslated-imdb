I think I should start by saying that almost every style of work can be fun in parts. The true test is whether it's good from start to finish, which is why I gave the analog title for this review. Most of us would agree - even those like me who like to read many blogs - that blogs can not compare to good writing of novels for many reasons. Likewise, FEM can not be compared to good filmmaking for a number of reasons, and actually I think it's a bad example of independent filmography. From the beginning to the end, FEM feels like a vlog together. (Heck, even MySpace gets some pimps.) If I wanted to see an hour lonelygirl15 - I - I'm not going to do it. The FEM, though certainly more obstinate than the bubble atmosphere of the above-mentioned media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. It is like watching the worldly life, which I agree most, is naturally boring. Still, FEM creators want us to appreciate it, a very postmodern film about filming a movie. Cue my yawn. Finally, I came away without worrying about it at all. I'm shocked that I'm really interested in taking the time to write this review, even. It's not like FEM is totally bad because it's not; it has a few moments when I tried to smile or thought maybe - maybe only - something interesting. It's more like it's just ... average. I feel so indifferent that it's almost OK with the oxymoron: passionate indifference. I hope that the creators / actors in the movie get out of debt from their efforts. They will probably need it when one of them moves out and goes on with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to lose and nothing much you want to do; Otherwise, go through and do not worry that you have missed some great, undiscovered talent. You really are not.
