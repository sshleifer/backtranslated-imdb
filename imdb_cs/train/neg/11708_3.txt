my mind is blowing how this movie has become. I watched it when I was working at home writing emails and answering the phone - I just watched because I was hoping the "revenge" part would be good. no need to say that revenge and forced conspiracies of fences are not worth the emails they watched. in fact, I'm still not sure what happened at the end. acting was just as bad as the rebuilding scenarios at the FBI Files show - by far the worst takeover (in fact, "arrest and court" can be just as bad at reconstructions). nor did I know that the lead man was in the Third Eye Blind until I had experienced IMDb, but it is clear why he has not made any movies since then. I hope he is a good singer.
