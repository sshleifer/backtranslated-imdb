That was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And it looks absolutely horrible the whole movie, hair is so bad! They speak like monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. The DVD envelope does not even touch what the film really is. Really, really boring. I had to move forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch. Do I really want to know how I can think of someone on earth that it's good? hhaha literally like speech and they say "yeah" and there is no passion at all. I could not say they were in love at all. I'm sorry, but it was the saddest excuse for the movie I've ever seen.
