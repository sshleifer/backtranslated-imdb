What can I say? Soon I ignored the reviews and went to see them myself. Damn review was so correct. What is the waste of money for being a budget. Good thing, after this I went to Kill Bill. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, it will be Crossroads! </ br /> <br /> Bottom Line - I like the "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this bullshit.
