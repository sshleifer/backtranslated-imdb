The worst film on earth. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person to punish this movie. As for acting and lighting, this movie is similar to bad porn without sex. Actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and it could not have been even worse, even though they tried to smash this movie completely. The film had to have a record low budget, which I'm sure was lost almost exclusively on the cover of the film. This film is now a common joke with my friends and has become the standard for comparing other garbage. I would like to point out that no other film has ever started to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting to my friend and watching me this film, and I am surprised that he still considers me to be a friend of the distress I have given us. You do not see this movie!
