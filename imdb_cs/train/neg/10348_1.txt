I was very excited to see the movie from my favorite book ever made. I did not realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was horrified by the many omissions of the major parts of the story. It was as if someone had made a movie from a book about this novel. Meg was learning well at school, and neither she nor her father was wearing glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's Mother) was not portrayed as a scientist at all; left the kitchen lab and replaced the internet. And that's just the beginning. By the middle of the movie, I found myself screaming at the screams, to the distaste of other people watching a movie that did not read the book. I wish I had more inches to give him four inches down. The only good thing I can say is that for the man who did not read the book, this movie is fine.
