to speak only as a movie, I did not really like it. not because there were no FX or because we had a single cabin as a script for the whole movie, in fact it was what kept me tracking. I did not like it because the acting was shadowy, his "friends" are all happy and then they're crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take distinct roles, one is a believer, the other is an antagonist, but they never really make any sense! Also, lighting was awful and I just mentioned technical problems. <br /> <br /> In a few words the movie could only have "ok I'm here!" from some characters. just like a lady who does not want to hear his version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> The story itself can be used by everyone to write about what they want, and the story proves good writing and fantasy. I believe the book's author for it, and so my 4/10. So, eventually you can hear the story of a man, believe it or not, just do not spend the whole time acting as you believe and is shocked by what he says, and at the same time he moves and makes jokes as if you did not believe him. <br /> <br /> Cohesion. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading;)
