I hated this show when I was a child. It was the day the children showed that the characters actually had accents, and not just the vague, generic, American dialect we are accustomed to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf was southern. Like one of the others, I have never fully understood what was the deal with the witch who wanted the flute. It always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute was just disturbing me and I had no trouble getting it away! Just a commentary on the similarity of Pufnstuf with McDonalds magazines in the early 1970s that others mentioned: Pufnstuf broke McDonalds. At the top of McDonald's popularity, television shows (or rather their creators) tried to allow McDonald's characters for their show, but when McDonalds rejected the TV show, they changed the characters slightly and handed it over to their own. They even hired former employees of the McDonalds advertising agency and voice actors to make television shows. McDonalds sued and won. Locate the Pufnstuf McDonaldland Court and find a lot of articles about it.
