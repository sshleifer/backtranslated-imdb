My first Templarios exhibition and not good. I was thrilled to find this title amongst the offers from Anchor Bay Video, which brought us another classical culture like "Spider Baby". The quality of the print is excellent, but it can not hide the fact that the film is deadly boring. There is an exciting initial sequence in which the villagers are exactly helping the Templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, gloomy and ultimately inexhaustible. Adding Insult to Injury: The movie was nicknamed, untitled, as promised on the video.
