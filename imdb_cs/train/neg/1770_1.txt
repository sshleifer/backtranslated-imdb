My wife and I both agree that it's one of the worst movies ever shot. Surely in the top ten of those I've been following all the way. At least Plan 9 was nice. I really enjoyed "Christine", "Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of his other movies. I did not care very much about "Cujo" (just because the sound was so bad in the versions I saw, and I often could not say what people say) or "Pet Sematary (pet cemetery)". > <br /> But this mess was a complete mistake in every case. The very "creature" appeared to be designed for 9 years. (No offense for nine-year-olds.) Even "unicorns" made us run and were not fun.
