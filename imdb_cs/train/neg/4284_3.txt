Jason Lee's spikes back! If this is what you are looking for, look no further. If not, keep going ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Chins, some badly shot, but somewhat exotic fighting scenes (used JKD) and lots of bad games and cheap effects. Poor Lee seems to be in pain in the whole movie and it's no wonder. It's not a nice return. The film does not even cut it like a B-movie - of course, there was a German bleached blonde woman Rutger-wannabe bad, but no free sex scene or even no bots of shots. None. Zipper. Nada. Even in starships 2 have common sense to include mandatory boredom scenes (as in my other commentaries on this excellent piece of classical excellent cinematography, please take a look at our upcoming review of this continuing mind of the sequel ...). I felt that the author had revenged someone with this - and so I would not get into the "conspiracy" of the movie or something. In addition to having some non-heterosexual melodies, so nuff said. However, this movie has one thing to go for - not Jean-Claude :)
