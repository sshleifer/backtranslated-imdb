How can so many corrupt policemen be without slipping? With a sufficient number of police officers using such weapons as flame throwers, you would think they would be caught before anyone who writes about a weekly coupon log heard someone saying "thank you" to the injured policeman. <br /> <br /> You will never get back 90 minutes. Life is too expensive to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for those big-name actors who made a mistake when doing this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, to rent this movie. It has a very important role, so fans can see it. <br /> <br /> But I believe most of his fans are young girls who can be turned off by violence in this movie.
