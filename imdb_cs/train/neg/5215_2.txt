It's the same old thing: "If I can not get the money for my project, I'm going to get injected" the movie monster. There is nothing new. It's a lot like Jeff Goldblum's "Fly" movie. The man manages to keep some courtesy, but ultimately he is subject to the effects of his experiments. The game is pretty bad. There people are stupid to play all the way, putting their lives at risk for no obvious reason. The guy is still returning to the lab where he was forbidden to enter. Then is his relationship with a young woman and son. True, she looks good, but she seems to have a lot of trouble. It's just a big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like he came out of the stand at the Star Trek conference.
