Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write a message immediately after watching this muddy puddle. Why? Because I have to let everyone know what the bad movie is like. It's incredibly bad. Just to let you know how bad it is, I'll give you this detail about the movie. During the chaos scenarios, which usually consist of people shooting or kicking zombies, they hide scenes from the video game. Yes, you have heard me right. This movie is really upset. In fact, I'm thinking about ten dollars today, just to get into theaters today. And see that stuff filled with corn? There is no story to talk about and the film has nothing to offer than occasional clippings and really cheap kills. I was really disappointed with this because I knew I was watching it. OK, I'm stupid. It's so bad I can not even find the words. EVALUATION: ZERO of *****.
