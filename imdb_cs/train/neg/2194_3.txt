Great premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that overtaking the speed beyond control when you get into the weekend cabin may not be the best idea at all. I loved Bill getting out of the car comfortably and down the hill without injuries at all! Unfortunately, the same can not be for his gal. And the police never seemed to find a car or trace the wreck owner. Lots of downloaded scenes, including a common stripper (there are nightmares still in the scene). A bad helper and his unnecessary hand. I admit that I was interested in seeing the mysterious "thing" behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HA HA HA !! The girl really seemed to be sadistically angry at being revived. Personally, I really would like to have a new body after such an incredible experience!
