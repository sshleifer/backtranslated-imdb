With all my disregard for this George Stevens, the "epic" miscastings and misreadings, I can only wonder that James Dean's "legend" could survive this trip, I suggest that the then-studio leeches to the banker boxing "giants" came from the crop of their own "gigantisms ". Likewise, Rock and Liz were much better. Let's say that "Dallas" was an authentic "heir", although today's "Texans" such as Lay and DELay, not to mention our presumed "president" of these Amurrics, the uniqueness of global dimensions. I never read the original version of Edna Ferber, but I think it's better head and shoulder than what appeared on the screen. And all those well paid, I would imagine that "I support" actor notes and celebrities no matter how, "Giant" is at least a pacifier of unnecessary merit, does not mind promotional campaigns.
