Dir-Walter Lang: Disappointment of the musical in terms of character development, in my opinion, from this much-acclaimed piece by Rodgers and Hammerstein. There are a couple of good songs and a decent comic depiction, occasionally King Siam Yul Brynner - but the film really does a good job presenting situation and setting. I can just blame the script and maybe some actresses, why do not we fully understand the characters and their situations. I know there might be too much to ask for a musical instrument designed for the enjoyment of songs and dances, but that part did not seem much to me either. The basic story is an English woman who comes to Siam to teach children about advanced European affairs. Later we find out that the king is actually the greatest pupil. Among the newest wife of the king played by Rita Moreno (Latin as an Arab - Come!), And a former lover who causes some complications, but nothing really charming, appears strangely forbidden romance. Deborah Kerr, as the main female figure of Annie - is fine, but it's not even convincing. The King learns about some things because of his presence and then the film loses the same way he does. This is really the smallest story with some songs and dances, but not such a great experience for the viewer really.
