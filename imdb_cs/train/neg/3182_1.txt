Ultimate justice has a great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he is in Malta where he shoots more people. He gets locked many times, filming people. Then he got into a shootout with a bad guy dressed as a monk. There is a boat of persecution, and Joe Don winds in jail again. Eventually, Joe Don, with Elaine's help from "Seinfeld", kills the evil one, throws a boat or two, and someone attacks. All this and a catchy song, like Mitchell!
