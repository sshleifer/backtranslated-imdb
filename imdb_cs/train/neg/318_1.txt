I stole this movie when I was the first college student. I tried to watch her three times, the other two, because friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but because it's so funny it has to be funny." Poorly! I can not look at this pile of crap out of a dream of a boxing match / an insult to the war where you burn a guy with a good ziner, causing your opponent physical pain. You think the awful comedy that hurts you is ridiculous, but after watching that you will know the truth. This movie is not worth the price I paid for. I was watching Steven's tunes and I even watched Crossroads twice ... but I could not keep track of it.
