This show is boring, lame and basically relieved of all sorts of things to be "original". First: Animation is so ugly ... Johnny is hideous ... and everyone is poisonous. The twins look like a teenage girl Dexters from "Dexter's Lab" and Johnny is almost like a smarter male Dee Dee (also from "Dexter's Lab"). Secondly: The invitations ... are painful, so it's hard to watch them. Gags are furious and nothing really let me feel compelled to laugh a bit ... especially when trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but you were alone. <br /> <br /> The third away: The whole dance song begins by copying the melody to "American idiot" Green Day. And while I'm not a big fan of this band, I find it really silly to have the same melody, and then they gently changed it to make it their own. <br /> <br /> The thing at the point ... it's a big thick ugly hole. 1/10
