When I finally had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on import areas of 2 Japanese DVDs, I was blown away by how fun this epic zombie is. The conversion is simply immaculate, as good as ever, if Anchor Bay gets hold it. The gore really stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent make-up and gore fx. Zvu is also terrible. It's just 2 channels dolby , but if you have a Dolby Prologic 2 receiver you can really appreciate cheese music (really good score) and effective and yet cheap sound effects. It never sounded so good, and great transmission contributes to total enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood flowing in this movie, it's extremely brutal with exploding head shots, exploding puss full of mega pimples, cleavage on the zombie throat, burned limbs of a woman (as it did not burn that guy also), intestinal ache, zombie kids and much more <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about the hardcore fans of zombie events, especially the Italian kind. There are some excellent bits and cinemas that are found, I think people do not give enough credit if you see a clean print and not some terrible copy of the pirates, it's a totally different experience. <br /> <br /> This movie will never stop for a moment, and I realize it's inconsistent, so the dubbing is awful, the acting is stiff and the feeling of ignorance is magnificent, but it's his magic. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the best horror movies you've ever done, you can not make a movie this bad, so good, expedient. It is a random genius of the highest order. If they played laughing, it would be a disaster, but they played it straight as an arrow, and the result is an amazing classic culture, the nose of all the traditional film standards. <br /> <br /> Tones of action sequences, exotic locations, great design, good cinematography, amazing cheese performance and inconsistent but still interesting plot, great makeup effects, beautiful women who can kick the ass, excellent music and sometimes cheerful, sometimes scary but always entertaining zombies. How can you go wrong with this movie? has everything, a cult classic that is a test of time.
