This program is really overestimated. Detective, as if Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to "rubber pistols" years ago. The whole team is made up of sacred Eomanians who judge people whose actions take place in decades according to the standards of 2007. Each Vietnamese figure in Vietnam that they have ever made turns out to be a murderer if it was not another veteran from Vietnam. There was only one black killer, and he was accustomed to it from his white boss. The only Israeli killer was a "treacherous traitor" who killed another Hispanic to build Hispanic streets for a crime that (of course) committed two rich white children. What propaganda. Hey, a screenwriter: minorities and poor people are also committing murders. Only at this show is the majority of the white class murderers. In addition, the arrest of people in their 1970s, 1980s and 1990s for the crimes committed 50-60 years ago is a joke. No real life office will try to kill, because it means that the state will be stuck in its humongal medical account until it finally stops. The state will make its families and insurers a favor. The prosecutor will only be asking for involuntary killing and will not serve the day. The only really older criminals who go to prison are either organized criminals or former Nazis whose highly persuasive beliefs strengthen the DA's career.
