The No One Sleeps plot is not a bad idea and the subject is very interesting. While watching this movie, we said loudly: "These filmmakers will get into trouble finding good places, lighting is good, makeup, and hair is good ... Why is that bad sound?" Throughout the movie, the echo sound was distorted, and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. There's a good actor in this movie and I think Jim Thalman is a really good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would be worth it as a high-budget. <br /> <br /> I just can not repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, pay more good sound. Sound is just as part of the film as the picture and it's worth doing right. You could have earned 6.
