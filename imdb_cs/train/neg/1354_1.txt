I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know about the movie one or two. Crispin Glover's movie is blatant. It basically uses mentally handicapped people. Not only is the Shirly Temple anti-Christ (which I admit is a bit funny) when he says mentally challenged for suicide, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors, who is, as they all are, mentally handicapped. PETA and human rights should be above this. It's not "anticultural," as Crispin said at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.
