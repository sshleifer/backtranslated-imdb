This film has a weak conspiracy, weak characterization, and really weak special effects that ask why I've watched why I lost my valuable life. He has random characters that do not allow anything to appear in the story, and look like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the movie. The robots are sad and the "hero" master boot is switched on by a large foot switch. If this movie was not that bad, it would be ridiculous, but it's not funny. The main antagonist is one of the only redeemed characters and is killed. It's sad when rooting for the wrong one, because it's the best thing to think about. When all is said and done, this film was better left on the floor of the bed or was not funded at all.
