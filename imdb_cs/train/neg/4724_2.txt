This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was extremely disappointed. The director did not know a little about John Lennon and even even said at the premiere. It's a drama, but people laughed at how sweet the film is. This is never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates / friends. It was funny while he took the rest of the film seriously. The ravenous drop of Beatles' lyrics was simply absurd. The soundtrack was great and was probably the best part of the film. If you are not one of those crazy, frantic fans of Dominic Monaghan, do not bother with this.
