Some people who have reviewed this movie seem to have watched him only in the first place because they were filmed near where they live. How about ringing? Had this film been shot near where I lived, I would not mention it in a review. It's scary! Several reviews say that this film is a fake or horror film of horror, it's not one. It's sad to see this movie reevaluated as a comedy, because it does not only make a bad attempt on horror but also comedy. I myself laughed at how incredibly bad the movie was. This movie has 2 good things to go for, a mask and a choice weapon, unfortunately it would be more interesting to watch an hour and half of the mask and the weapon lay on the table and then watch this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also ridiculous, youthful and stupid. Do not bother with this movie, you've been wasting your time reading this review, do not collect anything on this movie. Arrggghhh! It's scary that such movies will even happen. I expected the entire crew to be credited to Alan Smith, the name that is used when a man, usually a director, does not want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad. <br /> <br /> There is no redemption in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I felt I was torn. Avoid. 1 out of 10
