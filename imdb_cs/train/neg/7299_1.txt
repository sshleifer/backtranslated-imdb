I certainly saw bad movies in my life, but this was so bad that I was really angry at the theater. I wanted to return the money. I wrote to the director asking him to return a movie ticket, of course I did not get a refund (or even a reply), but that's important. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie the number -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer?) Stop being afraid of being hit by a bat? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the skull bumbu? The story was thin, the film was full of obvious clich√©s and some of its parts simply did not make sense.
