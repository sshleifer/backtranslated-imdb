This movie was really terrible. Actor was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super cheese and I think the worst actor was an old lady. At first I thought it was an old movie. Then I remembered that it was not a justification! I've seen older movies better and better. <br /> <br /> Music was terrible. It was really torn. Editing was bad (most of the dialogue was out of sync.) Overall, this film does not even deserve 1. I watched it just because I was so bored and the movie hardly entertained me. It was just ridiculous. The green pinkie finger of my dead grandmother could make a better movie than this.
