What a terrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and backgrounds always have dirty, dirty, dirty, misanthropists living inside. These people, who probably collaborate on complex science projects, do not seem to agree on how to survive death in the hands of CGI Dragon. Spoilers: An extra-ugly scientist whose main acting skill is "leering" and "a sinister look," the Dragon cloned. While the lab was supposed to work on such things, other scientists are shocked because apparently in their experiments they were completely behind and trapped in their trousers. The rest of the story is like a thing or ten small Indians where staff are hunted and killed when trying to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the "dragon." Creating CGI Dragon is dark gray, which looks like a favorite color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It barely looks better than the cartoon and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see interesting details in Dragon's body. Everything looks like a gray stain. The game is less than terrible. These scientists behave like a lot of kids who can not agree on anything, which makes it easier for them to kill in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is barely better than any of the cast of unknown actors this film. It seems to be falling to the level of his supportive occupation. This movie is really ugly. The game is bad. The story is stupid. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing praiseworthy about this film, he is not even a good time killer to look at work or other work.
