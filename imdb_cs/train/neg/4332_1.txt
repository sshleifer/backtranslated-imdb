This movie is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. The only thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason why the originals gained such a response was strictly that it should feel incomplete. This movie brings me to the bathroom. I'm not a negative type of guy, but the person who acts in this movie is ... no comment. The conspiracy was a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life, and I'm sorry I had two hours of my time and my money unnecessarily on this film. I still love the original and I will do the best to prevent this film from ruining my opinion about it.
