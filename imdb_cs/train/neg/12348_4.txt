This movie is very similar to "Flashdance", you know that dancing with Jennifer Beals. The movie is probably the most unfavorable movie I've ever seen, because it's not bad enough to be fun. "GI Jane" is much better than the movie, but it does not say much. Here Demi Moore feels great and there's high music and we see her fight and everything, but it's definitely not very nice. I really think the idea behind the movie is a little interesting, but the script is too clich√© and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
