The original "les visiteurs" was original, cheerful, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "The Worst First Continuation of a Really Good Film". In LV2 everybody yells when the gag does not work first it is repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually be funny. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, of course except that parody should be inventive. If you loved LV1, you do not see this movie, you see LV1 again!
