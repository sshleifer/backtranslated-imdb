As someone mentioned, she starts with a bizarre breakthrough about a little blonde who killed a cat. Then the main story will appear: The photographer (Gaffari) and the writer (Shepard) will meet and head into the mountains. At first he spends the night in the inn, where the slightly deaf landlord gets to Gaffari with increasing audience annoyance. Once in the mountains they are looking for shelters again and they are invited by a kind old lady who seems strange to the stranger (Hansel and Gretel, somebody?) What's going on I'm going to the brave spectator to solve it because I certainly could not. Eurohorror, and it would be better if the artist (the writer and the director) attempted a logical story. The background (Pyrenees?) Is an excellent and interesting place for mysterious and occult events. I want photography to make sense, and you can watch this movie at archive.org.
