... which is not exactly ringing. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Sure, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a full suitcase that spent the whole movie crying that his little brother would get DinoCroc. Special effects in "DinoCroku" were better, fence lines were better and playing was better. Here are problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) The crocodile killer looks like a child model with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. have fallen on a deserted island where they encounter a fragile group of ugly Filipino natives who are trying to persuade women in a group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) not enough croc time. There are several redemption qualities "Blood Surf" - actresses are quite attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets a crocodile eating at the end of the film. But if you are on a lethal bed and you only have time to watch one movie of a crocodile's Matt Borlenghi / killer, skip this movie and ignite "DinoCroc" instead.
