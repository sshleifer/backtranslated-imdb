Now I've never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about the songs in the movie, which is of physiological significance. WOW appears some demented Pokémon and multiplies that I can get a fit. Animie is unnecessary, the makers are useless, its big marketing plan seems to just cut down on the tracks and they get a good rating, I think this movie would be fine if you dropped the message, you have to see all episodes Pokémon understand what going, and it's not a movie. It's just an animation that should be on the video. Ps: I'll give it 1 because I only have $ 5 that I could not give half because there are no half.
