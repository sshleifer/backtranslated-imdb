This self-proclaimed "highly talented artist" was the easiest Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotions, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... repeats the same situation over and over again. There is no character development. It does not even show any violent and / or sexual content, and adds nothing new to the psycho-murder genre. So lame it should be shown at film schools as an example "do not do" in the first film. BTW, where the hell is "talent"? there are scenes that have been shot almost identically; there are scenes that have two or more major shots and it is totally terrible to see action no matter how to jump from one main shot to another. The camera almost never moves as if a "very talented artist" was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills. Actors playing a major role behave like amateurs and accompanying cast is hardly believable. The script has more holes than the script (if anyone has ever been) ... <br /> <br /> A truly daunting movie and a talented director.
