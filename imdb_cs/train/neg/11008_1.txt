I bought it at the tower records after seeing info-mercial about fifteen times at a comedy center. Actually, I was really looking forward to seeing it. My God, where did I go wrong? Now, before I make a review, let me just say that I am a person who can to a large extent find the best in all the movies, hell owns more than 1500 DVDs! It is said that the underground comedy film is there with the worst movie I've ever seen. I tried to give him a chance, but it was not just fun. It did not make sense, it did not break what it was and it was all stupid. God, who in his true mind thought these pieces funny? it goes directly to the bottom of the basket ...
