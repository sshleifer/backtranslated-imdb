A movie with very little positive to say. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, it has a zero pace and is positively missing in some drama. Besides being a remarkably slow Empty Acre seems to be devoted to using the same track of records over and over again. I've lost the number of times I've seen "that" field at night or that bit of crack. It also has the basic mistake that if the audience does not know about things, it will rather be grasped than confused. So without any indication that there are any problems, we find at one time that marriage is not what it seems, even though it implies that it is all right. We have found that Jacob is probably the worst farmer in the universe because he does not seem to spend time on the farm and he also seems to have bought land with a totally unnecessary acre. Beth has the key to stockbooks? There are a number of other issues, some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late. And in place of the acre. Horror creators remark that the big inanimate objects are not really scary? and if they are destined for a large acre, they will do so. There is also a terrible lack of understanding as Beth (the best artist in a piece, followed by Jefferson - a cop) suddenly seems to be accused of everything under the sun just because he is a "cure". For ten minutes, plus a run around the fields looking for a missing kid (he has been out of the window for six months), the film descends to a badly written scene after a badly written scene. Poor plink horror music can not add the atmosphere. Often bad movies can be fun, but not The Empty Acre, which is bad.
