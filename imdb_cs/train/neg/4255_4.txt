the film opens with a beautiful lady in a torn white dress going through a stereotypical East European city. we know something follows, because she is looking after her. and soon we see that he is being chased by a mysterious man in a black trenchcoat. then we realize that the man is actually a vampire hunter and he is after her. but look for her reflection in the trade window ??? it's not just her identical twin vampire! but unfortunately they both get it. After this brilliant and amazingly entertaining return to the old 60s and 70s (the twins of the evil are the twins of evil, which of course is the name of the final installment in the Karn≈°tejn Carnstejn trilogy), the plot largely dies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> .. wow, what a chance, maybe I just ignore all those movies that say drinking vampire blood turns into a vampire and use vampire blood to find a cure for our friend's illness. it is obviously a mistake, and everyone becomes a vampire. New concept, but pulled out unbearably wrong. The film still creates amazing situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, honey students are trying to bring life back to life by placing it in a bath full of blood in the lonely coastal land of the estate. The house itself is so scary that it's the center of the movie, but are we staying there? not because they choose to take a vampire into the deserted pool. sigh. This movie has a real problem with "honors" as I mentioned before the beginning of the scene is directly from the hammer, and this scene of the house would be perfect for a hammer-like movie, but the film quickly switches gears and changes to medical horror. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they represent so many characters that it is almost impossible to regret one of them. There are students of honey and their trolley-bound professor of the "friend" type of honey students are all: arrogant, boring, money hungry and stupid. as they did in the honey hospital, it amazes me if the medal school does not fulfill its muscular binding and large breast quota. and then he is a vampire hunter who remains mysterious in the movie. hey, I can respect it, but it would be nice if they did not stop him, like a movie around him. then you have random priests, cops and types of sciences. so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten until they need that person to save the day or leap from the cheap fear of becoming tiring. Basically it's a lazy movie. no real dreams, just a few predictable jumps. The setting for these is so complicated that it is cheerful. for example, a full-blooded bath. it is so obvious that dark blood will set dust. and yet we have to wait too long to get to the inevitable fear of jumping. after that he kills one of the smaller and bigger pupils with honey. we all know he will become one of the undead. but what do others do? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. sigh, so you know who's going to jump on you when the cops appear at the house .......... <br /> <br /> Oh, okay. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will get a hint that it is not possible to make a scary vampire movie and just go for atmospheric, and then end up with a movie that is just as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
