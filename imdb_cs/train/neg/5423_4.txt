I have been using IMDb for several years, but I have never done any review before. However, this film disappointed me (even with a moderate score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I could not keep quiet. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so disturbed by the noise that he accepts the alter-ego as a watchful, "rectifier", and vandalizes all the cars he finds with a self-alarming sound. the name of the movie is somewhat incorrect. Although there are one or two examples of other sources of noise that are addressed or mentioned, the only real focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is no other emphasis. When the film attempts to combine other examples of noise pollution with the car alarm problem, it seems to have just thrown it to gain credit from Robbins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all angry. No one likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have an inner desire to take a baseball bat on a screaming vehicle, and this film is actually doing that, and that's what he's doing, he sells the movie. I say "to a large extent" because there is also a spectacular contrast sexual relationship (including a totally useless trio), which is obviously thrown for those who are interested in films that need such things thrown in to make a movie. Frankly, that's eye-rolling. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very shortly into the movie, becomes totally unrecoverable. It seems less that he decides that he will no longer have to deal with the noise, by losing his mental health with such a strong focus on noise. The first half of the film is basically the story of how the hero of the little guy, the rectifier, turns from a simple, angry car. However ... the transformation will not happen. It just renames. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. An uncomfortable generalized social commentary comes at every moment to add to the pretentiveness of the film, and a self-satisfied smirk that never completely leaves Robbins' face does not help either. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's very clear what this movie is trying to be, because it's pretty deep in my throat, but in my opinion it's a big failure. Only one guy has an opinion.
