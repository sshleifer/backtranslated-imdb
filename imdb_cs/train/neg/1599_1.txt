THE REUNION OF THE NATIONAL LAMP REUNION was a flop when released. He has not stayed long in the theaters in my big city. Why? Because it's wrong !!!! The entire cast of actors was mostly unknown and then remained unknown after this turkey. The idea is really great (a parody of Slasher movies), but executions are immensely absent in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is much more expensive than you spend the nanosecond when you look at this unpleasant lunge.
