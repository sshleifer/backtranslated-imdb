I thought this film had absolutely no morals. I mean, how would you feel if your fiance left you on a wedding day for your cousin? I would be broken heart !! It's classified as a comedy, but I did not find it funny at all. I thought they'd mostly find cheap laughs and take them. Normally I love Julie Stiles movies, but that's an exception. Jason Lee plays in another shameful show, which again proves that class and decent morality are not relevant to today's society. She had a total lack of taste and I despise such films. I understand that people will defend this film and its morals because it's "just a movie," but I still think that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm trying to say that if you like this movie, you're a bad guy, because everyone has the right to own opinion and parts of this movie are nice, just say that in real life, the people behaving the characters in this movie are shameful.
