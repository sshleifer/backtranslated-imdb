The young man gets a bad day on his hair, goes out on a hill and falls to a place where he can not escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, the "mythological" guy 2000 years ago as his best friend and Arnold Schwarzenegger look-and-sound-like. His Hercules' power helps the boy out of danger and later adjusts to modern life. So what is the big deal? This is the saddest idea for a "family" trip! Either way, this one should not try, really! Our fictitious nature of power and madness is nothing but a typical alien that seems to be common to the rest of the universe. To add to blasphemy is the lack of something new or attractive, and before you know it, there is some attempt at violence that is not qualified as "family" fun. But the scene at which Atlas complains about her attic is grasped. Just spend in the park a nice and quiet afternoon to change.
