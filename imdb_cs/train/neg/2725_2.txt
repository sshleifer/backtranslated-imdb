Chesty Gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is US-Mexico "Border Cop". He serves as the character's father to a young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero) who wants Savalas to be the best man on his approaching wedding. Savalas is heavy, but Eddie Albert (as Moffat commander) may be harder. Hard is what you need to stop the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). Alliances can be in flux. If you find that you have the chance to hear "Boy" and "Oliver Douglas" in order to shout out hideous things, you should avoid the "border". If it is not, you do not have to have a stomach for "realistic" cow killing. Though it does not end up being a lot, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
