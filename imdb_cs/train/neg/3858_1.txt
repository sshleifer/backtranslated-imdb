What terrible movie TERRIBLE! One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I usually like movies like this, the whole guy meets an eccentric woman he likes, but somebody gets involved with him who is not right for him ... " I expected something predictable and did not mind him. Movies are always fun mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this! Every single joke falls and "romance" causes me to vomit. The title character is one of the most popular "kill me" characters I've ever seen on TV, "eccentric woman" is not too eccentric, reminds it strange and annoying. "Anybody else" is the most sensible, mature person in this movie, but it also happens to be just as uncomfortable. These movies are flat, it's still, it's no way around, do not waste time.
