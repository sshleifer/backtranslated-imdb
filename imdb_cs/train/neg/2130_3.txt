I think I'm late for a party. I just saw the Bye Bye Birdy version of Sky TV in 1995. I did not know she existed and was fully prepared to see the movie version of 1963 when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time ago and I think about putting on amateur show production because I remembered it's so fun. I was not overwhelmed with this newer version. It just was not fun enough. It was not colorful. He missed his youth. Lighting was bad. Nobody seemed to mention it. It's not a moody musical, it's clear and excited. The decision on lighting was a poor creative choice. Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of mistakes. I have no sense in this sense. The lighting was terrible and worsened overall performance. Dance numbers also looked anemic. Today we have music videos. At least the dance numbers should measure up to some of the best or the best on Broadway. The choreographer was asleep behind the wheel. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were extremely talented, there were really bad casting possibilities. Vanessa Williams is not Latin and with so many talented Latin artists, it would not be right if one of them played in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African-American, beautiful and talented but bad casting. The efforts of Jason Alexander were stunning, he always did a smart job, but he was not Albert. He was a miscast and I think it's obvious to most people who see this version. Media is not a media stage. It needs to be translated from one medium to another. Exuberance and lightning of the stage have to be translated into film. There is no merit to the scriptwriting faithful scenario when it is filmed. Spirit, the essence of production must be stated. For me, Bye Bye Birdy's 1963 film production was bright and lively, while production in 1995 was as grim as light and as dull as dance figures. It turned out to be an unfortunate loss of effort by many really talented people.
