with all the European studios involved, you would think that you would at least get some nice photos; but local color is minimized. Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using the Russian accent to play a Spanish policeman - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. Is there a supposedly romantic story that is deliberately confused - is it a lesbian or not? - does not serve any purpose. The police in the movie are the stupidest to have a serial killer movie for a long time. There seems to be some report about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s, but because everyone involved has been dead, no one sees it. In spite of the bull-fighting backdrop of the narrative part (which part - who can say), it never fails to look good at the bullfight. Earnest Hemingway would hit the director in his nose - with my blessings.
