I read the story of John Everingham years ago in Reader's Digest and I remember what a great movie he will do. And it probably would not be if Michael Landon never got into his hands. As for me, Landon was one of the worst actors in the world and his art license went over the top, just like his massacre from the series of "Small House" books is proof. This is a horrific actor due to the lack of a better word, the screenplay is opaque, and there's more close enough to Landon's cat than it should be allowed. This film reflects Everingham's story just as "Little House On The Prairie" reflects that the books are "based". It's just another vehicle that shows Landons terrible hair.
