I first and completely and certainly do not agree with the user who calls it "spoof". Crispin Glover is very serious in his film. He personally introduced the screening film I saw in Chicago. He worked for the film for years and is the first in the intended trilogy. "What is it?" is an attempt by Crispin Glover to make an artistic film in the spirit of those who adore Herzog, Lynch, etc. I have heard a hearing about this film years ago, "epic pornography with all recordings, crispin glover." When it finally came out, I watched the trailer online and read the synopsis, and I rose in my mouth with expectation. ... I went to Chicago to see it and it was a great disappointment. If he took a goofy sh * t, such as a grandmother with a chick and a dancing doll, it would be a little better, but only about 10 minutes. In other words, just follow the trailer, have fun and let it go. There are some striking images and fantastic neighbors and phrases, but its lack of focus is a disappointment.
