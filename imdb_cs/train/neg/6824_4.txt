After watching Koyaanisqatsi with two or three dozen and loving every second of it, I finally had a chance to see his sequel of Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed, because he almost did not remove the high standard of the first one. 90 minutes of people with baskets on my head is not my idea of ​​a good movie. Phillip Glass's score had no beauty or correlation power for the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsim, this film seemed slow and unnecessary. Captured version of Barak, which is the same idea, but it is better. I really hope that the third film in this series will not follow an example of this waste.
