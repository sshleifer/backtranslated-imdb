OK, I confess I watched this movie at Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I'm a huge fan of), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give the movie MST3K a 1/10 rating. Although I hate many of the movies they play, and some of the worst movies I've ever seen, I've actually been able to look forward to some MST3K movies. This is said to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (It's no surprise that the MST3K authors just commented that this is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> For me, this film is a good example of what they are not supposed to do in the movie. Dialogue is very bad, negotiations are worse, cinematography is a pathetic direction (and maybe it's the best in this movie) is bad. Motion is the worst part of this movie. Several times in this movie the viewer had to wait for minutes to make something happen. While minutes may not sound like a very long time, it may be in the movie, especially in this. I'm sure that meant it, but I was very boring. It really feels like ten minutes. If "non-believer suspension" means "almost fall asleep during the movie" then it has a lot of it. But the screaming scully is so terrible that I did not really care about anything that actually happens in the movie, and so the "suspension of infidelity" really did not exist. <br /> <br /> One of the worst and most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
