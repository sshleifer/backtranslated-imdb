The young scientist is trying to continue the work of his dead father to regenerate the limbs. His promising mother convinced him that he had murdered his father and watched his progress for his own bad purposes. The young doctor uses creep DNA to extract from the big creature and when his arm comfortably tears a few minutes later, he uses his pattern to develop a new murderous hand ... It is true that the special effects in "Severed Ties" are pretty good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is frightening. The cut arm acts like a snake and kills several people. Big problem. Meetings are average and peak is stupid. 3 out of 10.
