What a terrible movie. The game was bad, the motion was bad, the cinema was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect some degree of badness in slasher, but even the murders were bad. <br /> <br /> First, the past event that created the motif for killing took 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could remove 80% of this and explain what happened well. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to a "meeting" in a deserted school that had all the aids turned on. One of the victims thought it was a bit strange, but they refused and decided to break. <br /> <br /> Finally, the murders were so fake that they were practically impregnable. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie if you do not want to see some breasts and it's not too good for your breasts. This film makes showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
