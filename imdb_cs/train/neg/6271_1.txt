There are no words to explain how bad the NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply denies the description. Something about a computer that can change personal items to silver balls that enter the mouth of a victim who kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so great that it is stunning. There is also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer speaks through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff. The computer also drives things like cars, although there is nothing to link the computer to the vehicle. The film is a complete waste. Sized bad baskets. Great, dirty waste. There and there are lots of sexual scenes that are not too hot or erotic. There is even one scene where the woman seems to love or wants the French to kiss the tarantula, which shakes me on the floor. Certainly one of the worst movies he ever did. Also with the same bad video on BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a murderous toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch her and try to understand what's going on.
