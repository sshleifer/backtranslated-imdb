Haunted Boat is sold as "Fog" meets "open water". In many ways, this is accurate. There are fears and strangely looking people to be interested. But the acting ability is at best bad. They show clear signs that it's just a bunch of friends doing a horror movie. Which in all the credits they do according to their best abilities. When you accept a low budget, it makes it very difficult for special effects, with ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks. Many aspects of the movie are scary and weird. But suffers from using too many twists and turns in a short period of time that disturbs and disturbs you. As far as waking you up, the movie does it very well. If you ignore an irrelevant twist every 5 seconds near the end, you really want to know what's going on. And they are willing to wait for 1 hour 35 minutes for the summit. <br /> <br /> It is not a Spirit Ship, but it will definitely do it for the evening before T.V.
