This show (I watched only seven episodes) I got four stars because most of her jokes / setups failed. Some are not funny, but some are fun - for a 12-year-old boy. It reminds me that a painter from New York who throws paint on canvas calls his art and sells for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what he has, including a kitchen sink, while praying that some things stick to the wall in her quest to be funny but different. However, what has "enough" often is not enough to lack the kind of follow-on volunteer that would need a successful comic. The whole business is like a submarine potato.
