This is not the worst movie I've ever seen on Peter Greenaway, but it's close. The disaster goes to a worse book of pillows. I have seen the film films of this director that I all consider unfortunate. Just like The Cook ..., any positive cinematographic thrives, which he speaks, is utterly irreversible by the embodiment of his material and overall presentation.
