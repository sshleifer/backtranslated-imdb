Making a film dark and visually unclear to overcome budget deficiencies is often a strategy used in low-budget horror films, but that's too far away. It's so poorly lit and dark (and it happens almost at night, booting) that you often end up virtually on a black screen (though maybe even a bad video transfer may have something to do with it). Unfortunately, "dark" is also the best word for describing the film's plot. Film creators throw up varied (and non-original) horror thoughts without any hint of logic, and by the middle of that time you have the feeling that they have just left the effort to create a good horror film; you know when you see the characters to be in fatal danger (or in some cases even the dead) to make small talk ....
