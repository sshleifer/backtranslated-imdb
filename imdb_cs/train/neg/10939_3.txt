This movie has some of the worst gigs I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails passing through the floor. This nail trap captures these bad guys. The rest of the movie gets worse. I can not believe that this film is not even in the bottom 100 films of all time. I also can not believe they are a sequel! Another story I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R indeed be much worse than that? <br /> <br />
