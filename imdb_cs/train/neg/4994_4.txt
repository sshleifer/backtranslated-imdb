Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in some way, but sometimes you are in no mood. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, I did not just think of simple action when I was watching this. It started well and it was quite fun, so why bad reviews. And finally, the film lost its credibility. The event was not gentle, the action was not too strange, but overall good, it was all right, so it was more than enough to meet my needs. But everything was destroyed because things were going over the top, leaving me a bad feeling. They should make a little more effort to do everything they can trust and they would be in the "No Thoughts Only Simple Action" category. So, in the end, if you know you will be irritated because things happen that seem totally illogical: do not look! otherwise I would say that you continue ...
