WOW, this movie was so terrible. I'm so glad I do not have to pay the money to see this terrible movie. it was like a girl of history going coking! the previews looked good, but it was really bad. I say that this idea sounds good, but it goes on. it was really bad. If you sit down and think about it, you will also realize that it is NERALISTIC. come back in the day u think you have all these things to work with. It was not like Ben Franklin sat down one day and damn. it was totally ridiculous, and you want to see the bad movie, then with all the ways to go see this one. Everyone and all the HORRIBLE movie can actually be on my top 10 movies I've ever seen.
