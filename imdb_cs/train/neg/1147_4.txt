This film is for F.BI's history as Knott's Berry Farm is in the old west. An unbearably cleaned version of the Federal Office for the Investigation of the Fight Against Crime. Hoover's heavy hand (does it have any other kind?) Shows a number of good-quality reader scenarios, raw sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. Jimmy Stewart with 20% dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chews scenery, film presents every emperor known in the mid- years, with a touch of irony or humor, from the "Amazon jungle" to "barbecue in the back", everything that causes the sound and back. Even shots are preserved and known. I think Mervyn Leroy was drunk every night. In addition to a few (very few) exciting exteriors that make shots, nothing of what is out of curiosity.
