Before I started this film for television, I had relatively low expectations. That was because it happened after hearing the last episode of the series and many of the original series were gone. There is no president Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, for the second to last episode of the series, all residents except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left the B-5 permanently. Now, behind this film, Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) was back to join Zack, and the Captain and Doctor make a short and irrelevant look. But because it was getting rid of old chemistry, this film is already heavily affected. The film is about Seoul Hunter (Martin Sheen), who is headed to Babylon 5, looking for a globe filled with souls that they stole from a hidden archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of scary mumbo-jumbo appears, but honestly it was all pretty and useless. Yeah, yeah, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and everything, but I honestly felt like it was "that it was done - and it did much better in the past." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The secondary conspiracy that was provided more for comic relief was much more interesting because the entrepreneur had installed the holo-bordel, and the command was not sure what to do and when they tried to push them, they hung up with the lawsuit. It was a bit fluffy, but it was a bit of laughter - something that was really scary. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen first did a good job when she played the hunter - eyes and bizarre supplies. However, repeatedly during the episode he fell out of character. It should be recorded and corrected. So the final verdict is that it's just for complete hard B-5 nuts (like me). Others who see it could take a series of soaked ones - which is a great injustice. It's a great example of an exhibition that does not know when to stop.
