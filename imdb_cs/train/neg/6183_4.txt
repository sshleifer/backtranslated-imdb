In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as President of the United States; North Korea has announced that it owns nuclear weapons; After the fall of John Paul II. He died after a long illness; and the movie Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened in the year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. The United States have another president, there is another pope, the new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but it is the same as: "Getting the fingers cut is better than getting into the head. "This sequel is really a bad movie that kept me extremely bored and uninterested. Casting Into the Blue 2: The Reef is composed of television series actors who completely deprive the credibility and drama that are perfect for showing their bodies. Christine Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring a hollow and boring performance. I like some previous movies by director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil and Ted's Excellent Adventures), but he can not create a minimal level of tension, emotion or fun on this film. The characters from this film are not only badly executed but also repulsive. I wanted them all to die. The cinematography of this movie is also lame and seems to have been made by a technical team that makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels. Blue 2: The Reef is a terrible movie that's better than the original movie, but it's the same as nothing I've said before. Avoid this dirty movie at all costs.
