Phew - I have nothing to say. This is a movie that could be really good and with lots of audience stones. Some of the actors have reminded me that John Waters has an early offer. Maybe I should take it back - I do not want to offend Waters as a director / narrator. I was especially pleased when the lawyer accepted a "full trust and confidence" clause. It is "full faith and reverence," by the way! It also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys," where the main actor is also a writer, director, film editor, etc. Such kind of multi-affiliated businesses such as those that are probably best left to highly experienced film professionals who have the technical abilities (though it might be a bit, it could say) to lose it.
