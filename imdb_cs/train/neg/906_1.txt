Yes, this film is a real horror when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald guy gives me the impression that I'm a psycho-Junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me, if you appreciate your time, avoid this movie, I understand that the movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have the money, but that is not the justification for a stupid plot and a bad deal. I always support independent films when it deserves support, but movies like this make a bad name for this kind of movie. I'm still traumatized. I will no longer trust any nice cover.
