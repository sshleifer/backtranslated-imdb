I have a nice collection on the movies, and this has been added. Number 274 is accurate. <br /> <br /> That title left me first. University of Splatter. I thought it would be a great horror movie. Was I wrong at all? Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it could be much better. I love all the movies, but this one was the one who was rather laughing, then scared. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality, bad performance and poor situation are some of the areas that could improve. 3 of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is perfect for good laughter. If you're looking for one of those movies to have fun, then it does not matter!
