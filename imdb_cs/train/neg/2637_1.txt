Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's as if someone put a budget in the Basil's dollar on an autistic trainer and said, "Make me a movie about a secret service." The cut is ridiculous, cinematography was best random, every syllable of the dialogue was totally slow and directed ... well, was there even a director? Everything was so futile and deceptive and unnecessary ... and random ... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here is SPOILER for you; this movie is the stupidest thing you ever see. <br /> <br /> However, if you like this piece, you will also enjoy it; Deterrance, Dark Blue and partial frontal lobotomy.
