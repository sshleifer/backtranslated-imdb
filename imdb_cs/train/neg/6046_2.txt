This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character, almost literally asking for death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough footprints or knowledge of nature to be surprised. It was just a terrible and sad waste of time. Willem Dafoe is an outstanding actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this movie is just soaked. Slow film does not worsen, it was bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings anamorphic details are not synergistically connected in a meaningful way to the plot except to highlight some gore, which is illustrated from several views, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as fun it made me sleep. (I really fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was even more disappointed.) Generally, I do not like to make negative comments or reviews on other work, even if they bother, but this movie is a guarantee. It is a bad thing that these great actors have been ashamed with this end result.
