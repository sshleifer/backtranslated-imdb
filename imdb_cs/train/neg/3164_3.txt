Inappropriate Eva Longoria has died on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her and kills her. She then tries to destroy the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with her new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her. An obvious non-original film would not be bad in clich√©. The figure of Longoria is hateful and unpleasant that it deletes all the fun of the movie. It's like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. Being a Longoria, nor anyone else in the cast or crew, is not a problem, his divine horrible script that drives control. It's really really stupid.
