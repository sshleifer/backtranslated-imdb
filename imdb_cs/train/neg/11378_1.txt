The bagpipes on MST3K should see the dog of the film. It's basically a horrific Hollywood actor who can not land any concerts. And he has a special obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this stupid actor do? Blonde hair blossoms and begins to behave like L.A. surfer's fool in naive hope that it will have a role. You will be laughing at so many unintentional scenes of this movie. Just as when the actor's girlfriend's heart is broken and sobbed with her heart and saying lines like, "How can you do it to me?" And why is she crying? Because he put on his blonde hair and became a surfer to get to the concerts. This movie does not make any sense! The actor who played the governor at Benson is also in it and plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with a big silly funny interview. This movie explodes, believe me. Are you talking to me ?!
