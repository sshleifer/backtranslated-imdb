This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with a calligraphy on her skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is totally bizarre. I do not see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. This conspiracy transforms the old artistic form into fetishist pornography. Scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong also show the bad parts of Hong Kong, such as an airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise. Throughout the movie, he still thinks that the book of pillows offends the Japanese culture and the environment of Hong Kong. "Pillow Book" is a perverse yet boring movie. Really hold on to her.
