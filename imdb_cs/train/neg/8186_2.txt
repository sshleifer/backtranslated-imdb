Someone read the script. It must be the worst writing and directing of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson, could not take this out. About two-thirds seemed Giamatti's eyes to say, I can not believe I signed a contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's really a really bad list of Christmas movies. Lack of rows, but what else can be said? Okay, the movie does not move Vaughn's Dialog, his character is just a haunted guy you just can not get. It was just a tiny walk that no one could get.
