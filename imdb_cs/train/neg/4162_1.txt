If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil, you should just see it instead of 2 hours when you never come back. I can not believe that no one has said that this film is just a cheap discouragement of RE. First, the "special" power squadron is a unique defense for a computer matrix device that has AI and holographic projection. And this "hive" rip-off has a number of passages that inevitably kill one member of the team at a time. There is also a chess reference in the code names that was in the RE dialog. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the "swing" of the film is nemesis, there is some bio-creation, very colorful colors suggesting necrotic tissue, lots of cyborg components as well as super mutant RE. So, with Richard Taylor's fingering for any credit for this story. It's not the same movie, of course, but the writer got the idea to watch Resident Evil I think.
