I'm really starting to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see his movies become miserable. This particular film was a complete and complete waste of time. My first complaint was a DVD cover, where they doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when he looked like a bullshit in the movie. He has his big belly with a pot and a double chin for him, and the worst and bored look on his face. The whole site was ridiculous and it was too long. The whole movie led to the final, when Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top military chemical adrenaline booster. It was a very unnecessary dialogue, not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of the Seagals voice in the middle of the testimony. The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The battle scenes in the movie were terrible. It would be tight shots if he had his hands cocked by the camera and then the man was flying through the wall or something like that. It reminded the old Kung Fu series on TV. too strong slow movement in combat scenes. I believe this is the worst film Seagals, which is still the worst, and I'm glad I did not buy this movie or I would be very upset because I'm a huge fan of Seagal aikido. The action star has quickly disappeared and seems to be getting worse with every performance.
