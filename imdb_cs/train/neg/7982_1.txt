It's hard to tell if Noonan and Marshall are trying to imitate Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis, Curley & Larry or some other comedy team, but anyone who tried to imitate it failed unsuccessfully. There is hardly a laugh in this incredibly silly picture. Noonan (who helped write the alleged "script") and Marshall have no chemistry at all; Marshall seems to be trying to dean Martin's form of devil care, but he does not come too far. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing, but be funny, did he? He seems to think he has tossed his hands and feet a lot and carefully noticed everyone and everything is at the height of the comedy screen; maybe it's for him, but not for the audience. I remember when I saw it in theaters when it came out. It was on the bottom of a double account with three-year-old western Jeff Chandler ("Pillars of the Sky", which was quite good) and three Stooges short ("Sappy Bullfighters"), and about 20 minutes into what all kids in the audience things on the screen; it was so unbelievably unfortunate that it did not even change to the worst Three Stooges shorts. I stayed at the end (not that I wanted to, but my people should not pick me up until the film stops) and when I disappeared I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 years ago on the cable one night and stuck to look at it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing she was for her was Julie Newmar, who was as hot as ever; other than her, this thing is absolutely NEVER recommend it. Two of them also play Japanese soldiers, and the way they do that makes the unusually playable playing of Jerry Lewis of the Japanese characters as thick eye-catchy, dirty, frantic mental defects look like benign. Marshall continued to host "Hollywood Squares," and Noonan tried to film, but most of them were almost as bad. Not so completely because I do not think COOL could be just as bad. The really damaging loss of the movie. Do not waste time on it.
