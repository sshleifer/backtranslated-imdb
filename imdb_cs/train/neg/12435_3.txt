Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film in the home of the Empire itself. Four industrial spies get a computer chip on the missile system and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote-controlled toy. Because of the mess in the luggage, the vehicle gets to Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes). He gives it to his neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies appear. Spies rented a house to block each house in the neighborhood until they find a car. At home with chicken pox, Alex calls every time he detects theft while running, but the spies always manage to escape the police while Alex is accused of calling pranks. The spies eventually turned their attention to Alex without realizing that he had the equipment to snag their house completely. Home Alone 3 was not horrible, but probably should not be done; you can not replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some funny parts, but I do not like it when the characters turn into a movie series at their own risk.
