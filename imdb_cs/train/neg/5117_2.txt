First of all, I would like to say that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry), so I understand how it is to work on a feature film, so that the filmmakers are based on this. I am for a positive and uplifting message if they are faithful to the nature of life (that it is a fallen world and that things are not always solved ... even for the followers of Christ). I am glad that others have such a positive response to the open Christian message; for me it was just that the execution is the place where the film falls on the face. The film lives and dies in its story, and here you have one dimensional stereotype, eloquent exposition, and spontaneous changes in the nature of behavior that are inexplicably the smallest. I think the film does not have to throw you over his head with his message. I'm sure Kendrick's brothers. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will be the same. Perhaps they could direct someone else's script as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not exactly my first love, but good (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) They can inspire in many ways. If you were interested in a PG inspired film, do Steven Soderbergh's "King of the Hill" look. All truth is God's truth ...
