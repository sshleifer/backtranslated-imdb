There is a remark that one of the heroes was raped by a Russian soldier "drunk rampage", which is quite untrue. This movie should not be shown just for that. <br /> <br /> Someone also claims that the KGB is chasing "Jews, gypsies, etc." Which is "worse than the Nazis". The KGB sought out the so-called "Zionist" agents, which (KGB believed) were imperialist agents. This is totally different from the targeting of Jewry as the whole nation as the Nazis did. Gypsies have never been prosecuted. The KGB was a political instrument and politically used, but internationally. Communists did not really differentiate between nationalities. The whole movie smells like a fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the characters in Berlin contain typographical mistakes, the KGB General looks totally false. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are completely made and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and fake things. Go to "Good Shepherd".
