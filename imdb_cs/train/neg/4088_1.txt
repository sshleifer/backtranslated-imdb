This was an event in the movie that watched life. I came to see the theater when he came out. I was completely surprised at how bad it was. Movies like this, you are interested in who gave the money and who owed, to whom favor - very, very great favor. Special effects are absolutely first levels, just like in any first level. Rubber rubber bats on strings without trying to hide strings, arrows that seem to be drawn on the film and look like the shape of a dart you find on the street and a ridiculous story. Ed Wood produced works compared to "Conquest". Every film pupil should see this thing just to get to know the very definition of bad film.
