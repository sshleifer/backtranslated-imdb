... but I also saw it better. The story here is predictable - the film crew tries to shoot a horror movie where murders have occurred. Three believe what will happen. It is not a complete bomb - the cast is quite good with the pros of John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine, who give the best performances. It's pretty well done - for a low-budget movie. Just do not expect any nakedness, swearing, blood or gore (the film has a very mild PG rating). I've never been bored - it's fine at night. I saw it on the video - it was HORRIBLE print - very dark and some scenes were not visible. Still, I hated it, and it has a cool ending that surprised me - basically nothing happens until then, so it catches you. It's worth seeing, but only if you're a horror movie complete.
