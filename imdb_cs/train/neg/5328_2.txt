Susan Seidelman appears to have a decent career with several top credits under the belt. I'm sure she's back from this movie that seems to have her admirers. I'm not one of them. I've seen better acting in college games than I do in Smithereens. For example, as a young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to become a music world, she is willing to do something to get there. He even rejects the sincere progress of a young artist living in his eastern river supply by Brad Rijn. Young Mr. Rijn contributes to the worst performance in the film, in fact, one of the worst actor's work I've seen a long time ago. No wonder he is not going anywhere. I say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is good at capturing well-known places in East Village, where the film was mostly shot. But her work with her live artists has not changed. I'm not sure he has so much raw material you can work with. Take a quick look and see the very young Christopher Noth before the law, organization and sex in the city as street guards. br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can sit on the soundtrack. I'll join Bing Crosby.
