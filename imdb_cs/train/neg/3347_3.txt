I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think I can see him on the screen, I think everyone who works hard can succeed without regard to talent. That's a good feeling for all of us who have no talent. Some of the other reviews point to how silly it is, but many neglect points to positives. <br /> <br /> Every movie where at least one unpleasant teenager is killed can not be bad. Why do so many teenage films always have stereotyped teens? Is there no other kind of adolescents? Does each group of teens have one angry black guy? One ugly genius that no one likes? One sister girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? One disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home, who all agree, is talented (but what is the talent?). And one black boy who is at peace with the universe and so cold that all other neurotic children believe him. Then add some generic consumer teens of any color. They do not say much, but sometimes they're shot. <br /> <br /> Detention would be better if the bad men were thrown at school. Preferably, the writer inside. Dialogue is bad and the story is worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) finally abduct a delivery full of drugs, then they sit inside the van. He drives the delivery to school because they want to paint the van again at the school shop, but they never get to paint the van again. By the way, it would be easier to put all the drugs into another car or two cars or another vans or truck and leave without painting a Police Car. They also never move drugs or sell them, or do something else with a high score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide to kill children and teachers (Dolph Lundgren), even though when villains take over school, nobody remembers it remotely because it's after school hours. A bunch of people still have nothing to do with painting cars at school, so why are we going after them? <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is that the villains are armed with many machine guns and are still looking for teens (including a guy on a wheelchair) and shoot hundreds of bullets in teens and are mostly missing. There is some bloodshed at the end of the film. At least three hundred bullets must be fired at any moment when someone is shot. Stunts are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews that says this movie had a budget of $ 10 million and I am amazed. When I saw the movie, I decided that Lundgren did it as a charity work for a film school where the teacher is. Just like this movie was their end-of-year exam. It was the exam I followed, but I went through it.
