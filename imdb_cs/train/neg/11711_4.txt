A good movie with a beautiful front lady, but a terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays her husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is a film-saving pardon. She is the best actor of the pile. <br /> <br /> NOTE * The first comment from the one who deeply praised the movie (and according to his IMDB.com account he wrote only one review - and guessing which movie?) is, of course, a plant. While the movie is pretty shot, it is by no means subtle or great, or any other hypobolical description that the reviewer uses. <br /> <br /> "Art of revenge" is a fair film, but it is a great irritation. She offers all sorts of sexual situations, but she never goes with him. Just like watching skin on Cinemax, but with all the "naughty bits" released. The film as a whole is a little out of focus, and the end and a large part of the third act is really a big mess. There is, of course, a twist, because every film nowadays finds it necessary to end. <br /> <br /> And <br /> <br />
