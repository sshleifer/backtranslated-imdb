With nothing better, I decided to explore "Aztec Rex" (as it was charged) for his hell. A stupid story could play better if the effects of dinosaurs were convincing. In fact, they looked like animations (those harsh designs artists later used to complete CGI effects, adding more details, smoother moves, etc.) Absolutely awesome dinosaurs, which is the only reason. <br /> <br /> One redeemed factor was the beautiful Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. My interest was standing; if only the budget was strengthened and some convincing dinosaurs could be used. Disappointment. At least the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii where the film was shot.
