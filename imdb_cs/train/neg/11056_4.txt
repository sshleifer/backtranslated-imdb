In this movie I was so disappointed. I do not know much about the true story, so I was thrilled to see it on the film and to get a little history of history. With such a strong story and great actors, it looked like a certain combination. Well, somewhere the script failed. It was so scattered - is this film about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to incorporate these things into a good story, but this movie was not. I was cold as I watched characters that were not rebuttable because of their disability but because of their personalities. Other small handles: 1. Soundtrack with heavy hands. It's the 1970s - I AM EVERYONE! 2. If there is such a phenomenal public speaker, why did we here and there be more interested than excerpts - and even then mostly in monsters?
