I have no idea which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this bad comedy. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy clothes and polyester on the carpet throughout the 1970s, "Norman" plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes that include comic misunderstanding, not to mention the extended portraits of Waylon Flowers! Based on the play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of a spooky married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) teaches in a tough way that their son is secretly homosexual - and lives with milling, denying a white homosexual - has a lot of limp -more joke to embarrass every early episode of "Three's Company". Bailey retains his dignity, and Foxx's utter confusion is good for a few laughs, but other artists are humiliated. * z ****
