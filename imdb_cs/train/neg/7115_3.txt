Okay, so opening a hockey offer of a free coffin for anyone who dies in a movie is so poor that it's funny. And so the first "skull scene" is so extravagant and non-exciting it's funny. The real plot of the film is somewhat decent, the character's attitude is at least a bit of an original meal that we can think about, and plot plot is decent when horror moves. The game is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not quite flat in a 1/10 movie mode. It's not bad enough to get the lowest score or even the second lowest. If I simply read the script, I would say there is a potential for it to be a decent film. It's just that awful direction and production that destroyed the movie. So it's a bad movie, but there's a lot worse.
