Here's another Diane Lane movie where she cheats her husband. Is it the only role that knows how to play? This time she was set up in 1969 and cheated her husband with a man with blouses. I'm so surprised because it's so predictable. Then her husband crazy and throws milk. I would not be surprised if she also slept with milk. I would not be surprised if she also slept with ice cream because it is a very boring film. Then, after some milk run, she says she apologizes and sees the blouse again. Spirit. Then, when she's doing with her, her son is hit with wasps. My mom always told me not to throw stones at the nest. This little girl did not have time to tell him she was too busy with a blouse.
