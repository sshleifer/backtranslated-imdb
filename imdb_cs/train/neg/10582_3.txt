At first I was convinced that this was a television movie that was not worthy of primetime. But after a few minutes of deep astonishment, I realized that at least the comical value was in the most beautiful stunts and c-film. This movie would have won 1 if we did not really like our wife and me when we watched with astonishment that the actors could keep their face straight. It was like the less entertaining spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I actually bought DVD Big Hit) with even worse gaming. We were disappointed that Nick decided to take Elena, not Jim, after all the passing and high five. A few rums and coconuts will definitely help to make it easier.
