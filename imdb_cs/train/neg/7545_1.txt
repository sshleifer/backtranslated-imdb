It's unfortunate that you can not go one star. Before watching The Wicker Man, I considered Aliens 3 the only film that would really deserve negative stars. In all justice, The Wicker Man does not worsen the enjoyment of an older movie, but the fact remains that my cumulative film enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick often used in Hollywood when the producers are too clinging to hire a writer or too fast to hurry to allow them a satisfactory conclusion: slapping into a shocking end and hoping that the public something artistic or meaningless will be missing. This is a gambit that rarely succeeds, and in this case it can only distract the embarrassment of a subtle actor and mock the producers. Still more, it seems that the conclusion of "carefully processed" (or whatever it is) does not logically stem from conspiracy (which of course I can not process without the introduction of spoilers) and instead deny what earned the conspiracy up to this point. A film that could logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles and possibly hardcore fans of Nicholas Cage, but only to some of the main audience. If you really want something in this direction, I cordially recommend M. Night Shyamalan's Village Place. If there is no memory deletion pill, I suppose I have to look at something better to get out of my mind, let's say: Attack from Killer Tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?
