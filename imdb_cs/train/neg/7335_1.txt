This is probably the worst version of the game I've seen - several times on the stage except the movie. A very nice idea for a meeting - the US South can give a credible backdrop for extreme reactions around Hero's alleged misconduct. But execution! Widdoes is very satisfied with Beatrice, who is doing extremely poor performance. Waterston, a fine actor, is no better than Benedict. The worst performance is in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make that cartoon along the line of the villain who binds the girl on the train track fits with the keystone kicks of the Capper Dogberry and his men - but the acting makes you want to ruin. <br /> <br /> Successful compositions include a scene in which Benedict deceives the belief that Beatrice loves him - it would be an excellent acting. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict, which is approaching, is well produced. <br /> <br /> Overall, I had to make myself look, but I certainly will not hold it. <br /> </ p> <p> Very disappointing. In view of the above comments I am almost 40. I have been watching Shakespeare's theater and screen productions for more than two decades. I could recommend that you try to defend your friends to talk to this work rather than attack other reviewers when you are really badly armed. However, I can assume that your youthfulness of youthfulness is enough for you to have age when it was the taste of a few days. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite pair was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic artist, can act.
