When I'm looking for new cars, I expect ships will not be exposed. When I drink a Coke fountain, I should expect the beverage to contain coke. When I look at a movie that is adorned on behalf of an excellent scientist, I expect it to be relevant in some way for this person or her work. They could have been people who spoke about my grandmother's diary. The material to which it relates is relevant only to the fact that scientists are vaguely bothered. I fell asleep for the first time I tried, and for the second time I stopped watching it. I love science and documents. I'd rather watch them over the last blockbuster. But is not that far enough to give you something worth your time? Avoid at all costs.
