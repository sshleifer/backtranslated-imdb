This series gets 2 stars, just because the film saves some of Dickens' Bleak House and maybe somebody reads a book. Contrary to what he probably assumed, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. She was clumsy and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is bad, bad, bad for Mr. Jarndyce. So I'm going to interrupt and respond to all those people who say, "I have not read a book, so I do not have to understand that guy because he has based his assessment on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is wrong in her role due to bad behavior, whether you read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce (though he is too old). The series fails because it is unfair to compare it with a book, but because the characters and characters of the plot simply do not connect to create a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and entertaining pastime. It's dull and flat. To create a seemingly good Bleak House, you have to spend 20 hours of film in 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest that producers, etc., let Dickens himself (even Christmas carols). Television diminishes the genius of Dickens, as reflected in his genius drawings and unforgettable characters.
