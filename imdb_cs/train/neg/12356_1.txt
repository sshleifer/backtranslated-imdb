Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott was thinking, but I learned that women are as silly as men in the army. They learn to stamp, offend and fight in combat, and that's also a waste of time (in my opinion). And what the hell was the last scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gaddafi, or is it easy for everyone to believe that people are always at risk?
