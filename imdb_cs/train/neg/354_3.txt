Take a look at the wonderful range of talents you've created for this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even portraits of Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They prove that in the puzzles it is said that good cast can not save the bad scenario. The story requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its improbability should also surpass Hollywood standards. It's not too original and "twisted" are totally cruel.
