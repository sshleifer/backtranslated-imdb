I jumped on the opportunity to watch this film uninterrupted and uninterrupted, remembering the rahs and raves for it. But wherever he seemed to slip into a truly frightening, he turned away and went somewhere else. Dripping water throughout the house, black rain, prophetic dreams, and bad turns in raw waste were released before they could scream. What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost faint facial mask offered a small, but confused mistrust, something I had seen as a mirror as the film rang. What could have been the amazing indigenous singing and the instruments in the background were instead cacophony seemingly designed to defeat the horror of the head. The thoughts that modern humans can embody old gods that indigenous people believe they are the first priests of red-brown white men and many other options are passed on similarly to a list of purchases rather than a Dream Time. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene, I was not sure what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? Tsunami? Yes good. It is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From the wave? The last wave? That would have to be a big wave. Why? Was the world so bad? It was not that horrible in this movie. Actually, I did not think the wave was running out because the shadow left Burton's face waved. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Damn, it happens every day to the people who lost it. It was no interest if it was him alone. The heaviest scene and the one that gives the best idea of ​​Weir's potential was in Charlie's apartment, where Burton went to stand up with the old man in fear of Burton's wife. Charlie still asks, "Who are you?" and after a while it becomes really disturbing. Unfortunately, the film never followed.
