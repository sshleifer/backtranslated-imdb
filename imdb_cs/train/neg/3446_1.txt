This film on the paper looked as if it were good, even though I realized that this movie was totally terrible! The plot is meaningless and I think I count the best part of 5000 scenes, each of which makes the film more annoying and ridiculous. I watched this late black playground be no noise at all, just to add SCARINESS to it, but the truth is the only thing that scared me out of music what they would call tragic music, playing opera I mean! This film summarizes everything that is not good about this type of movie. To be honest, do not say more, but watch at your own risk that this film is just a complete waste, OFFER!
