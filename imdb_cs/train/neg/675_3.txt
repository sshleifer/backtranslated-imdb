City girl Meg Tilly receives a terrible phone call from her mother and, of course, shaken, returns home to her country's family trenches just to confront the mystery: why are all residents of the house behaving bizarre and disturbing? The radiant thriller, who has barely nodded ecology, has the inhabitants of small towns who have fun, which (ridiculously) involves two women looking at each other in public, and Tim Matheson receives the girl's mouthfuls attention on the bench. The picture is too stupid for the words, losing Tilly's sadness and silent intensity on the basket while he is forced into a corner, which he can not hope to get out of it. Some cinematography by Thomas Del Rutha is good (especially the order of fire placed inside the garage), although it is released after the scrappy edition - and a rather overwhelming final. The simplified scenario has a surprise or breakthrough in originality. * 1/2 from ****
