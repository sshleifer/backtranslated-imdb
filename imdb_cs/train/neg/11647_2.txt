CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; Italian crime drama, partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. Easily forgotten movie. Even despite a good sequence of car hunters, it seems that this impact almost does not matter. New Don takes over a powerful mafia and finds that he is fighting for his own life. Unpacked laws and the ethics of Mafia code make it harder to trust anyone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence bring the same thing in return. It can not be placed on shelves with real gangster epics. Only the look of the film brings memories of the American ticket. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can not increase the caliber of this crime. Antonio Sabato also stars with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
