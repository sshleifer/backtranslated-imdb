From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. It's so clich√© that your typical NRA member will not even love this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, just for William Benton's acting. I can not believe that 6+ people voted for this movie. He is so interested in "a certain view" (one thief ...). People are not born wrong. Nor is it born good. She is born with pure slate. It's a society, parents, and education, what makes them what they are. And if they take a wrong turn, somewhere along the track, it's definitely not an American criminal system that would put them back on track! Anyway, avoid this film as a plague. I bet you have better things with your time than to waste that bite. <br /> <br />
