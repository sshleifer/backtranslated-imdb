The world is the biggest joke. The biggest and most exclusive world joke in the world. Emulating crazy and "everyday" humor of office space, this film drives the attraction of this film into the land so that humor is such that it will only be properly appreciated by the legal secretaries who write books. The audience is asked to take over the unknown role of the secretary of law, and then connect with the absurd stupid protagonist. The entire film is aimed at a legal secretary who is looking for leisure time, listening to music and writing a novel at work. These are his goals. You can not imagine it's in the face, it's for the audience when (around half) finds out that it has a job that meets all three criteria, but then it gives it UP! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely eliminates the motivation of the audience to empathize or even find a fun protagonist who has previously rejected what he complains about the lack of this. <br /> <br /> In addition, a major breakthrough, a legal secretary dedicated to humor, fails because it must be explicitly explained to the audience every time it happens. Without these parties, the audience would not notice anything special. Humor is effective only when it is not necessary to explain to the audience what funny is.
