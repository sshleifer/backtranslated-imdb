A ruthlessly frantic and painlessly tireless attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bert from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom, it's as bad as some say it is! <br /> <br /> Laughing just serves to remind an unemployed viewer, what in this supposed comedy is to be a joke and how desperately it laughs that it really is! However, it is a bit interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. its best to feature Cleavon Little. His embarrassment is reflected in every scene. He was much more entertaining in HBO El Diablo than he was in this plate of cheese! The really best and most fun thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
