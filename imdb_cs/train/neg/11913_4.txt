Good idea, poorly implemented. While it can summarize 99% of the SciFi channel, it really does. I like movies that slowly reveal a good story back, I like action movies and I like all the main actors so it could be great. However, despite some good acting, this film fails due to bad writing and directed by Bill Platt. Further reviews have shown that you need to know where you are going to get there. This movie is not. It's a casual way that you know the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is totally useless and could be removed without anyone noticing it. This scene even begins and ends by driving a car, so you can cut from one scene of the car to another and you never miss an absurd scene in the middle. This movie also had a special habit under the explanation of some details in explaining to others, some to the point where you can guess the whole "conspiracy" in the front. It was also a habit to interrupt the struggle soon, probably only because they could not afford it. There is also a few laughs of the bad scene where the "plot" is revealed on the computer and the final battle involving a comfortably placed "toxic glue" (seriously what * is * this?). are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because it's okay. From his personality "Roswell" gets out several times and makes a good cat (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he did from playing Q back in ST: TNG, so it's nothing new. Overall, I gave this movie 4/10 ratings.
