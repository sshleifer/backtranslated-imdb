This is referred to as a documentary, it is not, it is filmed as a document, but I suspect it is just because they get away with a restless camera and a playful shoot. It has just begun in the UK on DVD as a comedy "American Pie", it is not. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's about a group of adolescents on spring break when they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the goal of finally coming up with a virgin boyfriend. Throwing is a couple of dwarves, even on the same kind of search and you have a story about drunken teens trying to get a couple of girls. <br /> <br /> Since 18 ratings have very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes, I think that the rating is for a lot of infamy. <br /> <br /> If you like the rough behavior of Jackass without humor, then it may be your thing if you have any brain cells to the left I would probably have avoided it!
