I saw this film at AFI Dallas. Most viewers, including my wife, enjoyed this comic track, but I did not. Starring Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who married Molly Parker. All three actors make a great job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and the infidelity that includes the third. Everything takes place at the lake house and looks great. The film first wants to work on its subject as a comedy and then a drama, and I thought it had to be the opposite.
