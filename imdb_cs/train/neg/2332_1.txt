What was the purpose of this film? I suggest that a few heroes and their producers and director earn a lot of money for not doing anything. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep his interest in this tedious movie. The crazy former pugilist falls with a strange woman and her relatives. He starts as a man who is real to this woman, and he pulls him to beat men and is about to catch him in a kidnapping. It was so confused that I can not even write a good criticism. If you see this, darling, make sure it's in the dark so you can go to sleep.
