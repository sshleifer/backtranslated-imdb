Rebar is an astronaut who is on the first space mission on Saturn in the world, but of course it is a horror movie that becomes ugly and he returns to the ground as the only survivor. Damn with some bizarre state that causes it to slowly melt and lose its mind until it is regularly consumed by the human body, it kills what seems to be the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring city to shoot more victims. <br /> <br /> I like the assumption and the monster and gore effects are actually quite good, but the space scenes are simply stuck together from NASA footage and the hospital looks curiously like a warehouse. A very low scenario, little character development, and poor overall performance, keep this from climbing over any other than average movement of slashers with the news to have a lively candle like a killer, and more or less it has only its gore effects, interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, exclusively for the most silent movie fans.
