I had the bad luck to sit for 102 minutes, which, in my opinion, is this shocking film. It basically fails at all levels; cast is horrible, acting - ham at best and the plot lacks some depth, so I feel violently apathetic in terms of the outcome of any of the intricate stories of the line. Plan B has no spell, this genre has room for mediation, and I found it physically tapering in different places where the script makes its regular misdirected meanderings anywhere in comedy. Bona fide saccharine covered with turd film.
