First of all, I would like to point out that Sam Niel is not seen in this film anywhere. What is a film without Sam Niel. Anyone seen Event Horizon. D-Wars had the potential of a dragon movie that controls rocket launchers and sounds great, but it's sad. No, not Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend taking 5 dollars or so it will go to rent D-Wars and adding 10 to this five and buy the film Sam Niel-apparently to submit it I have to have ten lines of text so heres list Sam Niel movies I recommend <br /> <br /> - Jurassic Park - Soothing Calm - Hunting for Red October - Convenient Horizon - Not Jurassic Park Three <br /> <br /> The total D-Wars is a pile
