This movie was terrible. The story was exhausted, the acting was bad, the editing was awkward, and this movie made me take my eyes off. I wish I had the time I spent watching this film. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack dried up, I did not see any chemistry between the two drivers, full of stereotypes, silly local "celeb" stories ... the most famous was Del "I'm going to drive as fast as I want. computer idiot. The worst thing is that these actors had to play on the spiritual side and even they jumped. This film helps create a long line of insignificant efforts to incorporate the LDS faith into Hollywood. I.E. RM, church balls, etc. I would have watched this movie and instead run my head first into a brick wall. You will have more fun than watching this bad excuse for the show.
