I had a video about the thing. And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole movie without sleeping. It is slow and the idea of ​​the Central Atlantic Platform, which at that time could have been revolutionary, is now only a big one. In addition to Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is quite forgotten, and it is only in action at the end that things are really interesting. When the water began to deplete, I woke up on one occasion. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. It does not begin between his index and middle fingers as smaller mortals. He held it in his fingers and showed us the old pearly brown. In this film there are several scenes where the smoke gives to the sky on a dark background and looks very artistically. But it does not say much about this movie if everything you think is tobacco smoke.
