I do not know what everyone likes about this movie. Set-up was too long and talky, and when it was done, the main character stayed as flat and opaque as in the first scene. After the film finally got Cusack into the hotel room of the same name, I had to wonder what was going on here for another hour or so to keep me busy. Answer: Not much, just John Cusack has a long, trained, mental breakdown. Maybe if the Cusack character had more depth. . Maybe if his monster was a more thorough reworking of his everyday life. . . perhaps, if the film had either better developed its half-baked themes of loss and faith, or stuck to it first. . . perhaps, if the film chose to be either psychological horror or exciting horror horror, and fully accepted one of these styles. . . I do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other enthusiastic enthusiasts, and none of us liked it very much. In addition to a disturbing episode on the hotel's rumble, an alarming crazy lady with a hammer and a so-stupid-to-be-fun crypta holder in the air channel, all three of which represent no more than five minutes of screen, this film was a hole. <br /> <br /> By the way, it seems that this story stole the thoughts of The Shining and used them for a much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas apart?
