It's a really bad movie. Ideology is not as perverse as in the films Collins made later. However, my main doubts about the film are that it is unlikely and long sincerely boring. The whole concept of a former person who joins terrorists for any reason is not very convincing, and you can not think why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become quite helpless) falls into it. The film starts with a very strong scene, but then it is going on for a long time towards the big final. Overall, I think Who Dares Winnings could be an interesting 45-minute episode of Professionals, but the story does not feature a feature film. Although he was quite successful, he began Collins career, which in the eighties created mainly cheap and dubious military or military films. It's a pity, because he's actually a fairly versatile actor, but at the end of the day, Martin Shaw has chosen his roles more carefully and has a career that's still successful.
