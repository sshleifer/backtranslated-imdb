I did not think it was totally terrible, as some people seem to do. It moves like one of those cheese horror movies that you could waste time in the middle of the night when you can not sleep, although it's certainly not a better quality. It's true that acting is not great - I thought Marianne McAndrew, like Cathy Beck, for example met with no passion - but the main problem is that some aspects of the plot really do not make sense. Becks are on the path that John (Stewart Moss) described as a piece of work and partly a honeymoon they never had (it's now romantic!) The work part has something to do with caves that are strangely sounding from the tour group across the cave to work someone?), but he learns that he is a doctor who is engaged in research in preventive medicine (what? This connection has completely lost me). in the cave it begins to turn into what I suppose to be a human hybrid (although we will finally see it in make-up, it looks more like some human people) and starts killing. Here's another problem. The first killing is the nurse in the hospital. At first, everyone thinks her death was a coincidence. The second murder is a young girl who is described as her throat torn. Sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells her that her death was similar to her sister (which means that her throat broke? - How could anyone think it was an accident?) And what about the sheriff? It seems that there is no nonsense up to the scene in Cathy's hotel room when she takes a whisper of alcohol and then almost rape, after which everything seems to return to normal. It is fitted with an end that left almost everything unresolved and one of the most irritating motifs I've ever heard in the movie. And it was all there was something that kept me watching. Sometimes pure cheese can get you over an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yeah - but not as terrible as some people say.
