A pretty bad Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad feature film. How disappointed that it came from Hooper and Dourif! Government contractors are doing a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy, who was born a couple in the experiment, still suffers from a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is an adult, people in his life spontaneously burn. He's trying to figure out why. <br /> <br /> People who are in the fire are well done, but when they get into a state that they are well done in a different sense, they are obviously changed to dummies. When the fire nozzles fire out of the arms of the characters, it looks rather foolish than alarming. Also ridiculous is the fire that apparently travels over telephone lines and explodes in huge jets from the receiver of the headset. How is it going to happen, exactly? Something else that made me think stupid is when I have a vision of my late parents. Later we see exactly the same shots of those visions in home movies.
