The Griswald winners win the TvV show "Shit Pussy" and all fly together to Europe where they can make one stupid disaster after another. Of all the ridiculous, unsuccessful sequel to money laundering, this will be a great deal to beat. The Harold Ramis film of 1983 was a bad average story in which the family went unnecessarily to the nightmare "Holiday" across the states. This time, Amy Heckerling ("See who's talking to you") will help you what turns out to be a catastrophic "comedy" that bothers you more than you will laugh at. Hughes' script (with Rob Klane) is terrible and you wonder why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo have bothered with such a dead project because even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had the sense to reject the offer. Even the omnipotent Michael Palin is incapable of raising control to any level that could be called entertainment. Yet, as it seems unthinkable, "European Holiday" has been successful enough to be a second sequel! It certainly could not be as unbearable as this one. You know, I've seen the National Lampoon show, which is worth bothering. Monday 26 December 1994 - T.V.
