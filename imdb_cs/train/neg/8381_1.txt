There are some extremely talented Blacks directors Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and many others who bring a highly deserved credit to the film industry. Then there are Wayans Brothers, who all of a sudden (15 years ago) had an extraordinary entertaining TV show 'In Living Color,' which inter alia launched Jim Carrey's career. Now we have a stupidity that replaces humor and gross gag (toilet humor) as a standard surgical procedure. People are not as stupid as those who are portrayed in the "Little Man" who can not be. A baby full of tooth and tattoo is considered a single month? The child comes with a five hour shadow that shaves. It is suggested that the child has sex with his fist mother for his men, Darryl, back. Yeah, that's just funny. As the chief criminal, "Little Man" is the most stupid on the planet Earth. She hides the stolen rock, which is huge in a woman's purse, and then she must persecute her. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by a crazy." Based without credits on the cartoon series Chuck Jones, Baby Buggy Bunny. It's too stupid to be even distant. The key to Damon Wayans' film being bad, he appeared on Jay Leno the night before he won the BAT award, and did not even mention this horrible movie. When will Hollywood stop the Green Waste from the Wayans Brothers? When they are most likely to get over a white husband.
