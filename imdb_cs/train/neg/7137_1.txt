The cars in this movie are amazing. The actors in this movie are terrible. Scene and driving scenes do not make much sense and are just as bad. If you really bother movies, where someone moves and suddenly goes funerally faster, save yourself trouble and money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there is a part where the mistake is to refer to the NASCAR driver as a car rally driver. If you can not distinguish, look, you will have a blast. It really is, really really nice cars in this movie, they are powered horribly and are totally unrealistic. The game is terrible mainly because of an extremely bad conspiracy. To see hot girls, turn mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that such nice cars will be represented in such a bad movie. If the car class is the same as in the movie, they should ride with rusted bicycles.
