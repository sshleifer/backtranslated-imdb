This movie is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. And I do not mean that well. We wanted to see a horrible horror / thriller, so we chose the one who looked the smartest in the store. Once upon a time, the film was all we expected. And more! (or should I say less?) The actors look as if they read the lines from the posters behind the camera. So-called special effects are created by placing the red transparent plastic in front of the camera to give the impression of looking through the eyes of the killer rats. And the screenplay? Do not even start me on the script ... And just as you thought it could not get worse, it turned out that the first part of the film was compared to the end. Oscar material. br /> Take it from me, this movie is cheerful when you get into dirty horror, but if you want a good movie, keep going. That's not for you.
