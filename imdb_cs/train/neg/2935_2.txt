(See our Blog What-To-See-Next for details about our rating system.) <br /> <br /> Here's the movie, an attempt to exclude from the online movie, screen tedium. <br /> <br /> Do not move your hands, do not move your eyes or give up the popcorn. Not really. For a movie with a * * * average, it will only make a knock on your own face. <br /> <br /> When you start looking for your own face - you must! - Start at the bottom. You'll need your top with comfortable tear-off cannons intact for really the third, which can bring you to your knees if you have not been turning around all the way from the theater ever since. <br /> <br /> In the season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Mum's Hockey as a new gold standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, you can really welcome the film as something anyone could create. Tracking * is far more dangerous. <br /> <br /> Here's our story ... Sidney Young, the London publisher of the fourth-degree celebrity / entertainment magazine, is about to look at his magazine. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a call from New York, USA. Sharp magazine publisher Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says: "Come work for me!" With his own employees who make a fax from his flat / office in the background, he says "Yes" is a non-brainer. Soon Sidney is at work in New York, doing all the bad things. His interviews are made up of demands for Broadway music directors if (1) Jewish and (2) gay. <br /> <br /> Kills Sohpie Maes, the hottest movie star in the industry, when he leaves him in the magazine's office during a business lunch. <br /> <br /> This is a bad luck for everyone because, among other things, Sidney thinks she's in love with Maes before she wakes up to Dunst. The worst of all is to completely alienate Alison Olsen's script-confusion Kristen Dunst), a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine * and * Big Apple. (We had a movie before and we know how this relationship will end, so we will need intact tear canals for the third movie.) <br /> <br /> The problem with The Thing is that the screen never hides, except for a single a tear-off piece in which true love prevails. Publisher Harding is to be a son - a girl who also wants to throw the whole job. However, the scenario is never approached on one side or on the other side of this dichotomy, and Bridges turns and moves in the breeze. Alison Olsen is to disdain Sidney Young, but whenever he comes to her (just like him constantly), she makes sense to engage him in an interview instead of trying to discourage his existence. The "comedy" of early scenes is built around a pig destroying the expensive hotel room and then take the elevator down to urinate the expensive high heels of a celebrity at the cocktail reception. Hot star Maes admits she's attracted to Young because he's "wounded." The character never shows us why he's wounded. This is another consequence of the film's deathly injured scenario. Within one hour and fifty minutes, this matter feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. It is insurmountable, dysfunctional, unenforceable and not even sold. Run away
