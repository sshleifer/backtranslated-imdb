After we counted on the use of the word f, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, they listened to some really bad actors who walked on a woman and horses and pretty much behaved like 12-year-old boys being naughty together, well, we switched it off. Relating to the gratuitous shame and humor of the genre is a sign of a lost Hollywood film, a product of writers without borders and without talent. <br /> <br /> We gave her a second chance and we thought it would be better. No dice. Later, my friend missed the rest of the film if it got better, and no more cubes. <br /> <br /> The main character had a cool lap. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this for anyone, except for really immature adolescents or boys.
