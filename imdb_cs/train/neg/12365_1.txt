I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why do all American animators think that kids these days want a stupid GI JOE version of good stories ??? Looney Tunes are some of the most popular characters in history, but they were not designed to be Xtreme, I think, come on! Tiny Toons was a great example of how the old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this piece of waste is just an example of silly corporate decisions that just want to create a cheap idiot show that kids will love because hey! ! kids love superhero properly ??? the whole show is just a waste of time in which we see a new version of Looney Tunes, but this time in the form of a superhero, it does not look too bad, but the problem is that this show is trying too hard to copy the series as a batman animated series or a new league, ??? bad copy of lightning (runner on road) or superman (who else? bugs bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes were not meant to be dramatic, should have been funny !!!! as I said before this series is upset and many people wonder why the anime is accepting around the world ??? this show is trying to be dramatic and action, but that's something that few serials and anime can do if you want to see a good upgrade of the old show Watching Tiny Toons, this is an example that can be reverted to the life of old characters, but with a good story and respecting the original roots. that the show is already dead, I expect another corporate wise decision.
