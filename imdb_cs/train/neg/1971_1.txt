This film is a deep disappointment. Not only does Wenders display a very limited Blues music spectrum, it's his subjective and personal interest in some of the music he brings to a movie that makes watching and listening absolutely boring. The only culmination of the film is the conversation of the Swedish couple, who with J.B. Lenoirem made friends and showed his private videos as well as telling stories. Wenders' introduction to the film theme is quite interesting - he refers to world culture (or indeed American culture) traveling to the universe, but his limited view of the subject, as well as the funny or totally fascinating reproduction of the 30s, makes this film as an ordinary sleeping aid. Yawn. I expected more of him.
