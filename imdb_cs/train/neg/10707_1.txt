Where to start? This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Edits are the worst, the sound effects were terrible, and sound editing was destroyed. Most of the movie that everyone could be here are dirty kicks, with murmuring in the background. I had to increase the volume to full blast just to her what's going on ... and what should I hear? Probably one of the worst scenarios ever to happen. I can not believe that people actually gave a green film for this film. It makes me take the box in the box, send it to the producers and then let them finance the film for me. Dolph was the usual Dolph. There is nothing else to say. The villains were bad, the protagonists were bad and the film was stinking. If you really want to know what you did not have to do when writing, directing or editing a movie, watch it!
