This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is surprising how brilliant actors, like the two main characters in this film, have taken on such a worthless amount of waste. The film is a genre of rape / beatings and revenge. The couple went to the party and on their way back they hit the deer and he set out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys arrives. He did not go to his car, instead kicked him and was good when he tried to run the car that betrayed her and she was raped. Then there is a woman in her father's house and one of those neighbors, so she took a shotgun and wanted to kill him ... So silly scenario! Hollywood! He was against this vengeance, but "She was raped," "They laugh at her," so she must kill them all ... But when she was inside the house, she was pleased to push her rifle at the tip of the bad guys and disappeared while he was crazy and to do the evil guy. Personally, I think the director exhausts the money before it ends because the film ends before committing someone else involved in this gang-rape and beating, which is not a big surprise because the sponsor obviously saw and wanted to take back his money . LoL This movie is not even for people who like to watch rape because they will not see anything they are looking for ... This director should be forbidden ... It is upset that this litter of litter was made by British cinematography, I like it and that's why I watched it. Do not do it yourself, you have better things to watch a silly screenplay ...
