Creating a television series on popular author works is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television found it difficult to learn the rights to books attributed to Dick Francis in 1979, three of which were broadcasted under the title "Racing Game." Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey turned his private eye after an accident in which he lost his right hand only to replace him with an artificial one. Gwily suffered an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the irritating Chico Barnes) was thinking about the horse's ass whenever he was on the screen. For six weeks, this less than a dynamic duo charged in the countryside, driving the nasty land to repair the race, usually by the same methods - blackmail, kidnapping riders or doping horses. Yorkshire Television threw money on the show, but without success. Violent, sexist, far-reaching and repeated, was quickly taken to court.
