It is undoubtedly the most insulting "kitten" I have seen for years, if not. Writing and characterization are so stereotyped that the film follows a parody. Before we left the theater for an hour and five minutes into this disaster, we were subjected to the following topics: Having a child solve all your problems, "executive types" are unfortunate mess, and musicians can not be good mothers if they throw their dreams for a more common lifestyle . What a waste of talented cast and some great-looking scenes and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that if she did not live in the mainstream she would end up - she would shake herself - "herself!" I felt unhurt. I can not believe that this film has gotten into a theatrical release. It's the type of fare you expect from the "female" cable channels that I always go through when I surf the channel. I'm a woman and I'm over 35, so I should be part of the target audience of this movie, but the boy, "Evening" is missing a target.
