It could have been a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. The British representation was terrible to watch. Have the creators ever left a leg in Britain before filming? At least in England? I do not think any British person would have such an accent except the Skit comedy from The Royal Family! Also with two English boys ... well, I do not think an English boy would play, talk or dress up like an English child in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry preceded a public performance. American filmmakers. There are more than one country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland ... which means more than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but it was so bad I could not look. The fire looked cool.
