I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha will prove to be another mistake in combining Western and Asian art. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after a restless emphasis on exotic-oriented scenes, some may have been filled with them. Excessive cherry blossom was frankly surprised. It is probably the cultural difference of perception here: the highest beauty is not a glamorous type, because a truly beautiful geisha would not be over the western pumpkin in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some other comments correctly report the biggest mistakes. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is great. Actor / actress can play any role when he can look. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotion she made in this film has not been translated into Japanese style. Everything I saw was a jealous and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my most popular actresses, did not even look for Japanese. Some remarks mentioned the peculiar subtle, female qualities of Japanese women with whom they can not agree more. It's so delicate I suppose that even modern Japanese actresses are not eligible for the role of Geisha, let alone two Chinese and one Malay actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know much about Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good show to invite American audiences. But it would be an insult to film and art if the film wins the Oscar for the best costume, best director or best picture.
