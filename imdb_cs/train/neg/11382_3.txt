Everybody notices that Tommy has only three facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes seem to give each enemy. 2. Grasping hands behind the face, mouth agape and scared eyes. 3. Smiling Tommy Turnbull. I have to say I hate this performance, I do not watch it, but it's like Lyoko's code, we've all watched at least one, I have to show that this show is racist, uninteresting and unnecessary. Each episode ends with robotboy's victory, except for one exception, when robotboy basically let this overwhelming freakazoid fly to the jetpack. <br /> <The jokes are pretty rough, I think it's mostly people who say the word "Suck" or farting, I think bullying the show is quite shocking too, too. <br /> <br /> There is no such thing as hiding a bowling ball beneath his hatred, and the other using a string, for God, what school is he going to do. Not to mention his older brother, who is borderline psychopathic and has no other characteristics. The whole show I feel is breaking the megas XLR and Fosters. As well as you could say that trio coop, jamie and kiva, as well as Robotboy is similar to Megas, where he all beings no matter what a chance and he is a free spirit despite a robot. <br /> <br /> There is simply no appeal to this show, I am surprised that it is still running.
