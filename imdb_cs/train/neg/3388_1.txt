I admit that I was a fan of the original production. I have never seen a movie version until recently on cable and I watched it with the expectation that I could see my memories brought back alive because I loved the original show. Imagine my horror. This must be the worst translation of Broadway Broadcast on a movie ever made. They changed the story, changed the songs, lost the soul. I was expecting a trip to the memory, singing on an extremely touching music and a mirror, a ballet, and hi, twelve, hello thirteen. No! Not only did they forge the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they broke the story, added songs and the external plotline (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) that were not in the original form and injected "drama" where it was not necessary. The original had enough patos alone. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, do not bother. I apologize for having spent my time unnecessarily, diluting my memories and watching this rumble.
