SNL is pretty funny, but people who say it's like watching a short skit on SNL is a little stupid. It's nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of crap. Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is just fun at Napoleon, Andy is trying his hardest and people think it's funny. In the movie, only the humorous people were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was funny with Andy was part of the pool. They could do a "Silent Place" much better if the falling scene did not come to 3 unnecessary minutes. <Br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The part in which he pronounces more H is slowed down. He's been trying to go with him for too long, and in part he looks like Andy is going to do it while he's acting ... he's a terrible actor and does not deserve to be in the movie. This movie is a joke and is for simple minded people with a 10-year-old comedy. That's about half the United States.
