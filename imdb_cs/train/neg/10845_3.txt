It's a surprising plot! ;) I've seen movies with fewer plot (I do not want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I thought the camera was not bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and the atmosphere was not too bad. There is no real reason for most of the things people do and the way they react to what's going on. Though I think about many movies, in this case it was terrible, of course. He ripped some movies so badly for each scene. The game was bad, but I saw it worse. The film was bad, but I saw it worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, laughter, intentions of death, sadism, agility and low-level entertainment. <br /> <br /> So if you like horror movies with stupid plot, it's the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> I gave her 3/10 because it can be fun if you do not expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood.
