1st observation 2/16/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery / Thriller with too many ridiculous plotters. In spite of a very talented cast, this film is too predictable and simply understates its audience. The film audience is not stupid, and I hope they constantly fill certain pockets of stars over and over again with what they are dealing with. We think that this film will start with something about Connery's conviction against capital punishment, but it turned out to be nothing more than a standard made for the audience, the running of a mill, we'll never see it, a thriller. We are attracted to every stupid switch in the character as shown to us when it is needed in the story, and we are ready for this thing to be ahead of us before it ends. Yes, there is some good acting, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psychosocial role, but the story does not work from the beginning to the long-awaited ending.
