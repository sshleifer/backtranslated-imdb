Actually, I had this movie to the end. Sure, it was skinny and quite unlikely, but after a rainy afternoon, my attention was still drawn. Until the end, it is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical Conservatory, where she tried to capture other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow is with her grasping and execution this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and carvers the great sensual Habaner from Carmen and turns her into a totally forgotten Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song. My ears bleed! And in the high moment of horror, her teachers are constantly cheerful! Any teacher who is not in the fantasy of Spears would not have succeeded in doing so. Save time, save your ears - skip this movie!
