This film is, at best, average. Angie Harmon is just as funny as a hammer bag. Her horrified "law and order" behavior is reflected in an unsuccessful attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one who does not hurt this horrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing that could come out of this mess is Charlie and Denise Marriage. Hopefully, this effort will bring better results.
