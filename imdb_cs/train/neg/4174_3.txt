Boy, it was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. It could be on Sci Fi and I do not see much Sci Fi, but one talks about a thin plot and two-dimensional characters to the maximum. The characters were stereotypical and exaggerated, conspiracy and setting were unbelievable, vampires were less intimidating, fun, gore was useless, the special effects were down - terrible and the end? The only thing that was unpredictable was when a lesbian suddenly started making a woman's vampire, which by the way is not really that hot, because it's going to take about three seconds to get closer to "What the hell? " then "Man, it's hot." If it ever occurs in reruns, God forbids, DO NOT USE it.
