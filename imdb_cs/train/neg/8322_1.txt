I was very surprised to see that this movie was so good when I watched IMDb after watching it. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen many bad movies. It looks like a good movie at the beginning, but when he came to the surgery, I could not believe how bad it was. This voice overcomes ALL! Imagine that you are so open and then listen to what he says. I saw the film in German, so I do not know what he was saying in English, but ironic things like "Yeah yeah, it will not hurt .."? ... what is it? Tell yourself that "think about something else" and then forget about your pain by thinking about your girlfriend is simply ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell is that? Someone tells her, her son died in surgery (what to expect). She also found several letters in the bag of Jessica Albas. plus that "knows the hospital" ... and then it takes "one second" to get it done? What the heck? ^ And the end ... why is the police grabbing it? The patient died in surgery, it all happened. That drunken doctor does not know anything ... and then they're all grabbed by them, and a girlfriend ??? Why??? Despite everything I think Christensen has done badly, but it does not really count for me ... the mistakes and stupidity I wrote above are a problem. I watch this movie with some friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... Just do not look;)
