If you loved "Pulp Fiction" and like handheld cameras you should love this movie. I liked a special story (although I feel that "Pulp Fiction" was the most exaggerated film from the "English Patient") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It's not "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened by European pretense. But the worst part is by far a handheld camera. It's so disturbing and uncomfortable that I'm desperately waiting for the movie to end. I do not know why directors think this shooting method is so great. If you are susceptible to movement sickness, stay calm, your hand-held camera will get nauseous in about 10 minutes.
