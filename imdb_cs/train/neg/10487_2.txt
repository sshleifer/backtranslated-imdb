FOR GOD! The only reason why I give this movie 2 instead of 1 is that Tom Hanks is funny like Elvis-in-the-box. Besides, how this half-way dignified sign to make such a lame movie? Maybe it sounded like a good idea at the time ... It's no laugh to mention, stereotypes are pathetic, cast is useless, direction is amateur. Now that I think about it, most guilt is probably based on director Joel Zwick. It gives nothing but a flat performance to everyone involved. Do not waste time like me; but then I enjoy the good wreck of the train. Geez, now the system tells me I need more links - here you go: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now it was more fun than anything in the movie ...
