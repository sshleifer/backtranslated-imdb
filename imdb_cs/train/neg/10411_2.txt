It is funny. I've seen a lot of Fassbinder movies, and I've seen some of them extremely creative and interesting, while others are repulsive and suicidal - like this movie. For me, it ranges from great to bullshit - without being halfway. I know he has a lot of fans among "sophisticated" but I can not help but I think a lot of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I get a lot of negative ratings), he shot too many movies too fast and was too suicidal. His gay or sexually bent films (like this one) tend to be really bad - scary, sometimes boring (like QUERELLE and BITTER TEARS PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just rough (like this movie). Could his report on the advent of sexual intercourse not be treated better than to show that he is wearing around him or looking at cows that are cruelly killed? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make sure your characters are more human and compassionate - maybe I would take care of the movies. <br /> <br /> I'm honestly after watching this movie that I do not have to bother with other Fassbinder movies - it seems wrong outside - the weigh of good.
