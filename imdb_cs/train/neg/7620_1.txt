I chased this movie because it sounded quite interesting, but for my horror this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I have read a commentary from Gumby-8 and have to be part of the cast or crew. If Gumby-8 is not a four-year-old child or some demented cult, no one in the right mind would feel that this film has any potential at all. I could not believe Gumby-8 comments. <br /> <br /> Quote: "From the" Dune "inspired opening of the animation at a fast pace ... this movie keeps eye on the move and works so well that repeated viewing is not unexpected." <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting, and the fact that the movie keeps eye on the move, that's because you're looking for some sort of tension. I mean, give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and by the way she became a cult classic. As for "repeat tracking not unexpected", I think he made a typo. Another quote from Gumby-8 single fan: "Act is also a strong aspect of the movie." /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With respect for the actor, their performance is nothing but a talent of Robert Napton. </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only gore you see is some red color on the leaf above the dead body that you never see. As far as I know, it can be a grass debris. In sum, I saw the horrific motions of the 50's, 60's and 70's. I saw what I considered to be absolutely the worst and some were very good. The director of this film did not make any attempt, he slept, nor did he experience any acid. Regardless, I think the actors deserve applause because they are trying to save a very bad job. I give this movie a .5 rating for the movie "B".
