I have to admit that I am a great fan of this show so you have to know how disappointed I was when watching this movie. First, the conspiracy was terrible, I thought it would be more interesting than to see what happened to Arnold's fathers or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house among many other places, so many people try to stop. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the conspiracy was not that bad, but what he was really getting was the steps Arnold and his friends had done to stop this maniac, becoming friends spies; driving a bus (based on a video game, for God) and doing all the worse, doing super buses on the bus, things that many people have tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga because they are video game experts. <br /> <br /> Frankly, my mom, my sister, even I really disappointed after watching this movie because it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I have to admit that I liked "Hey Arnold!" This was one of my favorite films on Nickelodeon, but after this crap of the movie I'm not sure if I will watch "Hey Arnold!" as I have done in the past. Another thing, Nickelodeon, with this tremendous amount of dynamite, I can assure you that a simple street is not going to explode, I think the whole city could explode. , and oh, please, if all of your future movies are good cartoons like this, you will not be making more movies, you give bad critics to the cartoons that were good. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think it was the worst way to end this show, a good show that has changed into this humorous movie.
