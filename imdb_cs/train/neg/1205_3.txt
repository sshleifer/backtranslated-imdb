What is it? Canadian zombie film I have never heard before. The Mason works on the body of the recently deceased young man. This allows for an extended look that shows how it got there. Basically, he and his friends visited the cemetery on Friday, October 13th, and raised up dead through their stupid singing. Cut back to the morgue where our dead body returns to life and kills mortis and the owner (who will breathe). Final WTF? shot the owner of the funeral home in a straight jacket and shouts, "I'm not a fool!" Surprisingly, he has eyeballs back. <br /> <br /> During unexpected 58 minutes it's definitely one custom in a zombie cinema. I feel much longer, but I'm giving some trance where I could not stop watching. The movie also has one of those, "if you see this picture, turn away from the screen" gags. It is the image of an old man who is getting worse in the theater (prophetic?) And when it appears (only twice), the blood begins to flow. The scenes are pretty damn cruel for the time period. There is a great gaffe where the zombie cuts the girl's right hand with the shovel, but - when he pulls a fake hand into the frame to drop it, it's a left hand.
