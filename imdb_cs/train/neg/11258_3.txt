I said this in other reviews, no story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, but nobody does it. The director seems to have a great eye for artistic decorations of the 1930s (which I like) and I think the idea of ​​using all the digital backgrounds and such can really be the wave of the future in the movie. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his film, but forgot to shoot many scenes that could absolutely help this surprisingly diluted film. (SPOILER) For screaming loud, they forgot that thief is in this thing! They all have one thing but they are dead for 20 years at the time the movie takes place. Conran lacks instead of having a thief. As for the action, we will see that the Sky Captain down the SINGLE robot, two or three of the flying wing aircraft (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting!) And a few robots, but mostly spend their time looking for and gaining others to fight for his battles. Paltrow like Polly or Peggy or Punky, or what is completely unnecessary in this movie (the reviewer who comments on it and the Chemistry Deficit Act is so right) and I am a little delighted to see repeated shots at the top of the camera, she has only two capture keys to the left, both of which subsequently lost in the movie, one uncomfortable, one quite funny, even though I've seen it since 70 years. Nobody except Law and Paltrow has a significant time on the screen, and that's a real flaw in the movie. The audience does not recognize robots, needs a hero to root, and a visible, contemptuous villain he hates. Without it, plus a good story, all CG in the world will not help.
