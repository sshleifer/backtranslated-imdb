This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is weak - I could not even follow it. Actor is a college student. The soundtrack is irritating. No humor attempts. Editing is terrible. Credits are even slow - I should be embarrassed that my name is associated with this loss of film. Do not waste your time or think about this attempt to play.
