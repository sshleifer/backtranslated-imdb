I do not know what the other guy thought. The fact that this film has been performed independently makes it no less terrible. You can be as great a believer as you want ... most of this film is a soulless disgust. I feel I was offended by having to watch the first 40 minutes. And that was no small performance in itself. Not only is this terrible, but the plot is never so close. There are lots of holes in the story, to the extent that you can not even call it a story. I have never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I wrote here, and its purpose is only to save all viewers there for an hour and a half of your life. I can not remember when I could not finish watching the movie for the last time. He really takes a cake.
