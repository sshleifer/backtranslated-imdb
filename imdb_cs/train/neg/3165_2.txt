this movie was terrible. I thought that with all those decent actors it would be better. do not waste your time. Eva longoria parker was terrible. it should hold desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes B agent. the mess she did in the movie I could never have been your wife was the epitome of what I say. and the lake on the lake was cute but definitely needed some other acting hours. looking like heaven with Reese Witherspoon ... it was better. or another ghost movie. you will be grateful that you have not lost your precious time. PS I love you is also good beyond the bounds of romance! time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listening to people who have already seen it.
