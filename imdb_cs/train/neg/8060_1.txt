What a bad, bad movie! I tried to watch without a quick move ... It failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the film, went online and found out how many minutes that disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confused, boring movie. I do not think anyone could destroy by being hit by a fluorescent bulb much less gutted! One funny thing is watching the movie "The Killer Cut". The box courageously states: "More blood!" "More Sex!" "More terror than a theatrical release!" So! If this movie was terrible with all of these claims, I wonder how lame "UN-Killer Cut" was ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the dead and the dead world, you can come from all the serials The Night of the Living Dead!
