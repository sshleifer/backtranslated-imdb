Absolutely crazy movie waste! It will never happen. No ghosts, just no train, no mystery, no interest. Constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is stupidity: a lot of people who have fallen into the sky because their train has been held for more than 3 minutes. What? And the railways leave them no place to stay in a heavy storm? I think not. They can walk four miles across the dead black field. Umm, yeah. Sure. Or they can force themselves to railway hospitality and remain at the "creepy" train station. The station, which turned out to be nothing but dead, completely without ghosts, interests or conspiracies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> LOST FILMS !! aargh !!
