Another insult and failing in the face of all homosexual men. This humble attempt at comedy has nothing to recommend. Again, we have an attractive "direct" hero who can not be interested in any woman. Yeah, right! And we are also presented with a "sympathetic, attractive" gay friend, who is actually a fat, bald, ugly old man whose leadership should be attractive. I did not even find it nice and I'm a fat, ugly old gay man (but luckily not bald)! Any actor talent that can be here was thrown into a bad scenario and a really awful direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from the film, but it does not differ from the countless other hackers working in Hollyweed.
