If you only look at the cover of this film, it's great. They are NOT. The movie itself fell asleep. She was slow, she had minimal violence and misuse of tension. It was the bottom feeder of the material and the conspiracy, while it would be great for another film, was wrongly shown here. In the whole movie, they even kill one good character! I give her 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was a plot at the end. In addition, you may want to save yourself from this movie.
