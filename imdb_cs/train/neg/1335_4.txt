This movie was great! (Not as good as Leif Garrett's masterpiece Longshot), but still amazing! I thought Ashley looked great in this movie compared to Mary-Kate. I wonder why. Who would think they could bounce like this and almost get away. Dad was a little sad and my mum was a little shabby with the helmet head. I give it 4. Everybody who likes this movie has to look at Longshot.
