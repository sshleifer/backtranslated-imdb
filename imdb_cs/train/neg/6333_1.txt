I actually saw this movie in the theater. Once I surrendered my money to the Treasurer, she said two words I never heard before or after the theater: "No refunds!" Once I heard these words, I had only waved on my cash and went home. But no, stupid, I went in and watched the movie. This NONE movie in the theater was not shy. Not even once. Not unintentionally! Mostly we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes someone would shout "This movie SUCKS!" The audience applauded enthusiastically and then sat in a stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes.
