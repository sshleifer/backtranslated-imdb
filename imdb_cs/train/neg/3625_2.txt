It is a film that is firmly in the 1950s. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute chooses this film for the top 100 American films of all time. I've seen virtually all the movies on this list, and it's by far the most disappointing. The musical numbers (and many, many of them) are very excessive and boring and have absolutely no connection with the story. The end of the film has a terribly long ballet sequence that naturally has no relation to the story of the film. It has to be admitted that it is very well made, the music is fine and the dance is done with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is contained in the movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is extremely strange and unlike and behaves endlessly. His mental age is around 14. If you want to see a good musical instrument for the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the Rain".
