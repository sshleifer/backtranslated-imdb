In addition to the Slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s, they were probably the second most popular genre of horror genres. While the slash films had "Black Christmas" and "Halloween" to make it all happen, the zombie flicks had George Romero's 'Dead' movies. And unexpectedly soon after the success of their first two in a row, other directors wanted to get into the money. Numerous Italian directors were particularly interested, such as Lucio Fulci, who brought us "Zombie" a year after Romero's "Dawn of the Dead," known as "Zombies" in Italy and some other countries, and there was Fulci's film known as "Zombie 2". In addition to the dead, he has no relation to Romero's film, but it's a good film that is in itself true. This was a great success in Europe, and nine years later a continuation was born. <br /> <br /> Pros: A lot of beautiful, fresh sceneries. An amazing score. The game is not that good, but the actor is a game and seems to enjoy experience. After the kind of slow start, the pace moves as in the case of action. Lots of cheeses and unintentional fun for lovers of bad movies. Good work on make-up effects. Lots of blood and some decent gore. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Virtual plot less. Nothing you've ever seen. From the first two films "The Return of the Living Dead" some things are getting rid of. Cardboard characters. She did not get too good due to bad rock music in 1980 (not that I say all the rock music from this period is bad), clothes and overall feel of the film. Final Thoughts: First of all, this is not a true continuation of Fulti's iconic classics. In fact, I do not know if it was ever to pick up the place where the film ended. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Matt movies are quite ridiculous, but like this movie many of them are good camping fun. And that's all the movie, it's really something to have fun with. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So good is a good rating) 2/5 (Deal Rating)
