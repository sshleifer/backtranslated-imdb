Julia Roberts has apparently made a joint effort to shake her female Pretty Woman persona with this fake, sad sex thriller, but it is hard to imagine that it will end with the performance of a powerful and persuasive (and oscar win) like Erin Brokovich on the back of this waste. And do not make any bones, it's nothing but a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately its performance is not the most insignificant thing. The story features all the brands of late night cut - for-the-cable, and you do not have the impression it will offer some insight into the dark world of domestic abuse, because the characters are not drawn enough to really care for you. <br /> <br /> Finally disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Roberts's name above the title, I'm sure it would be totally surprise.
