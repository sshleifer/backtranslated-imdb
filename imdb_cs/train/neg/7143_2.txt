This movie contains some of the most amazing cars I've ever seen in the movie and certainly the hottest women but I have to say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here's a conspiracy, and if you read it with a bit of curvature, you'll also have acting. <br /> <br /> Start bringing characters, hot female singing (apparent lip sync). The music agent or producer is coming, thinks she is awesome asking her to race. It has disappeared, too many bad memories. Flash for the war hero, back of the war, has several battles and becomes a movie hero with an attitude that is better than anyone. Ride in a fast exotic car. Brother, then he will die. A hero to avenge death, cut off a gun from a friend. (You've never seen this boyfriend before, but it really does matter to him). You're sure you want to do it; Yes; You mean really sure; Yes, give me your weapons; you are really sure; Yes; OK, I think I can not talk to you, be a careful man, I love you. Now he goes to the house of his uncle who owned the car that his brother was driving. She finds a woman, decides to save her, leaves, and can not kill her uncle. Now the race will finish the movie. Yeah, you have to throw one more scene with the bad guys coming to beat people who do not care about it, but maybe it adds a little conspiracy. The race is not that exciting, of course it will end with two racing cars and the one that should win, throws surprisingly to the end. OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send me all the money because I should give you so much luck as this movie does. Do not get me wrong, the cars are amazing and Nadia is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
