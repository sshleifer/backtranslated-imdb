I enjoyed the previous film Ittenbach, which I saw, "Burning Moon". But while the film was somewhat grim and unpleasant, it seems that "Premutos" usually plays laughter. While his amazing way this film shot Ittenbach in free time without money (and the DVD documentary is worth seeing), I was constantly struggling not to move on to another gore scene. Sure, there's a gore, and if it's all you want, then go ahead and enjoy it. Note, however, that there is an immense amount of lame comedy and boring stories. Many compare it to Peter Jackson's films, especially "Braindead". But looking at what Jackson did in a similar budget in "Bad Taste," it's clear that Ittenbach is missing one thing Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for fairly good and abundant gore effects and to get as much of the limited resources as possible - but not for the money I paid for)
