It's the beginning of the 1980s. There's a group of suspicious old teens. And there's a maniac. Yes, it's slasherville. The movie's name is Pranks. Why is it a joke? I do not have the slightest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a big joke is repeatedly bumping into some dinner with baseball bat - on balance, it's not a big joke; in fact quite a pity joke, if the truth is said. But you go there. The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who have the task of cleaning a rented hostel. They realize that the psychopath is in the open. In the struggle against this development, it divides and wails in the darkness. It ends with tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a badly created movie slasher. The DVD edition I saw was Vipco. It seems to be a lot of just violence. It makes the DVD even more useless, because, we look like it, the film slasher, which has been abandoned by violence, is a waste of time. Only for slasher-movies and video ugly compliments.
