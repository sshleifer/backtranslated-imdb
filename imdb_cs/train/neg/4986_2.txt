Everyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you every mistake you do not have to make when editing a movie! My grandmother could do better! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's so bad that I can not write a sentence without an exclamation mark!) If the first episode of "Les Visiteurs" was a pretty good family comedy with humorous jokes and culture, this sequel copies badly from the first. Funny parts can be counted on one side and maybe even in half. Clavier assumes his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because he replaces it), but it is "grotesque". Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even though Muriel Robin can be funny on stage, she is not in this movie because it does not work the way she used to be. I know it would be hard to replace someone who was in a good role (Lemercier won the César Award for her role in the first film), but she made a big mistake: instead of playing the role, Lemercier played the role! As for the story, it's just too much! Of course, we knew that at the end of the first movie we would continue, but Poire and Clavier should try to write a much simpler story as the first episode. Gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, really, there's nothing more than 3 funny in this. Only good things can be costumes and some special effects. So you have only two reasons why you look at it: 1) if you want to learn how to make a wonderful movie, 2) if you want to waste time, or if you really need a moment? 2/10
