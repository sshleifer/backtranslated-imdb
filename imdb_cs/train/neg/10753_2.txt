Del - "You're the smartest clever person I've ever met." Calvin - "Well, I had my brain, but they lost it when I transcribed it." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think what I consider to be the most exalted of this bastardic work of Asimov was, as the character of Susan Calvin had portrayed. In the books, she was one of the first strong female protagonists to be able to think about the problem. Here's just a girl in distress waiting for Wil Smith to save her. There are references to Asimov's robotics laws, but they are an idea of ​​CGI and action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is sympathetic because it's in most of his films, but honestly, the story is not that good. YOu come to it long before these genius characters.
