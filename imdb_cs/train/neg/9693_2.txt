The overwhelmed conspiracy "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from the young novel by Francois Sagan, who became the best-selling, though God knows why. For youngsters who want to get rid of a potential parent, they may have a challenge. Do not forget that David Niven plays Playboy's father and Deborah Kerr, who has become a renowned mother. Unfortunately too much lies on the fragile shoulder of Jean Seberga. It is beautiful and easily fills the image of spoiled teenagers. The problem is he can strike poses, but he can not act. Everyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in the first film of St. Joan-Seber, Otto Preminger, knows she is 19 years old unable to wear a movie. This film, also according to Preminger, meets the "promise" of the first. It was her second film; it was 20. What do you think of Preminger? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for the lack of Seberg's acting capacity? No chance? Seber's character is at the heart of the story, and although convincing, even if physically 17 years old, he can not meet the emotional demands of this role. I do not know if she became a successful actress in her short time because she did not influence my consciousness in her later photos. But anyone who thinks this film is better than average needs control of taste. In spite of Niven and Kerr, it remains a juvenile story in a youthful way that made a beautiful young girl who was in great need of acting.
