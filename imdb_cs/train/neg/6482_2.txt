Disney has not yet met a movie that has failed to do at least two sequels. And this was no exception to the Disney people, which would provide a weak story that would get a quick reward. Somehow, although I do not pay to see it, I feel cheaper by watching her. Ariel grew up and had a daughter. Nevertheless, he does not allow his daughter to go to the sea because of some inactivity suffered by the nurse of the late naval witch. So here we go again. The daughter is, of course, deceived and helped by the navy wizard. After a failed fight, it is defeated and moravody and people live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see here. Return to your life. "D-"
