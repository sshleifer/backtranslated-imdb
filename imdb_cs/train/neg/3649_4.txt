This is a relatively small paranormal show, although it seems that Art Bell and his artist have figured out how to make a career from the attitude that Carl Kolchak has set as an example. Of course, there would probably not be X files if this show did not fix this audience so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly a super hero, but he's a credible guy who adds heroic acts. Look at his work on some of Alfred Hitchcock's old gifts. Here is the main attraction, she does not seem to be a girlfriend or a wife who is scattered. In fact, there are not many sexual desires to the show. Something I notice is that stimulation is not typically exciting. There is a lot of laughter on this show. Sometimes just pokey gets to the climax. From this show, there is a thread that comes up after the current MAD MEN show as to style. Not that David Chase writes Crazy Men but the people who worked under the Soprano have certainly imitated and inherited their serio-comic tone.
