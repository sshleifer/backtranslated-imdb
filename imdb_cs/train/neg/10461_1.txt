Interestingly, reading the Omega code's commentaries ... many of the remarkably positive comments were almost clear from the TBN broadcast. The film looks like it was a video that was to be placed beside the three-part rapture series that was made by some other religious group in the 1970s. Do not you remember that? You will not forget it for a year or two. This is the first movie I've ever seen, where it was suggested that it was your religious duty to go to him and buy as many tickets as possible to save the soul ... very shameful ... it just shows that if you're a son of a TV channel, you can also play a high-roller Hollywood producer with lil ole ladies ten money ...
