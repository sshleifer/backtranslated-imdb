I saw this film today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing deep reviews, but I think the critics are just sucking on William Defoe and his wife (director) who were present at the festival. It's certainly the slowest movie I've ever seen, with a lot of nonsensical, ridiculously long scenes. Besides Defoe, who was decent, two and a half other people in the movie, including Defoe's wife Giada, were unreasonably horrible (as it is, that part of the baker's retailer is outside of me). This film is rather a conspiracy less with a lame attempt to be abstract and wall. The only scene that caused any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nothing, as if adding some sort of shock to the dullness of this movie. I apologize for being so cruel, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate a good indie cinema, but this film is not worthy of the time of the audience.
