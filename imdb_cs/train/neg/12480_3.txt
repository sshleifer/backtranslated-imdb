... Or more accurately, so bad that you will have the time of your life laughing your butt when you look at it! "Deathstalker" by James Sbardellati of 1983 is definitely one of the worst productions that the Sword & Sorcery subgroup has brought, but it's very fun. The game is terrible, the conspiracy is pure bullshit, and the effects and photos can not be more amateur. But it's bad acting, cheesy effect and many mistakes that make this movie so cheerful. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and experienced fighter. One day, a good witch will make him unite the three forces of chaos and creature, sword, amulet, and chalice to free the land from his brutal ruler, the evil king, and the wizard Munkar. Getting the sword is pretty easy, but the amulet and the cup are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the wicked king organized a tournament in which the most experienced fighters in the region struggle with each other until death. The winner is then to accept the king's place. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take a seat and therefore plans to kill the winner (instead of not organizing the tournament first). Deathstalker not only gains three forces of creation but also rescues the old beautiful daughter of a good king (Barbi Benton) from the claws of evil Munkar. Luckily, he is bored on his way to the tournament as he allows him to accumulate the beautiful female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) in the meantime ... The film has many great, incredible stupid and fun scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker finds himself a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls is not such a head. The falling head has a red goat's beard, while the kid who was Deathstalker's rain had dark hair and no beard. When the figure of Kairy (Lana Clarkson) is portrayed, she is the first black robes to hide her face and body. Deathstalker's companion Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights against her, and during her sword she fights her cloak (under which she is of course topless) to open and reveal her breasts. Her first breasts are Lana Clarkson, in front of her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior Deathstalker must fight in the tournament, a huge guy with a man's body and a pig's head. <br /> <br /> - Evil Munkar has an ugly small creature locked in his chest. That little creator feeds human eyeballs and fingers. There are many other unintentionally funny, funny and great scenes. Actor is horrible, but Barbi Benton and late Lana Clarkson are eye-candy, and though I described this movie as "unintentionally funny," I sometimes thought some actors were absolutely aware of the film's filthy. There is a fair amount of gore and a lot of female nudity to make the audience entertained. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly terrible movie, but I still highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!
