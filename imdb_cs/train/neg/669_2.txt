I'm the one who usually maintains my opinions, but I just came back from this movie and I felt I had to express my views. Let me start by being a huge fan of horror. But what does a horror film do? I would definitely want to see even a little good scenario and character development. I know they often miss horror movies, but Prom Night seemed as if it did not make ANY effort in this department. We all love tension. It is tense at the edge of your seat with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night did not! Of course we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night do you have it? No, he has a nice boy with a cute lily knife. And when everything else fails ... at least horror has its vindictive pleasure, it's as gore gore gore and a casual nude scene! Yeah, well, when you have a horror movie called PG-13 as Prom Night, they also skip it. So, with all these elements missing, I ask ... does it still count as a horror movie? No way. I'd say it more like a comedy. The people in my theater laughed more, then they were when I saw "Semi-Pro", which was supposed to be a comedy (which is also a hall, but that's another story!). I think I will have to give up new horrors. All good horror movies of good days were transformed into rubbish, so film studios can make money. The people I met did not even know it was a remake! Which made me crazy! I wonder what happens if they do not have any other movies to edit ??? Where will the horror go?
