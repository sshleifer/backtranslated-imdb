Since the universe loving cinema has met a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically associated with blood-soaked horror images and continuously acting sequences. It's safe to say that his "Night of the Dead" was a zombie movie we know it now. Yet, in the earliest years of cinematography, the premise of reanimated corpses was just used in slow psychological thrillers with almost innocence. Jacques Tourneur's "I Walk with the Zombie" is a perfect example, and so is the "White Zombie," led by Bela Lugosi. This "zombie uprising" could be another example, but unfortunately it is a failure across the line and one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Scary acting, a badly written script and a total lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is completely lost on silly intrigue of love and unspoken monologues. Setting up in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor would surely result in a stricter story, but all we see is indoor shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, a blonde textbook with curly hair and a nauseous nose) irritated me very much, and I still hoped that a ravenous undead would not appear to eat. Again unhappy? If you manage to fight 60 minutes, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent finale. Yet it's too little to get a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is a type of movie that you should only see if you've seen everything else.
