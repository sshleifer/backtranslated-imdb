Ironically, though he can do "division," Thomas is totally rigid as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is written in my memory as one of the most side-breaking, cheesy and incompetent films I've ever seen. As such, I'm more like you. <br /> <br /> The only reason it is more than one star is that Thomas has a great look and it's fun to see his tiny muscular body that performs various gymnastic skills on strangely shaped rocks and poles scattered about eastern European countryside (including the infamous "church" in the shape of a lid in the middle of the village square, which Thomas uses at the faces of various madmen). Let the poor man open his mouth and try to emulate, and every illusion that he might have a film career is an instantly broken piece. <br /> <br /> Thomas had at least the justification that he was not really an actor. Everyone else in the movie - actors, director, editor, buddies etc. It is at least as bad or even worse and most of them are professional. So Kurt does not look as bad as you think. I hope the poor Kurt took the money and ran. If someone asks him to play again in a martial arts movie, I bet that Thomas kicks the man in his face.
