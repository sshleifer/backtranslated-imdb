A prerequisite for making such a film is the complete ignorance of Nietzsche's work and personality, the psychoanalytic techniques and the history of Vienna. Take a well-known genius that you have not read, describe it as demented, include crazy doctors to cure him, some decent looking women, your role plays an actor with a huge mustache, every character speaks the most powerful accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious a character that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention of a few words used in brilliant works, to exaggerate everything you can, especially music, and you are done. Audience, please stay away.
