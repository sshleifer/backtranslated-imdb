This absolutely boring, pointless, useless, ruthless, and stupid film is not the definitive proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post-trainspotting movies: "Beach" cared for it. What this low budget is doing is just to secure its place among those who started very well, but completely lost in drugs, booze, ego, self-deception, bad leadership or what it was that led to a once promising director being a quick dying . The assumption is absurd: two defeats (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - rapper, likely) meet randomly and spontaneously to sing with enthusiasm similar to crazy asylum seekers than with the potential duo hit - which are happening. His friend - even an illiterate loser - becomes his manager by breaking the window of the store and stealing the camcorder in which he shoots them in "action" and then showing tapes to some music people who really show interest in the garbage. Now I know that the United Kingdom has released an incredible junk in recent years, but it is ridiculous; music makes Oasis like The Beatles. During the studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - to change the lyrics in every disguise, and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells guys music biz to take or leave it, and they take quite absurdly. Not only is the music completely and completely, but its "artists" are antisocial; these NEWCOMERS should call shots. It's just stupid. It's just terrible. Dialogue is unfortunate and does not go anywhere, and this story about being wearing is meaningless and meaningless. They often feel improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of waste is so bad that it's embarrassing to watch. Ecclestone is I.Q. must also be questioned by agreeing to be part of this nonsense. The one who funded this 1000 pound joke should leave the film store before he ends selling his own underwear on the streets.
