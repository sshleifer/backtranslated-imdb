With Bo Derek's film, the audience get exactly what they expect. A thin paper plot and a couple of Derek's shots without clothes. "The ghosts can not do it" it's all. The first fifteen minutes is a common television track until Scott [Anthony Quinn] still lives. He is a very good actor with a long experience in many different roles, but it seems that sometimes a famous actor needs to work only for money. Bo Derek, on the contrary, always plays a wonderful young woman with or without clothing. The film is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence from Arabia or La Strada. To see naked women or bad acting, rent porn movies.
