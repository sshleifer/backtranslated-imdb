This movie is one of my favorites. It's not very good, but it's great to laugh. Dialogue can be incredibly ridiculous and misbehaving (for example, "Manji, can we ask you a few questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Any fight is more or less surreal. Make sure you look at Brock, the shabby white guy who attacks the main characters. He has only two lines, but he's one of the best guys in the movie!
