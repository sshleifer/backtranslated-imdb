Do you know the movies you got stuck in the cinema? You were there in the best office in the house, in the middle of a row in your special sweet spot that you exchanged three times before you get to the right place - and after you feel it takes 13 hours, you are still imprisoned, uncomfortable and itchy , thinking "When is F *** this movie ever to end ???" (You know the feeling - think about A.I and the village). Well, visitor Q adds a weird variant of this feeling. I was sitting there for the first 30 minutes when I was thinking when she was going to start! It's infinite! So "Arty" it hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I watched. He seems to do movies about dozens, and if everyone is as demanding as this one, I suspect it will be the last. I'm not against Claiming wanker. David Lynch is for me among the top ten directors, but the visitor Q is a poor, cheap and ugly w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you may have been working - I hated it.
