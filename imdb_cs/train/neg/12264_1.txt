You will get 5 writers together, each of you will write another story with another genre and then try to make a single movie. It's an action, it's an adventure, it's science fiction, it's western, it's a mess. We're sorry, but this movie was totally thrilled. 4.5 gives it a tremendously high rating. It means it's such a movie that I think I can write movies, and I hardly write.
