Do not bother. A little prosciutto might go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The task is one of those episodes of car bumps ... the vehicle jumps to the other and everything changes in the direction until we can just scratch our heads and wonder if there's ever a conspiracy. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard to play from the mysterious Dunaway playing Lady Macbeth lost in duck Marx's duck soup. Oh, Raven ... she's an actor now. And there's a relative who just lying and bed and looking scary. Or Dr. Dread, filled with lots of darkness and no means of labor. I'm one of those watching the movie. Quoth Raven, "Nevermore."
