The boy of this movie deceived me. I honestly thought it was going to be a terrifying humorous movie, boy, which I got into a cold shoulder. This movie was, and I'm true, pretty damn good. It was not scary at all, but fragility and sneaky humor really crazy this movie interesting. Some to the terrible actress and killing of the killers were so painful that I watched, almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. Killing is unequivocally related to snow sports and Christmas, which makes things more interesting. The angles of the POV camera were amazing. The film is about a viscous killer who dies in a roadside collision with a chemical truck truck road. Later, it is resurrected in the same chemical substance with the snow bonded to the mixture. These ingredients have been chosen to become the perfect killer of the snowman. He will be avenged, like a snowman, to a policeman who has condemned him. This movie had such a bad acting, except Christopher Allporta, it was funny. I say that I am also quite disappointed that this film was not a horror, but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot, but they were not done correctly. Overall, I like the movie, but now it's really unpleasant. But this movie is much better and darker than the sequel.
