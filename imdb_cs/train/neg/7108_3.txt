After seeing credits with the only name I recognized, and that was the preacher in this movie (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this movie and I was not disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife by convincing other people that he is crazy and takes his own life. The unconscious of her husband is that the plastic-looking skull he uses, on the contrary, the woman apparently seems to be his first dead woman to avenge in her mind and uses a real skull. Simple land with the end of irony. If you are tired late at night and need to sleep, it will help you to sleep.
