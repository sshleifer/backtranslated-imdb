Why do I always do it for myself? I mean, it's really there - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else would I expect? I have to admit that I'm crazy about something I find on the Monster HD channel, but the only redemption of this picture will be the really grotesque makeup work of the legendary Rik Baker. As for the creepy, I will give the old old couple the nod of the lemon just before turning off the light. Now they were really scary. Something I never could have come up with horrible moves was why the monster victims would simply run away when they encounter virtual destruction. Just like a cat in the cabin. You know, in the kitchen there was a completely visible door that could run at any time. Unbelievable Steve-O could not get much more than a lively walk, so why is not it just that? I do not know, maybe something is missing. <br /> <br /> This movie had a feel of the episode "Stories from the Crypt", but "Tales" usually had a cool or grotesque twist that he had not often seen. This was one image you could not handle well on arrival or departure. For example, on the early stage you can clearly see that Meltingho's eyeball has dropped from his head as he managed to get to the rest of the story? I do not think we should ask. In eighty-four minutes this image was about an hour and a half too long. When it was over, I was ready to take General Perry to his earlier suggestion - "I can really enjoy drinking right now."
