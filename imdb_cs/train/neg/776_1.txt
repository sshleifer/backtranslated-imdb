I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather picked up this video for free in the store. I remember that it was really bloody. The story did not make sense. I hated a fox that became a friend of Casper. He was so stupid! Casper shouted his head when he could not find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part and I do not want to sound bad when the fox shot and died at the end. I laughed at my reward because this cartoon was so bloody. The bad news is that the fox has resurrected and became spirited. I wish he stayed dead. I think I gave it to someone because I hated him. No wonder they offer it for free at the store. If you have a child, do not look at it. Probably agrees with me that she's upset.
