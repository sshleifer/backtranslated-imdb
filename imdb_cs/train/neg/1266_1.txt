If it is hell, it contains a screening room in which GRAND CANYON plays again and again on the eternal loop. One could hope that the presence of so many great actors - Danny Glover, Alfred Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - will help to compensate for the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose repentance is watching her own films for all eternity). . But not. Apparently, they injected the other actors with McDonnell's serum. The whole thing is demanding, exaggerated, insulting (if you are deaf or you know someone who is, get ready for your blood to cook on the absurd scene of TDD). GRAND CANYON is full of unruly people who have joined together but never gives us reason to want / understand / understand or tolerate them. With the exception of rare ones, they are indispensable losers that the gene pool would be better without. There is no plot that we should not talk about, no character development (these people will never develop), no explosions, and the most beautiful songs you'll ever find in the movie. Best thing on GRAND CANYON? Its name. It's one big movie HOLE.
