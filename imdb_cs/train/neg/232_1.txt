It must have been one of the worst movies ever. When Kate appears and Jed is with a bunch of boys and everyone starts to applaud ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate dropped her hands over the sidewalk, as she seemed to explore the pavement structure. Andie's acting is so bad in this movie - I could not get together or feel love for myself. The other two women, however, were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway, it was such a camp film. I usually like this type of movie, but I just could not get into this movie. Too many unlikely situations and Andie's acting again did not help. She's also all the gums. Lancome has to make makeup on a knife plate because it looks charming in stores.
