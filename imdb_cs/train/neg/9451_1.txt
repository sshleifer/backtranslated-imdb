In my time I have seen some bad things. A half dead cow trying to get out of the waist of high mud; head on collision between two cars; a thousand slabs breaking on the floor of the kitchen; human beings living like animals. But I've never seen anything as bad as a Cat in a hat. This film is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Wolverine thorn, worse than people who gave kittens to microwaves. <br /> <br /> It is the most disturbing movie of all time, easy. joke, some complicated joke, and that Mike Myers was perhaps a big cocaine who breathed drug addictive bets that lost a bet or something.
