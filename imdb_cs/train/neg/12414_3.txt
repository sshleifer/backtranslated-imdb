Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match that shows extremely different siblings, but only Winningham can bring something convincing or essential to her role. Leigh plays singer and alcoholist Sadie Flood, constantly leaning on the older sister of Georgia, a well-known popular singer in the Joni Mitchell format. Perhaps due to her double duties co-producer in the movie, Leigh seems to wrap herself in the corner: she is not trusted as a singer, and, although it is deliberate, it gives too much screen-time to the microphone. He probably hopes to have the strength of a tour, Leigh is wired and nervous and jagged; but in this figure we just do not see any talent (Leigh is, of course, a solid actress, but she decides to make her wall out of her). If Sadie had even the smallest charisma or appeal, maybe we could buy into the concept that he would get (small) breaks he does. It is likely that they will get so hard on the stage. Director Ulu Grosbard releases several intense dramatic sequences and final editions next to Sadie's bar show with a sold-out arena show in Georgia - both singing the same song - and it's a sadly graduated moment ... but really what's the point? * 1/2 from ****
