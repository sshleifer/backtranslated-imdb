This movie is just bullshit. Although directors say they are part of this oi-culture, it's still a very, very bad directorial debut. The topic itself is very interesting and I accept bad acting because they are all amateurs and have never done before, but the worst thing about this film is dialogue and very inexperienced and naive direction. There's no time in the movie. I felt that the directors had left the film (it was their first feature) that they had never really asked what their story they were saying. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions, and he's a nice and thoughtful guy, but he does not make him a director. I think "American History X" is full of cliché, but somehow it can carry the story. "Oi! Warning" is full of cliché, does not say anything new or provocative and (it's a sad thing about this movie), it's far from any Oi! -Reality. If you want to see weird, but great German films, watch the movies Michael Haneke, Christopher Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** of ten for theme and photography
