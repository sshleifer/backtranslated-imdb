I'm launching a group to prevent the misuse of comics, and I've just spent the last two months hearing horror stories from comic comedians who have been trying to compete, Last Comic Standing. If they do not have a good agent, they have no chance of bankruptcy, so over 80% of the comedians who appear are refused before they can show someone they have talent! If they did the bankruptcy, I was told that they were "predestined" if they had a second chance. So, what TV viewers see is not the best comics in the US. <br /> <br /> If the comics get on the show, most of them do not get the IMDb credits. I know because I've made credits for all six seasons, "Last Comic Standing" and I'm not getting a reward for doing a production job. It's really shame. A month ago, I asked Facebook: "The Last Standing 7 Comic" on Facebook, why do not manufacturers give IMDb credits and have been banned from their Facebook page! I'm not a comic, so I do not have a personal share of it. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like being abused and helped by comics. Comics are being exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is the BIG THREE network to encourage those who are encouraged to be ashamed of allowing this exploitation. <br /> <br /> Watch this video comedian who was the victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
