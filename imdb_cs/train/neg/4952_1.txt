Well, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read a batman comic. As you can imagine - I was a little excited to hear about this series, and then I was NORTH disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even start with the original series. It's like a long advertising TOY. No depth. And what about Joker? Who is, in my opinion, the best of Batman's bad guys ALL and killed him? I wish to say that his design was the worst. Actually, I wish I could say that there was something creative or interesting in this series. In short (because you believe I can say a lot more), do not waste your time on this show or on your money.
