The premise of the film is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized - and given a chance to avenge him when (following the accidental disorder therapy) he was placed in a room with a man strapped to his chair and said he was the culprit. He gives him a great table of tools that can offer compensation: drills, bats, nails, hammers, torches, whatever you think someone might want to use for physical harm to another human being. <br /> <br /> We come too many torture scenarios before we find that Man Archer tortures, it is not the man who committed the crime. These two make an inconvenient alliance; who put them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when everything is said and done, we really do not care ...
