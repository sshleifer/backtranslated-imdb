Is Miike like Chabrol, alternate art with a rupture, sometimes confusing two? Does it match the fifty and fifty prices on Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike here? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines that quoted Chakushin ari (One Missed Call's), steals, cues and cliches. Others here will hit most of them, though not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for a dirty telescopic trip supernatural. Just once when Yumi takes a zombie-like mother in my arms, One missed call scares me a little. One other point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in the rough story of Audition, and like Boss Aoki from Dead or Alive's mud excitement with drowning and others, may be the most convincingly evil actor I've ever seen. So here's a cop.
