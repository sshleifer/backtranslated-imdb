Hooper is not fun, unspecified, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama. You think the movie about the biggest stuntman of the world would have some drama, he tried it, but it did not seem to be real. No study of the nature, no lessons, nor did it seem that the actors really enjoyed, trying to act as if they were having fun. There's no reason to watch if you do not want to look at Burt and you want to see Sally occasionally. The Pranc√©r was a beautiful horse and did what he was supposed to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and Bandit was such a funny movie that I was ready for Hoop Hoop. This film proved to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
