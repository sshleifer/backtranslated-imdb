First I agree with the bit that has escaped Mr Chomsky's mouth. His material delivery of an interesting counterpoint is what makes a human hit at a university campus circus. It's going to be sympathetic, easy, pragmatic. It hates the current political style (annoying bipartisanism) and sets its interests on the far left and the far right, pronouncing both for a good reason. Unfortunately, the movie itself is crazy. In fact, I would not even mention this document, but rather a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without a Pause" is no different than tracking the speaker on a segment recorded for 3 hours on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no editing, no stylistic touch. There is no story, no story. Technically, production is strictly amateur. Audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we can not hear Noam speaking, sometimes we do not hear questions that are present by the present. When Noam speaks seldom, we can see the reaction of the audience when he gives us a short film of his wife who obviously attends each of his speech and beams with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie and say that you are probably better when you look at the recorded slides on a tape or CD and you are listening in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and today I'm in a great mood.
