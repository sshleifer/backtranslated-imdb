In 1985 I caught this thing (I can not even say the movie) on the cable. I was in college and I was with a college boyfriend whose hormones were out of control. I prematurely thought it was hopeless. A stupid script (lots of old boys hires some young boys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception), and pathetic jokes. Rich nudity here kept my friend happy for a while - but even after 30 minutes she was bored. Remember - it was HIGH SCHOOL BOY! It was back before nudity so easily got over the Internet and the like. We were still following the hope of something interesting or fun, but it never happened. The funniest thing was the original ad campaign, in which the studio admitted that this movie is crap! (One poster had a fictional review that said, "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer headed any talent and really continued his career in business. No budget and boring t & a. Skip it.
