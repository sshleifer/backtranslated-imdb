This movie had the potential and I was willing to try it, but there are so many problems with the timeline that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow that it's treated like an idiot. in the late 1960s. Carlit's way is in the mid-seventies. To make this film realistic, it must have been set in the 1950s, if not the late 1940s. Rise to Power has no marks Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no signs of Kleinfeld, no sign of Roland, allegedly Carlito ran in a "heyday". None of the primary characters in the original movie were in this movie. We should believe that Carlito has met these people within a few years. Rise to Power ends when Carlito walks along the beach and talks about going to paradise, which is what he wanted to do in the original movie. Also, pre-quel creates the characters Rocco and Earl - what to do with them, obviously not in the Carlit's way? It's also hard to understand how Carlito could have a relationship with the Italians who are watching the Rise to Power events in the original film. Where are the Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between these two films and they spend five of them in jail. It's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole. It is obvious that nobody was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some money by making an average gangster film and throwing the character Carlito Brigante into the story. The movie had some good moments, but I think it would be better if this movie stays alone instead of trying to do it prequel on the Carlito path. If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of a film as a linear pre-quel. Think of it as a Western spaghetti with Clint Eastwood's unnamed man, in other words, two films that have the same character but need not be linked.
