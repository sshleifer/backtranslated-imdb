It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... The plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a bad thrilling movie and actors sounds as if they were reading for the first time directly from the manuscript. The worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as if he were in a "police academy" - the same crazy bastard - and that's not good for a leader in what should be a thriller. It's really hard to believe Hanson makes "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid it as a plague ...
