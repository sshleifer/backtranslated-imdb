It's a movie about shooting a movie. Such movies can be fun, but they need some cloth to do it. This has not happened, I'm afraid. Coppola has not inherited his fatherly abilities, unfortunately (even his sister, who can make movies that should be supervised). I wonder how this movie came to get such stupid reviews. <br /> <br /> We will see: The leading male actor, allegedly the director, is as expressive as the frozen octopus and his voice has the same meaning as he says, the main actress has on his face an expression that never changes happen completely divided into bits with perhaps a single connecting element, the film in the film must be more obsolete than the Palaeolithic rocks ... Would it be enough? I was looking at this movie. Walking with a dog is a much better fun of this incredibly lame film. It's like Fran√ßois Truffaut was filmed by director Dick Cheney ... Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You have to be really joking ...
