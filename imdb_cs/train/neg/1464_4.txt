I looked at it with the hope that I found out something I did not know about the most famous person in modern history, and I could not help thinking that in HITLER: Rise of Evil. Hitler was so obsessed with his nieces that he was threatening to have one of his admirers. Hitler turned his hand in hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but the writers did not confuse Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana of SCARFACE? That's bad enough, but what really offended me was that this mini-series is missing whole pieces of historical context. Germany lost the First World War, and Allied forces gave Germany the price it paid for it. It was this economic environment that led the German people to rebuild their pride to anyone - and that is why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 20th century by the Allied powers seems to be completely absent, so there is no way for HITLER: SOUND EXCURSION to be seriously defended as a historical document, and I have not even indicated that Himmler and GÃ¶ring are prominent because of their absence there is one positive point of mini series and that is Robert Carlyle in the title role. Well, some of his ways are bad and his voice is a little too loud (Archival tapes show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he managed to tell Hitler's own charisma on the screen. Comments in the British press that Carlyle reminds a Sparks synthist more than Adolf Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler. I liked Robert Carlyle's performance, but I hated everything else about this mini-series and wondered why it was made on the ground first. It's nothing to recommend to serious fans of history
