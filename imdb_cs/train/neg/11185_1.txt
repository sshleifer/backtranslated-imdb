Yes, MTV is really a way to put Daria on the market. What began as a clever teenage anxiety - "commenting on everything that is upset and making the audience feel better about their juicy teenage life," the sitcom turned into "how you should deal with your problems" -charade. I was still watching Daria and loving it. Now that I'm sitting here after watching the so-called "movie," I can only wonder what it all means. Daria tells us how to lead college life? Excuse me? does not that mean that Daria has made every episode that what you want is fine if she is right with her no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks? This whole thing reminded me of the scene in "Reality Bites" film channel for the first time will present a documentary.
