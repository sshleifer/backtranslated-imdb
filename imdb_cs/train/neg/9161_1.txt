... well, pop it into the DVD, losing the hour and a half of your life that you never come back and find out. What to do? <br /> <br /> Production values? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> Story? Do not let me start. After many years of broadcasting on IMDb, I never thought I'd see the film so bad that I really wanted a lower rating than one. Have I always found at least one or two reasons to see merit - and only in the intent or effort of a writer, director, cast or producer? In this case, it is the same person (!) Who really needs to master the fact that, at least as demonstrated by this worthless loss of a videotape, he has no talent. I think it would be a reasonable justification if it was a "production" of a junior high school student for his first cinematographic class, but the reference artist he was behind was twenty-six at the time of this abortion. <br /> <br /> How did it happen? Who in the right mind ever wrote a check on this? In addition, do not let the box hat crazy: there is nothing that remotely resembles a good sex scene or some good "exposure" of a piece on that cover. Two last items: there was one second when this "movie" redeemed the value: the above mentioned "talent" with her lover pulled away. I'm glad! And from this "film" I learned one thing. There are times when something is so bad that it really is really fun. But not in a comical way; it's only sadly humorous. Very sadly humorous.
