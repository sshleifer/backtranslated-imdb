I do not watch a lot of television and I come across this show. Real estate show? I hope it's not real. If I were a man and I had such a nug and been married to someone so crazy, it would be the reason for divorce. I think it is a bad example of how to treat a person they love. This is one of the things that is now wrong with our world, so many people with bad relationships, selfish and do not know the meaning of what really is to love another. It's self-sacrifice, not something that should be on merit. This does not mean that you have a very good feeling to watch what should be in private counseling. If his personality is real, then he deserves someone much better to show real love for him, care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this to show fact, or modified for ???? I really want to know. Regards, GB
