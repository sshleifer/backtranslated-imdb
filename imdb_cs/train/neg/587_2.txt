This film separates itself from documentary films of the "wonder of the human body" courageous if it bizarrely decides to cause disgust at the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes on a giant 50-foot zit as a teenager pushes pus and fluid out of it. In another case, the camera is half-fertilized in a half-meal diet and gastric acid, as part of a pasta salad that falls from the esophagus and the goose poplar. In the final excursion, the camera captures the viewer on a horrible journey through the woods ... adolescent armpits. Unfortunately, I will not do anything about it. Watch this movie if you have to but: bring your cooker and do not have a pasta salad in advance.
