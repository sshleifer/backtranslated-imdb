"Washington Square" is a flat, stupid adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James's masterpieces. Moreover, his simple story seems to be inappropriate to become a movie (though William Wyler, with his "The Heiress", gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film will completely betray the spirit of this great American writer's work. In the novel, hero Catherine is shy, not too attractive and somewhat clumsy, yet she is a healthy, intelligent young woman and not as naive as she may seem. Her relationship to her father is dignified and respectable, with no illness. Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is only a seemingly retarded, bad thing throughout the three quarters of the movie. In the last quarter, suddenly (and unbelievably) she becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman and all that. Director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. First, when the nervous child Catherine has trouble with the vesicle. The second scene when we see a strange brothel in the background, where prostitutes take their customers to their tents and so on. Nothing could be more at odds with the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and determined even for the standards of the Victorian age. I'm going to find some roughness anywhere on thousands of pages of James's huge literary production. I was really particularly bothered by these two scenes. Yes, I know the director needs adequate freedom to adapt the novel to the novel. But if the director totally ignores or does not understand the art of the author (here Henry James), I do not see a reason to use his work to create a bad film. <br /> <br /> The act is an adequate film: poor and flat, despite the talents of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely not recommended movie.
