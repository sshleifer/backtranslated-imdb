In fact, this film, produced in 1999, has good production value. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There is no clown running around to drive away, driving hundreds of wheels, but never touching the meat. Even there are no wild pursuits of vehicles / crashes, where thousands of dollars of beautiful machines are unnecessarily destroyed. The interiors look modern and architecturally, and the device looks like snuff. Well, there's this high-tech computer room equipped with what looks like the remnants of the electronic lab of the 1950s. And the make-up on the corpses has shattered me. It's not a make-up in the classical sense, but it looks like dried palin dough stuck to their exposed skin. This is supportive of the idea that the body has calcified - though how the virus would have achieved this transmutation, it is a workout for the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not absolutely the worst assumption of science fiction, the horror I know, but I can not. A computer virus that is transmitted through a television screen and becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Leave the break. Warp drives and La Star Trek are one thing but photons become viruses? It is so silly that the desired "fear factor" is simply not feasible. Flick could use one of those horrible dream sequences where the dead come alive or the cat jumping out of the cloakroom or something like that because the viral thingamajig does not do it. <br /> <br /> One thinks that Robert Wagner has the same justification for playing in this infertility that Lord Oliver has given for some of his later trails. He needed money. However, no other comparison between the two should be interpreted.
