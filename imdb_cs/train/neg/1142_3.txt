You were dismantled and beaten with a convincing assertion about "femme fatale" / "weapons n" gals "Now comes another breed in disappointing rediscovery: ninja movies Many of the things I've seen before and let me tell you, it is not all that is a hail, it is not common to this point, and it is not original, among all others! What is a ninja that deals with the prevention of the nuclear holocaust in Russia, and is not it a film of "martial arts"? Has a lot of shooting sounded like an incredible action movie? Is blood the most important reason to love it? Will you lose some of your hard earned money for a lady who sings in her transparent tank? find yourself in the martial arts section of the video store.For even more ninja fun, try to try those Godfrey Ho films released by Trans World. anete what you deserve, and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
