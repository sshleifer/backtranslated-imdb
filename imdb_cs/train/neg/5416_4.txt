This was the third director von Stroheim - he is quite crude and shows no extraordinary taste for the camera and the editing of the championship, which he would show years later with his masterpieces, GREED, and THE WEDDING MARK. Basically, we have a trio of fools who dress up as a Russian countess and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money on game tables and win money. Part of this plan is also Earl von Stroheim, who laughed, played and hopes to get some money by playing on his weaknesses between the ambassador's visitor and his "crazy" wife. He makes the mistake of also accepting the salvation of a servant who promised to marry. When he sees them, he lights the room, (von Stroheim and his prey are on the balcony of the room). Here von Stroheim first sets up his personality as "the man you love to hate". He is totally wrong and his mistakes in character eventually lead him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is rough in its cinematography and editing, and it's not worth watching unless you're fascinated by the director. There's a cute little piece - when she first tries to meet her ambassador's wife, reads a book - we see the title - Foolish Wives by Erich von Stroheim. This was originally introduced as a 210-minute slide, which the studio reduced to 140 minutes and was finally released in 70 minutes. Restoring the movie Kino Video restores surviving shots (somehow damaged in most scenes) from an alternative older version that gives us 107 minutes of printing.
