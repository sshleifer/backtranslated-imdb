This absurd and awkward movie is certainly the most misleading version of "Hamlet" ever to get to the screen. Branagh's access to the material can only be described as vulgar; the look of Ophelia in a direct jacket when the Fortinbras army appears on the horizon (looks very similar to the culmination of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail") when the palace is obviously guarded only by Francisco (who shouts a very non-Shakespearean cry "ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack" was shot), and the number of camera stars that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney Dole and Kate Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> And Branagh does not deal with such textual subtleties as the ambiguous nature of the relationship between Hamlet and Olphelie, and attracts the audience to the vulgar sex scene between the pair that fits any ambiguity directly from the stained glass. <br /> <br /> The unfinished text allows Branagh to indulge in his favorite film entertainment: more footage by Kenneth Branagh. It's never as obvious as in the speech "How Do Everyone Inform Me Against Me", which ends the first half of a nineteen-hour film (at least that's how it feels) trying to play a dramatic crescendo according to Gone With Wind: He will never be hungry. " It can serve Branagh's ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or his speech. When I saw the movie in the theater, I leaned on my companion and burned "Great moments with Mr. Haml". Branag rescues the most fun and disturbing moment for the last time when he tries to overcome Olivier's film and Claudia's just glorious death by Hamlet jumping from a high tower to a monarch and killing him with a sword. Bran√°in's Dane makes the King a heroic throwing of a seemingly magical rapier from the entire palace to pass through the heart of Claudia with a super hero to the bull's eye. The only thing that spared the moment of being unbearably crazy is that it's so fun. While this movie was a praise in some places as a serious display of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a stellar depiction of a talented filmmaker who overcame his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes and this Hamlet has nothing to offer, just a few unintended laughs and a terrible view of one male ego out of control.
