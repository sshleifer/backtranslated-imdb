I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I was just watching. In particular, I think it's a movie about the S & M "star" of the Roma CD, which is about as realistic as flash cartoons online. She is murdered by someone who causes her sister and has cracked a team of two FBI agents to investigate death. The local Great Assassination Division of the United States is also investigating, though most of his work comes through the oogling of CD ROMs that claim to be realistic "as a real thing." I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie with some credits. It's about 15 minutes in the film, and half of that is that the main girl is banging because there's apparently no apparent reason. I will not even explain the end because I am honestly saying that I can not solve it myself. But before the final scene, we took care of everything in the movie for 3 or 4 minutes. Frankly, they could run away after the final scene, and that would have the same effect with the cross-look and all. <br /> <br /> Overall, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I could really use something else for something else and I was more satisfied. Likewise, you play the knife game in which you repeatedly pull out your hand. That would be much more fun for 80 minutes.
