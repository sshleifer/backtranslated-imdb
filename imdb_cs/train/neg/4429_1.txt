Which piece of stupidity. <br /> <br /> You will not even waste time evaluating any points in this show. It's not time. The only comment I make is - why do such a DUMB, unbounded doofus, be a star ?! There is not much more humble testimony about the deteriorating mental state of the network than about the fact that FOX has said it DOES NOT LIKE John Doe (a decent series), but bring back a corpse like Joe Millionaire for another round of killing brainwaves of the American public. FOX lost it, IMHO.
