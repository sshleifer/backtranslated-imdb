Oh dear. Some of the best talents on British TV made this series, so I can assume they are working under incredible time pressure and have to settle on the first scene. <br /> <br /> There are some scary scenes in this Highland secret (mostly when a "monster" attacks and we see it from his perspective) but I'm afraid I found most of the story unintentionally funny! Just as the hero finds a broken body on a golf course: Oh, look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand ... hmm is a little confused ... <br /> <br /> for many years, fans of British TV series have been broadcasting a campaign to make this series come out on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
