There is no way you could take care of any of these characters on the ground. A lot of spoiled middle class kids take some drugs at a party, stand up and say. I just saw it on TV and I did not think it was a "movie" as such, but rather a post-'This Life 'grimace that really does not have any resonance or proper drama. Such things come into operation for a while, unfortunately, the irrelevant "lifestyle" of middle class bulls that get too taken seriously. It's got David Baddiel and the Cold Feet bird, you know what to expect. In 2000, it was a lot of things, it was a particularly British nausea ... "they are educated and do drugs? Friends, but a little dysfunctional and incestuous, it sounds great!" This kind of nonsense and post-Guy Ritchie comedy - gangster stuff ... dark days. If you have a taste, it will bother you to the point of violence.
