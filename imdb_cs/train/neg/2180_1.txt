Where to start, this film is so bad and terrible, I'm not sure where to start. Okay, two guys who wrote this step. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, could not first create the so-called name mind. I think it divides the difference, that's why the main name is BRAIN, which should not be lost, but on the final screen is called HEAD, which NEVER WORK. None of the medical profession knows anything. After all, doctors swear they do not "harm" them. Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "damage". In addition, a small thing called blood and tissue. Rejection would mean death for the lad. Plus, who keeps the singing job. What kind of medical school did Bill pass from FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? Monster had no name, you miss me. In addition, brilliant Doctor Bill Cortner does not know how to keep the patient sedated? All and all the disasters of the movie, it's incredibly stupid and inappropriate, except MST3K. I give her THOUGH TURKEY.
