I saw a lot of crap in the day, but good, Hot Rod Cake. At night I saw a free speech in NY. I can only hope it will show a fun version to paid customers. The big laughs were sparse, the plot was uninteresting, and the characters were at best unilateral. One of the highlights is the dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and it was the only scene I really laughed at. Besides, I can only remember the randomness and the dead air. Fans of SNL and Samberg can be disappointed. I know I expect more from that. But it's short, I certainly would not recommend attending a free screening or paying for watching this movie.
