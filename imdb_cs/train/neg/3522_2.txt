If you like the standard Sly moves that include over the top event, incredible stunning spells (unbelievable here are not intended) and slow down the dialogue; you will love this steam pile of mountain goat dung. I had great hopes on the trailer. I thought Stalone would be forced in his "ancient" days to go out to smarter people and create an action movie that would put a trusted hero into a plausible situation where story, setting, and (believable) would prevail. I long for action that is at least close enough to the reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects has brought at least one scene ridiculously ridiculous. Judge Dredda is just better because you know the theater is about seeing a comic book created in the movie. The character, settings, and everything else are out of comparison with anything we can meet for ourselves. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, turns the climbing guide to Rambo before you can say "Yeah, Adrian!"
