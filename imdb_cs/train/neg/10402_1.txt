Well ... I'm shooting, the original started in 1990 and I found the movie pretty nice to watch. however, they continued to do shakes II and III. Trust me, those movies started to go down right after the first one, I think blasters ass ??? Now, God alone is able to answer the question, "Why in God's name will one of these filming spots create the film?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie, in fact it can not be considered an example of a bad film, because it lives up to it. As I tried to sit still, I noticed that my eyes were bleeding, and I hoped that the girl in the ring would crawl over the television and kill me. that he really thinks that dressing people who looked at other films as if they were from a wild west, would a film (with exactly the same incidence) be better? honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I think there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
