Pretty disjointed film about a man who belonged to and left in the 1960s a superficial hippie religious cult fighting for sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists who are hidden in a police raid and received by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cottage by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some people in the city. It's hard to see what characters are, or in which time the scenes are to take place. The leader takes over sixteen years later (I got it out of the box - I missed the movie). No one is used to look older, not clearly, anyway. One murder is happening with a large circular saw, some being knives or crossbows. I have never heard the name of the name of the name mentioned in the film, but he is the one who has the most exaggerated, horn and hollering. The movie is a patch together quite wrong, with a voice-helping (not very) explanation of what is going on. Some sound effects were pretty bad. Man gets into the punch and we hear the sound of the whip cracking. The woman ignites the weapon and we do not hear it, but we hear ricochet instead! It does not seem to have been made for a comic effect.
