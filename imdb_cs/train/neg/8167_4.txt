Forest is not just your everyday standard slasher / backwoods cannibal fare, but also has an interesting blend of supernatural elements as well. The story is about two couples who went on a trip to the camp in the woods. Cave dwellings, cannibal lumberjacks and ghosts of his dead wife and two children are soon terrorizing. There's something you do not see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets an effort of effort, although the film itself falls to almost every level, the acting is just average except for Jeanette Kelly, who plays the dead wife of a forester (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent). /> <br /> The film opens with some wonderful shots of a pool of pools along the valley and the forest. They realize it's too late to be pursuing. Both are dispatched in a typical tariff. Our killer uses a trusted hunting knife all the time, except for flash, when he carries a hand saw, a fork, and a rusty saw blade to send his lover to the trickster. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story, but the film just does not work together with being pretty boring with just a messy deal. 4/10
