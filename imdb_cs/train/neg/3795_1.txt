I really wanted to love this show. Indeed, I honestly did it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers will receive their own version of The Bachelor. With the help of his mandatory "hag" Andry, James, a good-looking, well prepared thirty something has a chance of love with 15 suitors (or "buddies" as shown in the show). The only problem is that half of them are straight and James does not know. If James selects gay, they will get a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses straight, a straight boy gets $ 25,000. How can it not be fun? Take your hand, let me take a walk: <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in this show is the bachelor himself. James is your typical young and successful homosexual man with a nice smile and a body that you would probably give two views towards the local bar than grazing on green pastures. Why they decided to go to James as the head of a man is behind me. God knows there are a lot of other hot and lively homosexual men dying to be on television. In addition to his relatively average physical appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even as such, he has this arrogant and complacent Arabic aura about him. However, if James stood against the empty white wall he had slipped into. I honestly can not remember one interesting or remarkable thing that James said during the performance. It's boring and forgotten. One of his friends actually advised him that he did not feel connected. I thought it was the best part of the show. James also talks with an unbearable opaque lilte. Soundly feminine or healthy male, but it does not mean that tones appear in the middle of the sentence ... so painful that you sit down. I hated him so much all the time when I thought, "Please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unhappy haggle prospects" <br /> <br /> Then we have suitors. A remarkably unruly group of men who do not seem to care for what is happening. Likewise, they seem to be indistinguishable from one person to another except: "Hi, that guy has blondes or you have curly hair." Again, it seems like the goal of this show is incredibly insincere decision-making. While it can be hackneyed to write a cast role, it would be much more fun to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in all their banality, they managed to speed up James (which is not that difficult at all); You know you have a problem when some suitors are really hot and more interesting than a leading man. And the fact that suitors seem to have more fun around WHO than with a leading person? Very sad. I also thought I was referring to something I mentioned on the billboards that I felt was really true: straight men are hotter than homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I do not think all gay men were ugly and boring, in fact I found some of them very cute. It's just that, overall, they were just BLAH compared to men you would see at shows like Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. I do not know how many times I quickly got in during this show. I can take the lead figure as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept worldly apathetic suitors, but I SURE God's love is a little fun. Such luck. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, intrigue, sexivity or excitement, you will NEVER be disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still has a boyfriend in New York (How scandalous!). As bad as this can be a guarantee for you, it's the only thing remotely reminding of any conflict on this show. <br /> <br /> Make sure it's a twist, but if you have a Gaydar look in you, you will easily recognize who is who (it was not hard at all, the only one I was bad.) This show is stacking so many of your twists on the twist that it can not deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We are following James & Co as such in such exciting activities as western step learning, gift shopping, slimming zoo and gay karaoke. YAWN. Surely you have an occasional topless dance, but who cares when everyone is boring as well. This is one of the main problems with the show: NEVER seems to have fun themselves - just going through a movement that is hard to look good. And you really can not blame them because all the events are wildly uninteresting and lame. Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There is no cuddling, no laziness, no kissing (!), No interest of any kind. It's just "Okay, it was a boring date. I'm going back to my ugly, unpleasant want to be Sydney Opera House (CYA)." This show is so fierce that it's ridiculous. I understand that they do not want to play the perceived indiscreet nature of homosexual men, but they come to ****. People who watch TV shows will want more than just occasional hugs and kisses. This show rejects a compromise. <br /> <br /> I am sorry if it was long, but I felt that it was a problem that needs to be addressed. I commend Bravo that I will first introduce a show of this nature, but the incredibly incompetent manner in which this show has been handled is a breathtaking mind. Summary of my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = do something else. You'll have more fun than waiting in a doctor's office for a meeting, at least there are interesting magazines.
