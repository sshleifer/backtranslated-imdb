I am surprised that this movie is rated so high, but if I had to go with a typical scale of 71, it's c or d, so maybe it's ok but this movie was just a typical thriller except the boring slow and unreal. Not that the typical thriller is realistic, but it seemed to have tried it, and yet the woman who got to the rap did not summon the accusation because she did not want to be prosecuted, although she would introduce a man who broke her arm and blasted her and raped her for life, not only to protect a lawyer with her feelings and her family, not just random people she did not even know. There were other similar issues with the movie that would have been correct if some morality were turned away from the film but a few moral questions such as whether it was right to try to kill / defeat Kady before he did something illegal once Kady ended up crazy a bastard who bent to revenge, so sure that a lawyer is entitled to protect his family because he waited until Kady really raped his daughter to do something legal that it would be a little absurd. So now I'm my whole life for this silly movie, so please do not see it so your life will not be a passport and so my two and a half hours or so mean something.
