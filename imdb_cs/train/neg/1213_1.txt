I can not believe how Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger joined this garbage! The script is so badly written and the director so weak (both people) that it is hard to find more one-dimensional characters in the movie. The dialogues are so lame that the so-called thriller laughs at the few fools who have come to the theater. The setup is complicated and invites you to believe that you will watch a cool thriller and suddenly it will prove to be the deepest perceived film. Bassinger's figure is so stupid that she actually stopped crying to God "Where are you?" so people can follow her, and then there's a leak !!!! And then apparently got into the smallest wood in the world, I think it runs all over the place and the killers never lose it, and it happens in the middle of the night. I really am delighted that really the best writing people in Hollywood find out that they spend millions producing them.
