Mighty Morphin Power Rangers must be the worst TV show they've ever seen. There is no land, just a bunch of silly costumes that use martial arts while dressing in second-class spandex suits. Special effects look like they were from the 70s, costumes look like something bad comedy and the show is just terrible. The only thing worse than a TV show is toys that only bring our second-class plastic garbage to our children. <br /> <br /> There are much better shows for your kids to watch! <br /> <br /> Try to give your kids something like Nickelodean, these shows really have some intelligence behind them, unlike power rangers.
