Based on a friend's recommendation, we and my wife invited another couple to this film. I really did apologize to them - all four of us hated us and spent all the time looking at our watch waiting for the end of the movie. Half of the vines are bizarre, with very little value of entertainment. There were few scenes in Paris - for example, I was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I could not recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside the bar. No one in the theater has ever smiled or reacted. If you like bizarre, demanding, pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss it. If you are on earth like me, you will be sorry to have seen it.
