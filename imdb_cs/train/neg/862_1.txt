"Succubus", the modified version of "Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden", is an effort to sit, even in 76 minutes; even more of this terribly boring and pretending terrible horrific Euro and maybe I got into a coma. Jess Franco once again delivers a really awful piece of waste from the 1960s that looks like it was made from cast and crew from head to class A hallucinogens, because no one second of this mess makes any sense. Apparently, this is one of the best of his 180+ movies? it's hard to believe there's worse out there. The incomprehensible conspiracy deals with Franco's usual topics of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws a bit of S & M for good, yet still drives me to keep my mind boring boring. Could I have it for a long time before I get into the world of the ugly Euro Horror again? life is too short to spend watching cliffs like this.
