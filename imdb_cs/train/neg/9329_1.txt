One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I get money from the Hollywood video?" This is not the way it costs four dollars or some dollars. I think it was an attempt to tear the Mexican or Vin Diesel movies, but it failed unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The meeting was terrible, I was sorry for actors who could not find anything better with their time. The story was ridiculous. We called the lines in front of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the front lady was offensive, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br />
