From Shrek Creators ???????? .. OK, that caught my attention. But Shrek creators have also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. That means Flushed Away is not good. Animation and all the special effects were extraordinarily good, but the movie was not. The story of this film was intended for children only. It's really impossible for adults to actually love this movie. But for the adults there were many jokes. I bet kids understand jokes. Despite being like this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm totally disappointed. 4/10
