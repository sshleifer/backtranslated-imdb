The Bangville police probably marked the debut Keystone Kops, named after the studio they worked for. But they do not have dresses in silly police costumes, or drive a fast-growing car that is their trademark. Mabel Normand is the girl who asked her father about her bay. Later he sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. One responds and the persecution is turned on. Next, Mabel shook the door just as someone walks in. It turned out she was her mother who jumps to the conclusion that there are robbers! So when Mabel blocks the furniture door, Mother and Dad are trying to get in the way! This was perhaps the most amazing part of the short time with the explosions of a police car. It was a short 7 minutes that had passed so fast before it was over. The only real feature she has developed is Mabel's, which radiates the charm only with her face and big eyes and seems to be so optimistically cheerful, besides, of course, when she's afraid. It is easy to understand why she has become a star. It is largely because of her that I recommended to see it at least once and why I give it 4.
