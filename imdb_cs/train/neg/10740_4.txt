This movie begins with a certain promise; but in my opinion it starts to lose when the protagonist throws a good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-thinking foreigner starts repairing his car when he is gone, making phone calls is unlikely, but that he is one of the few people in the country who can help him return his family's life back on the road, it's a type of coincidence beginning writers being warned against use in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on average at best. The direction of art could be much better than cinematography. Acting was good, just like the singing of Eva van der Gucht.
