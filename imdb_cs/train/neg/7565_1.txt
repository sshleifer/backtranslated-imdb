This movie is the biggest loss of nine dollars I've spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you would probably say, it's hard to imagine, but never, that's true! When I saw a trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and tension, why not? The trailer is nothing but exciting and exciting; Unfortunately, the film is nothing of that. <br /> <br /> From cinema, script, to acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you read it, you plan to go to the movie and expect some excitement, secrets, action, horror or something other than wasting an hour and forty-five minutes, I'm afraid you're disappointed. > <br /> "Why is it so bad," you can ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor thrilling. Nothing in the film is the smallest "on the edge," frightened or curious. The script was at best ridiculous. In the whole movie, where the dialogue was almost so ridiculous, I began to write it as a comical relief, just to find out a few seconds later that it was not. The game was terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but this was a mistake. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. Cinematography was terrible without a moment of tension or mysticism. The story is totally transparent. You can see the end of this movie, which is miles away. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a very harsh critic. Honestly, when I look at the comedy I want to laugh at, and when I look at the mystery / tension / fear, I want to be surprised. This film was boring, poorly written, poorly written, and overwhelming disappointment. Make a favor and look at something else.
