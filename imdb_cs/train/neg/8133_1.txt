The movie is as fun as watching the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a total retarder who likes nothing better than sitting on her bold back, making a smoke ring from his inflatable cigars and drinking booze until the doctor behaves as a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking all the so-called "Blood" in fact, resembled Punch. Most of the conspiracy seemed terrible to even call this piece of bullshit a movie. The rest of the characters in this film are the complete waste of time, the end was terrible, the contours were baited, and the scenes were terrible. What else should I tell you to the audience? My advice would be to get your Raby if you were watching the movie. This film can give you foam in the mouth if you have not gotten your current pictures.
