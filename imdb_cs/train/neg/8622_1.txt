Since the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came in, there has been much talk about the revival of the film industry in Hong Kong. Do not believe it. People who are now making films in HK give the word crass the new meaning. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is called a pull, but he spends most of the movie, who smiles idiot and turns the coin. Over and over and over again, the coin gets stuck. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman who is chasing after a nice little boy. But one more time: who knows why? There is a pretty actress in a woman's management who runs a company and has to pay a ransom or something like that, but it seems she'd rather be in the spa or shopping center than in front of the camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. Everything is the name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
