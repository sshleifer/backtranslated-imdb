Like a former submarine, it was one of the worst submarine movies I've ever seen. First, the revolt aboard any US naval vessel, especially the Nuclear Powered Trident submarine in unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is amazing and they take it very seriously from the captain to the youngest crew member. I have never seen the crew of any ship divide their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Director. One executive officer who behaved like a character played by Denzel Washington would be discharged from his duties and the Martialed court, then shot out of the navy. Not surprisingly, the navy refused to send a technical advisor to help make this film. Finally, if one of the submarine crew members made noise on this ship, they would be seriously punished. Submarines learn early in their careers to be as quiet as possible to avoid being exposed. They do not wake up the door and they do not even speak quietly, and when they are in motion they wear soft salted boots. I was overwhelmed by the loud performance of the crew when it was running. Voice music would never be tolerated. I know that displaying a submarine in reality would not sell movie tickets, but it's over the top to the point that it's ridiculous. I would not want to make this film to anyone.
