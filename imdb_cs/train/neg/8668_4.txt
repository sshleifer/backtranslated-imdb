I have never read Bradbury's novel that this film is based on, but from what I have collected it will be interesting (when I finally read it and myself). My comments will be based purely on the film. As soon as I saw a trailer I knew, I had to see it and was so excited, but when I finally did, I was so disappointed it hurt. This is because the movie itself was so amateur. The actors were not well occupied (although Robards and Pryce are both good actors - not just here). It seemed that the actors had been asked to appear, got into the character's clothes, said the lines and the faces. Set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised I had to go online and check who was driving it, just to see what it did. The editing was cut and pasted, and the script was just that (although the author himself involved, irony?). Building tension, fear and tension was so mild that it was ineffective when the peak finally came. I read some comments on this movie and it was hard to believe that people really enjoy it. The most hurts that content is interesting and fun and interesting. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that it took a brilliant story.
