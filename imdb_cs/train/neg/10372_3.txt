I liked the comments of the first reviewer much more than I did when I saw him in second place in the early 1980s. I was amazed by the fact that I was taking care of creating costumes that were so detailed in Tenniel's drawings. But for me, the cast was very useless, their personality muffled by masks, while the direction I think is unusually static, and the photograph dark. The rating that was recorded at that time was nothing, which means "it's not worth sitting for once". Still, I would have jumped to the chance to have a second look.
