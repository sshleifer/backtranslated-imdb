I was right that I believe Mr. Glover and Mrs Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and friends. I have no idea what the film is about. After much discussion, we all agreed that it was not one of their improvements. <br /> <br /> It does not apply well. It's too jarring and there's little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could have been much better. I've been waiting for months to see this movie based on notes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste money unless you are complete and you just want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. It was a bad way to spend the evening.
