My family and I have previously seen Underdog. And as bad as Underdog (my four-year-old loved it), Hot Rod looks like an Oscar. The only thing that could save this film was if Evel got himself retired to put Samber on his face when he made the film. But I admit that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the film was shot in the 1980's, but most of the music comes from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would make a pass. Stay at home and watch the test pattern at your local TV station. Or if you are dead when you look at it, people under the influence can look forward.
