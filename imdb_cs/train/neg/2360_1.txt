This will be the most unnecessary comment I've ever postponed, but I have to do it to warn you about the atrocities in the cinema that is "Freddy's Dead." It's not just the worst nightmare chapter, but it's right with the worst sequel of horror all the time! It was boring, useless, and almost without death. The terrible 3-D endings and over the top CORNY kill it just drive this "film" into the ground. But it does not stop, you just add bad acting, a terrible scenario, and lots of cheese portraits, and you have a pile of pile of guano! No wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, did two postmortem performances. I would, too, if I went out this way. This is a strictly fanfare film, do not look at our shame.
