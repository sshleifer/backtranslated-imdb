This is not a very good story about the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this film. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful woman in buff! Bo Derek in '10 'was at least humorous and was a reason for nudity and sex. This film is nothing but gentle porn. If you do it well, then quickly get over it and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) was again a car for Bo Derek, who performed her horrific acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but her poster is much more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; it was one of his few mistakes! do not waste time on this movie ... go buy a book.
