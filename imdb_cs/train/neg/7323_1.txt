Well, unlike other previously written comments, I have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one person looked a bit like Jason Donavon, who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how it got any appreciation, and although I'm sure it's been a great deal of effort, it's all futile, since the end result is the one who screams out of the nineties of foreign soaps. The cinema was hopeless and the acting was the same as performance and it was unfortunately long and partial drawings were incredibly unrealistic .... for example ... if your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend for 6 years after he was only parting two weeks, you would not be all the best friends. It was all fantasy. That is all! Yeah yeah, and the strange 90 house / soft core of India was mind insensitive!
