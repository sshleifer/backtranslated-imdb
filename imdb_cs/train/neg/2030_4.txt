The comment "eliz7212-1" will hit the proverb "nail on the head" for this turkey program. But it's a horn to watch William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, "" tags for word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be great for SNL or MAD TV - and throw a few stars on a single track, or to see Shatner, who seems to have taken a "camp" on new heights - whether in a role or as himself. But the guy's funny. Girls in the data room boxes will be really lucky when this turkey is canceled - unless the whiskey-a-go-go genre revives, with the rising demand for balanced young women to dance in higher cages once more. I watched the first competitor, who was annoying and literally "stupid than: a post," but still fortunate, he went about a quarter of a mile. The other competitor, somewhat smarter, but who was lucky to have won $ 1,000 for Jeopardy! Was tabbed with a card that required a special question - which he did not know, leaving him alive. <br /> <br /> This show of game shows, which is pampered and sometimes gives large sums to everyday individuals, is certainly a cheap effort, overall, to try to bring viewers. Even if the host is well compensated and give away six numbers in the average episode, I assume that revenue versus cost can be good - because you do not have a sitcom where six or seven star numbers are on the episode, with some big residual contracts. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the better ones will wear thin ones at the time. This has already reached this point. I think his offers, especially with James Spader and others on "Boston Legal", should provide us with a satisfactory offer of Bill Shatner. Again, the aforementioned evaluation is just a good thing to see Bill Hoot and the Prance, maybe once; that should be enough.
