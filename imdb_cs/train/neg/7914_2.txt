This film was designed to be a very successful film. This is a type of movie that is made to popcorn food, and watch his crazy graphics. With this idea, the film brings, perhaps not as well as the ultrasonic Iron Man, but pretty good. Besides popcorn munching actions and special effects, the film looks like a cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Many viewers, including me, complain about how most of the characters have been greatly changed, but it just makes the film a poor adaptation, not a poor movie. For some other reasons, this film is unsatisfactory. The creators were more focused on attracting the eye in the eye than it was in the mind. Characters that have long been anticipated and promoted are reduced to 4 scenes. Major characters Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the movie) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Lieutenant Schriber. The remaining characters are thrown to the way to make way for all the important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30 minutes, just like the Sabertooth, though Victor has a surprise in his movie. The "final boss" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and hardly gets any development to show why it is the way it is. The filmmakers, of course, felt that everything they really had to do was create a bad figure that could do whatever they wanted, and slap in the name of a popular figure. Very disappointing ...
