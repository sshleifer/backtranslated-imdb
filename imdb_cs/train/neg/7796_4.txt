Wow, not only is this movie a "new lesson in real bad taste," but also a lesson about "true bad movie." Do not get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence," but at the same time you have to realize when the film is terrible. In case you missed the story, it's "Zombie" 90 "on the government plane carrying toxic chemicals that happened to hit the wilderness, causing the chemicals to spill, causing local people to become ominous zombies. Another thing you know is that zombies across the city are eating people alive while a drunken doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the illness that causes them to eat each other - hence the name "extreme plague." Since then everything what we see, zombies with a field bottom in every place on the site - nothing but extreme and dirty disembarkation and destruction accompanied by infinite buckets of guts and blood.For this is a German film, the film had to be nicknamed English and when you are not laughing at feeding frenzies zombie, the voices are also fun and fun as a UnratedX user mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, in the movie is a scene , which crosses the boundary between what is acceptable and unacceptable, and therefore the scene in which the woman carrying her child is around her in a wheelchair, and a zombie horde comes from nothing and attacks them. One zombie catches a baby and cuts it into pieces, eating his organs as you hear the baby crying. Wow, this is a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLY's bad taste. I terribly call you terrible.
