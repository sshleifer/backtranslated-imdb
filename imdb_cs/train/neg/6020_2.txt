I like movies at the end of the day. I like B-movies. I was hoping I'd like this movie. I could ignore bad effects, often horrifying music, traces of seizures. I could ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the film always relies on deus ex machina is justified by the subject. I could ignore the fact that people who fight hunger and try to achieve world peace are bad boys. None of these things will kill the movie. What kills this movie, it's simple and simple boring. Nothing will happen; almost all of the scenes in the film are designed to send filmmakers' morals to viewers, at the cost of having a coherent story or any kind of tension. If you are looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
