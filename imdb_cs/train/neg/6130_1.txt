In the early eighties, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. It is inevitable that men in their position will get film roles that exist only to make use of it. I have no idea what Tomas is paid to make this film, but I have to pay a big pile of money to agree that I will be crazy about the film. The film is obviously derived from "Enter the Dragon" as well as most martial arts. Only the real martial art creates an absurd new martial art, precisely described by one critic as "the cross between Kung Fu and break dance." Gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue a lady from an impenetrable fortress, and yet every room has a backing, exactly what Thomas needs to kick bad asses. Of course they are fighting their main dick and, of course, they have fantastic fighting, with an end that will only surprise those who have never seen the Marshal. There are touches that nostalgic types will like, especially the smiley hairstyle Thomas and many of the male star-stars have. The only reason you look at this movie is if you have a hatred against Kurt Thomas, who now wants him never to move on to the movie set.
