This is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical instrument ever made. Chorus Line Scene A is great. This film lacks a mark in almost every direction. Even casting is disturbing. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Valova's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer, but she is 3. In the art department, she finds a solution, but she is a great dancer. What are brilliant filmmakers doing? They lend an actress who can not dance and is known for looking great. The way to the ship. <br /> <br /> Then there is a choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned around in his grave. Why not use their choreography? That really can not be improved.
