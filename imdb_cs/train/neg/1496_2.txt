Evil Breed is a very strange movie slasher, which unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the movie looks promising, but overall it is a disaster. Dialogue is pretty bad, but it's not as bad as acting. The game is brutal and unbearable. Characters bring rows terribly, and even if it's purpose, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some killers are innovative, but it took too long to get them. After about half an hour of the film, we get the first death (other than the beginning) and then the next five minutes smoke almost every other character. The film then turned into a spoof with characters of ridiculous viewers, unrealistic karate, such as the fight and scene in which a man gets his gut pulled out of his * sscrack. None of it is funny that it's just ridiculous. This movie then becomes ultra cruel and ultra-purposeless. Most of the characters are clich√©s even for slasher standards and are just as solid as ter left on the counter for 5 days. Eve's breed is not even ridiculously bad, so it fails in its main task. Watch Texas Chain Massager, just before dawn, or see no evil for the real slasher.
