My favorite part was when the credits began to move. I wish I could give her .0000000000001 of 10. I really wish I had this hour and thirty minutes back. Do not waste money or time on it. I really wanted to see how the grass grew, and after the departments it felt better. Nadia was really nice and I hope the film will not ruin her career. But she decided she was in it. Overall, it sucks more than any other film sucks. More than Kazaam and Glitter together. It says something. <br /> <br /> Do not <br /> <br /> do !!!!
