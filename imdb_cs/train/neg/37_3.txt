Devil Hunter gained renown for being on the DPP's "Video Nasty" list, but it does not really have to be. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP), just known reasons, and while it is not thereest out of the pile; there is not so much that would require a ban ... which is a shame because I would never sit down where it does not mean it is on the "shopping list". Give the movie a decent base - or at least a more decent base than most cannibal films - and then an actress who is kidnapped and taken to the Amazon jungle. The hunter is then hired to find it, but he has to lead the natives on the way, led to a man called the "Devil" (hence the name). In fact, the film simply breeds for eighty-five minutes, and there really are not many scenes that interest you. It is true that Jess Franco eventually shot such films because he has a clear talent. as seen by films such as Diabolic Dr Z, Venus in the Skin, Faceless and Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good movies are just gems between heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much part of the bullshit. I saw this movie purely because I wanted to be able to say that I saw everything on the DPP list (just two more!) And I think that's why most other people who saw it saw it. But if you are not on Nasties watch; there is really no reason to bother with this.
