In my time I saw better movies for young werewolves, but he took this cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" gives "c" at a cheese-fest. The quality of the stars in this movie is not bad. Just the way it happened just sent on a slope. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 50-year-old American soccer player who does not work in Transylvania because of a wolf-bite. The most annoying part of the film was the violinist. He went all batts! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father, who has met the end of his own bullet. Adam's father, Alan, plays a stream that does not seem to be the pinnacle of his play. After all these years, Tony seems to be out of place due to the attack and then gets a chance to capture his state. More laugh than blood, this movie is just the beginning of the 1980s, "Teen Wolf" was better! 1 of 5 stars.
