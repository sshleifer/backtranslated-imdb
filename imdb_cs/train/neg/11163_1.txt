We loved Rock School and Jack Black. We could not wait to see this movie. It was the only time the movie was so bad I wanted to leave. My husband also hated it. Only funny parts were in the trailer. My husband and I wanted to stand in front of the cinema and tell people to save their money. Writing was terrible. She had every terrible stereotype of the Hispanic people who should be totally offended. The film was not that long, but it looked like eternity for us. The people in the theater were so restless and quiet, it was as if the colors were dry. I made my husband because I was sure there would be some redeemed parts, but they were not. Save money and time.
