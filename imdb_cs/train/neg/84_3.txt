As a child, I thought the weapon the killer was doing was fine, but I was a baby and so I was a little stupid. Even as a stupid child, even though the film plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer did not use his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has really solid content. What scenario they read when they agreed to be in this movie because it is certainly boring and just a means of showing a light saber on a very small scale. Sometimes it is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. It looks like the whole movie is spinning around aliens and one weapon. The conspiracy has two children and a few bastards who have met foreign affairs a few years later, and it seems to be returning as in a mix. The dead animals and those to be explored and for some reason one of them gets a weapon of aliens and continues to use to go to a very light killing. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you have a killer to have some good death scenes if you have an extraterrestrial encounter to show more than a strange luminous vortex, and if you're going to have light sabers and then called star wars.
