One would think that the film about a young man who would cope with his growing homosexuality would be boring. Think again. This production should be packaged and marketed as insomnia as it is about ten times more effective than any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if a filmmaker * was thinking * about shooting a movie but was lazy and decided instead to run a series of random (and randomly BORING) paintings and go-node scenes, throw a few real scenes to represent real acting, pretend that good lighting is not important in the film process and wrap it under the auspices of the film "arthouse". It is exactly such a dirty product that makes it easier for many traditional filmmakers to respond to the Indian film movement and to keep the general public easier to take indie films. <br /> <br /> You are interested in movies that cover this subject, it would be much better if you enjoyed some great short films available on the Logo website or rent Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long stroke.
