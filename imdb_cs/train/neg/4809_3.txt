When a movie has less than five different titles, it usually means a few things and almost always means the movie has some big mistakes somewhere. Necromancy has serious shortcomings and is simply wrong. I saw the version on a video called Rosemary's Disciples. Yes, I'm sure it differs from the other versions, but I do not want to think that there is no other version and a few more minutes that it could have - it's going to be better. The story is perhaps the biggest problem: the movie opens when Laurie wakes up and her husband takes her to a town where she has a new job at a okultist toy factory (yes, it gets worse soon!). The town is named Lillith and has a guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those chosen by the "owner" of the city are allowed. Soon we will find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and everyone is guided by the guidelines of Mr. Cato - the head of this community community who wants his dead son back (hence the name Necromancy). People in the city are making witches - they have ceremonies, some have a head on their heads, and promiscuity is rich (not much in this area), but none of these people are a very good actor. Mr. Cato is a playful and literally larger film director Orson Welles. Welles is abused, but do not make mistakes is the best in this movie. And that's really the deadliest part of necromancy, because Welles is doing pretty bad and pedestrian performance with little overhead. In one scene at the party, director Bert I Gordon returns to Welles, who looks at the party's action with exactly the same pictures! It looked ridiculous. Just like a scene that was repeatedly seen again and again from the hand of a woman who focused on swirling flames after a car crash. It looked like a business man's shoulder. The story is never fully utilized because we never know what's going on: many scenes are shot as dreams or hallucinations and never been confirmed. This also applies to the lean and hockey end. Chief Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent. Other than her performance, the real slim pieces from the rest of sans Welles. The direction and story was Gordon, who apparently had little gas in the engine. It's not a good movie in any way under any name.
