Good! What can he say? First, this adaptation is too long in 4 hours due to the complexity (or missing) of the conspiracy. The actors are really trying to make something out of this movie, but there is very little content available. Swayzee is not really the character of Quatermain. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of a big man in the League of Outstanding Lords, Swayzee does not really make a mark. This guy with a Winchester recurring rifle has no strength, character, gentleness or humor needed for this part and is upstaged by all, including the witch, which in my view seems more convincing than an actor than the rest of the cast. Some views are nice, but in cinematography there are stupid mistakes. For example. When a happy team arrives on a water hole in the middle of the desert, their traces are visible until the oasis, just waiting for them to enter. The climb from the socket leads to the exit (the next shot) of anything similar to the exit that is seen from the passage into which they climbed and the like. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear. In some ways, I wish he had. <br /> <br /> The Russian leader who watches Quatermain is a sober stereotyped figure who shoots just about everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee was pretty good as a sad father who returned to London, unable to get his son's custody. Swayzee should stick to this sort of thing. He is not able to carry part of a brave gentleman with a heart of hell, experience with life, and feel fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Barely
