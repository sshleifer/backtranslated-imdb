My personal vision of hell is locked in the room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie game forever on every accessible surface in this room. The whole idea that Streisand plays boys / men is beginning to scratch the surface of such a meaningful premise of this film. The only thing that matters most about watching a movie is the concept of a "willing suspension of distrust". . . it's impossible in this movie.
