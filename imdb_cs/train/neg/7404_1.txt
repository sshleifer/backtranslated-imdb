I started to be interested in this film after reading a review that reminded this movie to Silent Hill reviewer. When I was a huge fan of Silent Hill and I was disappointed with his film debut, I thought I'd make it a chance. Mind, Fearnet only mentions this movie as "Dark Floors," not its full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits I immediately thought about the band (I had some college colleagues who resembled them), but I did not think it was important and quickly refused. > <br /> The film is getting strong. Despite the fact that "DEATH" is a "scary little girl", the good use of sound and the feeling of isolation actually began to connect the story. The tense atmosphere was built up quickly, and each indication showed that the film was excellent. Since monsters are horror stars, I could not wait to see what was hiding in the corridors of the hospital where the main characters were trapped ... And then the first monster showed up, and I found myself very impressed. By the time the other appeared, I was caught by the fact that it looked like it was from the Megadeth concert, and the stupidity completely turned me off. During the movie, the atmosphere remained undamaged, and the story left you wondering what was happening, but fears were largely absent. But I had the hope that the end would bring all that. Unfortunately, it was not. By the time the movie reached its peak, I was totally unbelievable, and I realized right now that it was bad in my last revelation ... The lead singer Lordi? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was it what the film was all about? A lot of poor souls are haunted by Lordi band members around the hospital? The silly construction of the monster suddenly made sense. If you're going to be like this, maybe even through Marilyn Manson, or even KISS. Not to mention that I'm sure I saw the end of one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. Did they have to go and make the whole movie out of it? <br /> <br /> The worst of all, when I find out what's really going on, all I've done is yawning. I'm not going to "ruin" for you, but I can safely say it's probably a story you've seen before. Most likely, more than once. <br /> <br /> So, if you are not a huge fan of Lordi, stay out of it. It's not scary, it will not bring anything new to the table (though it does a decent job to borrow from other horror films, especially Silent Hill). And I can not emphasize it so much, the Lord is an antagonist. Lord. Talk about buzzkill. <br /> <br /> You really would rather be scared to watch Slipknot music videos yourself. In other words, it is simply not possible.
