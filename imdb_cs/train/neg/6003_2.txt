Sundown - it was the weakest and hardest vampires they've ever seen, accompanied by one of the most inappropriate, demanding songs ever written - and with Vampire Shane, every move and spoken word, so ridiculous that I half-laugh and rewind that vampires have no special force at all - besides strength (sometimes), they can turn the lamp off their mind (once) and ... that is, really. Sometimes imagine that Dracula was desperately afraid of fighting because he avoided bullets? Me neither. Virtually any other film - Dracula eat this for breakfast, the skin of his followers and use their bones as the tip of peaks. The main screenplay of the film is that the human family of four will get caught up in the battle of vampire gangs - Dracula vs. some old bird. It could have been some good old B-Flick fun, but too dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took the film a little too seriously and eventually destroyed the rest of the movie that was not destroyed by clay bats and a ridiculous screenplay. Ultimately, it's just too stupid to be funny. Sure, they have some fun moments, but they are little and far apart.
