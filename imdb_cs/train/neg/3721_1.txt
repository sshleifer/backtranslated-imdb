The two films are useful for fear of God, this and 'Event Horizon'. One has a meaningful and prompt message, the other is as monodimensional as a religious film. The pity that Paul Anderson continued in the damned film films Resident Evil really had something. The thief is blocking many obvious independent film attributes (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) at night, and it is clear what the intentions of the film are from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not come to fruition, so we stick to The Omega Code, Left Behind and other Tribulation movies. Their bottom line is that they are interested in selling their message: "Save yourself, people!" that everything else happens to be the other that the viewers hide overhead with the Bible. Overall, I can not believe I even write so much about a movie that is ineffective. Skip it completely and go back to Sam Neil, who slips the eyeballs. 1 out of 5.
