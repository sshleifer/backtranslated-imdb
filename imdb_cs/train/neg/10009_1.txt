This movie is a huge burden. Paul Schrader is totally lost in his own bad script. And his direction is about as comatose as it may be without having to sleep during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst is Woody Harrelson, whom I usually like when he is properly occupied. He plays a "pedestrian," a homosexual man in D.C., who plays a social partner with the boring women of the Washington elite. He could not be more dimensioned if he was cut off from the magazine and set out in front of the camera on his wand. His "Southern accent" lies in the fact that the "rack" version decresends from the beginning to the end of each line it supplies as if the warmth and humidity of the South still emptied him of every energy he has. It is monotonous. But his film is not the worst accent. His "friend," played by Moritz Bleibtreau, is trying to influence a sort of accent in the Middle East, which is so clumsy that he barely delivers the bad lines written to him. He is unable to roll his r is over the fact that in real life he is German and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! Is that a good reason why you do not think anybody else? <br /> <br /> From the story, script, directing, working with the camera to leading performers, this movie is bad from start to finish. The only acceptable moments in this film come from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three have managed to prove their dignity in the film in this film. In fact, all three are excellent, even though they are trapped in a very bad film. Unfortunately, nobody can ever be good enough to redeem this infinite number of shortcomings. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
