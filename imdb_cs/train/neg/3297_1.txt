Why take the idea that millions watched and loved us like kids and made a joke? They ask why Hollywood does not make the money he's used to. Because they drove garbage and paid actors a huge amount of money for garbage and asked us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where good guys are on top. It was not Gone with the Wind, but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can not come up with anything original to take something that was good and destroy it for a ball. I just hope this movie will be 10x less than it would cost. The only one who has some fun with this bullshit are the guys who got to run General Lee. Viewers are victims. <br /> <br /> You do not see it, but instead look at repeating TV shows. Still 20 years later.
