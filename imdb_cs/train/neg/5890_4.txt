This romantic comedy is not too bad. There are some funny things there, and there are some rather unforgettable characters. However, the hearing is amateur (except for the banker). While some scenes are very entertaining, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the poor story. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedy. It's not really a bad movie and the end felt pretty good. Just do not expect anything extraordinary. It's fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
