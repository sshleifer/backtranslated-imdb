First, the big actors need money ... Surgical scenes were ridiculous ... and they must know that people with little knowledge of medicine would find it totally absurd ... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during the transplant hearts ... neither do surgery in a small room without equipment, heart equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not concentrate on the story because all the stupid operating scenes ... no blood, no staff and then the hero doctor comes and assumed ... it's not a movie for adult thinking .... Also, the budget had to be limited ... the street scenes were fine, but who was the technical advisor .... It seems that it was driven by a total idiot .. Save money and wait until it comes out on DVD and do not let it ..
