Hail Bollywood and Men's Directors! <br /> <br /> It really is the ultimate limit in the absolute sacrifice of an Indian woman! <br /> <br /> Showing the current state of affairs in India, where wives become more mature day after day and are very wealthy to their husbands - directors .. can also be called Uncle Scars (see the movie The Lion King) came up with a very new concepts of how breeders and wives can live together happily after sharing everything with each other ... including sperm !! <br /> <br /> Story: A couple - very happy - but accidentally happens and the woman has an abortion - she lost her fetus together with the capacity to become a mother at all! <br /> <br /> Now in India, in-laws usually drive away their mother-in-law unless they give them heirs! So the wife struck a big plan - a replacement mother ... but the scientists intervened - "Certainly artificial insemination" - NO said the artist (the director really) - "The neighborhood learns that mother-in-law is barren they are preparing for a substitute mother! the same one who watches Fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the age group 14 to 40 ... al in brassieres and panties - and those who neighbors suddenly take the upper hand in planning and deciding the family! So the wife sends her husband to a beer bar where girls dance on the stage - mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women because they can satisfy their ego a lot Hired a dancer in the pub - ask her to give birth to her child - in exchange for money - agrees - comes home - she becomes pregnant - wife and reared - both live together in the same house - at that time the prostitute will also get the taste of the household ife - so many caregivers around self-lacking everything and silently crying In the meantime - no one in the family knows that the real daughter is rotating with a pillow under her petticoat! - Mother or other elderly people have never used it for sightseeing - nor did they feel the child's movements in the womb!
