Black candles are a rather confused disorder from the same director who brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among other things .. I only record the ones I've seen. Anyway, we have a couple who love, and then somewhere near the pin is standing on a voodoo doll and then piercing it and the man kneels. I'm not sure if it was good for someone at that moment. Going forward, where the sister of a man came into the house to explore and hear the read of will or something like that, and of course everyone else except her is in something that is by chance worshiping the devils. It's really hard to tell who is who in the moments of the movie and that's a bit confusing at times. To justify things, there is a simulated bestiality scene (I thought it was simulated) with a black goat, definitely a crowd of joy. Ugh. It sometimes reflects "Rosemary's Baby," with the exception of a child, because the hostess always gives one woman herbal tea and a place that is so unpleasant to Satanic herbs, because it is still remarkable. However, herbs are not the only thing that concerns this film. It looks like the end is starting again and many viewers might be interested in where they are in the middle. It's not indivisible, it's not very good, and I think it all depends on what you like in movies and there was not much that did not do much for me. 3 out of 10.
