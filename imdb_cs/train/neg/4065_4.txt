... over Eric Stanz's like-minded talents. Not-a particularly talented director tried not a particularly good movie, but nevertheless I found myself sitting through it for the final credits when for nothing more than to see what happens next. The assailant escapes from the prison and causes his old flame. After capturing her (though she came willingly) and threatening her to have sex (another event she was willing to do), she discovered that she had kidnapped three boys who had hurt her in the past. He then decides to kill her (huh?) But He is destroyed and dies instead. A girl has a mind (or something like that) and she took her fury on the unfortunate guys in the basement. All right, the song is angry: it's a long, charged ten cents, and there's plenty of it. <br /> <br /> Behavior is upset: how long do you play? <br /> <br /> Shooting is upset: the home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of recording from the cemetery is just a damn insult. A budget is a joke: you get it ... "budget", it was a punchline. And yet it was a spell. In the seventies, these films appeared in theaters with real budgets and talents, not today. If you want to follow this kind of violent, sexually abusive waste (you do not lie, some of us), then it's all you get today. Some short hardcore shots on sex scene, torture with fecal material, fun with axes, anal cutting with a broom and long shot of crazy masturbating chick with the same broom are some of the better items on the menu. <br /> <br /> It's not good and it will not be remembered, but not from the beginning of Joe D'amato, people have filmed such films. <br /> <br /> 4/10
