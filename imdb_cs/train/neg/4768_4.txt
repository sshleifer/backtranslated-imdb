I found myself on Nine Dead recently and read the latest reviews because I could deal with the average film. However, this film was slightly below average but observable. The script was badly written, and the acting was on average for B and the pair performed as good. The story is bordering on Saw, teaching people what's wrong with the situation, and trying to make them more aware, but that's really where the comparison ends. The nine dead try to have the heart and intent behind simple thoughts that are not new. The main mistake I found in the nine dead was the faint face-to-face with the viewer who appeared in the movie for three minutes, and it was a totally useless and completely inadequate end that people do not see them coming wrong. I make it impossible for all allies to see the worse of the bad movies and not even do it wrong. Decent movement, bad behavior and end ...
