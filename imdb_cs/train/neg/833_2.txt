There was not really a story in this movie. It was free from the events in the first Lion King movie. It is supposed that Timon and Pumbaa met through their loneliness. But it is no more than that. <br /> <br /> Directs some scenes from the original and then ab-libs about how this movie changed slightly. But is that so? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show is a blank conspiracy with little explanation. I think if you want to see more meerkats in the universe of the Lion King, then it is. But besides, the animators have little justice. Disney should actually stop these productions directly on the video. It really was quite boring and he could use Jason Statham. "D-"
