Arthur Askey has a tremendous skill as a comic in the way he communicated with his public. His teen jokes, silly songs and dull dances went well because he managed to attract people and drag them to the world of the wall. The lack of a living audience was a clear disadvantage for him, and he was never completely comfortable in the movies. He has his moments in the ghost train and his character Tommy Gander has been adapted to use his talent, but Askey, an artist, needed to be appreciated. Askey's film support is not strong, including regular stars Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as couple of honeymoons; Linden Travers goes over the top as a "crazy woman". Also on board is Peter Murray-Hill, who extraordinarily married Phyllis Calvert, as the nominee leading man who gives a totally insincelance to this section and the lead Mrs. Carol Lynne, which becomes an equally obscene performance. It is left to actress actress Kathleen Harrison to help helplessly steal the film as a parrot who loves one woman who smashes on dr. Morlanda Graham.
