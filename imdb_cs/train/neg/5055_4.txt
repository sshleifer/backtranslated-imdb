Two years ago at Sundance I loved the directorial debut Josh Kornbluth - Haiku Tunnel. So I'm looking forward to Jacob's best brother, Jacob's (and frequent coworker), the best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good guy growing up in the lower class of New York. The film is not without insidious moments. But sometimes it's as if Kornbluth worked too hard to make it clear: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. Stronger and more important is our understanding that, despite all of these rather hideous cultural backgrounds and anti-social behavior that they can reproduce, these characters have no dearth of goodness and humanity. We can renounce their language and living conditions, but we can not reject their intent. And in fact, their efforts to keep their family in such an adversity have a certain nobility that most of us barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his sympathy with people is obvious all over the world. When he said it all, the best thief in the world suffers from many painful defects (including the title). Characters are not very credible. Writing is uneven. And the story line is barely recognizable. And for the most disturbing, Kornbluth uses two young black boys who mimic gangsta rap between the scenes. To each of my own: But when I do not question the possible realism of this phenomenon, it hurt me to see the 5-year-old mf'ing and talk about sex with a group of women. It is unnecessary shock value and it is a forced piece of interest.
