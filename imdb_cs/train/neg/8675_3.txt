The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba, this movie gives him a lot of people. Chiba makes speeches; Chiba represents; Chiba sarkasy; Chiba sees the camera; Chiba strikes and kicks of live sushi from a group of evil guys; Chiba sits on sofas and chairs and looks thoughtful / thoughtful; Chiba is driving his car ... I like Chiba as an actor and a fighter ... but even for Chiba fans, this movie can have a bit of Sonny Chiba. It's probably something for him. And no, I would not do "Street Fighter" in the same category because "SF" plays a ruthless, amoral anti-hero and shares a camera with interesting engagement of friends and enemies. Here he is almost always front and center and tries to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee in one. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could not pull it off for a feature-length feature film, and Sonny just exhausts his welcome. At least he could just get out of his suit. <br /> <br /> The film is further confused by the totally free and misplaced introductory sequence (seemingly attached to the front of the film for the American version) and the jubilant cry ("Viva !! Chiba !! Viva! Chiba! things on the wrong leg. There is some surprisingly amateur and inappropriate dubbing - Sonny (or his usual English stand-in) apparently could not be bothered to make vocals for the American version, so they got some bad drug with a completely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite pleasing, coming from the face we all know and love from "Street Fighter". <br /> <br /> Even with all these deficiencies and overexposure, it could be even less classic, but working with the camera and battle scenes are hopelessly deep. I'm willing to believe that karate really works if someone is as awesome as the Chiba character, but the director and cameraman made his bets by scribbling and editing weed combat scenes, so you can not really see what's going on most of the time. It's not all bad: there are some decent pictures and compositions, and there's at least one unforgettable nightmare when bad guys appear in the client's bedroom in a truly inventive way. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to a real plot ... forget it. For "bodyguard" Chiba's character is an idiot. The scenario depends on making mistakes and mistakes that repeatedly (and his "client") find themselves in dangerous situations to get out of them and after 30 minutes suffer even the most important court to think that this guy is supposed to be something good. (Even if his character really destroyed the Japanese drug store, he would take his client to his neck for 10 minutes into the script and shake it until his teeth were called a castanet until he'd left a little secret ... and a whole lot of unnecessary death and conflict would </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> I think it's worth watching once.
