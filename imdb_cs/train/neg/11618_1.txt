The cinematic work is really honest, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it becomes interesting, everything slows down to a major stop. I'm glad I saw Sam Rockwell doing a great job, just like the other actors I mentioned, but man ... that's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Now maybe in a short film, this film would be good, but other than that, to avoid it. This film has so many fillers that Twinkie makes the pie jealous. <br /> <br /> I never went out of the movies, but when I watched this family home, I went out. Yeah, it was boring. Apparently, my comment does not have enough lines to post, so here is some filler. I think I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
