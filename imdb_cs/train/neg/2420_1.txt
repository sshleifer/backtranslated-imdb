Usually I only comment on the films I like, and I imagine "everyone to my own taste", but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this movie, which seems to be lost in shuffle, is that these two adults themselves have the perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, go out and cause unpredictable suffering to the kids. Even allowing culturally disabled people have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up in the morning and get back what they started. After all, "love" is all that is important, is not it? To hell with the others. Whether things "eventually evolved" is not really right; in fact, it is absolutely irrelevant. The question is that disrespect for others, especially when they are young people, especially when they are in a position of addiction, is a light and thus strengthened by this film. There is far more harmless behavior that these "parents" could do, which would mean the suppression of the army of social workers at heart.
