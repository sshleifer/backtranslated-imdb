Of all the films (and I'm a graduate of the film, if it's worth something to you), it's the BEST movie I've ever seen. I know there's probably a worse one I have not seen yet, but I've seen it, and that's the worst. My friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and slowing down. She is unreliable! Her role was incredibly small! How did she do it on the cover! IMDb does not even mention it in her filmography. This movie was so bad, we made a small note to the video store when we returned it and slid it in. It read something like "please rescue your other customers to have to view this complete and completely wrong movie!"
