As Irish critics scare this movie is behind me. Crossed by the usual group of Irish actors, they drew for every Irish film. A horrible script with forced characteristic expressions (brown sauce). Romantize everything that's bad in Dublin. The attitude "ah, it's a landfill, but it's definitely not great." Lots of tidbits purely for the American audience (supermarket boss and his terribly forced catchphrase). And the nail in the coffin was the character of Colm Meaney. A great actor forced to play this part, which could be written by a five-year-old. Cringeworthy things. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's bad when you have to say it. Well, at least he did not make his terrible American accent. The international audience will be warned: Stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You'll have better time. A pause is a walk outside
