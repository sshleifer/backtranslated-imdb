From time to time in Indian cinema, the film comes as Sholay, which changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. A day only once in a while (hopefully) we have RGV ki Aag, which breaks all standards and creates one of its own. Standard so low that it can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish that is so static and feel him from afar. To take the classic as Sholay and murder, it's totally unforgivable, and I can not believe he almost called RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had many folk elements in it, the film managed to build on his plot by defining the characters so significantly that they lived forever. What Aag does is to take these characters and brothel is so bad u'll need a competition to choose the worst. The element of realism is totally absent, and what ultimately brings the film is a bunch of "actors" who look at the plot and seemingly unrelated set of events. One star of this movie is a ridiculous loss of votes. his time for RGV to awaken the reality of his failure and to conjure up another "other" plot that can be divided into cinemas.
