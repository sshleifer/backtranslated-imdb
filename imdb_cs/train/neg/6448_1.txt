An unknown creature is the right word for this movie. Or should be called Unknown Movies. This movie is from the beginning a piece of crap. It has a really silly "plot", a really pathetic "acting" and so-so "special effects". Some thirty-year-old "post-adolescents" are trapped in a forest with a mad creepy shape of a rubber suit that lurks indefinitely. What you have with this movie is a lot of short stories and precious little action. You have girls walking through the woods and talking, and then you have boys (with heavy mascara) walking through the woods. The whole thing is so boring! <br /> <br /> The very same creature is seldom seen for most of the movie. When pictured, the image is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and motion shows it to be a suit, and is therefore the cause of blur and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie in ANY from the word and those who praised it are most likely people who were exported from the street to "act" in this really shy movie! Skip it for sure!
