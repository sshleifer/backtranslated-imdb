That's absurd - except for the Australians who have reevaluated this movie, I can not help, but I think that everyone else who has done so has been involved in Electry's production in some way, considering how generous they were with their praise. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely not a fan of comic book conversion, so I did not expect much, but I still found Elektra incredibly stunning. The thing that prompted me most was the fact that in this movie, which was inexplicable, was such that he let you think "what is the meaning of the plot?" or "how did this aspect of character appear?" I can only hope that these are things that may be somewhat explained in Daredevil, which I do not intend to see. Besides, it seems that the behavior of the characters in this movie is about the face of random moments to suit the story, and I do not even start with a totally senseless romantic conspiracy. I, too, scratch my head at the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, which seems totally inexplicable. If I can give this movie for nothing, I have to be a fantastic location where it was shot, but otherwise I got a little enjoyment from Elektra. I know we should stop our distrust of fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confusing (even under action film standards) that it just made me frustrated. hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn well.
