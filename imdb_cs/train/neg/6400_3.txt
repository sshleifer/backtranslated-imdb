The Pryor and Gleason comedies could not save the dog from the thin constipation, the weak screenplay, the furious acting, and the sad continuity of editing this mess. It has very few memorable moments, but the well quickly dries. As a child, I remember it as a Luke-warm vehicle for two actor-comedians, but there was always something strange about the flow and feel of what was being transmitted in each scene, and how it worked with the venue overall. He follows it after many years, shouting schlock-a-mania. I'm not so worried about racial disagreement, because I would not mind seeing a movie levitating a little bit about this issue. The most obvious mistake is that the scenes are deployed as a mixed, unrelated series of two-minute comic bits (which are not very good in that case) that were published after all, through a local irrigation hole. Characters change feelings and motives to a dime without rhyme and reason, between scenes and scenes, which makes feeling like no one has an idea of ​​what to get from the script. Not that it started. I feel bad about the two actors whose heritage is being destroyed by this catastrophe, which should never be done. Maybe my sense of humor is too good ...
