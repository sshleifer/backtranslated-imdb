I realize that this is not a BSG and can handle slow shows if they are interesting, but I have found myself totally uninterested and bored with this series. The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Conclusion + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Capric seems to be: Bland Drama + Modern Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it will be more interesting , but from Episode 3 I can hardly follow her. In fact, it's at the bottom of my watch list. That's a sad state of affairs. The Syfi Channel really destroyed their Friday night set. What happened to the famous days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? There was a good thing there.
