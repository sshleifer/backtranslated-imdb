There are plenty of pretty women in this picture. But unfortunately, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. One story of this movie takes place in 1971. Why are they the heirs of Kia Sportage? Hi? Continuity, someone? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it's the worst effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if anyone did this job, but there was no 3D, just a blur of double vision. I did not have the same problem with other 3D movies of this company, THE SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, 3D in those that were getting in, but with them I saw a 3D effect. This is a big ball of no use. And whoever the women who played the daughter of a hearing lady! I would like to see her more. Also in movies. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
