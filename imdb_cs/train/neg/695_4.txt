I've heard so much about this movie as it was a great slasher and one of those 80's movies that dying hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see. I managed to rent it and I must say that although I kept my attention with regard to the strain on most films such as "Fool's Day," "Friday 13" and "Prom Night", this film could be the right one with the above mentioned only lacked the true enthusiasm and potential of the characters, as well as the ongoing story. The characters I found were unfortunate to be in this movie a strange frizzy hairy guy who was still crawling around the track and of course leading to her real climatic role at the end with the killer facing. Another would be the dirty guy with a robe who could play more roles in this movie that could make the film more interesting, instead of playing this guy like another loser who made an unknown call there while sleeping with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts it down to the end that was waste, I was disappointed with his part at the end. As for the true identity of the murderer, when the identity was released, who became, I just laughed but it was all obvious and he really made a real blockbuster of himself, just as the annoying figure after his real intentions were revealed. This movie should be such as to watch at least once for all fans of the slasher, but do not make the hard earned money in it in some rare hard to find inventory collectors.
