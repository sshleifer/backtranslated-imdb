Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, fifth installment in the Nightmare series on Elm Street and the worst sequel, even worse than the Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box for me my birthday and I followed all the sequels. The baby dream was undoubtedly the worst, I was surprised also because it was so good with both lasts. But I think they just lost the spell, the story was just horrified, and I was not happy where it was. Alice has become much more annoying, it's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her own movie did not work for me. Freddy is also losing fear, this is just a little stupid. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she's carrying a baby, she could not be happier with her life. But Freddy is back too, and he will not be too light for her because she so easily defeated in the fourth film. But he still wants his child and is born again in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy is also a parent? So that's what the Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Baby is investigating, and Alice soon finds out what Freddy's childhood was and that maybe it's the only thing that can defeat him. Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Child is just a bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone could be content with this sequel. Just the story was really stupid, I think it might work, but it was just wrong. I know that if you look at the sequel to Nightmare on Elm Street, you should watch it, but I really do not recommend it, it's not for me, at least in my opinion. <br /> </ p> <p> 3/10
