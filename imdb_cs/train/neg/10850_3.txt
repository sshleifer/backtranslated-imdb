This movie has several things that are going directly from the bat. Dani Filth as the lead actor will automatically make some people like this movie. True, I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack of this movie long before I watched him. Dani Filth is a very recognizable figure and makes a great lead. The film's independent movie style is great for a ghostly factor. In this film are some actresses GORGEOUS. Because the budget is low, the special effects are not bad. The ways in which people died were very creative and spooky. <br /> <br /> There is very little in the whole movie. It is hard to fear the lives of still, static characters. When there was a little talk, the F bomb was abundant, jumping in random places. Yes, I understand that people are swearing, but it seems like this is a preteen boy who wrote it and thought he was fine because it included the whole language. The story, what I could do was quite good, although many parts remain hanging and the lack of conversation leaves a person who is often interested in what's going on. In the end, Cradle of Fear is porn for people who love sex and violence but porn as they try to make a plot, it just does not work well. Rent it if you are a morbid person who wants to endure your blood and a meat taste.
