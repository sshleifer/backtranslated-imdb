Paul Naschy made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to indivisible baskets; and unfortunately, the horror of tombstones is closer to the other. This conspiracy is just your average story of a witch, a wizard or (as is the case here) a warlock that is killed, but not before I swear revenge over those who did it ... etc etc. Then we get sans and one thing leads to another, and the soon-to-be-executed warlock does not stand. The story is slow, painfully boring, and the movie is constantly unnecessary. Characters capture the bells of diatribe and never give the film any way. Paul Naschy wrote a screenplay, and if you asked me, he should hold talks because the dialogue is justified in the extreme sense and serves only to make the film even more boring than it is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy's Blue Eye from Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil, provides a dark direction that loves dialogue that does nothing to help film. Sometimes bullshit movies like her have some charm around them; but the horror of the grave does not even have it. It's a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest.
