I was fascinated by how bad this movie was. Should the viewer learn something or think about something here? What was the pumpkin? Should I have been hit by motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on the roof over the hotel? Why the narrator fails to mock the people he conducts with the conversations (it is so obvious that he has given himself really informative parts of his conversations to get a mockery). The best part of the film was an interview with a film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be before it's done. <br /> <br /> I am really impressed. I believe the creator is trying to become an intellectual or trying to impress an intellectual community.
