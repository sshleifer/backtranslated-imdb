Everything you need to know about this movie is happening in the first five minutes: it looks great, it has a solid original soundtrack reflecting the late 1960s and all but a few of its characters are dissimilar. Once you get this message, you can switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Davies ignores her beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in her life who cares about her. Until the moment she takes her advice to join her in the real world - instead of living a fantastic film about which he is the director, he does so by pulling her away and joining an actress who is ideally understands. The couple laughs and some artistic thoughts are the only thing worth watching. The film is also interesting as documentation of the fall of Jason Schwartzman of Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's unpleasant bratriness was something to overcome, but here is his only quality. Schwartzman's family connection clearly landed him in this role; here I hope his decision will improve.
