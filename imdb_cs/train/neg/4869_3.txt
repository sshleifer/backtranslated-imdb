This film failed to explore the humanity of the animals that left me feeling empty inside. [Spoiler Forward] I was not convinced Dr. D had a really compelling reason to avoid buying a big deal to help his hairy friends. While the Babe (the original) brought the trend of big budget hits by focusing on the human abilities of animals and their human counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than a comic cartoon one would like in the masses- (even if a man understand their absurd stupidity). Without Eddie Murphy's behavior, this movie would become a flop.
