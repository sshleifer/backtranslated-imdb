This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Avengers held this dubious honor? but no longer. The performer in "Jill Ripper" is terrible and was just overwhelmed by a conspiracy. This film is as intellectually stimulating as Telletubbes. He does not know whether he wants to be a S & M movie or a really bad thriller. Watch only for extreme intoxication, or if you are absorbed in bed and need distraction from your skin. This script should be redesigned in porn, it would not be too much effort and it should have a longer life. Porn, even poor porn, would not do any harm to Dolf Lundgren's career in the way that this movie has.
