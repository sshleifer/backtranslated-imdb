After reading reviews, it turned out that everyone was intelectualizing this work. How absolutely boring. Oh, what about good days and nothing like that. Of all the comments, no one has expressed any emotions about this or any other work. I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematographic jewel, along with Dan'l Boone, was decorated with the Saturday afternoon of the matin√©es. It was an annual film that made wheels and filled the seats with gabbing, shouting, farting, giggling, blind monsters like myself or myself. And at that time it was a cinematic filler. Almost as big as a wizard from Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that each critic contains something about a conspiracy. The problem was that it was rather a template. Here it goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and defeats the bad guys. Hurray! <br /> <br /> We all found the land before we took the neighborhood down to look at it. It was just about Scott's, John Wayne and Roy Rogers's scripts. If you have time to come back and check every movie - just do not ask for surprise. <br /> <br /> One must remember the context of the time. There was no or little television. None for children. There was a school there. It was great outside. There were the weapons. No Time Cyber. And the age of steam has just collapsed. But such films provided fun and filled the imagination of young fools. Even the girls got into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was fun. And he is as soulless as something that is being made today. She had originally intended to be propaganda. But we soon got into the movies for kids. <br /> <br /> Our fathers have experienced the real thing. And it was not until Sam Peckinpah, ten years later, in a realistic and large number of times struck a red splatter of imitation blood. Only when his headquarters did not die slowly, with great pain and pain. Until the Peckinpah War and the Weapons were more bloodless. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To see that the film had little or no blood, the adults did not mind. I do not think they tolerate it. No entrails that would spray the broken plants. So this movie had all the glory and none of that horror. Gung Ho was suitable for children. <br /> <br /> You will see that I have given this rating four. Why would I do that? Good. It's a terrible movie. No matter how I like it. I love this movie because it brought back one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But it's not all good for the movie in terms of quality. In essence, Gung Ho went on to become a novel for children. <br /> <br /> People should watch it. Of course. I'm not saying I'm going away. Realistically however. The data is simple. The figures are shallow? they are beautiful. You can love a bad movie.
