There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are fun. "Criminally Insane 1" was one of those films. It was so bad that it was pleasant, and he was careful again. "Criminally Insane 2" must be one of the worst movies ever made and they come from me, which says a lot, because I'm not the kind of guy who says everything is the worst. But believe me, it was totally awful and running only 1 hour is too long 1 hour. The movie has a rather incoherent story, but who cares about the story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because it is not fed. Well, in this movie you can not see it, except for all the sequences of memories that are from the first. The new story could be really fun when Ethel was sent to the middle of the house and murdered everyone there, but nothing has happened until the last 20 minutes of the movie, and then you will fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera works in this movie just ugly. It literally reminds me of something I made with my friends back when I was 15. The quality of the sound is something different because you can not understand the word most of the characters say. To show how bad it is, go to the New York Underground and try to understand what is being said through loud speakers, that's what this movie sounds like. Not that it was up to what he was talking about because the actors are as dry as the dead piece of wood. Now I know this is the worst movie that is quite harsh, but the words can not doubt the bad thing this movie is. If you do not believe me, look at yourself. 1/10
