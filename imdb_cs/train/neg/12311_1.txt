I know I've already added a comment, but I just wanted to make something clear ... I'm not an old fog from Generation Baby Boom that grew stuck to a blinking black and white image by Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. <br /> <br /> it was 20 years before I was born but I was delighted to discover Phil Silver's Bilko with the kind permission of BBC2. I wonder if I would enjoy Steve Martin when I did not see or hear about Phil Silvers - I do not know - maybe I should. Some other reviewers who think this movie are worthy of "10" admit that they have not seen the original. I can only ask you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching one episode. If after watching the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and more, you still think that Steve Martin's movie is just above the "2" pint ....
