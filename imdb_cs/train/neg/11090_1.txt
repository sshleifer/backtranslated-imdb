This movie looks like it was made for television. I've been waiting for years to come up with a movie about Rubin Carter because I liked to see him on the old MSG and I saw this movie was a very disappointing one. I had a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but it was awful and tedious. There is nothing good to say about this film, except I like a song.
