Now they will not deny that when I bought this off eBay, I had great expectations. It was an incredible out-of-print job from a comedy I like so much. But I was soon disappointed. I apologize to those who enjoyed it, but I just found Compleat Al, which is very difficult to follow. I had some smiles, of course, but most of the fun came from musical videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was basically filling. It could be said that it was not Al's biggest video success (that's the honor for the UHF). Frankly, I doubt if it ever makes a jump on DVD, so if you're a fan of ultra-hardcore Al and you just have to own everything, buy an eBay cassette. Do not pay too much.
