Many days after I saw the Conducting Ada, I am still amazed that every group of people would have spent so much time doing such a shameful movie. No one should see this film in the hope of learning about the consequences of Ade Lovelock, her colleagues or the products of her efforts. Likewise, no one should see this movie in the hope that they enjoy themselves. As a science fiction film, it would undoubtedly mean a terrible failure. Somehow the main character can bring the past to life and communicate with her on a personal computer - with advice and encouraging words by Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone can stop their mistrust enough that it may not be totally absurd. A dramatic film would undoubtedly mean a terrible failure. Somehow, the writer / director manages to fill eighty five minutes with a constant, useless, unpleasant and trivial drama, basically nothing. I doubt anyone can feel that all the dramas in the film are just as irritating distractions. It seems difficult to fully express my contempt for Ada's conception. The conditions I've seen have prevented me from leaving the theater, but there is no doubt that I would not. I'm still upset that I spent the time it took me to see him. Only the fact that I can more effectively criticize this film, I wish I was more committed.
