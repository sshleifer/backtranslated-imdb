Robert Forster, normally a very strong actor, is lost at sea here as a family man from New York who is trying to avenge the brigadier who murdered his son and attacked his wife during a domestic invasion. A frightening subject used for cheaper excitement in the "Death Wish" vein. It is not difficult to mock at these outrageous talks: the dialogue is full of warriors, crime statistics are irrevocably dated, and supportive characters are ridiculously overwritten (especially a shameful judge who allows accused murderers to go right to the courtroom). Low-priced production is contemptuous in its own justice, especially when violence in our cities has only increased. * z ****
