Wow, it was a very bad movie ... as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they might have some sort of script, but it's difficult to say based on the actual result. <br /> </ p> <p> The editing of this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything that would help the viewer to determine what is actually going on. is just a low budget zombie that has not been thinking at all, has bad behavior, bad dialogue, bad everything. The only thing that saves this movie from 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think it must be where they spent all the money they had to try to justify. </ P> <br /> <br /> If you are (like me) determined to find and watch all the zombie flicks you can find this one. Time.
