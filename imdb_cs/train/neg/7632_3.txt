Many people consider it a classic, but of course I did not want something. Life in Anarne in Texas at the beginning of the 1950s is rather dull - meaning that the film about life in Anarene, Texas, in the early 1950s will be quite dull! What do so many people see? As soon as the last picture in Anarene shows up, there really will not be anything in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) will do this at the end of the movie. But before it closes, there's not much work, so basically everything turns around sex. High school students are making plans to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some equally boring adults in the city. You see, there is not much for them - except for sex (sometimes with you and sometimes with boring teenagers), or to hover over the local football team of high school. Three times something happened that I thought he would add a spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), but nothing really happens because Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) takes a little girl, but nothing really it happened because of it. The only thing that added something dramatically significant to the movie came to a close with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) who really points to the emptiness of life in this poor town as men stand around and look at the body to go to breakfast. Peter Bogdanoviƒç made it in black and white, which was meant to point out how gray this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors such as Dno, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (It was terrible to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character cousin Eddie in the films National Lampoon Vacation). I do not think so! 3/10
