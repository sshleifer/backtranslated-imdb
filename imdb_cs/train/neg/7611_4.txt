The first tracked 2/28/2006 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I watched with the title "3 Days Condor" - So a CIA drama full of relaxed performances makes for a very quiet movie. The assumption of the story revolves around 7 of the 8 members of the CIA research group who were killed with the character of Robert Redford, codename = Condor, who was the one who remained. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford tries to find out when he tries not to be the eighth victim at the same time. On the way, she plays Faye Dunaway, originally because she needs a place to hide, and then helps him after a little love time. This is one of a handful of innocent guy on the story but he does not have too much tension. Flat performance does not help, and finalization does not end the deal for the audience either. Despite a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, the story and the show are not what they should be, and therefore the film is not as it should be.
