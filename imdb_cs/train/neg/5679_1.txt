I was so concerned about the real thing at the beginning of the movie that I felt bad about my stomach and finally turned off the movie. How can someone give this movie more than just one tosser. I know the purpose of the film is to shock but to show the real shots of a dog that was spiced alive (stick to vomit as I write) - PLEASE! After the scene, I upset my baby. Mostly I had my eyes covered. No wonder this film was found in a commodity basket in HMV. I really do not have any desire to see any other film of this personality Uwe. Everyone who enjoys it needs therapy. Time.
