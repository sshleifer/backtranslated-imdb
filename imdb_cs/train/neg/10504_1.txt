I could not watch for more than 14 minutes. It's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad direction. The used shots are disgusting, they break through 180 degrees all the time. My headache is trying to track this "you know what" load. The dirt in the "mysterious machine" window lets you see the light from the windows ... unpleasant. What else ... it's so framed that it's just that you want to scream at the lady who leads there. I only directed short films, but I'm sure I would be much better than directing a feature film ... the story is incredible, just a long French kissing scene at the beginning tells you it will be terrible. So, try to avoid these really bad movies at any cost, it saves you about $ 5 for rent, and you will never return in an hour of your life ...
