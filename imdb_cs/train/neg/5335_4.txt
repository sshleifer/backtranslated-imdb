Since I've seen this comedy, it was looooonnnggg time, and I forgot how silly it is. I should easily put it in two to three of Elvis Presley's worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a field breed of an Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and the broken hut where his family lives and where his friends love party all night. His parents play Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of them offers anything that could be comic or otherwise. The government invested in family cattle but lacked a bull. Elvis sings only a few utterly worthless songs and is chased by a young man - a mad gal and a mother. This is a real flutter mess, and the dilapidated environment practically smells dung and does not make it much easier. The only thing that guessed me was that Elvis actually seems to have a good time in the movie. It's hard to believe because he realized he was so upset that he was stuck in filming so many media films.
