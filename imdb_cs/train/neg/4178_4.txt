Man is in the most remote places of the earth and is now traveling to new worlds. But with the new worlds, the ancient evils ... the vampires of the universe. And not just the hand, but the whole tribe. In this movie (which I saw as "Bloodsuckers," but I think it's also "Vampire Wars"), we see what happens when the imperialists die with imperial vampires. because it's not really a good review. The best thing I can say for this movie is that it has a good cast of b-list and upcoming stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana and was much more appealing than in "Bloodrayne 2". Michael Ironside is Muco and is always a favorite fan (as I say, it's Jack Nicholson). And we'll even get Carrie-Ann Fleming as "Damian's wife," whom now horror fans recognize as Jenifer's Jenifer of the same name Daria Argenta. So this movie, as bad as it is, is not without some names attached ... but the same can be said about Uwe Boll's work. The concept of military surveillance and killing of vampires in space <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not necessarily a bad idea, Negotiations, especially from vampires, are over the top, and I simply have not found the explanation of their existence very convincing. The worst of all is that the vampire tribes have the names "Voorhess" and "Leatherface". I understand it was supposed to be a smart link for horror fans, but it was not clever. It sounded just stupid and in place (as opposed to the much smoother references in James Gunn's "Slither", such as the names of shops by lesser-known horror directors). That's all I want to say. If you can endure a lot of cheeses (this day I could not and I was from Wisconsin) and would like to see average actors with poor costumes fighting vampires in space (although "space" looks a lot like any other forest on earth) check this out if you will find it. I do not want to personally recommend it when you can watch other sweet vampire movies (Vampires Jon Carpenter) or other space movies. Or maybe some good. But, hey, do your thing.
