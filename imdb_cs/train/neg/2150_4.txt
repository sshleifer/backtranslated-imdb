You instantly know the plot. The daughters of the divorced couple are trying to take Mum and Dad again. Yes, it was the theme of parental trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's a creepy thing. Although Deanna Durbin was a younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills while playing small daughters, Durbin looks much older than in adults. And so do all her so-called siblings. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between an adult and a child manifests itself throughout the movie. The girls are dressed in cute little naval suits, but look ridiculous in them, because the director seems to have pain indicating that they have enough peaks and tones throughout the movie. So you are constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start to "beat" them, you feel as if they were pedophiles, and you could also be one to notice the tuxes and peaks the director pointed out. Teens or temptations, little girls or little foxes, you are never quite sure what you should think about them. As a parent, she also seems very old and the whole movie seems very dated. <br /> <br /> It's a rusty version of the parental trap and you should avoid it or at least ensure that your tetanus shots are up to date if you do not believe me.
