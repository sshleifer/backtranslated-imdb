Well, I think I must be the one who says, "The Emperor does not wear." When I saw this show for PBS last night, I was both hopeful and worrying. I loved Morse (even so far as to buy a complete DVD set) and felt that when I always liked Kevin Whately Sgt. Lewis character, show WAS John Thaw, season! After watching the new Lewis Inspector, I'm convinced that I was right ... Everywhere is fine (though it looks terrible (both bad and too fat), but it just does not have a charisma that would take the show as Thaw did. And as for his "helper" Fox, well ... maybe that the reviewers from England can understand what he says, but I can not usually either. <br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... all I can say is that I miss James Grout. I'm sorry to have left "Morse" resting in peace.
