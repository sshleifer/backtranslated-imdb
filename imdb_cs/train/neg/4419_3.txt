Like an "abandoned Catholic," who had 11 years of Catholic school, but was not 35 years old, except for weddings and funerals, I thought I could kick it out. And I did it. . . for the first two thirds of the movie. They were all standard things - strict school teachings, suppressed sexuality, etc. But suddenly the film was shot. It really means. Now you think so, I saw it before the scandals of pedophilia hit. . . and perhaps I would not be so offended by such ugly, hateful disasters at the Catholic Church if I knew of those abominations (such a Catholic term!) and fears. a couple of years since I leased the video and I will not go back to rent again with a new perspective. She left me so dirty, ugly, ugly taste in my mouth. . . I wonder what experience all the actors have with the Church, for they really * hate or redeem themselves for payment. It is an incredibly anti-Catholic film, offensive to anyone who has a glimpse of respect for Catholic education. I still do, because there were no better teachers in the 1950s. No matter what these nuns did, they forced me to learn to read and write the English language. We've remembered it. (How many children can make a simple arithmetic today?) The truth is that there is nothing more to America's success. Can you read? Can you add / subtract / multiply / subdivide? Great. You can get any advanced level you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will be in a good position not only because you will continue studying but for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the Catholic "mythology" that we all had to learn. > <br /> Such a great cast, such a dirty, corrupt script. I really feel bad (and no, it's not "bad" - believe me I was tutoring better for my writer and director). I thought I had mixed emotions about the Catholic school. But the participants in this project had to be the bad (ie, stupid) children sitting in the back of the room if they were willing to get involved in filming this movie.
