This movie looked better than it was. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue was not too stiff ... but about twenty minutes there is this long scene with a doctor who you know is really a patient in the asylum pretending to be a doctor - and it goes just south from there. <br /> <br /> In addition, the demon is the deepest looking hellspawn of the Godzilla-looking thing in Curse of the Demon. There are also strange believing demons who wear masks that look like exploding teenagers from the beginning of Logan's run. Finally, the film could not save the movie. In spite of some pretty full performances, the story does not go on anywhere. I think Hellbored would be a better title.
