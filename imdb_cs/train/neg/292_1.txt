I saw it by chance when I saw on the cable I liked it because I thought Sandra was absolutely funny of what I remembered. The only movements on my face that I had throughout the film were the jaw that fell amazingly to how terrible the film I just suffered. The person who said it was one of the funniest movies of all time, please show one line, just one scene that even deserves laughter. She's a much better singer than I remember being, but I did not want to look at the lounge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie that's hard to fit because they think they should not and objectively not see it.
