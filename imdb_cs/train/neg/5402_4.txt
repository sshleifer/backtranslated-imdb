This movie is so incredible; - the whole assumption is a bunker; the fact that a serial killer (a vampire or otherwise) could fly around an unprepared and kill as many people as the film suggests is ridiculous. The Vampire himself would not have loved Bela Lugosi. Most of the acting is so wooden, actors should be treated for dry rot. I'm waiting for the day someone makes a decent film from Steven King's novel (except in the case of Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most of Stephen King's films do - lack of money used for "special" effects, poor actors, alert characterization and dialogue. This movie is inexpensive, sticky and fails in everything she's trying to do.
