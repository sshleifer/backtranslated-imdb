Normally, I'm quite happy to like low-cost gonzo movies, but Darkman III is so terribly impartial that I feel nothing but contempt. It looks like it looks like a television show and a particularly awkward one in it. The files are sparse, flat lighting, the scene and the effects are divided, and the camera is a film school 101. There is no plot they speak of, the characters are one-dimensional and the actors are sleepy. Most casting looks like they should make fine kernel porn ... In fact, the only reward I got from this mess, seeing the surprising idea that Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) was facing without her Klingon bumpy head. Her skin tone is about two shades lighter than Voyager; either it was selected for this role, or it was obscured for Voyager. It's very strange.
