I see where a couple of people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their story page, and I thought what they wrote was useful to understand. The fact that it basically came up with excuses - transcripts, budget cuts, production formats, etc. - simply highlights how bad the film is. And my criticism in the rhythm is not personally focused, but it's just a warning that it does not cut. It's observable, but hardly. In every corner there are holes in the plot, the boundaries of dialogue are ridiculous and the end is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of the hologram that works with the reconstructed team is drowned in a silly dialogue like the one who makes food in the midst of a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Could you bail us out with a helping hamburger Sally, killed by these automated carpets? Apparently, this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubular miraculous armor does not have access to MREs. Once they reach the last room, they are treated to a four-star motel rather than a wounded area. <br /> <br /> The reason for meeting the menacing tower is that it can not be killed with one hand. Just before one scene, the hero who left the case did just that. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and improved the best acting character in the movie. But he does not say much.
