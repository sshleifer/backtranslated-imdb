This is the best way I can describe this film, which focuses on a newly married couple moving to a house that is haunted by the first wife of her husband who died under mysterious circumstances. It sounds good and good, but what's playing is an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things about this movie is that at the beginning of the movie there is a warning that promises a free coffin to anyone who dies out of fear. Well, believe me, nobody cares about this offer unless someone is scared of plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and doors. And the music is the worst, it consists of a constant tube of music that sounds like some sixth grader. And you find a terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie think. Someone dies while running and hitting his head, and the police are never called to investigate. Yes, in the end, it's a slow pace (which is really bad because the movie is just over an hour), a boring little story that is easily found by the average person. It seems that none of the characters in this picture were an average person.
