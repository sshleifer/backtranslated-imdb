After watching the first 20 minutes of Blanche (I'm sorry I could not take it anymore) I've already confirmed that not. <br /> <br /> This "film" is basically an insult to real French actors who are involved in this fake piece of junk mail. Based on the concept successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moines quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with an anachronistic tone / dialogues. It can give great results if supported by brilliant actors and "softness" in order to avoid dreaded "heavy comedy" stigma. Unfortunately, horse-facing Lou Doillon destroy everything and Blanche, instead of comedy, just turns into a horror movie. Horror to movie fans who want to be confused and shocked by looking at subtle actors such as Decaune, Earth or Rochefort who fight in the middle of this crazy burly kitchy-prissy farce.
