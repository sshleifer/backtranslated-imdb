Freedom's "Speedy Gonzalez" Freedom's was the second cartoon character of Robert McKimson's "Cats for Two" title. In this cartoon, Speedy was a nasty small figure with a large gold tooth, but in his second look the famous design was already accepted. Despite looking much nicer, Speedy never evolved into a lot of character. The big hat, the tremendous speed and the bad Mexican accent do not have a classic character, and that's almost everything Speedy ever went for him. However, the harsh little mouse turned out to be immensely popular and began to play in many short films, including some really horror films from the last days of studying. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which they were often (somewhat odd) paired with Daffy Duck, they still kept many desirable, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar pattern of persecution. In this episode, Speedy takes some other mice to steal cheese from a local factory that has become a Sylvester cat patrol. Although it adds extra weight to the cartoon star, the role of Sylvester could easily be filled with any other generic cat. His personality is weakened by being forced into predictable. undemanding role of persecutor. Tweety's cartoons have always been a problem, but Speedy makes even a more complicated opponent because of his fiery crispness and the obvious impossibility of capturing him. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear next to Speedy for many years to come. Despite a very nice pattern and minimal laughter, Speedy Gonzalez won an Oscar and a deep star appeared on the birthday party.
