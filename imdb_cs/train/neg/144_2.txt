There is no way to describe how really, really, really bad this movie is. It's a pity that I actually sat in this movie, this very tiring and predictable movie. What's wrong with that? They perform: There is no performance that is even far removed from being even sub-par (at least they are all very nice). Soundtrack: "If we get Orgy on the soundtrack, then everyone will know they're watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Well, but someone with the keyboard can do a good soundtrack these days. Do not even start on "What the hell?" There are several times: The killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens the actress, nobody is there, turns around, sits in front of him; From the time the killer appears with power, it's really great! Filmmakers get points for being involved at least, but I can really believe that the killer has taken the time to find an electrical outlet to get her involved. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and I mean, "Where did you get a drill?" I could go on and on, how bad this movie is, but I have only 1000 words. I'll give 2 out of ten stars. One star that made me laugh and another star for everything. Seriously, do not waste time with this.
