What has Martin Scorcese owned to film this film? And not only did he change it, he completely destroyed it? The unreasonable decision to make the character Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance, and it says a lot) into religious fanaticism is ridiculous and exemplary attitudes that Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorcese) occupy - the attitudes that forced writers to think, that the best way to make a mad character is to tattoo on his wing. In any case, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br />
