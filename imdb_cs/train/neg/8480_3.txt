I can not say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. But then I can not say again that it's one of the worst I've ever seen. Ok, so it's basically a girl doing skating, she's good at it, she wants to go to an expensive school, she can not afford it, and she has to take a hockey scholarship. He has to hide secret skating from his friends. <br /> <br /> I personally did not like the actress playing Katelin. Absolutely she could not cry to save her life, only furiously sounded like a backpacker who pretended to cry to do it. Katelin was just an unpleasant man. The way she tried to treat all nice and helpful people. Also the part where both wheel brushes call her names, and they say something about her choreographer, and she says that "drawing a line" has made me taper. We all knew where to go with her and Spencer. They did not like the classic, and something together at the end was just typical. Overall, I think it's a movie that will watch if you like skating, but if you do not mind the main skater it is extremely annoying. It is good to kill time in essence.
