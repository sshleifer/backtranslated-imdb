They should probably call it The Map because most of the stupid film is rotating around the map of the cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring images on the map are. The only thing that shows more than the map itself is the small sweat beads that are constantly on the forehead of our main character. Of course, they were film makers of how to show us how incredibly tense things are going to the Immortal Hills cemetery. Come on now, could not they just show us one of the deadly scenes? We hear a lot about how everyone on the map looks like flies, but we do not see anything. Some of them, as I was Bury The Living, I managed to keep my attention, so I was very generous with the rating I gave her, but I do not recommend this movie to anyone. If you do not have a deep fascination with maps or sweat, I recommend renting better movies, such as I Spit On Your Tombs or Drink Your Blood.
