The DVD was a joke, the sounds of the first few minutes were horrible with the sound of synchronization and the Segals voice even its !!!! Pathetic! When sound synchronization was improved over 5 minutes, poor plot, lines and actors should get another job because the film store is not where someone should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had some good movies in the early days of the latest joke and should be an embarrassment to him and the company that did. If Segal was the one who cared for it, he would have better go back to the next show because he does not have as much talent as he is at this time. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete embarrassment for all who are involved in its production and the shame of all who have seen them. I turned it off in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask for money for Buster! Brand from Ontario, Canada
