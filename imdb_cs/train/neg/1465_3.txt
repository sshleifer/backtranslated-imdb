First of all, I would like to add that I myself am somewhat a historian, so what I'm looking for in a film based on historical events is that it is really based on historical facts. That does not apply. Make sure the movie is fun and everything except the fact that it is not entirely based on true facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for the Jews before the World War. It was, however, during World War I, and then formed its views on the Jews. His upbringing in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not disturbed by a small sprat. He had more or less normal upbringing. Nothing to mention about his lost brothers and other important works that are being added to Hitler. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he really does not fit into Hitler's role. Hitler was not so impossible and unstable when portrayed here. During his younger years he was a charismatic man who "manipulated" people with his spell. Its unstable behavior and furious explosions began at the time of the break of the war. I would like to see a film about Hitler's life, which is based on real historical facts rather than on allegations. I really hate when people point to an accusing finger like Hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint them as pure evil. It's much better to tell the story exactly the way it was for everyone to know how it was! Those who had this film had some research before doing this research. Because they do not even seem to know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march in Munchu, his shoulder was pulled from his socket. It gives you more to see a good document than to see it.
