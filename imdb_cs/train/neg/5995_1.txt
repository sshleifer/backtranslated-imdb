It's really a terrible movie. What they did was a television show that had never been aimed at young children and gave them treatment by George Lucas (ie, it destroyed her by bothering him to appeal to a younger audience). The Thunderbirds TV show was not exactly the most cerebral show, in fact it was pretty formulaic, but it was always nice to watch (especially when the models got blown up) and the voice cast was not too bad. <br /> <br /> It suffers from bad determination and misconduct (with remarkable exceptions like Sophie Myles as Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only cast members who have a sense of how to play their characters ) I would not allow Frakes direct traffic after this travesty. The whole point of the Thunderbirds was that it was the entire Tracy family and how they functioned as a disaster or rescue team involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste as an epidemic. <br /> <br /> I only give 1 out of 10 because zero rating is not supported.
