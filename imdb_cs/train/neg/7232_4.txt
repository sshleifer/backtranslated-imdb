I consistently enjoyed Bilal's graphic novel when he came out, and he was amazed when I saw a trailer for this film, and even more when I discovered Bilal himself was driving. The film, however, was a great disappointment. Visuals are not far from the rich and obscure texture of original works of art and the story is wrong. Bilal seems to have focused on the esoteric aspects of the graphic novel and does not do much work too. <br /> <br /> The most pleasant part of the original graphic novel was the relationship of friendship and hatred between Nikopol and Horus. Both were out of the right time and place, forced together by circumstances. Most were fun and appealing. Not here. Nikopol has no distinguishable person at all, and Horus is a pompous whim who just wants to lay down. Although the film is French, Horus may not be! <br /> <br /> We all saw the movies we enjoyed, but they would not answer for all, for some reason or for other reasons. I do not intend to recommend Immortella to anyone, except for any warning that you will not exceed your talent and resources. Bilal is a master story, but apparently is not a master of all visual media.
