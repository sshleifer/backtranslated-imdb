this film is simply one of the worst movies ever shot and is a condemnation of not only the British film industry, but also of talented hackers at work. Not only did the movie get into the mainstream, it also has good British actors, so what happened? I do not know and it simply does not do me enough to get involved in the discussion because the movie was so terrible that she did not deserve it at all. be warned and remain hell out of this waste. but obviously I need to write ten lines of text in this report so I can plot it in detail. Nob man sets up his evil friend and co-worker from his father's company, leading to a meeting with the Russian mafia, with raving accents and silly, very stupid plot / equipment. I had to ask for a refund, but she was still in shock from experience. if you want a good crime movie to watch the usual suspects or godfathers, what about the lock, stock ... this is the peak of the current British crime film .....
