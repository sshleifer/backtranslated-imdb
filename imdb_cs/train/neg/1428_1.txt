Although this film was shot before dogma emerged as the predominant method of the film, and surprised before the digital triumph began. You will get it. This masterpiece of 1991 clearly predicted this development. Corin Nemec is just great because he does not make the author and narrator well. The pace is slow but elegant because cinematography is so beautiful. Record it next time on Tv, because I guarantee you will never see the better nostalgia that will happen for TvV. Direct-to-video has never felt so good!
