Two things are good about this movie, these are two unknown celebrities. First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in the film, young and flexible, with the look that still surrounds her body, steals at the beginning, which is all she's in, and that's it. She, of course, is just starting out because her acting has improved with her other projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the score of then-famous composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what keeps this arson from getting one star ... yeah, I know one star is not much, but in this movie it there is plenty. The rest is just a stupid nonsensical horror of a pair of college students who try to clean the dorm, it's because it's torn that one by one they find themselves unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where it is. Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zunigou, then turn it off.
