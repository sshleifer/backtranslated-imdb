While "Santa Claus Martians" is usually referred to as one of the worst films ever made, this Mexican film of 1959 is so bad that it makes "SCCM" look like "It's a wonderful life." You have to wonder what people have been thinking about; it may have meant the allegory of the Third World about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nah. . . They were simply not very good. The same production company created an even more disturbing version of the "Red Riding Hood", in which the wolf is obsessed with our hero, unmistakable signs of pedophilia. (Maybe it was an inspiration for the "highway"). Back to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas is located in a satellite in a geosynchronous earth orbit (shades of "MST3K"); instead of elves, his toys are made by children selected from all over the world; and had top spy equipment to check which kids are naughty and nice. The result is like an Orwellian pearl shop. Just turn you away from Christmas forever. This and other films of Mexican children with low rents were given in English and spread in the USA in the early 1960s; no wonder that the 1960s became such a turbulent period in American history. Child boomers who were forced to endure these "family" films as children would be too excited to turn into a revolution.
