How many other fake films "slice of life" must be made? Let's hope it is not too much. Lifting Victor Vargas is a very confident attempt by director Peter Solett to get Hollywood attention. Overall nothing happened. What's wrong with this movie is that it ignores audiences and piles on every clich√© in the allegedly "playful" Hollywood independent production. It has to be a "real" camera "documentary style", except that no documentarist would shake the camera for the purpose ... <br /> <br /> It's "nervous" so do not waste time lighting the film. It's "hip", so let kids use bleeding words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... And so on, and so on. All you have is a very self-confident attempt at impressing on Hollywood that does not act on someone outside of a "exhausted" independent crowd that seems to be a massive response to every bad movie.
