I was an enthusiastic supporter of Hal Hartley because I saw his short "Surviving Desire" in high school and even then he was still absolutely undamaged by his incredibly great "Henry Foole". But this 10-year follow-up is not just unnecessary, it's shameful. After a cracked and rapid start, "Fay Grim" breaks into pseudo-intellectualism, flat boredom, and ultimately unwarranted - and undesirable - nihilism. And that's just a plot. Most of the new faces are equally frivolous and poorly developed as a film: one particularly flat nature ends at the end of half the time spent with the infamous Henry Foole, and that's his only spoken scene in the movie! Jeff Goldblum, a Fulbright agent, seems to be the only clear figure (Hartley certainly intended). So how did he go? ** SPOILER ** Dead, thanks to the bombing of a car that just makes this slightly natural Hartley's most violent film to date and the tone of everything wrong in a movie that's all wrong. for other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or it's Grim?), not to mention Fay herself ... Well, I do not threaten their fate, because the movie does a pretty good job, everything on its own (when it does not work with another a divinely inclined angle, which gives a disturbing impression that Hartley moves back from Autera to the cold student of the film). This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that is not good enough to enjoy its disorder. Instead, the self-perturbing, typically, funny puzzles of his director into a "real world," one worse and worst than necessary, but not nearly ugly, or enough to get close to having something to say. In this way Hartley follows all my memories of these people and the amazing world he originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been so depressing in movies and I count "Leaving Las Vegas," which has at least developed new new characters that we grew larger than we destroyed, instead of instantly ignoring characters that are already loved.
