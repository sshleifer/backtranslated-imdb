This comedy is not really fun. It's a romance that plays so many stereotypes, it has no impact. It's a caper film so inferior - yes, even then - it has no trouble. Cast is adequate. More than that is hard to say. However, what's nice is that players are not familiar. MGM should be played by Robert Montgomery. The wife of an entrepreneur who does not have time to do anything but work could be any number of actresses. We can be grateful that this little known movie is a popular artist who is mostly unknown today. And the production values ​​are not terrible. However, this does not imply any real impression. <br /> <br /> It's a general knockout. Who wants it?
