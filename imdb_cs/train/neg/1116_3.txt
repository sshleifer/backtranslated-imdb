It seems that this film was at the school for the Coppola family. It does not seem to know if "A" or "B" is to be Western. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God. William Boyd must rotate in the grave. <br /> <br /> All the Western cliches "B" are here. A twin-marble, pearly toothed hero in a white hat with a trusty stitch ("C'mon Thunder"), all in a black bearded villain, a hero in distress, a ranch in trouble, a cowardly sheriff, over the top of bad guys, etc. <br /> <br /> The performance, except for a few exceptions, is from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) Like a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) Like villains they seem to be more at home in the thirty-year-old Poverty Row quickie. Adding cast veterans Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a bit, but they do not get enough to save this. <br /> <br /> What was the reason Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing the sequence? Do we have to believe the character of Sheen was a spirit? What was the purpose of black gloves? It simply does not make sense. Being a great lover of westerners of all genres, I tried to find some redemption in this movie. The cinematography was pretty good and the settings looked very authentic. In addition to the hero and the main villain, the other characters looked authentic. If the producers wanted to resurrect the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they might think it would render it the way it was originally written - the dirty ranch's hand with the lace on the shoulder, the kind of Lee Marvin's work would excel. What else could I say, but on Thunder, the big man.
