A boring childish fantasy that gives Joseph Plowright a stellar bill, but has nothing to do with it. Sappy kids watch their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballet and baseball player (yuk), while best friend Hazel runs for mayor --- she's 13! Completely pedestrian in all directions, plus increased inertia of syrupy performances by both girls and baseball boys. Definitely less effort for Showtime - no limits?
