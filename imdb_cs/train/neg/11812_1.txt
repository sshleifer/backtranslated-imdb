... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario watched at least two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centered third part of the film gave us a taste of what should come up with this extremely self-conscious disorder. Moretti says he needs to shoot this movie, but he does not want it while the viewer feels he should stick with it, but he really does not want to. The film about Italian politics and the election could be fascinating, but this is not the movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends face the headquarters of the Communist Party and discuss the interviews they are preparing to lead with party leaders inside, but for this film it is characteristic that none of them will ever see us. Interviews with Moretti's political debates are events that led to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movies with him and his child, and later with Pietro's child (the film stretches for several years and more than one polling period). We expect to see some definite sequence or argument, but they will never come. I doubt that I can have the patience to relive the film, Nanni Moretti. He succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like eternity.
