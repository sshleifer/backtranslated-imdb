I do not know where to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before putting her into another movie. Stephen Dorff appears to have been motivated by Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater walks through this stretch. Direction, editing, sound (we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of prosecution?), Costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them) and hey, there's no recognizable conspiracy. I am surprised that no one connected to the project stopped and said, "hey guys, it just does not make sense, let's start over again." Let's hope Slate's career can turn away from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Hand the worst movie I've ever seen.
