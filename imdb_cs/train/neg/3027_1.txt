If it smells like waste and if it looks like waste, it must be rubbish. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Bad Tony Scott's directorial style shamefully reminds of an uninteresting and slightly untrue story about Domino Harvey's life as a hunting hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing. Some aspects of the plot were ridiculous and unbelievable. All action scenes seem to be loosely connected with bad plot points and terrible gaming. Keira Knightley is getting naked in this. This is the only lead of this film. To see her naked just fast forward the film for up to an hour and a half into it and capture a lot of nipples. I strongly recommend that no one ever see this movie EVERY! </ 3
