In this movie, you know it's a movie that has six lab technicians in an enclosed lab with an invisible maniac. So you guess who lives and who dies. The remains will end exactly as you would expect them to be, so no conspiracy points are there. And if you're not sure if it's a B-movie or a movie that's just happening in a lavish talented lab that features William Devane: the immediate state of B-film. The film is promising at the beginning. In the lab, we are introduced to an invisible gorilla that is increasingly violent. Oooh, premonitions. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team sees the gorilla again. Great special effects. The same thing when Bacon makes invisible. There is a pair of bare breasts, a really chubby dirty joke and plenty of space to swear to get this movie an R rating they did not really need. There was no surprise for the thriller, except Shue does as MacGyver in the freezer, which is rather "Whaaaa?" OK, there is one surprise. That's when Caine (Bacon) returns last in the lift shaft. It was a surprise, but just because you're screaming on TV, "Noooo, you're dead! Shut the movie!" When we talk about shouting on television, that's all I've done in the last 25 minutes. "Put on f # @% ing glasses!" Instead of putting their infrared glasses in order to see it, they tried every other trick in the book (extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). The story really lost at the end. But the special effects were good; that's the only reason I gave her 2/10.
