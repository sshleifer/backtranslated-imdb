The only reason I gave him 1 out of 10 is the possibility that he will be given a zero of 10, forbidden. It was the biggest waste of time I've ever had. After about 75 minutes, you are exposed to the best acting activities (and I do not mean that in a good case, as in KILLER NERD, who had great horror acting) and a conspiracy that's not only ridiculous but also absolutely NEVER what to do with the massacre. The reason I arranged this kec was because he massacred the title. That means there was only one killing in the whole movie and it was pretty pretty. You have spent more time watching kids arguing and doing work in the yard than anything else. When we talk about children, a little boy is probably the most irritated child actor ever since the bob of the house in the cemetery. Did I mention that he was also filmed on a video? If you want to throw money and more than an hour of your life, then watch it all. But if you enjoy your heavily earned dollars and time, then go crazy as far as possible.
