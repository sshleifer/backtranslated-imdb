With Knightly and O'Tool as the lead, this movie had good options, and McCallum as a bad kid after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all out for a silly evening adornment, and then later with Maudlin warlike remnants. It was of course a superficial, beautiful English country and sea, or not. The worst mistake was that Knightly was filming so soon that he could easily play someone a few years older instead of choosing someone who is ten years older to play a role. They missed all the chances of a large conflict between casting, and instead foolishly pulled out the easy and inexpensive ring elements.
