Great cast. Great actress. Unpredictable story line for the first half hour. I really wanted to know what happened to each of these unforgettable characters and how their seemingly different lives would become interconnected. But <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I still thought it would be better, but it only got worse. Do not trust reviews. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise was ugly - why? Beautiful <br /> <br /> The boring bartender who wears the braces - why? I know it had to do with the venue, but without them at least one attractive member would have occupied it.
