There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already featured in the video. I try to balance myself in the overview because I strongly support local films, but I can not help, but I support resistance against this film. It is slow, boring and bordering on nonsense. Even "almost nice and believable moments" were instantly undercut by painful clich√©s and misconduct. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only passable in this film. It seemed to me that the director was trying to create a melodramatic TV soap, then took it away and decided to put it on a big screen. Leap Years should come with RA (Rated Awful), but I have not changed the faith in local movies. Other good movies will appear if no such movies are created.
