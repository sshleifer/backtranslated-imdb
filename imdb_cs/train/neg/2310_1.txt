It was a really insipid film. Performances are the third measure, and the dialogue is so cramped that sometimes it seems that it has just overturned and died. My reason to rent was simple: Find a movie with a script. I needed a visual aid for my presentation so I thought why not use a clip? The boy was wrong. After searching for my local video store I came across where it was suspected as "Starstruck". I thought, "What hey," and decided to try it. I was very dissatisfied with the results. There was perhaps one scene I could use, and I practically fell asleep because of total banality. So ..... I took it back and raised Ed Wood. It's a movie I can use as an example. And again, anything that could be presented in comparison to the disgrace that is "Starfucker".
