I think Elisabeth Rohm, though he can hardly try, is not at all good at all. I think it was because of the budget that she might have been the only one they could get for this prize. I looked mainly at the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. It was the most sincere and undoubtedly the most attractive. When he was not on the screen, the thing disappeared. This was filmed in Vancouver. She gave me my lungs, but be assured that in real life is a kind, funny, compassionate man. He even said he was playing the part that gave him his lungs. I'll watch something in him, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. It was as exciting as the dust of law and order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
