So American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Although it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies, except for some characters to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can not that guy get better concerts?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to compliment this movie. There are no funny jokes. It performs painful monitoring, especially a girl with a "southern" accent, which sounds more like a Canadian personification of a British woman who pretends to be hillbilly using the word "ya'll". This movie seems like an idiot. Why do not I go to college where nobody goes to class (everyone gets good grades), girls regularly wear clothes in the public, all have promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of children and STI and can you all ejaculate family photos of the girl without her thinking? Indeed, this series has fallen to the level of softcore porn. Perhaps for another, they eventually fall apart and find Ron Jeremy as the leader. I'm sure they can only bind in series by having his character Stifler's 3rd uncle once removed or something.
