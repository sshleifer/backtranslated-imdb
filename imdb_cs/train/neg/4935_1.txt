"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations and not the good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, there is a show: Cavemen are an alternative race, facing prejudices, etc. Perhaps the most stupid idea ever to come; almost worth jail for writers. One show represented caves that went to the club, trying to pick up the girls and then nothing happened. He remembered listening to Andy Rooney's 22-minute interview, followed by death on steak knives over cannibals. For those who did not see this show, there is an example of dialogue: "You're sure you're okay with going with a cave man." "Yeah, that's fine, I've got about ten thousand!" Merry ... Maybe the best script I've ever witnessed. 22 minutes of cavemen with terrible make-up, solving serious social problems ... It sounds like a fun night. I also like how bad the last thoughts are that they have resorted to it. I wonder if they're going to do Gecko so I can have a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I'd even say it's worse than Viva Laughlin. At least "Viva Laughlin" was torn off from something that was somewhat inspired. Such a demonstration gives me the hope that some comet is going to Earth somewhere. <br /> <br /> (Unreachable honestly ...)
