I do not have it. The movie apparently has a good budget. He has a very good cinematography. It has beautiful stimulation, good editing and pretty good direction. So why OH why not hire someone who would eventually overwrite the script, so it would not be so damn coveted and WHY they are why they hired such dirty actors who can not come out of a paper bag? This movie could be good. In most cases, it looks good and BEST well, but in the end you realize the movie was not good at all. So I would say it's a good production, but a bad movie. That's really bad. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come one, really!
