For the first 30 minutes of Tinseltown I had my fingers on my remote and I wanted to move and watch something else. It is assumed that the two writers who were lucky living in a "bin" with their own storage space were slightly entertaining, but painfully insignificant. The introduction of the character Joe Pantoliano, the biggest film boy living in the park and sleeping in the toilet, offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. And then a few others before Christy Swansons introduces himself as a beginning filmmaker and frontier nymphomaniac, adds a little spice. Her strong acting has increased her presence beyond the very welcome eye-candy inclusion. Ultimately, the apparent low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured tempo and manipulation of the bites of certain moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time are low budget, Whithnail & I is one that also deals with 2 boys with a dream, but on their luck. But for my money, the actors to save Tinseltown from the archives "The Terrible Movie" and just moved it to the archive "It could be a ball movie." I jumped out loud in some scenarios that included the character of Joe Pantolian. Especially the penultimate scenes in a terrible clich√©, but still funny, rich, but crumpled characters of the house where the story unfolds at his last moment. I see Tinseltown being great, and while the filmmakers made the best to translate it to celluloid, it simply did not work, and while I laughed aloud on some scenes and on a single pad, I think I lost my senses for the first 30 minutes and expectation. I would laugh at anything. <br /> <br /> If you are not stuck on a new coffee path, you do not have to pick it up if you see it in a good bucket.
