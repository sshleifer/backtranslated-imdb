This movie is terrible. You do not have to read this review. If you plan to follow it, just say - not (if you are not studying how to make a good movie). Actor is terrible ... a serious amateur hour. During the movie, I thought it was interesting to find someone who talked and looks like Michael Madsen just to find out he was actually him! New low for him too! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim to be genuine or good have probably never seen a decent film before. Even by the level of Hollywood action flicks it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not look! Go instead - at least you will not want to kill yourself.
