"Shinobi" is one of those films that thinks the mere act of killing a character automatically brings a sense of gravity or emotion into the story. Unfortunately, in order for viewers to really care for people who are dying, you have to develop characters, otherwise you only have a lot of accidental acts of violence. The problem is particularly complicated when you have TONY characters, all of which die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you can not be bothered enough to make the characters unforgettable or sympathetic, you can at least do the reason why they die duly, right? No way. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, without even knowing one side why they fight each other. They kill each other because the Emperor says it. But even if it is clear that the emperor wants all of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their absurd missions. It's not stubbornness ... it's just stupid. Sure, cool! There is no development of character and the plot does not provide any rational reason for the fight. At least they die in battle action scenes, right? Again, NO! In fact, many of the fighting is not at all fighting: super ninjas that the film has spent so much time and effort to introduce sudden death (and lamella, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, "Lalala, I'm walking, and I'm thrown." END for this character. Even in the middle of the movie I did not make my hands worse.
