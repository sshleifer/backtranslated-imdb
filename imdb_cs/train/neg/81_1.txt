Life has done it again. Can we say stupidity? I could not wait for it to finish. The conspiracy was absurd. The game was terrible! Especially teenagers. The story is played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give the actors a job? Things were attractive and I really was looking for a good thriller. Once in some life comes up with a good movie, it's not one of them. If nobody has anything else to do, I would avoid it at all costs. It was a two-hour loss of my life. Can I return them? I would rather scratch my face on the brick wall for two hours and then suck it in peroxide. That would be more fun.
