What was happening during the Second World War in New Zealand when there were US forces? This terrible story about the four sisters was really pathetic. Can you imagine Joan Fontaine playing as an older sister, Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even more fun was that the movie will be pregnant with Fontaine. Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, four years later filming chemistry on the screen in "The Hustler," have no scenes in this movie. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to hunt her there, even though she is married. Woe to her when her husband returns from war. Jean Simmons is a widower and finds romance with a much dulled Paul Newman. There is even a romance for young Miss Dee. <br /> <br /> The image has little or no meaning. Are they trying to say that everything is just in love and war? If they are, they have done a bad job of selling this. <br /> <br /> The clash of interests with Newman and Simmons is quickly removed. This was to be done quickly on this horribly disappointed film of 1957.
