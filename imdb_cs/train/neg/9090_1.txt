A promotional film for the Palestinian "cause". If you expected an unbiased document about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you would have to look elsewhere. If you are anti-Semitic (or just an anti-Zionist - nothing wrong with defending the destruction of the country, right?) Or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (eg Mass murders, destruction of Israel), this is the document for you. For a fun evening at colleges in the UK and the USA. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the mere amount of deception presented in this video. I just hope that those who are not really aware of the situation are not harmed by this anti-Semitic dirt.
