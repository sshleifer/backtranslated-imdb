I've seen other guinea-pig movies like a mermaid in the shaft and never die, and though they're sick enough, they have at least some sense of humor (however dark). Devil's Experiment, however, is nothing but the shooting of lots of punks that sign a young girl in many ways of torture and violence and there is no conspiracy and no redeeming of values. It's not terrifyingly terrifying, except maybe a set of minds, but it's definitely disgusting, and I certainly would not call it fun. Now I'm not the right taste in movies, and I like my waste and dirt, but it really was too much for me. I'm all worrying, in fact, I'm looking for things that are worrying whenever possible, but that was a little too much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, suffocated by continuous noise over the headphones until it drops, and then crumpled with raw meat and the interior and hangs somewhere in the hammock in the woods. If you think it sounds great, go for it, but it definitely lost me from watching other things about the turkey. 1 out of 10, absolutely unstoppable.
