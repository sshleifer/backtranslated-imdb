I suppose if you love an endless dialogue that does not recommend the story and the effect of the camera, as the scene passes in the _Angel_ TV show, you will look forward to the movie. Me? Everything I wanted was a nice, strict little story, and it was not there. Movement was virtually back, conspiracy points were buried under the sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of fear or tension or NEVER. Is it July? Is it Wendigo? No, he's a speed cameraman. That's not frightening. It does not create a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're afraid of MTV. Just like those who have been evaluating me before me, I have also noticed that the end of the movie is laughing at the audience.
