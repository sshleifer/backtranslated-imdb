I admit that I liked the first and I really look forward to continuing. I was released. Of course, the special effects were technically amazing - but they were not credible. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit I like 80% of the chase scene - but the fight with Mr. Smith? It was too obviously animated. I can take it all. What I can not accept is that the ineffective parts were bullshit. Each time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in a speech that lasted forever and did not mean anything. I was also disappointed with the little conspiracy that existed. What this film did was tell us that the first movie is not true (except the existence of a matrix). This movie was a bit like seeing the DALLAS episode, where you will find that the whole previous season was a dream. Ugh! I want my $ 7.00 back!
