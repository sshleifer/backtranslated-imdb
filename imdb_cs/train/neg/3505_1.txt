The Central Comedy has the habit of doing great programs in the times - Chappelle's show, Daily show, Colbert's message, and then those that some people love or hate - Stella, Dr. Katz. Then there are some shows that have their defenders but they are just terrible - Mencia and now Sarah Silverman. This show is based on the fact that Silverman is self-centered, which may be funny (Colbert Report), but it can be terrible (Mind of Mencia). No one should be shocked to believe the other. This show is a parody of a sitcom and society, a program so absurd that it is lost in absurdity and is simply not funny. The woman who suffers has become a comedy many times because it is not something in common. We do not need 25 minutes. When a criminal is disarmed by a friend, he simply loses his appeal - we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob Strike, except the women were warmer and the whole scene was far absurd, so it was better. But the best comparison of this show is Stella, except that Stella was much finer, making the absurd comedy fun. It was better acting and I think it's a bit more fantastic realistic view. Maybe some reviews are so negative (I'm very skeptical about critical recognition, but I have no doubt about fan reaction) on this show is the amount of advertising for it, very unpleasant advertising through many programs far outweigh the advertising on other programs. Many people wonder why Sarah Silverman has a career, and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled. This show should never overcome the unsuccessful pilot phase. Back to the norm has shown much more promise, but this show does it further. And if the critics are right, many things were generally settled, seeing that their condition grew enormously. The last time I checked, Britney Spears would also get good reviews. Take this comparison, however you want, because someone no doubt accuses me of being psychotic on IMDb because he did not like it.
