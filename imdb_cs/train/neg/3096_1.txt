To begin with, "Hobgoblins" try to overcome the more successful "Gremlins". That's bad enough, but he's not even trying to do something like a movie. Instead, it's more like a mature cellar, everything - I have to go with the omission of embarrassing scenes, the inappropriate FX sound, acting like clumsy tapioca, and a screenplay that takes everything that people keep in their movies sacred and throws them into the old pipe -aroo. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy? Grrrr .... The fatal kids watch the grimm creatures from the movie before they kill people by projecting their fantasies. The sound is cool, is not it? Look at the wall on the other side of your room? Go straight ahead, top speed, face first. You see, it's cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare to doubt? Quickly, name something else, one of the wires was different than this one. What other scripts do writers have from "Hobgoblins"? The name of another director's effort, Rick Sloane. How many "hobballs" do you have available? See? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I wrote such a terrible movie for so long. I would like to write about more important things; such as separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, such things. But no, "Hobgoblins" it is and it's bad - bad as grandparents' wallpapers, bad as pink flamingos on the lawn, bad underwear that says "Whopper Home" ... and I think we'll stop there. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robot fight smartly, but trying to do just as much as they can do with Hobgoblins do just as much as they realize, yes, the DOES manager needs to kick the shin. br /> <br /> Real, really hard. <br /> <br /> One star for "Hobgoblins," seven star for MST3K.
