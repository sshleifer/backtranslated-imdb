GENERAL APPLIANCES: <br /> <br /> Gettaway is usually an action movie. And what's the action! Shootouts, chase, dumpsters and much more. He plays Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy. This is a remake and the original I did not see, but it really did not care about it at all, although Bassenger and Baldwin have some nice screen chemistry. But the film itself did not do it. <br /> <br /> Gettaway really bothered. This plot is overshadowed by one fight after another, and as the violence continues to accumulate, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their brilliant looks regardless of the extent to which they are threatened. In fact, until the end of the movie, they look almost like a BETTER start. I do not think Bassenger eye makeup moves once during the whole slide. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, certainly not, but it's not very good and if the action movie is not purist I do not really enjoy this movie because there's just so much here. Gettaway is not even horribly original, and it is unnecessarily brutal to a rather dull. It would really be better. I think Bassenger and Baldwin are all right, but they have nothing to do except they are being persecuted and running for their lives. Sometimes there is less, more, after seeing the same thing over and over again, he is still obsolete. This time he did not like it very much.
