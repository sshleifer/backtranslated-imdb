It's a great reason why Edison went straight to the video: they would land in theaters with a collapsing bang. The film lasted too long and was dangerously boring. It's just a fraction of a low blow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who had, of course, two weeks before their other films), the evil men are as mixed and as close as Justin Timberlake does not exist. I hate to knock him, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his strength, the better. The film is not bad at all ... just by most. I like the fact that LL Cool J has got what looks like a shot in being the leading man. He deserves that. And unlike his teammate and stars he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always nice (you see him several times when he chews the scene) and Freeman has the ability to promote this movement to three stars (out of ten ... it's not that good). /> <br /> When everything is said and done, the final mistake of this movie is that it's a funny and tedious piece of pseudoactive poppycock that can not keep someone awake. Nor can someone give a good figure to a figure. Overall, it's just boring. That is, rent it if you suffer from insomnia.
