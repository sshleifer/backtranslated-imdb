At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate pop maize as stupidly as possible to drown the inferior dialogue. It's not a girl's movie at all. Any blocks they like are those that ladies can certainly stay away. Dirty story, average dialogue, and overall handsome movie. I've seen many, many movies, but this is a new winner in the wrong category. If you look at it, the only thing you're looking for is the end. So you can finally get out of the theater as quickly as possible.
