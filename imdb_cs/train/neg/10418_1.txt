This is not a movie for kids! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acid trip" for children under 5 years of age. In a month, my four-year-old asked from time to time, "Why did the rabbits bleed from the mouth?" or "Why did the bulldozer store all rabbits?". (And that was not the worst). We stopped it for about half an hour, but the damage was over. Intentively morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally forgot the whole bad thing. Who should decide that this film should be sold to children should be accused. ... (Copper condemn me, my conscience is clear.)
