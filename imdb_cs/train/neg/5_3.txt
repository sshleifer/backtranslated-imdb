I basically shuffled the film, but only to be able to watch where the plot is. To tell you the truth, it was boring for me and it did not make sense in some places. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! It's so hot, but it's got a bit weird in this movie. But it's still hot. However, despite being hot, it's really failed for the movie. I think the conspiracy is not so bad, but what really fits me was the fact that they're coming back like every sentence. Is it hard to express your anger without saying the word F each time? The pain was unpleasant, and the horror of the camera made me feel headache. Overall, although the plot was fine, I found that the film is boring and dramatic. That's why I'm just inserting into cut scenes. LOL By the way, it's not worth renting, unless you're a passionate fan of a particular cast like me. Oh yeah, the cast was Hot. Girls were HOT !!! But CHACE is the best!
