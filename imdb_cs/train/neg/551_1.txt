I'm going through the AFI list of the first 100 comedies and I have to say that this is really one of the worst. It's not just 90 movies on the list I've seen, but about the movies I've ever seen. Drunks are sometimes funny, Dudley is not. Liza has almost done it, but unfortunately ... just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see it in something good. Seriously, Dudley is laughing and drinking to be funny? I highly recommend almost any other movie about the TOP 100 comics of AFI comics that could be more laughing. If you want to see the more fun "drunk" try a thin man. Funnier generally kills any Marx Brothers movie (especially if you are as drunk as Arthur).
