Everyone who saw "Shine," Scott Hicks's heartfelt film, but ultimately the joyous life of keyboardist David Helfgotts; I'm sure you will realize that "SOLOIST" is very bad in comparison. It's as slow as a lullaby (I took five breaks, answering emails just to wake up). The drawing of the homeless at the top and the extreme self-worth, I am afraid of the horrible depiction of the battle of Joe Wrights, are another disaster of Attonment. . J Fox's performance was a very bad example of a hearing and lacked credibility from offset.Downey on the other hand; although he is struggling at a bad pace, still captivates, it's me, or is George Clooney more than one?). The comparison of the two well-known so-called "STAR" factors is unnecessary, however, because the light that best shines in terms of acting must be what is the "shiny" Geoeffry Rush, which is a great performance that is definitely very much in my sky more clearly. With both "Attonment" and "Soloist" the written word wins much more for the empathy of the subject. Read the book and articles or wait until the DVD will soon be in an underground basement.
