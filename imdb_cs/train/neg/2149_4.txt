Well, a big money machine did it again! Disney very smartly uses fools like me who think we have to own every video (good or bad) stamped with Disney moniker. Why do I look forward to these "follow-ups" that Don Bluth's doing on the wrong day look like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three stories (the wrong choice!) Is not this one of the most cute Disney creations that at least deserves a linear story? Of these three, the last one comes anywhere near the quality of animation and narrative that I would expect. Music is horrible and modern (which means it will be dated in two years) and does not remind anything. Why update everything? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectable and original with songs that reflect the same style? Look, I can not wait for the Dart Beauty to continue. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky's themes, we will get the music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So, Disney, when you listen, remember that we are not all non-distinguished children here. What about throwing two bits of fans who were around long enough to know the difference between craft and bullshit?
