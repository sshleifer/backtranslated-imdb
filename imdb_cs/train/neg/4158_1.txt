This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I've never seen a movie worse than this one !!! <br /> <br /> And I never think !!!! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of horror movies "B". How could you imagine .... I've been exposed to some of the worst that the film industry can offer. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to this movie would be the title. I think so ... what a true horror fan should not be surprised by the title like "Vampires vs. Zombies "??? The concepts of "undead" fight each other on the "undead" dancing in my head. I thought ... "I have to see it" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well .... sorry to say .... "this I wish I could not see" !!!!! <br /> <br /> These title movies are very misleading to say the least. There were no vampires fighting the zombies. In fact, there is no conspiracy !!!! If you asked me what this movie is about can honestly say I have no clue !!! <br /> <br /> There was no fence !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !! <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no meaning at all !! <br /> <br /> At the end of this debacle ... I found sorry for the poor souls who have invested their money in this project because they definitely have no business sense !!!
