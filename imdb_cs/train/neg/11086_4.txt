As for the Spanish westerns, I would have this man not be able to die on the boring side of the genre. It's not that the film is particularly bad, but it lacks the shine and gleam of some of the other SW I've seen. Guy Madison does the best in the lead but lacks the charisma on the screen that's needed to pull him out. With one remarkable exception the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction is inconspicuous and offers very few moments I have not seen yet. It's not much what she's looking forward to. <br /> <br /> The exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. It's the only clear place in this otherwise average movie. Unfortunately, its on-screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: IMDb's page for this man can not die is bad Rosalba Neri is not Jenny Benson, instead of Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for a guy named John Bartha given in IMDb credits for the movie.)
