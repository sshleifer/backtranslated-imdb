Have you ever seen a movie made exclusively from long wide shots? No? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one in "spring in my hometown", and I have to admit, now we know why people do not do it. Technique is "arty", of course, but certainly not ripe for public consumption. The technique is badly flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and maybe it could be the director's whole intention. I do not know, I can not read my thoughts and definitely the directors do not have enough idea to decide. But one thing about this film, which is painfully obvious, is its ridiculous anti-American views. As an American, I am well aware of the participation of my country in the Korean War and I realize well that we are not always angels, but I will be damned if I take this version of the fellow. According to this blind fool, the Americans were not just the roots of the war, we were the cause of the war and we almost destroyed the country unanimously. Anything, Mr. Director. And I suppose you would have shot a movie in COMMUNITY KOREA if we did not interfere, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is almost similar to the Nazis being "good guys" and turning Allied forces into "bad guys." This film is so historically naive and so in fact inaccurate that it is almost embarrassing to watch. For a person who comes from a country that owes its existence to American intervention, it will surely come as tall, powerful and judicious.
