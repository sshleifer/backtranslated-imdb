My interest in Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Although she had great actors / actresses, there were just too many subplots continuing to keep an interest. Moreover, it was not so interesting. The dialogue was stiff and confused, and the story went too far to be credible. I was quite disappointed with what I consider to be one of Audrey Hepburn's latest films. I will always love John Ritter best in the noise. It was just too pathetic.
