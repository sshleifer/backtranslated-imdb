Everyone who watched Central comedy in the last couple of years has probably seen ads for this movie. First I saw ads for this movie in 2001. It seemed funny, but I did not have to dial the number on the TV screen and order it without first seeing the movie. I thought I'd wait for the movie to be available for Blockbuster rental. About a year and a half later, I was at Tower Records and a "DVDS for Less Than $ 20" a copy of this movie. When I see that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I got home, put the disc on the DVD player and waited until they started laughing ... and I waited even more. Laughter never arrived. <br /> <br /> He will have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was terrible. Poor, desperate and badly written and directed, UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is a nasty piece of waste and in my opinion is the worst film of all time. No stars.
