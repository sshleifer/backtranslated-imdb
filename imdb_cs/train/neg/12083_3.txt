Yes I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have emotions about a movie that has no emotions. This film is as sterile as the surgical scalpel. There are several stone columns, several stone seats, a few stone crosses and several stone actors. They have no emotions! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that Hamlet and Hamlet are amazingly written literature. Dabing really was not that bad. The voices remained true to the dull, gloomy, gloomy, life-sucking atmosphere the film did. I saw this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and every three of them I was on the verge of turning off the TV even though the MST 3K was. <br /> <br /> Not uplifting drama production that deserves much better performance.
