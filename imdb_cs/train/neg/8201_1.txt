Move to your favorite chair and turn the play station as you throw it into the waste disposal unit. Spend a useful 90 min. to live your favorite game. Unrelated - badly shot - unmanaged junk emails. It requires several other "science fiction" films and poor attempts to link the parts to a rather faint story. There is nothing new here, filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple fun would achieve a monetary game, but it needs to be witty and ingenuous. Any money spent tracking this kind of waste is waste and I personally would like to go back about 90 minutes of life.
