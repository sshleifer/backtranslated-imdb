Here we have a movie that fails almost in any case that it is possible for the film to fail. A horrible script, dirty acting, amateur directing, ridiculous special effects ... it's just a terrible movie. Not to mention that when you finish, you realize that the whole thing does not make sense. After you've spent the entire movie and wondering what's going on in the world when you finally explain things, you'll realize that the story was built on an extremely impossible basis. In one of those tricky sequences, "The villain explains the whole movie" tells us that our villain has done something that just can not be done and that has absolutely no sense. And then we see that it seems to be some sort of jel-o-monster. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would very much pretend that this movie never happened. If for some godless reason you've ever tried to sit down and watch this movie, I can suggest instead of taking the time to rub my head against the wall for 104 minutes. This would prove to be a much more enjoyable experience than to sit through this waste.
