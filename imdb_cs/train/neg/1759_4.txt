This effort was like a crazy TV movie ... I do not remember that it would never be allowed in theaters ... If so, she must die by a quick death. While watching a DVD, in the comfort of our bedroom, it was obvious that this film was meant for much more ... Ed Lauter critic of art with greed? What I had to do ... I did not see Ed from "The Longest Court" ... Everybody else got the numbers led by Baldwin, except for Pompey ... She had zero charisma and seemed to be helpful over most of the picture ... Pompeo's daughter had one dimension ... she played every scene like a nice puppy ... the slowest delivery of a line all three years I've seen ... <br /> <br /> Chase scenes gave my wife and I headaches too ... fast cutting and angling ... If you are going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you might want a few WIDE shots to take advantage of the beauty of your background, right? The whole story was quite unrealistic and appealing, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
