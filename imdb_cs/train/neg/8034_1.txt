I know the murders are always bad, but come on, what the hell is that? It's like a group of 10-year-olds who have saved their luncheon money and started filming until the end of the week. Every six young people go to the same house to kill the screen. We have the youngest, the bitch, the second bitch, the black man, the killer, such stereotypes. shaking boats, others are all driving out a guy who wears a mask that people in the poor box refused. There's a pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle, but then it's even more bored and especially fake worries. we actually know that he can not be a killer when one gets attacked because that guy certainly loves to take his sweet time for everything. After every person you expect to die, the standard ugly blonde chickens will die and her girlfriend will eventually capture the killer (they get pushed down and then faint) and the killer reveals. I think the filmmakers just took their eyelids and pen and gave somewhere on the character list. The motive is just lame, and I'm not even starting to bloody secrets. The killer, of course, takes too much time to explain everything (and then about ten extra minutes in which, for some reason, he breaks his own arm) and finally gets caught by a guy with a gun. Hey, it's not fair! one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could be more pleased to watch Lindsay Lohan, I swear. I mean, most of the 80s slasher were sucking, but at least throwing some T & A has nothing to do with it.
