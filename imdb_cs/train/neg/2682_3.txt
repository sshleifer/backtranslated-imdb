I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time when I looked at "Return to Paradise", which I found fragile. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about this was an unpredictable ending, which, in my opinion, was partly stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> I may have waited too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like Danes' character first, I found it very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic about the movie. It could have done much better, for example, more emphasis could be put on prison conditions and complete horror. The film was too cheerful to be realistic. There could also be more actions and tensions. The best thing about this movie is a "tragic" ending. I could not foresee it. But at that time I really did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
