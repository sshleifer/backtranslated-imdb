Even though I use this page quite often to find out how other people rated what I think are demanding or simply nice movies, after watching yesterday this movie in Four, I felt compelled to write something, even though it will help me clean up the movie again. The film was perhaps the most powerful experience I ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Certainly?) And Gillian Anderson (who always will be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock) had no real substance about them - I'm not sure if the first the half-hour of the film did not make the end, but surely in the vengeance you would like some empathy with the victims ... here I could not care less. In fact, it seems to me that the only character I liked about was a dog, with the deer approaching. And both animals drove Dire (sic) and Scully, who were frankly terrible. I think that even if you are just as good as the script you have received, I would like to thank all the writers, producers, the director and all the creators for having 90 minutes of my life and some good electricity.
