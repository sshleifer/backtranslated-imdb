This Italian semi-horror film starts very similar to fine core porn and turns into a mystery that has few to many free ends that are good and that is rather boring, making this film somewhat inconsistent for my taste. The only thing that really matters is the fact that many breasts spread throughout the film. The story has a guy who, at the beginning of the film, is attracting girls to their castle, where they bring them to their dungeon, go berserk and seem to kill. They show nakedness, but at this point in the movie they never show murders. Then the guy finds a pretty red head at the party and goes with her and marry her. He has a redhead thing you see because his beloved ex-wife Evelyn was also one, but she also died in circumstances that may not be a viewer's affair. After many plot scenes, murders with snakes, foxes and the like will be taking place. At this point, it's easy to find out who is responsible for the murder, and what the motive is, then you have a pointless end when everything is not so nice. This film just did not work for me, left me with many questions and the last third of the film just did not have breasts from the first two thirds of the film. The explanation that Evelyn's death will help the film will have some end when Evelyn gets out of the grave. Granted that the title is not entirely misleading because it caused her to leave the grave, not her own power. Gore is very light because there is a scene with foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood as well. I just thought this movie was mostly boring.
