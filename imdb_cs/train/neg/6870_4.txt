A well-intentioned film about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), the wife of the devoted Talmudian scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees it and hires her to work in a field where she's a jewelry expert. Her affair starts with her, and then, when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, throws her off and betrays her to a family who turns her off. There is a subplot in which the dead brother of Sonda speaks to her and apparently takes the form of a magical beard, but why it is not clear. It is unclear, unfortunately, including what is happening to Sonja, why she tells Rebba that there is a fire in it, and maybe it's not from God, and what it means and what the magic beetle tells her. To a degree, the story touches the situation of women in the ultra-Orthodox community and yet Sonja is not completely liberated. Nor is it the idea of ​​being redeemed by the love of a man of another race who was very well thought out. The title stems from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman, and yet it is the bastard Sender who quotes her of Sonja. Zellweger fights this part; she should be a Jew from mid-west, and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times it is adopted on the distinctive sounds of Brooklyn. She is at her best when it's hard and takeover, but eventually the movie is a mess.
