The reason why the DVD is black and white is that no one can get their hands on the color print of this movie in a public house, a modestly humorous story. Distributed for television through Allied Artists, DVD (or VHS) on the market at this time for this title come from the same 16MM television press. Films distributed for television before 1963 were often distributed in black-and-white prints because most of the audience did not have a color. Outstanding black and white prints for television were also cheaper as they often included relatively few copies that covered all the stations on which the film is based on a syndicated basis.
