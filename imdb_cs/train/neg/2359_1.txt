It was the last Freddy movie (and it was over 10 years old) - you think they would be trying to make a good movie. But it turned out to give us the worst of the series (and it says a lot). The story did not make sense (I really do not remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you really wanted to be dead) and Freddy's quarrel was even worse than usual. The only remarkably good bit about it was the short (and humorous) portrait of Johnny Depp (the first film "Nightmare" was his first). I also originally saw that in the theater the last part (re-counting Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. No-3-D was miserable - faded colors, and the picture went into focus. Also, the three flying skulls that were supposed to be frightening (I think) had an opposite reaction from my listener. Everyone laughed. Looks even worse on 2-D TV. Unimportant and stupid - also very boring. Skip this and look again at "Freddy vs. Jason".
