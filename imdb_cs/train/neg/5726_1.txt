Obviously, he was trying to spend money on the musical accompaniment Hostel / Saw, my expectations for this movie were low (really low!) And yet he managed to disappoint at every level. The game is so bad that it's not funny, the story line does not exist and the only fear is that I've lost 1 hour 21 minutes to it! I was surprised that 34 people gave her 10 stars. I can only suspect that 33 of them are Cast and Crew. 34. Is the director the mother? - although I'm sure it would be hard to go higher than 2! Extra DVD contains an hour long "make of". Which raises the question: "Why?" (though perhaps it serves to prove what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
