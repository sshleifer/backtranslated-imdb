In 1967, mining workers found the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization called Abkani, who believe there are worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, there was something wrong before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, Bureau 713 for the State Paranormal Research Agency was headed by Prof. Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who experimented with the children living in the settlement. Currently, one of these children is a paranormal investigator, Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who just acquired the Abkani arcact in South America and was persecuted by a man with abilities. When an old friend of a foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he finds the demons returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and Head of Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his team fight against the evil creators. Despite the charismatic good cast, directed by Christian Slate, Tary Reid, and Stephen Dorff, "Self in Dark" never works and is a complete mess without developing signs or plot. The reason may be explained by Uwe Boll's "brilliant" interview in Extras DVD, where he says "video games are bestsellers of younger generations that are no longer under the guidance of books." In addition, its target audience will be people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. I'm sorry, but I think the two statements are restless towards younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know a lot of my friends and it's not such a stupid stereotype, says the director. Furthermore, IMDb provides excellent statistics showing that Mr Uwe Boll is absolutely bad. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Myself in the Dark? Despertar to Mal" ("In The Darkness?
