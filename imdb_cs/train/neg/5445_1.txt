Ooof! This was a smell. It does not fall "somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller", that's for sure. In fact, it falls somewhere between the Wham cracks! video and Captain EO, just with a not so big budget, and much more close up of ugly teenagers crying. Simon Le Bon performs the queue and center, while the rest of the gamely tries to hide the fact that they have stolen their entire career from the last 3 albums of Roxy Music. Barbarella's short clips do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (But I enjoyed playing "Hungry like a wolf," but why did a tiger appear in the audience that turned into a woman with tiger stripes? I mean they do not call "Eye of the Tiger" "Hunger like a tiger" it's a Wolf Anything.) Duran Duran DVDs from the 1980s are probably worth looking for nostalgia
