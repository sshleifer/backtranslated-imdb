The film you want to throw on your sword. I saw stories in my time, but looking at the poor mess I do not think I could ever watch another movie again. Let Allah be tempted by the souls who have done it. The premise - an ex-army silent pussy, model type underwear (really acting really) is looking for a girl who sent him a Xmas card while serving in the army. He stops with his family in a family that is a real treasure trove. The family takes it and it takes 2 hours of our time when the kitten is seen to be better than his liberal-looking, French drink of wine, porsche control, loud mobile phone, lazy, bitter, Jewish looking for a fiance. > <br /> Bad-1d characters, 1d topics. Hitting the head with a pro-military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good business breaks were long. Peter Jason. It ended.
