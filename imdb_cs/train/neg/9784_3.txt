I think my friends and I have seen a movie based on his title alone. It's cute, though it's obvious that it's a plot and a direction - you know where the film is going in the first five minutes. My main statement with the story is that while it remains tolerantly consistent, they never explain a lot of things behind the characters. Alcoholic father, redesigned mother, restrained nurse ... this is a bad family, but there is no solution in addition to the occasional mention by the nurse. I was also confused as to the bottle scene ... it seemed quite random. Scripture is a secondary problem ... children were not bad actors, but their script left much to be desired. Unfortunately, what could be a cute niche movie was postponed aside for a single, blah strange effect, lame scripting and a clear conspiracy.
