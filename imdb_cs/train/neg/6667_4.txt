she was such a joy from this movie to Ed Norton's facial hair problems. Without revealing details of the conspiracy - he had a light beard in one afternoon, but the beard was off the same evening and there was a very lush mustache on the spot. It was much fuller than a mustache that went with a beard. Later on during the dark night in an open place his mustache was gone, and he seemed to clean up the sanctuary. It was not possible at the time she stopped shaving. These inconsistencies of continuity completely separated me from the rest of the film and destroyed any credibility they had before. I also found that the lengthy cowboy scene in her bedroom reminds De Niro in the Taxi Driver. Even if it were to be honored, it was too strange for him.
