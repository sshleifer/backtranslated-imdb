This film is another long-haul budget-free, no effort, no talented videos shot on the video, and a smooth cover to dive to unsuspecting tenants in a video rental. If you want to know what to watch this movie is like, grab your camcorder and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around at night drilling and "attacking" people. Congratulations, you just made "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now make sure the distribution company will buy from you. I recorded a low budget that was shot on video clips showing the talents of the creators and actors, or at least the effort, but that. Avoid if you are not a real masochist or you are not enjoying badly made horror movies.
