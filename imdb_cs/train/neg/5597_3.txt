Let me say at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. For the most part, the effects are not good (I think only Sky has shown some promise) and you feel it's annoying watching. All scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow, as if Ng appeared with their parents. There are a lot of details like the canyon tattoo on the Sky shoulder, the magnets on the girl's refrigerator and the God's terrible decoration in the sets ... and the music ... and the clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point: "I'm gay, not nasty." And I do not know. Even the comment is terrible, I turned it off after Ng talks about how weird she was when she was a lesbian.
