I just do not have some big space in this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable and that it's something so ugly that it would make you crazy. Someone here made a note that maybe it's the frequency of light waves or something other than ugliness. Miranda is just a fool. The episode is slow, inconsistent, and too nice. I also do not understand why Colos is an ambassador - why does the Federation just let the damned Meduans be? It's one part I like when Kolos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I like TOS, and even in its strongest state, I always tune. However, this episode - mmm, I would not get it, except for used copies under $ 3.
