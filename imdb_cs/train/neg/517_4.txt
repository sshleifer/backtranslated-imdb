"Returning Chanda" is remarkable if one can say that for casting Belo Lugosi as a hero rather than a villain. Why does she even get a girl. The story as such includes the black magic cult of Ubasti, who tries to capture the last Princess of Egypt (adorable Maria Alba) and use it as a sacrifice as a means of reviving her ancient leader who just looks like Nadja. Lugosi like Chanda, who has magical powers, tries to betray villains. Ray Taylor is doing the best with a limited amount of resources and extensive series. The King Kong fans (1933) recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong in the bay in several scenes. The game is largely horrible. The actor who plays the highest priest (for example, Lucien Prival) uses an acting coach inspired by pronunciation that was so common in the early talks. The less the others describe, the better. It's the secret why Lugosi took part in independent views at this stage of his career, because at that time he was still a universal star at Universal. Perhaps it was because in this case playing a hero and getting a girl who knows. As his career began to spiral down in the late 30's, this fare would be a standard for Lugosi rather than an exception. <br /> <br />
