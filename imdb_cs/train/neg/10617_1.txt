Probably encouraged by its much better "Orlando" admirer, Potter delivers the vehicle for itself in the worst way: it writes, drives, stars, and actually copies music, including the mawkish love song. The film very much resembles a college or college teenager's project convinced that her own intimate love and melodramatic obsession are as fascinating to us as to her. But Potter's character is equally dissatisfied with the subject of her romantic obsession, which is unbearable, and the whole movie is an embarrassing manifestation of narcissism that dresses as a celebration of a thong. Maybe if she did not fit herself, it could work. She just can not act, whether she's playing alone or not. Skilful, too ambitious, boring and stupid.
