This film is undoubtedly the worst horror film I've ever seen. And that's a lot, because I've seen such mouthpieces as Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is close to second). However, I love bad horror films and, as I can say from my username, this guy really does. Occasionally there is nothing more fun than a badly made slasher movie. Regarding this film, it seems that the opening scene in which the woman is roaming in the sunbathing booth has no effect on the film, especially because the film did not tell you that the event happened two years before the rest of the film. Effects do not exist and most camera shots are from women's spheres that shrink in spandex. The policeman was the most monumental, monotonous actor I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this movie must be a murder weapon. A huge safety pin? What did they think? Who's the murderer? Unhappy employee "Huggies"? I would have to give this film a total of zero, but sorry if I did not want to watch it
