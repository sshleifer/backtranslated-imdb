I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York has been in Germany for 16 years, I have entered the film as a backup. It was so boring. Then I realized that these are just bulls where the husband is exposing his wife. I think today you are doing this over the Internet and paying for instant access. It's been over 20 years ago, but I'm still upset that I'm wasting my time with this movie. This is soft-porn for school children. She printed Bo Derek and painted it in color - pretty. But then they should name Undressing Bo and paint it.
