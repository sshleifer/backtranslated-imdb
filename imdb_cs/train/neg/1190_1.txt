Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali will bring it. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. Certainly one trick pony, I think they could get another American chef to come to the table on this like Iron Chefs. The kinds of meals of this duo come true ... do not reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef series. I do not think Batali even went to school chefs. There are a lot of great chefs in America, just wondering why they are not in the food network. It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a bit too flippant / funny for this role.
