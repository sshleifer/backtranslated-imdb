... the first movie I had to leave. And that was a preliminary projection of the cast and crew (Not that I participated, I will shortly add). I did it for the first hour, so I think I was just able to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Just like other comments, how did it go through any type of QA. Accumulation of the worst in dialogue, incarnation of wooden acting, horrible casting, all packed without conspiracy. Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comic. It has the worst Russian accent in the movie. <br /> <br /> When I left the screening, the director and the producers drank in the bar outside the cinema. Of course they could not go through again. <br /> <br />
