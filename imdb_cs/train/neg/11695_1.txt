To call a movie as "Thinner" bad is like calling the land around or Pauly Shore un-talented. No news, but how they got this way, that's what people want to know. As for this movie .... The book was good, although it was a bit derived from other stories from "watch out for what you want" genre. Burke plays an overweight attorney who kills a gipsy daughter and is cursed by his father (Constantine from TV "Room 222") for a few pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it works well, but why join the gangster (Mantegna)? Why shoot automatic weapons so much? Why does this change into something so strongly dependent on FX? I thought it would be much more effective if he concentrated more on the subtle consequences of horrible losses, illness, death, gypsy traditions, and so on. <br /> <br /> No, it's not. Remember, this is Stephen King, which we are talking about. And the end ... almost the same as a book, but a little too talkative. In fact, the whole movie speaks too much, it feels like it explains that every plot is turning to us. Not that I would wait for the "Dead Zone," but I could do it without another "Pet Sematary", thanks. Just as one star tries at least to make a decent midnight makeup work. The rest of the movie remains ... tell me ... "Thinner".
