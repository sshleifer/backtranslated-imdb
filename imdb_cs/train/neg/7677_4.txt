In this episode I stopped watching the loss because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby's deaths were useless and really depressing. Then I found them keeping Libby around to die in another episode! Gah! I can not deal with it. <br /> <br /> I like this show for the first season, but in the second season it definitely fell, I found that Jack and Locke have a little religious conflict as unpleasant. The deaths of Rodriguez and Watros were the last straw! <br /> <br /> I'm giving this episode 4/10 because I was the end of my tour of this earlier big series created by legend Alias ​​J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve in the future.
