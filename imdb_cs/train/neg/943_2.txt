Here is an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase "low budget" a terrible name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization." Students are hopelessly killed by false random undersea sandwiches and aviation school supplies. It sounds like the resurrection of classic B-movies from the 1950s, right? No way! It's not an example of high camp entertainment, which is way WAY out of the brand. The enchanting show of breasts and buttocks builds on our desire for pleasure, which defends the horror, which was supposed to be the first place with 99.44% more. Bottom-of-the-barrel fun at the best, with the help of pints of red blood and dead bodies of students. Strange movies like this would make the disastrous GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) a work of intelligent genius with a Masters degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so rest easy!
