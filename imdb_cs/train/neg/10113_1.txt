I found out that this film is being leased on a cover. The zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get into the movie and they are women with soap raccoons. Zero Special Effects ... and even combat scenes you can see that there are no 2 foot strikes. the funny thing is that Lommel is short acting in the movie and is worse than other filmmakers. the only thing I think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people consider him a "cult classic" ... but I can not imagine anyone thinking that this is nothing but one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed to have leased it and promised to never see another Lommel movie again!
