What is it in the sky? Is it a plane? Is it Superman? Errr, right? It's TURTLE!?! You see, that's what happened in the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other problems! Americans shoot down a Russian warplane somewhere across Artic and the subsequent explosions thaw and literally awaken the giant prehistoric turtle-creature of Gammer. This is not a very friendly creation because it quickly results in the destruction of everything and everyone on its way. Guilty governments eventually decide to kill ugly bastards with a new and super-sophisticated ice bomb but Gammer has another surprise in the store? A bloody turtle can fly! When this happens for the first time, there will be an incredibly grotesque and cheerful succession! The Gammer is lying on his back, which seems to be defeated when the fire suddenly flies from the armpits and he rises in the air. How can you not love it? Then there's also a spooky plot about an unpleasant boy who can telepathically communicate with the monster, but that's simply not quite interesting. Flying turtle, people! It's very little that could be written about this Japanese (and American re-edited) Sci-Fi effort, except that it's the obvious and utterly blatant tearing of such classics as the original Godzilla and The Beast of the 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and patterns of monsters are extremely hockey, and unlike the films above, they never create an apocalyptic atmosphere. Outstanding actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem unconscious of what films they are in, and even the original Japanese fairy tales are not too convincing. Gammer is a very custom and personalized theme-song is rather cool, though, so it gets one more point for it.
