This film had a great actress: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - solid b-movie actors all. But this downer of the film did not use any of them for any benefit without the screen being met by any of their characters (even though Christopher Lee was playing against each other in several scenarios). <br /> <br /> Motivation of strangers in this movie seems to change to a drop of a hat. First of all, they only want to repair their ship and leave, then turn to the main character by killing most of their friends and not releasing their wife after they get an important part they need. Then the "peaceful" race decides that it must destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (although they offer the main character and his wife instead of in his company). <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spent watching a man and wife drive or walk or stand or sit at the table doing nothing. You almost want them to get to the end with the rest of the planet, just because they are bored to death. <br /> <br /> If you really do not like Chris Lee or sci-fi with a low budget of the 1970s, I'd give him this. They fall into that narrow range of unnecessary celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
