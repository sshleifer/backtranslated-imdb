I can not believe how this movie is uneducated. It's like watching a police academy, except for people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot to be a side-by-side. I understand the suspension of mistrust, but it's just a stupid thing. Not only is there no plot to this film. It's like watching someone pretending to be a doctor, throwing babbling words as if they were the chief of staff in a large medical facility. People wearing clothes that are not suitable for the space program. I feel I'm watching the movie in Valley-girls "b" in the universe.
