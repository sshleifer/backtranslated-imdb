I usually appear on this web site before I go to the cinema because I like what other people see on the film. I've read many reviews that said, "Thriller is not a horror movie." It encouraged me to try this movie. I have to deal with these "thriller / horror" statements because it was not! I almost went and asked for my money back, and if a lot of reviewers enjoyed this waste ... well, you have to be easily pleased! At the end of the film, people told me loudly, "What a waste of time," I turned to them and said, "I could not sum it up better." I was still waiting for something to happen ... but no. There was the potential for a lot of good worries (or excitement if you like) but nothing happened. Williams did it quite well, but I felt he was simply changed by a bad script that had faded away and did not go anywhere. Save your money, this is Turkey, which will be in the very near future to feature in the DVD deal "bargaining box".
