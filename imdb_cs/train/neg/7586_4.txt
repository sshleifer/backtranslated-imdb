The Summer Holiday is a forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's "Ah Wilderness," and deserves a Broadmee Take Me Along musical adaptation. With the exception of Stanley Steamer's song, none of Harry Warren-Ralph Blane's songs are forgotten and even questionable. <br /> <br /> Right after the release of this movie, MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey played 26 years as Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was just too old for a part of the 17-year-old who was influencing radical thoughts in the spirit of a teen rebellion. Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this time Killer McCoy's remake of Robert Taylor's Crowd Roars, love laughs with Andy Hardy's lyrics and music. In all of them, Rooney played the adult part. Even in Andy Hardy, Mickey played Adult Hardy Andy, who returned from World War II. Why was Louis B. Mayer aware of that? <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad casting makes Summer Holidays even worse because in Wil Wilderness's original emphasis is placed on the character of his father played here by Walter Huston. And on Broadway's Take Me Along, which won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, starred in Big Brown's brother-in-law Sid, who played Frank Morgan here, and is a central character. Gloria DeHaven enters Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet and cute girlfriend, and Marilyn Maxwell plays a girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original game, O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but this was Hollywood from the Code, so all Marilyn makes her a young Rooney neighbor. A lot of genuinely gifted people had one hand and they do the best, but summer holidays will quickly disappear in the cold autumn.
