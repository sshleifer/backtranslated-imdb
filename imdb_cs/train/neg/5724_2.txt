I agree with the last reviewer that this movie was terrible. Yes, there was a lot of gore and some nudes. But it was overshadowed by the slow moving, insignificant plot and the stupid end. Where was it to be shot: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend to see that instead. The technical harassment I had with the DVD is that if you turn off the Spanish subtitles, it will return to several scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Do not waste time on the removed scenes because there is no sound and it looks like just a footage.
