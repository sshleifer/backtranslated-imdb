Although the film takes place at the Ivy League, it was actually filmed exclusively in northern Arizona, mostly at North Arizona University in Flagstaff in the autumn of 1976. I attended the theater department and most of the others in the film are members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely absurd scene in this movie (if you know your geography of Arizona) that shows several cast members riding bicycles from high school to the creek. We NAU'ers know that the campus and the mentioned Creek (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 kilometers apart, and while the trip there is all downhill, it would literally NOT RIDING BIKE back on the same path!
