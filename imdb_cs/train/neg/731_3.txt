Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of Father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike collects a group of his friends in a family cabin in the Halloween party forest. While playing a game where guests admit and confront their worst fears ... Mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father. It is soon discovered that Morty's ghost in the dwelling resides in a wooden Indian. The statue comes to life and the bloodbath begins. Most F / X is not very convincing and the movie captures a cheap teen slasher theme. The old story was pitiful. Cast members include: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon, and veteran Betsy Palmer.
