I just saw this movie (mainly because there is Brady Corbet) and I must say that I was not satisfied. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics were amazing, but the story needed a bit of retouching. I also think this movie would do much better with other curses and blood, even if it was rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> It would certainly attract more people to see it -> teens. What would also attract more adolescents (especially teenage girls) would be a great close up of Brady Corbett on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Although the movie had its points, I still saw it and thought it was all right!
