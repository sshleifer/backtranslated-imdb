I am generous and I give this film two stars. The line about "You've even seen a wizard from oz" was the best part for me! with horrible writing and acting as shown in this movie, it's no wonder that so many people have received a worthless TV reality show. make a favor and get out of the house and attack the royal baseball game, you will be glad you did!
