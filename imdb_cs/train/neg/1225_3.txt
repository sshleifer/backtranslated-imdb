Well, let me start by saying how this movie is absolutely HILARIUS, I just could not let myself laugh at its utter stupidity. Do not get me wrong, BASSINGER is very good at acting, but the script is simple, but the mind is really sorry. The premise is good, and until Della actually testifies to the murder he is interested in, but only goes down the hill. In the middle of the movie, the protagonist pulls out his set of tools and, of course, instead of lobbying on the head, he decides to pull out a screwdriver, a car jack, and finally a flare (like a sinking ship) to kill their victims. <br /> <br /> Then it's the last line I promise if it's not in the stitches, then I'll eat my own left leg. I recommend this film to those who just want to laugh in some good old-fashioned, horrifying movie. I can also recommend that you watch the scene in the yard, that the guy who falls from one leg of a high wooden board always gets me.
