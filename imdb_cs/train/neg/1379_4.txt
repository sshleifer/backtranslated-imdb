The Showbiz of Satire Monica Mitchell has some laughter and some sophisticated violence. I would not say it would be blood; but it is an insult and an injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a distinguished actor who has an extremely adaptable presence on the screen, but has a tremendous amount of experience with being selected for the parts he is driving. He is always a producer's nephew or a seemingly trivial reason why he has not been granted the role he is looking for. Well, the best thing is to get rid of the competition ... Max gets obsessed with such thoughts. A rewarding career is just a swing, a print and a shot. Other cast members include Ren√© Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini, and Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, this is a show business ... or is it it?
