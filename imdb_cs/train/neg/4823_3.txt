The Lame plot and two-dimensional script have created characters like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, it was difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters, especially for the fiancee; He looked and behaved more like a cartoon. In a nutshell, I think you could say it is on the same level as your typical television track. Uses almost every cliche in the book. A tortured classical musician who wants to say goodbye and play salsa. The carefree fianc√©e deals with the personality of the "beans" they do not love. I will not write them, otherwise it would be a spoiler because I would give out the whole conspiracy. The dance was fine, but nothing special. I saw even worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was really tense. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see it in the theater. I'm still a little shocked by how many great reviews this movie admired.
