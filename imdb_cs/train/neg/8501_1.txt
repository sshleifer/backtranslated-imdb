<br /> <br /> This movie takes a long time. It reminded me of the Resurrection film (Christopher Lambert), which I also considered extremely boring. And "Semana Santa" is in any case even worse. <br /> <br /> The only good film to do for this movie is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great old ladies in European film history. I loved her manic appearance in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). They will not spend more time dealing with this film. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
