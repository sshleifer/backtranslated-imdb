This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I looked at it mainly from morbid curiosity because I loved a novel and I wish I did not do it. After less than an hour, I switched it off, although I wanted to turn off after five minutes. I wish I had. The novel ignores too much and changes all sorts of factors. If the movie was unable to redeem it in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), then I would not answer it in any way. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not think, as many people say, that it is that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily inevitable, but this particular handover could be done without. Almost one day I would notice the director and screenwriter who can do it fairly.
