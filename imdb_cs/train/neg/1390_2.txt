I'm a big fan of B5 when I caught him only at the end of season three. I have faithfully watched all previous similarities when he was syndicated and came to the conclusion that it was one of the most sophisticated narrative arcs ever hit by television. Even the filling episodes were interesting. Also, the films were well-produced and entertaining as spectators. <br /> <br /> Who brings us to the 'river of souls'. Of course, when I saw everything else, I had high expectations. It seems that Martin Sheen acts in Ed Wood rather than a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself could look good in contour, even got into a short story. However, of course, it suffers when it comes to fulfilling this term in a two-hour film. There are no special effects that would entertain us in the complete absence of a compelling story. There are places where there was obviously a lack of time and just improvised dialogue to fill the story out. If it happened in the regular season, it would be the worst of the episodes.
