I saw this movie at the London premiere and I must say - I did not expect much, but I expected something that was at least slightly fun. The original "basic instinct" was not a great movie and it's still something "sad classic," but it was fun. I can remember that I saw countless times playing TV channels on a late Friday or Saturday night and found out that I was going to start doing it. But this chaos-brain, waaay-delayed sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still gorgeous? Well, let's do it this way - for a 47 year old, it's very hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. Apparently, she also had a plastic surgery on her face and her hairstyle in this movie is somewhat uncomfortable. It does not look like soft, genuine, or innocent as it is in the original - which is the very different reason why the evil snuff is and what is not. Remaining performances range from bad to horrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (typically a safe director - one who does not always do a great job but can make films) has officially released his first real turkey; the film so bad that people laughed at certain moments that were to be serious. I have heard that the film has gone through several editing sessions and it is very clear from the start. Nothing makes much sense. The whole conspiracy is a cosmic mess and the end - oh! Talk about stupid and unbelievable. (I still saw it.) I saw "Gigli," I saw "Son of Mask" - and although I do not look at the "blurring" of this film, I can say by my authority (which I do not have to agree with at all, to these films before this catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Stone left five minutes before the movie began, and people in the theater began to throw things on the screen during an extremely offensive and offensive scene inside an orgy nightclub. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - basically it was also a piss.
