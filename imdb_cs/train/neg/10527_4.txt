I found this movie at a PPE retailer. And this is definitely the PPE. One year after The Exorcist is back in business with this film, but what we all were new was that Blair's career never escaped, never becoming a star. This is one of the reasons why many of her films are PPE. In this film he gives good performance. It's a refusal that parents do not recognize and has no friends. She plays at the age of 15 when she plays a girl at the age of 14, that's funny. The film is also known for the scene of rape in showers, keeping broomsticks up to her virginity. In most editions it's cut out why, I do not know, no blood is needed, well, Blair's butt bare, but nothing is shown, no T & A anything that would offend people. The film is slow, very slow. It's not a pleasure for me, but I almost fell asleep. It's just that 14 years of being rebellious against society, but no blood flow, no gore anything. Why it is categorized in horror is still a miracle for me. If you are a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it, otherwise leave it as it is.
