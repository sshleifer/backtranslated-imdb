I really wanted to like this movie, but so much of it is stolen / borrowed from another job - some loans are painfully spectacular. The New York Times has shown that their singing frog is remarkably reminiscent of one in the famous Warner Brothers cartoon ("Hello my baby, hello my dear, hello my ragtime gal ..."). But I urge everyone to watch the animated Fox / Blue Sky Robots (2005) and find no ridiculous similarities: the story - the young inventor grew up and one innovative company distributes all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> Cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture an extremely similar futuristic urban environment. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... Robinson's robot robot has a similar design to robots, and both films use a retro-futuristic look. All this seems to be in sharp contrast to the disconcerting Disney price at the end, which suggests that the company was a permanent innovator who will never return (which is also in contradiction with its overall catalog of films in the 1990s, which were more clones than each other, with some minor improvements for storyline and ethnic affiliation.) Directors seem to be unable to let the story speak for themselves, and instead constantly send objects and sounds of flying in our direction as though we have no regard for the span no less. The villain is really well-designed and greatly revived, and he is happy to watch. Much of the rest of the movie seems to be mass. Some countries look like CGI since the mid-1990s. The film actually opens the classic Mickey Mouse short. At the end of this cartoon, we remind you that Disney has never had much interest in innovation or good narration - he seems to think that just something on the big screen is a good proof of their virtue.
