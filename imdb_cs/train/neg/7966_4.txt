CREEPSHOW 2 is an unfortunate sequel to CREEPSHOW's original film, George Romer (overrated). Every sequel to Romero, which is not controlled by Romer himself, has some big boots to fill, mostly because of the Romero fans who think he is God. I did not like the first movie and it was fun, but I did not care for the sequel. The film series had so much potential, but it was short-lived because both films were less stellar. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with CREEPSHOW 2 was that he had only three stories (except the story between us) and since the first story was exhausted, he left just about half the film to be really good. I saw CS 2 in the movies and the first segment was a real supporter. Something dramatic with George "I can not act" Kennedy is automatically condemned and the story of the Indian statue was too hockey and he just did not belong in this sequel. So after a really tedious and boring beginning there were only two other stories to reverse the fiasco of the broken start, and unfortunately, the other two stories were not big enough to forget the first story. RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER are slightly successful, slightly, because even though the other two segments have their moments, they are still disintegrating. The last two stories are basically extended for too long. It's not that I wanted the stories to become dizzy and they ended quickly, but the two good ideas that appeared in these stories were canceled by the fact that they were slow and cushioned and eventually disappeared when the segments had to be more energetic, more irregular and punchy endings. Also, if the last two stories were not filmed, or if all three segments were much clearer, with better editing and direction, they could add to the fourth interesting fourth story. They have only three padded segments for boring feasts. The acting and writing in both RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER is from terrible to good. I like Lois Chiles in the last segment. It's probably her best moment on the screen next to the role of Bond Girl Holly Goodhead in MOONRAKER and SMRT NA NILU. But even her roles are sometimes difficult to understand because of the serving direction and the blurred story. Should we hate or sympathize with her? Should we sympathize with an annoying hater? If the tracker's body was found by other people along the way, what was it like when Chilesa attacked? Was it a ghost or a zombie or what? How did the body finally leave the presence of the other people who found him dead to attack Chiles? The whole thing is not too clear even for the supernatural story. And the end is rather boring and insignificant. Regarding the infamous THE RAFT story, acting is mostly on a terrible side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting. The characters would be more interesting if the actors played themselves. None of the actors is convincing in their specific roles. Paul Satterfield looks smarter than the stupid block he plays, and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not too convincing as a typical horrified bitch. She seems to be too shy. The same can be said of the other two who play "plain" teens. The idea of ​​killer oil is interesting and scary but not well done. It should be the fifth story, maybe a homeless or ranger lurking around the lake and knowing about an oil spill, and it could be a water monster alter ego of that kind. As spooky as an oil spill, it is not for a convincing "character". And as the story ends, everything seems unnecessary. No hit on it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CS 2 is more rental material than something you pay to appear on the big screen.
