"In the tradition of" Carrie "and" Heathers ", try the" non-murderous ripoff of not only the two films, but also "Evil Dead" and "The Shining." This means they really do bad horror movies like this one Rainbow Harvest is a substitute for Winona here, and although she barely makes more than mumble her lines (and occasionally shouts, "You're UGLY !!!" into her haunted mirror), she's Goth so sooner than that fashionable, so you have to respect it (And she's also quite creative about the accessories with black leather scarves and a kind of black spray painted with a hawaiian hat.) Karen Black overcomes but is not completely without dignity, and you can not help her but sympathy with her. (If you're not sure my friend who asked, "Who is that, the horse's lips from" MASH "?" First appeared on the screen.) There are decent supporting performances by Kristin Dattilo (like a square and Ricky Paull Goldin (in his brand name) and William 'Larry, Darryl and Darryl' Sanderson (like a pet or something). But it is sad to see once Yvonne DeCarlo once smoked and played what could only be considered part of Charlotte Rae. The 1980s were a boom for the merry, sad stupid horror. "Mirror, Mirror" belongs to the last of its kind. It's definitely worth a look.
