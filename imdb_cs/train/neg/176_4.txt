<br /> <br /> I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel. Then he appeared right after the first. For some reason, I did not care about this movie. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Well ... It was funny how this guy got involved in filming the movie. In the first film, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequel, half of the killing / attempts at killing were essentially unreasonable. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, captured co-writers due to creative differences, but in terms of trying to kill the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to "look really real when they died"? If this is a high budget, use the special MAN effects. Of course, as the first, the captured girl gets away and Stanley finally gets into a bad state and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This film has the potential of HAD. And the saddest of all ... really sad part ... I would have looked at the "Cabin by Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he is the only good part of this sequel.
