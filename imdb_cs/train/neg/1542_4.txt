was this meadow the first acting role in the movie? the character, leon, is fun enough, but shortly thereafter sexual jokes and humor are too stupid to listen to. some movies can get away with sexual jokes, and set up your audience to know the right when the ad appears. some movies that do it are American Pie and Scary Movie. the scary movie was stupid, and the American pie would not do well without sexual jokes. the only role, except for Leon, who had some humor that followed, would be that she would ask. the figure was really stupid and that was all, stupid humor was all that was watching me. the movie was fine and nothing else. I dont really understand why snl people dying to leave the show always get a movie based on the character they played on the show. jumping takes about 5 minutes, and if they can shoot a 5-minute skit, what kind of world is coming? molly shannon had a superstar, cheri o'terri had a haunted film, but she was not the lead role and will have an elf. but that was good, but he did some stupid film, but I can not remember, and mike myers with wayne world. how are the creators of mad television channels never getting movie stores? they saw only one guy, but only two films and a television show with Andy Dick. but the guy relies on comedy to keep going, funny or not. this movie is not good, but has some positive humor. what is the waste of film and people's money.
