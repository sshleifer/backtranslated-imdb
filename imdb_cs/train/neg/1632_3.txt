The apparent vanishing project for Karina Mani (which?), How hot, Charles Bronson is going around erasing the "dirt" that killed her parents or grandparents or something similar and impressing young hunks with her karate skills. In the main scene, he intervenes to stop the rape, and the mad policeman puts him in jail, so after a few cold showers and some failed prison sentences, he has to take the law into his hands of blah blah. I think there were a lot of similar movies there? The script is more stupid than usual if you believe it. Mani looks exactly like a type of showbiz that would co-create his own Death Wish, who plays a role, and that guy is sporadically cute, but the film is a ungainly apparatus. The relevant actors would be unnecessarily lost in roles that could be dirty and would actively undermine the fantastic judgment and the incompetent DA and the judge who must be the uncle of the producer.
