In no case is this movie as bad as 'Perfect Stranger', but it just was not fun. She could not hold on to one type of comedy - she jumped out of SNL, Adam Sandler-esquire, into romance, to a small boy scoring, to a pile, to "Loser" (comedy) kinds of comedies. Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments (falling down the hill), no one was a very special fun or excellent in any case. "Schindler's list" was more fun (and felt shorter). You never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, a school run or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek, in the worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, a serious actor, if I only had to name one, got his crap to read it in the camera. The story stretches and is completely predictable until the end (no spoilers where Adam Samberg wants to see it). Do not Miss ANY money to see this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels gets help and start producing quality (yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are Quality) movies.
