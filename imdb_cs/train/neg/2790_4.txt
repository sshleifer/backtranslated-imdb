Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Mange) and son Alex to spend several days with her family on Savage Island, which is their own island. The couple expect to solve their problems during the weekend on a remote island. While waiting for the ship, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) comes in, she explains that the family is hillbilly squatters on the island. Reckless Peter smokes driving the car at night and switches off the light to show up; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage family, but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alexa as a replacement for his lost son. The young family does not accept business and initiates a deadly war between families. "Savage Island" is a very low budget movie, with a silly screenplay, amateur cinematography, but surprisingly good acting. The bad story is totally absurd and there are many incredible situations. For example, how would two men leave two women with a child alone on the road during the night with the threat of an agitated family? The logical process would instantly draw the continent and bring the cops to save Peter. The young family will disappear; Julia and Steven leave their car on the continent and their house and friends, and nobody goes through them? Peter will call his sister Julia from Alex when he comes with the boat at the beginning. There are so many mistakes in this slide that I could spend many rows on this topic. I believe this movie was shot with a home video camera so the pictures are horrible. Good occupation deserved better work. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Blood Island")
