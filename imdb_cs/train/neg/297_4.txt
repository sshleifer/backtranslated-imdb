For the record, this film is interesting, but its origin is hardly original. Back in 1998 the film starring Talia Shire called Landlady had almost exactly the same conspiracy, but with younger characters. The story is Amanda Lear has a bad life, an abusive father, a horny doctor, mental homes, etc. She is finally released from a happy house under the direction of her perverse doctor ... which she abuses and kills a poor boy. (now it was original) The doctor funded her residence before she killed him and buried him in the backyard. After moving, she falls in love with a well named Richard, who has just married a blues singer. If you saw Landlady, you know the rest, kill or try to kill anyone who is between her and Richard (including roadie). Much of the idea comes from the previous movie, the same idiot assistant that holds him in his nose, as well as spying on a boy with a popcorn bowl, the same flying body fist. It had some original material, the thing about beer was brutal. The top of the film was the beautiful Amanda breasts in the upper stage. Somewhat ripoff, but not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
