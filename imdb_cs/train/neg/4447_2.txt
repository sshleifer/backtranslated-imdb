Yes, there are worse movies. Most of them were made for fun, budget shoe cords or as t.v. film of the week, but even if it was a movie of the week, he would not count more than two stars. It's a bad film about a serious subject, which represents an abused woman who escapes the king of the slim people into the protective hands of the king's enraged people. (If it's an attempt to show that he does not need a man to protect it, the man is a super film and should not be in it at all). She has no tension, no character development, and no heroine that Rotton onions could overcome. (I think he'll flush his wedding ring on a ship with a separate tank, rather than just across the deck in the ocean (where her body should be the same) and after her husband finds out and proves to be crazy he still makes childhood prerequisites , which almost kills her.) I'm always surprised to see a sort of generally high rating of the movie that happens like that, and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market for people who would be challenged by his work. After what I did in humanity, I cried.
