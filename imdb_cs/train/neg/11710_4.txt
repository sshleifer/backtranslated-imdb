There is only one reason why you can look at this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or producers: actress Nichole Hiltz. It's a show in this slowly moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge. Director Simon Gornick shot Joyce Hyser as a betrayed woman who chose to avenge her wives. Oh, but not by conventional means. She plans a complete guerrilla war and recruits a poor girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon. She wants Nichole (like Tuesday) to get to her ex (handsome but boring Stephan Jenkins, who should keep the music) to shame him and destroy his life. David DeLuise is good in a few short moments, and former star Anthony Dennison's "Crime Story" has practically nothing to do but annoyance. Hiltz on the other side looks like sexy and playful at different times, then bad and awkward. She also handles vulnerable and "maybe a bit psychotic" well. She is also quite hot (although there are no dirty bits of the show), so you can understand how she could get on any guy whose goal it is. Performance is unnecessarily lost in this movie, which is simply unusual or interesting enough to recommend.
