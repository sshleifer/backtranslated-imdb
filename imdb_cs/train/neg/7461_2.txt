*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From its initial credits this fantastic film sets the record straight: it's an instant classic. It does not take long before we realize that this film is bigger, bigger than the "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy" 7. "His utter grandeur left me speechless when I left the cinema and went back to the ticket counter so I could The first track will surely leave you with the strange 'Huh' feeling, but it does not feel embarrassed - it's going to be the best of us The story is so diabolically smart that you have to interested in the mortality of its authors It seems to be a simple story of an idiot that infiltrates the FBI, it turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life.Complexity of the land structure disturbs you at first viewing , but do not give up! Until my sixth or seventh point I began to reveal only some secret secret "Corky Romano". watch out for an unexpected intervention at the end, otherwise you might be completely caught when it comes out that FBI agent Brick Davis is the most wanted FBI criminal, Corky is not a real agent of the FBI, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he's illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the box as a homosexual. I was surprised that I could do it, I can tell you a lot. Chris Cattane's talent comedy is unrivaled when he leads his Corky Romano character through a maze of completely unpredictable situations. Recalling the performance of John Reynolds in "Manos, the Hand of Destiny", Kattan takes over a myriad of personalities and solves all scenes with perfect comedy timing. Kattan, however, is not just a comedy. He is also a master drama because he controls the feelings of the audience with the smallest movements of his face. His expression on his face reflects life on his own. For example, in a scene where he falls into the faces of his brothers, you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflecting on his terrible face. At a time like this, it's hard to find a dry eye in the house. Scenarists David Garret and Jason Ward are real heroes of "Corky Romano". With a story of such dimensions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers have been employed to complete this ambitious project. Their clever story and unorthodox structuring makes Pulp Fiction an average Saturday Night Live skit. Garret and Ward's story is so convincing and appealing to catch your hair, swallow you, shudder around you, and spit on you. At the end of this experience, called "Corky Romano", you will meet another person with different views on the world and different thoughts and only one question in mind: <br /> <br /> Why, God? Why?!?
