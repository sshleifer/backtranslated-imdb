Jason Lee does the best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just can not make a connection. Maybe because the character Julia Stiles seems unpleasant because she will soon be a cousin and a sexy cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because she and the Selma Blair characters have to be set in the opposite direction. (Selma Blair looks much nicer than Julia). Either way, this film is another trivialisation of the Hollywood case, perhaps in the real world (the fact that you are going to catch your legs at your bachelor party, your cousin) who will not make the promise. <br /> <br /> There are certain laughs to make sure and cast (although miscast) do the best with subclass material that does not go beyond its ruthless theme. So instead of getting a successful festive fest (ie Animal House or American Pie), we remain the center of humor and some of the stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something).
