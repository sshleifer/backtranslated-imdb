I loved the apprentice for the first two seasons. But now is season 5? (or it's 6?), things just become too tiring. <br /> <br /> I liked the show, but it became my own ego Donald Trumps. He gave him his company for you to work on, but keep going! Some of the things that says, "You are FIRED" is just an insult. After watching the show I would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or such. It's just that the show is unrealistic and the way it treats me just stiffens me. Good entertainment? YES, but tedious because the backstroke is so tired .. not his teamwork, not his personal, his simply business. look at the rear connector.
