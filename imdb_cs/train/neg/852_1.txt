I'm going to keep this short.This "adaptation" of the King's wonderful book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course there are many fans of Kubrick and Nickolson on this site, and as a result, this movie mysteriously finds its way in the top 250. Jack Nicholson is ridiculous like Torrance and likewise is Shelley Duvall. A story that has nothing to do with the book is a disjointed mess, and characters Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who did not read the book and wanted to understand the characters of this story: keep up with the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and people who say that Kubrick has all the right to destroy the king's story because the King is ... not a good writer who should hold reviews of "masterpieces" like "wide-eyed".
