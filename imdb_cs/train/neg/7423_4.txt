Las Vegas Lady really has nothing to say. It's pretty harmless, but it's nothing more than a boring heist film of the 70's. The film is not as smart or sexy as it tries to be. The task is to restore the tired old story of a robbery in the casino that was at the end of death. Except for Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was designed for three years. Does the plan include three women? one unnecessarily and clearly seen from the outside of the Cicus Circus, the one who serves as a waitress just to bite her for the first time and one to stand around to reveal her split. That's quite a lot. It's complicated, right? Apart from Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in this plot are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady works with Stuart Whitman. When Stevens is not used, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun battles ever shot on the film. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. It is that the 70s feel like I always like some nice shots from Las Vegas around 1975. But the movie itself is too boring to rate any higher than 4/10 ?? and this is likely to be overstated. Finally, Las Vegas Lady is the loss of some perfectly good fission.
