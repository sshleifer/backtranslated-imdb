Do you know when you are in the bus and someone decides to tell you your life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is crazy and go away? Well, I had a similar feeling watching this movie. Well, actually, I decided to go for Aprile and I knew about Nanna Moretti's taste that I was the only star from Caro Diaria, but about half an hour later this last payment of my memories I wanted to give Morettim the madra of all the slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual and at least a few other characters managed to get a word on the edge. But in Aprile, Moretti has the exclusive right to dialogue, so everything you hear in an hour and a half is a high whining about what his policy is best about, or an unpredictable piece of popular culture that attracts his imagination right now. He also realizes that it's time to pull down the movies he does not like, something I thought was reserved for the losers like me. Sure you're in a position like his, you think he's going to try a little smarter cinema. By creating a suitable film that has some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that is not completely controlled by its annoying voice. And when he started to run over my newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, the most fearless film director with a strange passion for lazy music. The next time someone you do not know tries to tell you their life story, give it to them. Each wound will be a small victory in the fight against Morettitis.
