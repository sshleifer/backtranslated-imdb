This film barely watched the story of the film. All the fascinating points of the book did not exist in the movie. Eventually they ended up being "crushed" in the form of a "blind" Disney film between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that Hillary Duff should play a role or one of them. This film was nothing but an insult to the book's intelligence and mysticism. I can not believe Disney could even get away by making such a cheap, basic edition. If you've ever read a book, I think you would agree that it could easily get into the movie "The Lord of the Rings". This movie should never be able to use the title A wrinkles in time. Badly done.
