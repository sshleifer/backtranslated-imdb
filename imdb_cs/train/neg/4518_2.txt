Several films have lost expectations and annoyed me just like fire. The film is a heavy waste. It does not achieve anything at the artistic level. The only thing she has been able to get is a ban in India. If it were only because of the poor quality of film making rather than actual disputes, the ban would be justifiable. Now that I'm worried about my system, I'm more capable of analyzing the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning, the movie feels unreal, especially when protagonists start to speak in English. The director, of course, shot the film for an Indian audience; nevertheless, underestimated its international audience by simplifying it. Tracking the character of home help that is done in perfect English is too unreal to be true. Next, we come to Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come crazy and prevent the flow of the film. I am still interested in the philosophical dialogue associated with the story. I felt surrealism was lost. Love felt like voyeuristic, and they are probably intended for the audience rather than a powerful saying. In no case do they reach either of the two. The names chosen for women Radha and Sita are the names of the Hindu deities and were therefore chosen to shock the audience. However, since the film was not intended primarily for Indian audiences, choosing a name-by-name shock is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the direction is very poor and some key and fine scenes have been poorly processed. A better director could make a strong emotional drama from this topic. <br /> <br /> * The effect felt woody, although Nandita Das brought some life into the role, the others were lost. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not visible in this movie. The men were all garbage. If you are a fan of Earth and want to see more director, stay out of this. Please.
