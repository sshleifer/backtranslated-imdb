This film has some fatal mistakes about how someone could go through the open back door of a highly secure medical facility, it's incredible. Then the same person walks around the device and enters the Dr.'s office, it's a bad writing or a bad editing. <br /> <br /> Very very predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this film was shot, except that he was shot in Canada and probably received a government grant. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the person who plays Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> If you are not really bored and there is nothing else on TV, it will kill some time, but otherwise, it's a movie that no actor wants to have in his life.
