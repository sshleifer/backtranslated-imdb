This movie is really nothing but a well-crafted series of tense sequences tied up with the inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. There really is no character development and no real conspiracy to talk about. There are only the most skeletal motivations for characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their inevitable courts. It's all but an excuse to show a terrifying baby ghost (which looks like he got some of the family cats mixed in his ectoplasm) and his spirit mother (with long black hair hanging in the face like a "ring") take down a bunch of cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying immediately, but not really what you should live. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
