I have been watching this movie for a long time (about 10 years) and liked it then. I remembered it was day and decided to watch again. The second time was not pleasant. The act is "so," the plot is illogical, inappropriate and predictable. Acting acting ... I'm sure that for the actresses it was not a section that would have played those characters. Give ... in hell it is impossible that those women get away with the first robbery much less than the other. (Side note: Why did not TT realize that even if she came with the load date, she would ask where she had it and she would have no logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a shit!). Striking stereotypical black women basically said that the only way black women could "defeat the system" or get a lot of money was to steal and not use their intelligence or other resources. It's playing too sympathetically, because they all die in the end (bar Jada), but that's not sad (you think they were so stupid they deserve to die). You just do not care about those characters unless you're a shallow person. I can not believe that this film is more than 5 years old.
