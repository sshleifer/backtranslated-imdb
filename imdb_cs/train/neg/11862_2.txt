This movie probably had something for someone; my confusion is how these utterly prosaic dysfunctional themes are still making theaters, it's as if thoughts are recycled just because they are generations. True suspects, who are behind most films, are like dogs, coming back to absorb their own vomiting. Well, now they are richer for me. It was not imaginative at all, there was no redeemed moment, the trailer showed that there was nothing fun on the trailer (and the trailer was not fun), the performances were tense (especially Molly, absolutely unconvincing). Theoretically, it was supposed to be a comic relief, he was a homoerotic friend with affection for Disney movies; none of his analogies got home, his little moral expressions were flat, I literally waited for him to say something meaningful just to find that he was done. The so-called "Hard 10" is the most insipid plastic creature there (except that the horse has a similar face with a strange smile); I honestly found my friend Patty (referred to as Hamburglar), who would be much better than she. But again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Anyway, the whole idea is that society is superficial and if love is true, it goes beyond all social facades; as they showed it, with the stick of the shit devil another and a million times crippled and beaten to death by the premature ejaculation of the routine (with obvious cues for American pie and happiness - the other in the disgusting scenario of a family dog). I feel that the film is like adjacent ridiculous jokes into an unformed crazy sphere of raw waste water. Going to show up on the market, pushing anything out there, lighting up any small meat and calling it gold, people come (they work for me). Done with the tired.
