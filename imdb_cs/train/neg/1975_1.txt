To be totally honest, I have not seen many Western films, but I've seen so much to know what's good. This is probably the worst western on the planet today. First black people in the wild west? Come on! Whoever thought it might be cold from a wall movie that everyone would love was moderate, not no, totally retarded! Secondly, in these days, women, especially black women, were not vulnerable to wearing or using weapons. Asian cat speaks perfectly English? If the setting is Western, Asia is not where you would go. Finally, the evil gay cat was too much a movie was just stupid from the start. Now do not think wrong I'm not a racist or a white man, do not cover up after reading this, but this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of the black people I've ever seen!
