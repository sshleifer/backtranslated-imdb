This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It is a curious film from the Second World War and serves as a statement about racism. It is worth watching to understand that films reflect how we feel about the problems they are producing, not the time they are displayed. That is, it's the 70th film, which is not the 40th film (WW2). Still, there are some good scenes from seven seven blacks led by a white captain who is trying to capture the dam. The story focuses on the fact that captains learn that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could come from the film Civil War and not WW2, which reflects what the film is all about. The black lieutenant gives German women the face of their innocent skin, and the white captain is upset. I liked the film out of curiosity because the stars and the genre were interested in me.
