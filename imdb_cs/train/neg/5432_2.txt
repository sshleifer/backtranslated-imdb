The battleship sinks ... Its survivors, hanging on a nearby lifeboat, sit there and do nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashes. Although the name of Noel Coward is just one that you will notice during credits, everything in the movie is due to Lean. And for technical reasons, it's very good. David Lean just KNEW movies from get-go. There are many moments when Coward's studied dialogue takes second place and Lean's visual sense occupies a center stage. Try troops to get out of the boat near the end, and the whole scene; watching the shots to sing the hymn, the scene where we are inside the house that gets bombed. Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is absolutely wooden, without emotion, character or humanity. You see in his eyes that he really does not listen to what another artist says, just waiting for them to end up to break his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. /> <br /> His episodic, a bit repetitive, and memories overwhelm the story: there is no central story that would evolve, it simply gave a general look to the characters. An interesting movie per hour - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a deep or penetrating film, and certainly a propaganda film, but also a showcase of Lean's editing skills - all about how pieces get together.
