Until now, the worst movie I've ever seen is Ben & Arthur. You really should review reviews of this movie instead of this one. The statistical overviews of this film were distorted by a positive attitude by the tireless and ruthless pressure of some of the people who participated in it, which is proof for which it is easy to uncover online. At least, the people who made Ben & Arthur were so honest to let them stand on their own restless legs, instead of blaming them, so they buy me as I buy it. Everything about this movie is horrible, script, story, casting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else goes into the movie? Whatever it is, it's as bad as it turns out. If it was not so unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I was still looking at how he thought he had to improve because I did not know that none of the positive reviews were reliable. It will not be a lot of money to make a great movie, nor a low budget means the movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a great budget masterpiece is the amazing Little Noche Gus Van Sant, but there are many others. Seideline Secrets? Director Cut or Original? It's bad not because the people who did it had no money but because they had a huge ego and no talent for anything at all, except for their own promotion.
