Perhaps one of the most overvalued so-called horrific classics ever made, Halloween is the unforgettable Michael Myers and some great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis. However, its traceability factor is very close to zero because there is an unforgivable amount of time spent in the dark / climax of current events. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that you can walk away from microwave popcorn and do not miss anything at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> Thank God, Rob Zombie does it. And generally I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> It will surely overcompensate all the random fill-in times with some special curiosities the original is seriously lacking. <br /> <br /> It's the movie we feel we like, as well as the way we teach us that we should enjoy Dickens. Do not suppose it's a classic.
