A group of friends come face to face with a family of vulnerable cannibals while camping in the beautiful German countryside. The concept of a "mutant cannibal family" is almost as old as the hills that inborn janitors often call home, so every director who tries to breathe new life into the genre must come up with something special to impress. With Barricada, Timo Rose will try to give a well-worn routine teutonic turn by moving the event to the Black Forest and providing German low-budget spraying. The result is a very bloody but totally non-original effort that is almost unacceptable due to inconspicuous overhead decisions, in particular continuous use of elaborate filters and irritating editing techniques. Should Timo Rose decide not to use every diesel trick offered by his editing software, then Barricade could be a reasonably entertaining gore-fest: his inexperienced performance is quite good; bloody effects are suitably stomach churning; and there are one or two fears and even some well-designed spooky moments. All of this, however, is completely destroyed by a terrible camera, torn editing, and a stunning barrage of visual tricks that give the film a desperate look that is so inexplicably popular with today's film makers. <br /> <br /> I give the barricade 3 out of 10 purely for an extraterrestrial gore that includes a skillful scene where one is forced to drink acid, lots of ugly wounds caused by various sharp tools and some pretty decent shotgun damage.
