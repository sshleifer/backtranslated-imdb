When I read all these positive reviews, I found myself confused. How come so many people have been using what I consider to be a miserable alteration of Jane Austen's second favorite novel? There are many issues in the movie that have already been mentioned in several reviews. Simply put, it's a swinging, exaggerated, chaotic mess from opening credits to the end. <br /> <br /> While many characters are misplaced and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette give a performance that is worthy of them, the worst is far from Paltrow. In some roles I enjoyed her performance very much, but here she is hideous - she is herself, nose, silly and completely disconnected from her characters and the people around her. A very disappointed effort - though the perfect Emma could not save the film.
