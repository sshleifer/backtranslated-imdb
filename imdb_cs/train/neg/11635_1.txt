Okay, this is a short and sweet review ... Something that the film should train has made life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason why there was a petition with more than 40,000 signatures. They all wanted Uwe Boll to stop making franchise films that people liked. Blood Rayne is a biggie there. <br /> <br /> Jokes are good ... if you have never heard PRINT before. Action acting is a descent, but it can only blame the scenario. Even a few moments I wonder if they even use the script. The film has little to do with original games. HELLO, if you played games and realize that the main character has no real motivation beyond the murderous calls, such as mass murder, because he scrambled a toe or a simulator. There's too much story for such a silly movie. as I said. I would not even steal this movie. And for the person who says it's "The Most Interesting Film of 2007" .......... you need to look around, the news is better than this.
