Maybe not, but it's terrible. Even a fantastic cast can not save it. OK, I admit it was quite fun, but it seemed to fall down as the girls jumped into the generals' house. Bill Murray turned away from being a quick, humorous, humorous guy who was screaming at people in the street who were simply not funny, as if trying too hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (RV? Come ...) and ends up as a national hero after invading another country and killing God knows how many soldiers, laughing. One good point is that this film shows the insufficiency and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and stupid they are, albeit unintentionally. I really felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda bull could actually be released.
