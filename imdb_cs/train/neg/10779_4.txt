I found this film to be a complete disappointment. The talents of the director - particularly Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria, and Alan Arkin (without mentioning the four main options) - were completely unnecessary to the unfortunate, average story whose conclusion was one that was fed into horrible stereotypical characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is simply unpleasant (it seems to repeat it from high fidelity except for humor), Crystal is just playing the same old hyperactive, nervous, annoying alter-ego, and Cusack simply goes through his part, apparently bored with the whole project. For what is to be a "romantic comedy," there is absolutely no romance among the central figures, let alone chemistry, and in terms of comedy (maybe SPOILERS), only moments of mild humor appeared in the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - a screenwriter apparently incapable of proving any originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably entertaining because the Mexican lover and Walken made a pretty funny turn like a dogma-maverick-dogme-like parody - but these parts were a very short time on the screen, and instead we were treated to Billy Crystal with his the dog's long eyes. Pure genius. For a huge fan of most of John Cusack's work, not to mention the remnant of the fantastic cast, I was completely released by a movie with lots of good ideas and at the same time reluctantly exploring or processing some of them, instead of resorting to the same old genre clich√©s and even declining to the depths of almost "rough" teen-film "humor at times. <br /> <br /> Very bad 4/10.
