The only great thing about the movie is its name. In this case, "Snake On and Plane" is an example of the book not evaluating its cover, the title does not say anything about the movie. When I went to the theater, I did not expect to be citizen Kane, I was expecting a day of independence, a movie that is pure popcorn fun, but instead I got the terrible movie Roy Liotta called "Turbulence" Yes, it's so bad SOAP . The only thing that makes SOAP better is its name. And it's not even the right title for the movie, it was not even a snake or an airplane to see 40 minutes into the movie! What a fake ad! If it were not his title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B-class summer movie and rating R? It must be the most popular R films of all time! Movie makers add just a few f words to R, All violence is maintained at pg-13. Do you know what is really rated? Rated superstar Edge! Look at him at Summerslam instead of losing the snake money!
