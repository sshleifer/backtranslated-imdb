The patient escapes from the psychiatric hospital and kills one of his guards and then one university professor after he goes to the local college. The next semester, replacing the late Prof and a new group of students, must deal with a new dose of killing. The dialogue is so clich√© that it's hard to believe I could predict the lines in quotes. This is one of those cheap movies that were thrown out in the middle of the 80s era slasher. Despite killing a heroine, it's just an unjust waste. Striking acting, terrible script, terrible effects, terrible terrible horrors! "Splatter University" is just gunk put into your VCR when you have nothing better to do, even though I suggest watching your heads cleaner tape would be more fun. Jump over and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. Rating R for strong graphic violence, treachery, short nudity and sexual situations.
