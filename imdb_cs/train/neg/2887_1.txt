I just watched this movie today and it's not only terrible and terrible but it looks like the director has only a few buddies together to make a film about a sick man. I also think that this movie has the look of porn video with its bright sharp just shot. <br /> <br /> I thank the heavens for working in a video rental shop and I did not have to pay for it, because this movie is bullshit x infinity .. Do not buy or do not let this movie !!!!! You'll have a better time watching Dude where my car is, than this one! And that does not say much about that movie. <br /> <br /> Negotiation is miserable and the movie is simply inconsistent. I watched this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. I drove home and threw myself after watching this film of dirt, then I took a shower and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had half my mind, I would take the film out and burn it too, because no one should be exposed ... maybe to the members of Al Queda ... especially those we have in guardianship as well as the child violent prisoners who are in prison for life sentences without consent ... just set up as an hourly work of Orange, and then force this cheese head to watch it over and over again.
