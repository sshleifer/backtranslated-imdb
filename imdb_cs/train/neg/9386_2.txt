In many of the films I've seen on Warren Oates, I have come to a certain conclusion, here is a talented individual. I first saw Mr. Oates in a television series called Stoney Burke. Since then I've been following his career and felt he's meant for great roles. It happened in 1974 when Sam Peckinpah gave him the highest award in the film "Bring Me the Head of Alfred Garcia". Of course, his greatest claim to glory was his spectacular role in "The Wild Bunch". I always thought he was quite capable of bringing some character to a certain spell, that's until I saw him on this flop. The film is called "Chandler", which is a tribute to the detectives of the 1950s created by Raymond Chandler. Because the synopsis said she was a hard eye of the Private Eye, I was immediately interested. However, I patiently sat the whole movie and found it to be a dull, uninteresting, slow pace, a twisted, confusing saga that should have a theme or plot in a dark room. Along with some of Hollywood's best stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo, and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to reach Mach five, but where. As a result, one of my favorite actors was stuck in a poorly constructed vehicle that never got out of the ground. **
