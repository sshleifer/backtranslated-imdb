When people ask me what is the worst movie I've ever seen. Her even near the MST3k riffing level, even at midnight in the theater, or even as Disney Channel late night fill. The only time I ever wanted to jump to Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to capture Dick Tracey's jacket from a mannequin, tear it to pieces and sit him down the tourist guides. "Eat it, eat this wicked coat of darkness!" I have never been so crazy about the movie, not "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Do you want color and cinema? There's no babe here. Reviewers still say "oh, but it looks like a comic book", well, for me, her color Gordita after several weeks in the sun. Perhaps so pleasant. Beatty Wanders in this country jumps and talks with her watch, alone and occasionally at other actors, hoping someone will tell him when to continue the sequel. To be fair, I saw this film only once, but my pain threshold is like a human, not a god.
