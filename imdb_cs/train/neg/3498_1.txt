I just watched one episode of this program and I could not even get to the end of the program. Every minute I watched this program, my IQ had to drop by 10 points. This is basically like a children's program, but with talent. Even the promises and insults she says to other people made me laugh. Anyway, the story has to be written by a monkey, and the people who actually put this script on this filming program had to be kept at the point of the gun and had no choice but to make this slow, disappointed, terribly-acting program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some crazy acting lessons.
