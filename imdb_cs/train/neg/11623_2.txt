From everything I read about the film, I was thrilled to support a film with a Christian theme. Everything about the film was very unprofessional. Especially writing! Without good writing, the movie does not have a chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to give up how the story relates to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I still waited for the young adult / young adults to tell, but it never was. As someone who went through divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would not be pleasant when I first went through the emotional storm that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
