This movie is so aggressive. The main character seems to be 35 years old and I've seen dirty beans with more balls than this guy. Losing conspiracy is so predictable that I do not even have to look at the humor factor. Also, some of the worst dialogues I've heard in 3 years, "lets go find a small animal to torture". <br /> <br /> Ugh ..... I can not even go on, do not look at the pile of rubbish, it was made in 8 days. <br /> <br /> One top is drunk who calls the main character as a bassoon for drawing pictures. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10, impractical
