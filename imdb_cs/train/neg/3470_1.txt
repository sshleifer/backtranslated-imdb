Like most Ben Affleck films, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That's when you want to call this story. Many points have been associated with no idea at all. I would like to thank the Director for not saying better. I say this because it would mean that torture will take longer. As with Ben Affleck's failure, this is no exception and is only survived by other actors. Even then, for the most part, acting was created and was not credible. A trip to a monumental lane with actors I have not seen in years is not worth the price. Everyone thought they had to say that they too quickly joined the ranges of "already existing". My choice was to wait for the car to be fixed or watched this movie. I decided wrong. Overall I would give him one laugh ... mainly because that's all I got from it.
