Positively horrible vehicle George Sanders, where he goes from a thief to a policeman. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was an outstanding actor, he was definitely not the leader, and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> It is totally out of silly. Gene Lockhart offered some comical relief until the moment of anger led him to shoot a gun with tragedy. The result was sad that George Sanders and colleague Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After filming, it's just as sorry it's not shocking. The usual attractive Signe Hasso is really nothing here.
