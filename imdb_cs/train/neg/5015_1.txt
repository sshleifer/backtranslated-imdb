As a film critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see a lot of films and not all very good. Some movies are so bad, you will not be surprised to be released directly to the video. Thanks to the tab, it was surprising that it was released on the video at all. This is a really low budget of bad quality poor written waste. <br /> <br /> A group of young people plays the game of taboo. They write their most obvious wishes or actions, and later people are murdered for their taboo. The question is, if we believe what we see? The movie has a potentially interesting conspiracy and I will not give it here. But what could be interesting remains stupid, wrongly committed and for no reason. Some of the actors had previously played in bigger titres, so why did they sign it? If you see it anywhere, try to avoid it. In this film there is no logic, no human sense of quality.
