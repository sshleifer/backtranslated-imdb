Many royal fans hate it because they deviated from the book, but the film is another medium and the books should change when they make a jump. In spite of this, the film fails completely, but it does not fully satisfy film concepts. I'd like people who tell me it's the most frightening film ever shot. I always watch the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I asked was silent. Occasionally someone, for the loss of a decent fear (there is no ...), names the "grape juice-shot-out-of-elevator" shtick. If you're afraid of this, I do not know what to tell you except you're easily afraid. I just turned my eyes to watch these on-stage horror ideas playing in this schlock, disjointed movie. One place to deviate from the book and really is insipid's boring work the movie does to keep Mr. Halloran up to the show just to kill him; with the deepest member of the audience who know Jack is waiting for one of the pillars in the corridor that Halloran FOREVER will go down. It's one of the stupidest sequences that ever appeared on the film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a nice choice for Hallory's artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really contribute to the mood and development of the horror film characters. Was he sometimes ever better than ever before? If it was a movie if it was ever shot? I think it's a miracle that I eventually managed to bypass this tour and I agree that Kubricks 2001 is a really important film due to the immense "bad will" generated by this stupid, stupid film and the cult of creepy but gruesome fans of Kubrick who could not describe the idea of ​​working with each film source of the congressional library in front of them. <br /> <br /> Play in a grotesque overcoming of Jack Nicholson, a silly one-time show in tense moments and a Razzie Shelly Duvall nomination and you have a very poor film.
