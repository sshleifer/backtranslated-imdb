This TV movie shows that there are bad movies. The only reason I saw was that it was covered on the KTMA MST3K. It's a Super Bowl at Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is playing and we can see that backstage is virtually unseen. With many stars in this movie it has not changed. I really do not know why I was watching it.
