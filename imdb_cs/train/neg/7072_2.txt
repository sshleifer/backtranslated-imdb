My title about this pile of dirty bits should be taken into account when I saw it was Fred olen Ray - but I thought, "THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE BETTER THAN HIS FESTIVAL", I was wrong! It must be the worst film targeting children. Acting was horrible, humor did not exist, direction was the worst I've ever seen. Special effects would not seem to be in place in the Disney movie of the 1950s. What happened to DEE-WALLACE STONE! Who once had such a promising career in the 1980s. The movie veteran and former child actor Russ Tamblyn was a terrible villain, and the budget was so low that it was absolutely incredible, even as a children's film. I did not see the sequel in 1999 and I do not intend to <br /> <br /> If you want a good guy movie Watch 'HONEY SHRUNK / BLEW UP CHILD / KID' OR ANY DISNEY FILM <br /> <br /> My RATING as 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> RATING AS KID FILM: - 3/10 NA BEST!
