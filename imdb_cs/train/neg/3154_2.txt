Look, this film is not very insulting, it's just boring. This is a typical rom-com with the end that you can see before you saw as much as a trailer. The key difference is that classical Roma communities resolve their stories with joke and inadequacy. This movie has no preload, but it really does not make sense of movement, you feel like you could get and go at any time. Film production also has a sense of a debut film that was made fifteen years ago. I recommend watching again a classic movie like When Harry met Sally instead of this shallow imitation. Oh, one more big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael look cute like Vaughn in an alias, you'll be really disappointed with seeing him here.
