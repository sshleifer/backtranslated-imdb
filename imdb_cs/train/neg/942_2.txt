I saw one night late on the cable. At that time I did not know that the girl charged as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and she got naked so often, thank God) that I was actually sitting through this mumble. I like swinging movements just like another guy - more than the other guy, in fact - but it was much more than noisy and more rancid. The really unpleasant overcoming of mad scientist and director, writer, and special effects, by virtually total incompetence of people, exacerbates uninteresting nudity, which is only salvation by grace. Savannah, before she turned into a plasticized Barbie doll, became a porn queen, she is really interesting to watch - she's dead, gorgeous, erupts to uncontrollable giggle occasionally, looks outside the camera and laughs and seems to have a really good time, which is more than can be said to the audience. Although Savannah and her colleagues spend this amount of naked images, she still can not hide the fact that it's an incredibly stupid, ill-produced and unpleasant film. If you know someone who has it on the video or when they sometimes appear on the cable, look at it, but do not waste money on renting.
