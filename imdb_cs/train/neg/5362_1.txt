A woman with a hair wig that is "coloring" her hair in the middle of a movie (= wig) probably does not see what the audience can see from miles: <br /> <br /> *** Start a note * ** that her husband has a relationship with her best friend and both try to get rid of it. *** end spoiler warning *** <br /> <br /> And what is the spoiler that was: the title is already giving it away, right? Bad Actor, Bad Scenario: Time Loss Oh yeah: Eventually live happily ever after .... If you like this movie, you will really love "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle Death" ....
