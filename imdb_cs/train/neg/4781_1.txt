This may be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. Writers and producers should study German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even the Soviet enemy leader as a god-like father was better done. Disappointing. The loss of faith, recovered in the church last minute just in time for the father to "save" Hoover / God, was not too bad. Unfortunately, it seemed to be hurrying and not quite melodramatic. A few mischievous celestial shots of angel Hoover at the corner of the screen - enlightenment and nodding - would add a lot. The best aspect is that Hoover has saved the deserved family and children who have "proven" their worth. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people were portrayed as sympathetic and even good - yet Hoover-God will not help them. A better approach would be the shots of breathing alcohol to show the justice of their state. Finally, clear and merry recovery scenes (after Hoover rescued the country from depression) should eventually develop at the end. We saw how Hoover-God saved not only this deserved family, but they really deserve it. Amateur best.
