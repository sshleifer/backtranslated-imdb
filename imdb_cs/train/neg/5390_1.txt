Do not think it's neither a horror nor a movie. I strongly recommend that this 82-minute failure be missed; the only reason he deserved the star was the presence of Chris Pine. Nothing will happen. Wait patiently in the hope of twisting flickering, a hint of surprise, a conspiracy that arises - but not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The only thing that could make it worse is the addition of an ethnic "companion" who becomes an ethnic fraud. <br /> <br /> Their encounters with obstacles (whether human or physical) are short, confusing and totally useless. > <br /> Chris Pine struggles to keep himself above his surface while he was drowned by the suffering of a light cast. Lou Taylor Pucci could not have been a dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves, who crashed into the Navada desert. Watch 'The Road', watch '28 days later ', watch TV time ... anything but this; Please. Suffering from boredom, unlike the fact that you could be entrusted with the film, this film is not a cure.
