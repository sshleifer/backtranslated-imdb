This movie is no more than a badly made fetish porn, and that is a lot of consideration when we were dealing with similar bulls that were born at that time. This was recommended by my friend as a "unique movie experience". He was right. I suppose he meant it like a joke. Not disgusting or shocking. Only badly acting and bad attempts at shocking art. A little camp value, though I do not believe the creators of this movie intended it. And yes, as mentioned earlier, it is a sex with a guy in a bear suit. Do not waste a lot of money on it. Try to borrow it if you need to see it. Or contact me, I'd like to sell you half the price for a copy. <br /> <br /> Maybe I have to see other films of this particular director, because he seems to have a certain mood. But if that's the case, I'll regret another two hours of my life forever.
