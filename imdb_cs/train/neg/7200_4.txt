I really wanted to like this movie - the shots were mostly shot in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photos. But even for the filmed cartoon it was a really badly shot film. Continuity and stimulation were simply terrible. The best pieces in the movie are under the final credit, so it's (almost) worth it to pull it to the end (though, weird, a bit it will pick up in the last half hour). <br /> <br /> When Andy Dick has the best performance in the movie, you know it must be a problem ...
