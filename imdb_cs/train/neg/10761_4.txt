This movie was a mess. She had absolutely the worst adaptation I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of the scene where the writer wanted to go to the commercial, and the filmmaker added a second of a black screen to fulfill the dreams of the writers. Under the uncomfortable direction and adjustment, there was a flash of something good. Good idea, persuasive spark. But somehow it happened. The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a chain of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Part of it does not call on him to be a good priest and succeed. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as a mad thief. He always plays a crazy evil guy. Very buzzing. Oh, I thought that maybe everything that was going on, scary modifications, and disconnected conspiracy, was trying to add a feeling of confusion to the character (Grieco). And just to prove that it was invented, they dragged credit passwords. It's not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
