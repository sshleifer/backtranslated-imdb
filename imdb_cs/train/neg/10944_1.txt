Now I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I have seen (and enjoyed) all the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme, including where his own clone is, both the twins, and all three where the cyborg is. I actually own one where she plays a fashion designer and fights in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if anything else, he has a great ass and you almost always see, the DVD can even pause and enlarge!) So you can trust me when I say that the movie is so bad makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane . <br /> <br /> Everything about the Snake Eater is bad. The story is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The fight is bad. Stunts are bad. FX are bad. The performance is spectacular, earth-tremendously bad, very likely to show the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and it really does say something. And I would be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is miserable in bed, boot. In particular, Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> This can happen inadvertently funny, so it's not a complete loss. However, I recommend watching this movie only if you are either a native idiot or very, very stoned. I was able to get it alone because I needed to watch something that drives me from rinsing cat urine from my clothes. It did not help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palill's portrait as a gay cheater.
