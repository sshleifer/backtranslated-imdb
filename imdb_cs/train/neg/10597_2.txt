This movie was totally terrible. I can not think of one good thing. The plotting punches were so huge that you could pass them through Hummer. It makes it so terribly wrong that Jean Claude should be ashamed, and he says a lot! A dialog, What dialogue? To think I was a fan of the first (I use this comment freely, it's more than a pleasure to do than anything else). This movie had Goldberg screaming aloud !!!! There is nothing good about this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad you can not even watch with your friends to get out of fun! It must be in my five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it's hard for me to put 1.
