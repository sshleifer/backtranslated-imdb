Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel, The Celestine Prophecy, following the spiritual awakening of a teacher without a job in a mysterious village in Peru. Video-quality home actors are so-called characters who hook exaggerated exposure and metaphysical hokum while the film is powered by extremely heavy hands towards Armand Mastroianni. Although visible attempts to measure up to interesting fans of stronger tickets within the dead time of "Lost" or "The Da Vinci Code" by director David Brown, filmmakers are barely on the job. This film has resulted in misconceived spiritual propaganda for mass consumption, and the results are so terrible that few people can go through this mess to find a real point.
