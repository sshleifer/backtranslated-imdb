Somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode of The Twilight Zone, which is trying to get out. Since the Cube was tense, well-made, claustrophobic and conceivable, I'm afraid that Cypher is a bloated and lengthy rehash of some well-worn topics that are not much to be seen, especially if you've seen almost any other half-hour decent science fiction movie before . Cypher managed to drag all the way through his relatively short 95 minutes into an incompetent end. None of the characters turned away from each other, and for the film made in 2002, technology is really cheese. It's hard to connect this tired and uninvited film to director Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not good. When you watched the grass growing and it was dry and bored with your insects, but other activities are likely to become more stimulating.
