Oh my god! Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not look at this movie! It's 82 minutes of my life, I'll never be back. Sure, I could stop watching halfway. But I thought it might be better. Not that. Everyone who really enjoys this film is a seriously ill and twisted individual. No wonder Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation for shooting movies. Everything about this movie is terrible, from acting to editing. Nor do I normally describe reviews here, but in this case I make an exception. I just wish someone warned me before I hired this disaster
