I knew you would get a summary. What is this movie like Pet Rock and Disco? Well, if you did not get the 1970s or 1980s, you probably do not want to understand why anyone would like to have a new coke or have Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I do not quite get it yet). There are only a few things that seemed to be meaningful at the time, but really disturbing the young generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his group. At that time (mostly in the 1940s) they were very popular and had the influence of being shot in the studio by Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre. Still, if you did not live at that time (it was a lot of my time), you wonder why someone liked this kind of "fun". Kyser and his friends are incredibly annoying, and their humor is very, very broad (ie simple and cheesy). To be honest, I could not stand, nor did I appreciate the fact that there are too many musical figures in the film. Because of these factors, a big boost was given by the back seat, and the fans of these actors are likely to be disappointed. The film includes Kyser and the group who arrive at the home where the young lady and her crazy aunt live. As soon as the bridge clears, special events will begin to appear. Eventually it will culminate with some attempts at Sally's life and seance. It's all played on laughter - and that's really a horror movie despite being cast. Overall, this is at best fun. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I felt cheating that I had to watch Kyser and his joints.
