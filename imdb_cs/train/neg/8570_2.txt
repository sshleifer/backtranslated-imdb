There is only one thing that is necessary for a thorough appreciation of the Indian runner. Unzip your pants. Look inside. Is there evidence of Y chromosome? Okay, you'll do it. This film has all the masculine qualities: blood, weapons, chasing cars, loving women, death, many tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics - what am I missing? - oh, yeah, blowtorches. As a woman, I seriously hope that Sean Penn considers it "an effort when I was a child ...". Since he both wrote and directed the thing, he is almost the only one responsible. Irregular casting (Viggo Mortensen as usual shows how to do the job) is trying to save Penn. Too late. Lines and events are here. Even a devoted and qualified actor can not change them. <br /> <br /> I found this movie strange and stupid, as well as predictable. The conversation spreads - Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a wooden mother monologue without maternal authenticity. Then he will die. After a while, he is also the father of the protagonists played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is barely noticeable. <br /> <br /> It seems that pyrotechnics, etc., which is mentioned above, revives things and scares viewers that they think something significant is coming up. <br /> <br /> You are men and under 25, you can admire this movie. Are you planning to return to 35. Do you think you will like it? I think yes.
