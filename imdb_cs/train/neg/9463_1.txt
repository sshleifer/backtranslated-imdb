The moderate, temperamental and right humiliating adaptation to the classic story of children not only lacks the spell of their ancestor but lacks any talent they ever have. Mike Myers should not just be ashamed of his terrible performance, which is a clear reflection of what Jim Carrey did, but he should surrender to everyone. He's so unpleasant you'd want to beat him if you could jump right in the movie. Sets are ugly and cinema is very bad. This year I've seen a lot of bad film, but not just a cake, but it's undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever to make.
