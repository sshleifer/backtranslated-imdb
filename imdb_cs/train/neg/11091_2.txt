Denzel is the only thing that's right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe once in the early stages it was a better movie. Someone has decided to suspend some action and draw points to the beginning of the movie, which has released most of the story around the first 5 minutes. This and destroy what builds up in the pace and rhythm that the movie could have had before. <br /> <br /> So it confuses you first and then puts you off. Dramaturgy is pushing for not trusting. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a feeling of great injustice and anger that such films can potentially conquer the audience. If you do, it will do so if you are looking for it ... go ahead.
