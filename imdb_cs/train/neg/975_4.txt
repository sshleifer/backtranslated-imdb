I saw director "Woman on the Beach" and could not understand good to great reviews. This film resembles one, two people who are captured in relation to very little dynamic and even less interested in someone else. Just like his other films, you will have to listen to an empty dialogue, go through very little and be enchanted by signed, quite uninteresting characters. If you feel like you like this movie, do not let my review stop. I like minimalism in movies, but I feel that Tsai Ming-Liang films are far better. In his films, Lee Kang-Sheng is a rather amazing actor. There is nothing. I wish I liked the IU but not. Oh, okay.
