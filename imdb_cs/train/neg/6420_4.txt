OK, I admit, it started very nice and good, but then it just fell down, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could even finish reading the script after about 5 minutes in the movie, the only reason I really sat the whole movie, he wanted to see a twist on Sunday and to my surprise, well, people can not even tell if there was one, because the end just lets get confused, and then the credit rolls, was I like hell? it did not deserve a theatrical run, I'm sorry but I did not mean it was terrible, the only reaso I gave it 4 is because it had a couple of jumps ... that's it! you can watch it, I can not say no, hey you might like it or even love it! but if you hate it, do not say I warned you!
