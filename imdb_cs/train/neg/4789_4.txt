"Phantasm" from 1979 was a very atmospheric, scary, scary and very original film about horror and a single word of cult. The first sequel to 1988 was horrific, humorous, action and very entertaining. But after the first sequel, Don Coscarelly, the creator of "Phantasm," apparently lacked new ideas. "Phantasm III - The Lord of the Dead" in 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is even fun, but there is no more originality and desperate attempts to bring something new are sometimes tiresome, which is quite disappointing compared to its predecessors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , who gets great when filming, Rocky, hard and super cool nunchaku-swinging black cat with a crew). The film also has its features - Reggie Bannister is again cool as a pony-watched guitar playing Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still very horrible as Tall Man, but the fact that Tall Man speaks much more in this movie causes him to lose some of his craze. The character Mika plays again Michael Baldwin (replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which, in my opinion, does not make much difference. Gore also keeps the movie so interesting that he can watch, but it is still disappointing, especially because attempts to exhaust the lack of ideas often get poisoned. <br /> <br /> Anything that is considered Phantasm III is an acceptable time loss, but it is a disappointment when compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two Phantasm films can try it, but I do not recommend setting your expectations too high.
