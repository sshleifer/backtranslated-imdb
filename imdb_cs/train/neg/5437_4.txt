Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about a young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer around two buddies. The year is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at the crossroads. Fully against his father's lifestyle, Art wants to become a stockbroker. From a visual point of view with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography, the entire film feels like a director - whose previous Dodgeball effort was funny if it's completely commercial - desperately seeks independence from credibility by kinking together aspects of other Indian movies, but sprinkling it stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many stars on Sundance this year, it felt like this was a mysterious atelier-sponsored vain project that helped the director to get some independent credibility points - in this respect, he failed and as a film himself.
