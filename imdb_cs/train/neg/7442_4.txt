I'm sorry this movie has not scared me, it just upset me. It was just so frustrating when I saw the potential, and it all fell off the road. Children! Father! Foreboding! She had so much potential and vitality! nothing, bluff! I've heard it before. Terrifying! No! I can scare myself, where I sit before they can in the movie. Are men writing that women should be so annoying? Huh? This film was quite atmospheric. Or it could be if the director / writer has bothered to work. We could have some good music that would add to the tension if someone tried. What do I really want to know why they get the money? Just give me that and save all the trouble. Abandoned? ... where we are betrayed
