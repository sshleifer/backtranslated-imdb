* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I bent back to be fair to this movie. I knew it was Madonna. I knew it took a whole week in theaters. I knew he had a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect deep and thoughtful exploration of class, culture and sexuality as we got into the Italian original. The benefit of this doubt lasted for ten minutes. Madonna plays a rich, demanding and annoying Gorgon who goes on holiday with her henpecked husband and flippant friends (brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, showing some really silly facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first boat that Madonna likes to humiliate and treat as dirt in every scene they have together. Why is she a bitch with him? Simply because the act requires that later, when both of them reach a deserted Mediterranean island, the tables will be turned and he will teach her the lesson. Similarly, it is inexplicable how they fall in love, although they have nothing in common and abuse each other for two-thirds of the film. "Ice Cream" is a silly, simplistic, superficial film from the beginning to the end. Madonna typically gives a wooden performance. There are a lot of silly scenes: Madonna sing and dance cruelly at Giannini's request, a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he slames her and kicks her in the ass. Guy Ritchie is doing his "stylish" layout, which is ridiculous here. The film contains the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a big movie in a few years. The end is gruff and unlikely. It's basically the "blue lagoon" meets with "overboard" minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter. <br /> <br /> Maybe Madon's ego is so big that it insists on being a competent actress. Drain it, Madge, for both ours and yours. This is not her worst film. This difference still belongs to the "Shanghai Surprise". She did nothing worse than ... yet.
