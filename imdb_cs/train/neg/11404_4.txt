It's a bit fascinating that so many reviewers consider it a masterpiece. I am not unnecessary in terms of quality films, and I agree that, from a technical point of view, as well as for several characters that are portrayed, the movie is awarded in the classroom. There is no sense (for me) of this film in fact anywhere; I mean, you get your browsers everywhere. It's a series of moody scenes, perhaps so remarkable, but I want more of the movie. I'm looking for a story, a movement and an arrival that I have not found in this movie. Yes, it could be considered poetry in the movie. . . but there's a lot of poetry I can not live for the same reason: it draws pictures without going anywhere. One thing that still needs to be said is that it documents the English childhood in the middle of the century, which is necessarily limited in its versatility. I was personally horrified at what a young British boy had to live in, at that time and on the spot. When I grew up in America ten years ago, I can authoritatively say that this contrast is huge. I can not help wondering if this contrast has any effect on those movies that are so good. In other words, can there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its "film charm" (which I admit it is there), and completely ignore its lack of relation to the nature of its own memoir experience?
