An attempt to move on to appeal to those who do not mark an opera using the glory of one of the greatest opera singers of all time fails badly. Everything that is desirable in this movie is an opera, and best finds the record of Pavarotti who does what he does best. The thing is about romance with a doctor who heals him, which suddenly became difficult. <br /> <br /> Just because it's been so long ago is largely forgotten. Like most of the opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor, and besides acting talent, he has the talent of theater, and nothing he does in this film rejects this view. His guilt is that he rejects this terrible scenario. Maybe because the great operas can have stupid stories, he tolerated this. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those who participated in it? We need to know? <br /> <br /> The drawing is weak and sad. This movie is like trudging in the cool mud to pick a few juicy tidbits (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. Just get one of his many excellent opera or vocal-concert recordings and recognize the tenor master where it is most appropriate. It would be one of the 100 worst IMDb films if he remembered him more and gave him some votes; it would be great for a list of several singer, actor, model, and athletes' efforts to exploit their popularity through the film. Very often, everything is badly done because of incompetent behavior or a terrible scenario. Pavarotti would be a decent actor if he did not show such a great voice. Whether it's as effective as an actor (the operas require it), neither Jimmy Stewart would save that step from the script. I gave him a decent 3 of 10 because someone can become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and opera for this film.
