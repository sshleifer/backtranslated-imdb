This movie was not made by fans Who. Most of the great moments that fans will enjoy in the half-hour Tommy series are simply omitted or surprised: At Christmas they did not show Daltry's cries on the line "Tommy does not know what day it is ...", almost showed the Pinnacle Wizard almost no Townsend the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and the worst of all, we did not do it in the second half (listening to you), robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's chanting chords. Huge pieces of film are shot from the back of the band. It's a very frustrating film that can be watched and not delivering goods. I do not know if director Murray Lerner is simply a fan of Who or worse, at least for him if he's a fan Who and these are all eight cameras that can deliver him. Because of Tommy, there are some rare numbers, just like some favors that are very well shot and sometimes great adjustments. That might be enough for some viewers to be content if you do not expect Tommy. Overall sound was average in the transmission I watched from DirecTV; it may be different on video or DVD.
