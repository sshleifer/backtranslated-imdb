What a boring movie! To summarize everything, it was essentially Nana Patekar who had defeated Kariso Kapoor's efforts as she tried to escape from the village with her son. Can anyone tell BORING ??? The concept was not too bad, but it was wrong. Canadian locations and some village scenes were pretty shot. Overall, however, cinematography came shorter. The story could be great, but the film seemed to stretch. It's just such stupidity that one can take, let alone three bloody hours. The best part of the film was the song "Ishq Kamina" and it was only five minutes. In addition, this film was a bit of a bullshit.
