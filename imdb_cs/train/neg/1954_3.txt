First, let's get out of the way. . . yeah, this movie steals LOT from "Darkness Falls" (2003). The story of "Darkness Falls" is something like this: The dentist, a murderous woman who conceals her face because of a mischief, kills people who look at her for revenge. In 'Tooth Fairy' (2006), a disfigured Tooth Fairy (which, yes, hiding her face) unleashes her fierce revenge on almost everyone. A little like a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But what you have to ask is this: If you are going to steal the exact conspiracy from the movie, why choose something as average as 'Darkness Falls'? Certainly it made some money in the box office, but that was strictly due to the relatively good theatrical experience that the film delivered. A low budget movie and a direct video will not have the same effect. Not that. <br /> <br /> When I watched the start of 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations actually grew. There appeared to be a minimum production value. The story does not sound terrible, just tantalizing. In the first scene, we get the cast of the character including the ex-doctor with mystery (played by the guy who looks like Busey) and some hot vet (Jenifer of Argento "Masters of Horror: Jenifer"). After a few minutes, however, the film is slowly declining. It provides all the basic horrific clich√©s, including, but not limited to: some crazy old man with incredible warnings, silly stupid jocks, a psychic and a gold-striped heartbreaker. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems with this film was the inability to stick to the target group. It's a bit like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for any character on the screen at the time. When adults were on the screen, he felt more mature. When a star appears on the screen, and what is the gray image, the dialogue went into a more silly, inappropriate state. When the child was on the canvas, it seemed like an episode, "Are you afraid of the darkness?" . . just a little scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is everywhere. Visualization ranges from relatively good to simple drilling. Scripture is a letter, as well as acting for the most part. On the plus side there is an excessive gore (including relatively cold (yet painfully predictable) scenes of wood seams and a nice nail scene. Also, if you are looking for some sexy stuff, there is a short topless scene (but if you want to see this topless chick, <br /> <br /> If you are a huge fan of Darkness Falls (exist?), maybe you can check to see the story made in a different way ... but it is the only reason I can find it. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
