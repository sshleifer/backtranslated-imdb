The sun should be on this film forever. <br /> <br /> It lasts forever (which is not usually a bad thing - an English patient, Schindler's list), but it is so boring. The aging of the actors is unbelievable, and so is the exhausted, endless story line that really does not seem to lead anywhere. In short, the loss of talent and film.
