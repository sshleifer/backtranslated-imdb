Just think it cost a total of $ 250,000 to make "officials". How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to get this fabulous music video? Virtually unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I would see ... I know it must have been devoted to this professionally created, economical and exciting scenario. Shoot, the set of bars must become a package. By the way, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not be caught dead and produced something for less. I'm just surprised he did not blow anything. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not a terrible movie, I think. The girls seemed to have good chemistry, and the soundtrack was fine. IMO It seems to be a shame that this relatively poor project could be made for $ 5 million without losing production and another $ 6 million worth of Indian films for merit.
