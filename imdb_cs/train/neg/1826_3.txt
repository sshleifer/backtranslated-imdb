I saw this movie yesterday, and even after a few beers, the only giggle that came out of me was when I realized I was actually watching him. it's unfortunate. UNfunny. I'm convinced that the trivia is that Jack justifies the waste. I can not believe that Barry Levinson simply did not fit this script when he read the first page. besides, I can not believe I've been watching for more than ten minutes. I gave her 3 out of 10 * because I like to see Christopher Walken doing horrible pay movies. also, the horse "corky", only existing as a character in this movie, is actually quite ridiculous.
