no redemption can be redeemed. I wish I could get some time back. the handsome face of the skull really smiles, clearly at the camera, when the illness has already caused a lot of disasters on a poorly informed script. I was ((spoiler)) happy to see all the characters dead or heavily incapacitated to end, especially party poopers who drink spoiled juices on the road to the alleged sunset. Eli Roth shines about ten times and tells how well the grass smokes in the woods when others actually live at the peak of beer consumption. Overall, I found out that most of it is useless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the extinction of the cast, but despite the desire that the path never occurred (probably should be put down instead of watching the TBS late night , ugh).
