A typical seventy-year-old film from a young age, original and good music, but with some peculiarities, interesting, but not fantastic, poor and sometimes confused story (eg Wolf's Role and Where Does the Boy Come?) With a bad conversation, a pleasant atmosphere. The reason why they are still (relatively) well known and sought after are likely naked scenes (including the typical 1970s pseudo-coitus) that relate to a 11-18 year old girl with an older teenage boy (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) it is interesting from a sociopolitical point of view how this representation of very young adolescents was considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the US) 30 years ago, whereas now it is more than taboo. The story revolves around harassing one girl (Laury) with two other characters and her discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of the aspect of teenage life. The figure of Eve (Silvie) does not develop until the very end of the film and is already very erotic in art - it's not "the coming of age": it's a very fucking young girl, her sexual charm, who weeps like a little girl she really is. The boy is totally contemptuous, while Laura is a very naive and feeble victim.
