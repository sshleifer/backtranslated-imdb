Below average movie with bad music considering a movie based on music ??? Common script and direction with full errors. Salman Khan was in his usual conversation. Ajay's performance worsens with what looks like his appearance, especially his style as a rock star. Asin was just a shot. Overall, I felt like I had money in the cinema. Salman Khan remains immature 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. In the movie, many songs were all boring except for "Man Ko Ati". The most important song that impressed the British music sponsor was the most insurmountable. "Khanabadosh" can be very comprehensible to the English music sponsor. The second movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid," which was a simple slow love story in a good direction and acted through average music
