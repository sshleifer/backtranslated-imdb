Pam Grier plays like Coffy. She is a nurse trying to avenge a drug dealer who has given her sister a dependence on bad heroism. Like every sixtieth summer, you can expect racist criminals to get their desserts only. <br /> <br /> During the seventies, dozens of movies were filmed in these films, which were really humiliating for both the black and white audience. This is due in particular to the bad racial hostility in these films and the humiliating, stereotypical characters. Especially female figures. Other shots between Coffy and other films of this type include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chase, generous nudity and sex crazy gorgeous women. Not to mention city ghettos inhabited by drug dealers, pimps, mobs, and other criminal conspiracies. Pam Grier was the undisputed queen of sixty heroes Blaxploitation. She was magnificent, she was both tenacious and immobile. As in other movies, Pam is emitting the other characters in Coffy. Pam is so charismatic on the screen that these kinds of films are indivisible without being the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you'd better see her other movies, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have much less empty worry than Coffy. Pam's character in Coffy gets too worse to get to the fallen. Pam has characters in his other Blaxploitation films, they do not move so low as to be revenge, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I think you just watch Coffy if you can not see some of the other Pam Grier movies. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes Coffy's toleration.
