The character of the acting is a bit stiff, as if the person of the actors appeared for the first time on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (starring in the television series as Star Trek TNG and The Heat of the Night), dies quickly and then can be dramatically omitted from her acting. <br /> <br /> The main role is Mr. Ballard, as Cliff Robertson portrayed. Cliff is mostly forced to wear this film with his body language. It does not do a bad job, but it is a little supernatural to ask the actor to join the oceans of an empty screen during which characters spend their time NOT use and do not charge. Robertson's most memorable role may be Ben Parker in the last 3 films Spider Man (played by Tobey Maguire). The conspiracy is predictable. The husband murders his wealthy wife for his money. then it seems that the wife returns and chases a man who drives him madly until he slips out of the high window (fearing the fear of his dead woman approaching him) on the day he is supposed to die no less. <br /> <br /> The second chauffeur that Mr. Ballard hires looks more like the English brand Hamill. Great! The only thing that stands out is the total ignorance of the dialogue. Many minutes pass through silence, no one speaks, and little does. It's a shame that MST3K guys never got into this movie. It could have been much better, if not predictable, with larger dialogues or shorter scenes of "nothingness." I still expected G'Mork's red eyes to appear out of the shadows and say that he was working for "nothing" that the film is about.
