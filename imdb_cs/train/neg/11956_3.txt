This film is sorry. I do not think I've ever seen a movie shot in shock. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat, and the acting was loud. This could be a good movie. I think he relied only on grotesque visual imagery. I usually deal with graphic scenes and human taboos, but I felt Miike shot him for filming. One badly executed movie. Just do not have a lot of fun watching this movie unless you are fascinated by exhausting with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, milking alone, abuse of parents and siblings, and fecal distraction. I think I sold a movie to many of you, but I thought when I said it was funny. He succeeded in other films, but I think you'd rather watch someone who's acting.
