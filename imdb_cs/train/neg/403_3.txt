Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it is difficult to tell if the choirs take seriously, with a sardonic intention or work in total oblivion. He also seems totally ignorant of the fact that all brilliant visuals in the world (and some of them are excellent) can not hide negligence on story, dialogue, and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to get into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a pleasant actor who occasionally shows his dark side ("River Wild") in an effort to balance his boyish appearance; With regard to the material, however, Bacon is not nearly hate enough to bring. Other leading figures include Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, none of whom are genuinely talented to create a solid impression, and who, when forced to deliver an unpleasant dialogue, was just upset. The culmination is the predominant study, and the infidelity must actually be suspended.
