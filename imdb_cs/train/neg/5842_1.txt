What a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well, with the title sequence, but it's probably as good as it gets. The film is something that rats become monsters and they go to killing. The act is not so poor, but the script is useless and the film is not even scary through atmospheric music. It's really amazing that a band was piling up this bag of garbage and thoughts would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's litter and I urge you not to lose a minute of your life! One in ten.
