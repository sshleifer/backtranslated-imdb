This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Apart from a few giggles and one or two gore scenes, this film is a complete waste of time. Calling Campy does not even cut it. "Campy" means the fun that this movie was not. You spent the first half of the movie and thought, "It's better, is not it?" In the end, it ultimately explains who the brother / sister is and what they want, but until then you do not have to worry because you spent the other half of the film and wondering exactly what Mr. Onorati and Mrs. Pacula did to someone has been knocked off someone so bad to get stuck in such a terrible movie. <br /> <br />
