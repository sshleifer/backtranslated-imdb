I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought it at our local Kmart because it was for sale at $ 5 per VHS. She thought that for me and my brothers to watch, it would be a nice Christmas movie for me. But this movie scared me. Maybe you ask yourself how could anyone scare a movie about Santa Claus? The film's story revolves around Satan, who sent one of his guides, Pitch, to the ground in an attempt to kill Santa and destroy Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon out of hell to kill Santa Claus. Pitch runs Santa during the Christmas Eve in an attempt to capture it on the ground as the sun rises on Christmas Day, because if Santa does not return to his home in space, he turns to powder. Do not get me wrong, the movie is fun and quite fun, but the picture of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just scary.
