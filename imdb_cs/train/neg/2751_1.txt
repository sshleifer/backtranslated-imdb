I would not even want to waste the time to write 10 rows about this atrocities. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that a bad film is not a crime, or he would have been murdered twice for writing and directing the disaster. I'm impressed that this movie had a budget of $ 75 million, but she was really glad that it was such a huge flop that Shim hoped he would never make another movie for the rest of his life, so do not waste any more movie time. I would think the actors would get together and lynch him. <br /> <br /> With the effective resources available to them, they could make a great movie with this budget. As usual, a failure should be noted at the outset with a terrible script and a story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak scenario, but it looks like "Citizen Kane".
