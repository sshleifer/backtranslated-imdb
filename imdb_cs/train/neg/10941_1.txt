WOW what can I say. I love slippery movies and I walk out of the way to look at the horrific movement, but the Snake Eater should rather leave the nail in my pee jam while my grandmother gave me a dancing dancer. Lorenzo Lamas, like Lorenzo Lameass, this guy has so many abilities to act as Bill Clinton has his own control. He has all the goods to make the really bad movie even worse. Crazy Hillbilles YEP! unnecessary shot (with a real weird scar) YEP! dirty soundtrack YEP! I wish I could give the movie -10 stars, but 1 is as low as it goes. I really think someone played a joke on me when I saw that it could not be real ...... worse thing, it's 2MORE SNAKE EATER FILMS! ...... guessing his in demand.
