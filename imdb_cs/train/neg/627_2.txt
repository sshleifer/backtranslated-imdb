Oh dear lord. This movie ... It was terrible. I'm a huge fan of horror films. And most of the time, horror movies that others say are bad, I love it. An actor who played "a scarecrow" was amazing, I say. But this story was terrible. It did not make sense! It had too much gore and unnecessary (and rebellious) sexual scene at the beginning. I believe the director tried to be "shocking" or not, but it just went horrible. To add to the pile of nasty crap, they call the conspiracy, the actors (except the "scarecrow") are terrible, and I have little to do with them that I soon forgot who is who. Finally, I made this film a bad one. If you can get rid of this movie, please do so.
