It is a bit strange that the story, which is located in Oslo, where a very high percentage of the Asian population lives, DOES NOT ASK ANY ASIAN OR AFRICAN person, even as an extra. This is most likely to be the case for Norwegian racial relations. - Nevertheless. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY SHORT INTRODUCTION: Buddy shows four young people living in an apartment in Oslo. The protagonist is two young men who can not manage their lives seriously, and it can be said that the film could be indecisiveness and avoidance of responsibility - any fear of growing up. The story plays on typical adolescent dreams and fantasies and lifestyle models. Pretty clich√©. Although the story is a bit funny, acting is good and as a "young person" you can definitely identify with characters "crazy" and complicated love affairs, I can not find the story or characters very credible. Polishing and lack of depth. This movie uses all the classical tricks of a nice audience to create an entertaining movie that has as much intellectual depth as "Friends" (yes it's on a TV show). Finally, did Norwegian film find its identity ?: Poster American poster audience. And what about watching Tillsammans (together) Lukas Moodysson.
