What a pity that a truly competent director, like Andre de Toth, who specialized in slippery and shifting alliances, was not the first to deal with this concept. He could help bring out the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the film stands, it's quite a mess (as the reviewer Chipe claims). The main problems are in the direction, cheap budget and bad script. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept - characters drawn in different directions by conflicting forces. He needed someone with sufficient vision to gather positive elements by reworking the scenario into a coherent whole, instead of being a fragmented and unpleasant mess (try to find motivation and interethris if possible). Also, a larger budget could match the contrasting positions and studio shots and have got places beyond the distinct LA. The real shame lies in wasting an excellent cast - Hayden, Taylor (before the teeth were closed), Dehner, Reeves along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their premature death. Several films illustrate the importance of the author with a vision more than this dark dark west, which could be in the right hands much more.
