Take a basic swing of Frankenstein, apply some Reanimator (but not good parts) and you have Dr. Hackenstein. Of course, it was apparently inspired by the above-mentioned films, but never mentioned as something special in itself. The scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place over one night when he tries to revive his wife. In order to revive my wife, she decides to tear apart parts of her body from some women who have become entangled and decide to stay the night in their place. I can not really say that acting is bad or driving. Everything here is just too standard. How few attempts at humor actually work (look at the scene where Hackenstein is still hiding behind her deaf assistant, because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw her holding a woman and a needle), but that is hardly enough to recommend this movie. The music is decent, the blood that is decent there, and the cast looks pretty good. And for half the time, I even enjoyed this film. But I never felt it was more than just time. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Instead, try Frankenhooker.
