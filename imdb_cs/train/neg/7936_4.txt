Another film about a group of less intelligent people on the road who had either traveled their shorter path or, in this case, visited an attractive side show show. The results, as expected, are by no means good, as this particular side exhibition is home to many fools, living people who had escaped prisoners years before. The father, who is apparently a professional photographer, must stop and take the place to see that he is still living. Different family members are wandering and looking at various attractions just to be scared. Thinking they were safely on their way, van tires exploded (surprise!) And let them look for a shelter and accommodation in a town that we find that they are inhabited exclusively by freaks (surprise!). <br /> This movie is played as expected, with the family being persecuted and killed. Some struggles are back to the family part, but these are probably among the worst scenes in the movie because they are badly executed. Here is nothing original if you do not count on the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during specific scenes that completely destroy the atmosphere and the mood of the movie. The game is about as bad as I have seen for some time (it's pretty bad when your acting is emptied by casting "Camp Blood"). The special effects are miserable and finally made me feel good, but despite all the negatives I was a little excited about this film. He definitely has so much "so bad that it's good." even enjoyable as I got through the tremendous clich√© of plot, frightening acting and bold special effects. Although the end left me feeling cheated and angry, especially because the film is not so great to start and finally makes the film useless. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I can list countless movies that if you saw them, you saw it. The difference is that most of the movies are better. Although this is not a complete waste, this film is pretty bad and not remotely frightening. <br /> <br /> My level: D
