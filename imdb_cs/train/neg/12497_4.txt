I'm sure people on the Texas / Louisiana border had to laugh or two, when Paramount's photographic unit B caused this in public war. Quite simply, the area along the Sabina River, where the film opens, is the cotton country like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south after the Civic War. There are no big cattle, they are far to the west in Texas than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could go to set up their empire. The film starts with two partners in a riverboat and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal his services by not paying them for taking his cattle, they keep cattle. And that's the beginning of the great Ponderosa as ranches that begin. On the way, Foster married Dix's sister, played by Frances Gifford, and fights his much smaller neighbors. They also have another run with Le Carril. Anyway, Eastern people who like westerns do not usually worry about geographic details, and it's still good west of the Harry Sherman production mill that manufactured all Western Hopalong Cassidy for Paramount. The climax is flaming and I think it literally, a gun battle that might be used to produce A. But I should not just have Western fans to look at it.
