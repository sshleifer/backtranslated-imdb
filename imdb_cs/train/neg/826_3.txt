I love these actors, but they were wrecked in this movie. Can I just wonder what they thought, agree with this bullshit ??? Debra Winger just called in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were cartoons. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably enjoy it. I hated both of them. 3/10
