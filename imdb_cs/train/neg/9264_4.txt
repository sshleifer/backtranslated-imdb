This inferior sequel, based on the practices created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer), concerns marriage by the name of Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They will take a girl named Delia from the monastery. Gene York is reappointed for the congressman and chairs the Financial Commission. Meanwhile Delia looks when unexplained death occurs. When it comes to the metaphysical trade fair, it is a disaster, because the shops of numerology, therapy, healing, yoga, tarot are destroyed. Karen York bought a private eye (Michael Lerner) to explore strange and bizarre events. This television sequel shows excitement, chills, creepy events and bloody killing. Delia, like Damien, appears to be sending a new secret murder every few minutes of the movie and terrible killing. The main thrill is the observation of what can be new and innocent sacrificed by medium special effects. In addition, the average protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, whether they are a nice secondary performer such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser, and the recently deceased Don S Davis, became the captain of the army. As always, excellent music scores obtained from Omen I and III by great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is designed exclusively for hardcore Omen saga followers. The film is badly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Previous and much better versions are: the extraordinary original "Omen" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) by Richard Donner; 'Donami' (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; "Ultimate Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) Grahame Baker. Rating: Under-average.
