I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. I was looking at the parts, and I thought it was too silly to check again. Excessive amounts of "blood" at the beginning are simply obsolete - not to mention the sound of wind "whip around". My friends and I made a movie with a very low budget, and the effects still exceeded this bizarre fest. As far as the amount of errors in this movie is concerned, there is too much to be able to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, was my teacher THEATER. HA! <br /> <br /> Ultimate Verdict: Do not be afraid of this "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of 73)
