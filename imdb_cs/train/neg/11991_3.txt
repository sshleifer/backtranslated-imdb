- Bad Stuff: This movie is a real deal. Bad pieces of one thing looked so fake that I thought it was "The Twilight Zone". Sample playback is useless. One part of the movie he thinks he's taken his anger at the window will make his life better. I want to know the director and if he was tall, because acting, even adults, was terrible. The kissing scene in this movie even burned. This movie killed a book. The book was great. I do not really like this movie. Nor for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good thing: I do not know what I can really say. There are some exciting parts that bring you, but they are quickly shot down by bad stunt work and acting. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: Do not look.
