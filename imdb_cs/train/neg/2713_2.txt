I like a lot of actors / actors involved in this project, so offended the film felt even worse than if they used the unknown. The main problem was that this film was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers. 30 years Nbc probably made a movie like this in the early 90s. I see it now in a black family where the children are involved in a revival, and the white family has children rebel and listen to grunge rock music. The soundtracks will feature groups such as Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, etc., so it's going to be as cheesy as the 1960s and I will surely do NBC for you. Seeing the biggest problem with period pieces when you've made shopping nets is that if you live in a certain time period, you do not think that 60s or decades are trendy retro at that time. Next, someone doing something like that should give more weight to the project
