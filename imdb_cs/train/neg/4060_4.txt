OSTRAY O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto and new code) Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Blind Print 35mm and 70mm) ex-journalist (Karl Malden) hears the scream of extortion outside the Genetics Research Laboratory, and later collaborates with reporter James Franciscus to investigate a series of murders in the lab, unknowingly dying his beloved at the mercy of a psychopathic killer. <br /> <br /> He came to production after the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento took THE O'NINE TAILS as a giallo-thriller, basically the same as his predecessor, who fulfilled the celebrated actor from Hollywood by Karel Malden - Fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and rising star Franciscus (VALUE OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film, which claimed advertising, was "nine times more exciting" than "Bird" - a disappointing consequence, flawlessly photographed and stylishly executed, but too fruitful and useless for general consumption. /> Malden and Franciscus are clearly obsessed with sympathetic roles, and cameraman Enrico Menczer (THE WILD ARE ALIVE) uses a wide frame of Cromoscope to mediate the hi-tech world where Argento's Dark Heart scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro star Catherine Spaak LIBERTINE) as the romantic interest of the Franciscan is a little more than an unnecessary padding. One of the most important events is an unforgettable encounter with a Black Glove killer in a crowded railway station (edited by the elegant reassurance of cult filmmaker Franco Fraticelli) and a night episode in which Malden and Franciscus are looking for an important footprint inside the stinging grave and fall prey to the murderous killer's machinations. But in spite of these flashes of brightness, the film deliberately deviates from one scene to another and gently squeezes without getting boiled. No wonder "Cat" failed to imitate the successful success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
