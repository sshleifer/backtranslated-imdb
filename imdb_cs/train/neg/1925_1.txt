Did Ron Howard say that? The 1966 cartoon is charming and simply teaches the lesson to children through a simple conspiracy. In this film, Howard gives Whoville full of greedy, manipulative, egotised Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine that the script has called for the performance of the worst person, so Carrey showed Tom Green and the result is the magic of the film. Just as Danny Devit's penguin in Batman returns, Carrey Grinch is so remarkably dissimilar that any degree of comedy that can escape his character simply evaporates. Where the cartoon appeared in 1966 as Grinch, with whom we were all able to identify, Carrin's Grinch is the angry, soulless old man we all saw at one time or another sitting in a parked car that mumbled or emptied toddlers in a supermarket his stick. This Grinch is totally deprived of any degree of humanity, humor, or any insight and his redemption at the end of the film will ring fake. The whole movie falsely flashes: there is some stupid Christmas lighting contest, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why Grinch is such a bumper digging into his childhood and an unimaginable secret why some of those who have such a particular extension of their lips and some of them do not. Unlike the cartoons of 1966, I would imagine that children will be difficult, irritating and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really have to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard casts cast with his untalented relatives. Take the funny jokes, humorous fantasies, sexual jokes and other obligatory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that's about as far from a 1966 cartoon (or a book that inspired him), such as George W. Bush's rational, clear thinking. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
