Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, do not make any mistake. But it's also incredibly nice. This is to a great extent due to the amazing presence of one Chuck Connors, which is charged as a movie, but really lives in several scenes. I think he should be a kind of Obi Wan Kenobi ("hard ninja-buster"), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says it's a sign of mental retardation, not the highest concentration. But really his two assistants, Sonny and Dennis, have such a terrible dialogue that "Brooklyn," as we call the Colonel, tends to be in comparison. Take special care of Dennis' logic regarding the "genetic plot" that Sakura works with. If you know anything about cloning, you'll die laughing. And yes, that's the main disruption, people. <br /> <br /> The amazingly entertaining film, Sakura Killers, is a hard-to-reach gem. I will not spoil the "trick" that ends for you, except that it's the perfect setting for Sakura Killers 2. The pity that Chuck Connors has died. :-( Because it has the finest way to blow ninja.
