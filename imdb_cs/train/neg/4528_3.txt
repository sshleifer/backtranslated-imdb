This Worldwide was a version of a cheap man that NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made back in the 1980s on localized "Big 3" stations during the Saturday morning / Wrestling afternoon match. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett's unsuccessful version of NWA, he changed it to a World Championship match and continued to run all NWA links together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were labeled WCW and moved from Disney / MGM Studios to Orlando, Florida, and eventually became nothing more than a recap of Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night. Worldwide, it was officially the last WCW Tournament program to broadcast WCW weekend from Vince McMahon and WWF. Today, the entire archiving of NWA World Wide / WCW video cassettes, along with the entire NWA / WCW videotape library, was generally in the vaults of the WWE Command in Stamford, Connecticut.
