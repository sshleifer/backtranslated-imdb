This film was not as bad as the first two sequels of the original film. This is directed by Martin Kitroser on Friday 13th Glory. The game is really very bad, but gore and special effects help make it interesting. This is one thing I like Screaming Mad George, the effects of being so distant and bizarre that they will watch you a bad movie just to find out how fools can get. The film is not really so scary, but it's an extremely ugly eye-spitting scene in the midst of a maggot toy (what ?!) Mickey Rooney is a guest appearance that probably was not too excited but needed money at the time, maybe? If you like the fourth installment (my favorite of all 5), you will probably like it. I like it better than Matrix! Enjoy.
