Really bad. Why anyone thinks it's a good movie, let alone funny, is a real secret. I like comedy just like another guy and I loved the "Christmas story." The fact that he has the same director and was based on the same writer's memories made me totally confused why this film is a complete failure at all levels. Charles Grodin is a miserable miscast as a father for beginners. For others it does not seem to have the same stimulation - it just does not flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that penetrated the first film is completely absent - you want the movie to end. I would not even recommend this film for the curiosities who enjoyed the "Christmas story". It is bad. 1/10.
