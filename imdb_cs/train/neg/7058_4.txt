I came to the New Harbor of JUH, where I waited for a spare movie about a massacre at a school in Columbine like ELEPHANT Gus Van Santu and certainly a TV guide review that said the student sociopat rebels against the system gave me that impression but it's a very boring movie where there is little, so be a warning <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a high school student in Chicago who decides to put back what he thinks is an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is impersonated and the actor, played by Blake Shields, is unable to refine any shortcomings in the script. You feel that Maddox should have the evil of the charisma of Hitler, Saddam, or Bin Laden, but he never thinks anything more than a cunning fluid teenager, and it is impossible to believe he could pick up any apprentice. Your subtext of overthrowing one manipulative authoritarian mode just replacing it with another manipulation mode is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SOUTH is a completely unconvincing drama that is not worth it,
