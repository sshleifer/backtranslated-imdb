Disney goes too many times to the well, because everyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel shattered. The celebration of their daughter's birth Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce her to King Triton. The celebration is quickly encountered by sister Ursula, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defensive tool to obtain the royal trident. To stop the attack, Ariel and Eric build the walls around the ocean while Melody grows wondering why he can not go there. <br /> <br /> Amazing and terrible is what describes this directly to the video sequel. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you look on seems to have come directly to other Disney movies. I think Disney can just plagiarize! Do not tell me that the penguin and the worm does not remind you of another duo from King Lion! Other disappointing moments include a match between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They're great to play it! The culmination of Morgana and VSEM seemed to be another disappointment. I do not give up anything, but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly tight and too big. Disconcert with Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better to let you rent and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the next sequel Disney will drown you later.
