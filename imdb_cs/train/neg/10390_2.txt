I just leased and watched this movie just to find out what was going on. So it's my reaction to that. It is easy to see that this is a low-budget film with poor actors. The main plot of this film is that the woman avenges her opponents. This concept, if this was done right, could easily be a provocative film. However, the film does not hurt or disturb me. It just bored me. This movie can easily be shortened to less than 45 minutes. All the lots of scenes are mostly there to fill the time, like the scenes of the scene and some scenes I described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains a spoiler ***** ******* I find raped scenes. I do not know whether I have been watching a cut or uncut version if it's actually such a version. I also found a lot of holes in a badly written plot. Here's the list at the top of my mind. Why the rapists raped rape Jennifer during the night when she left the house and found out what was the noise. It would be an excellent time. Why they simply do not abuse it instead of some of the rapists delaying the joy and prolonging of Jennifer's misery for so long. It would probably be much more shocking and disturbing. I found it really silly that the violent guys left her in the woods and returned to her house. Perhaps you will show that these rapists are really unreal. These atrocities should at least know that if you want to do the dirty work properly, they should not send a cow who could do the job. /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? Which should be the first thing that occurs with most people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why do not these perpetrators feel danger when they see Jennifer alive? I think it's really amazing that a slender lady like Camille, a tree and hanging it. ************************ The end of the spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey movie is not without his merits, Camille Keaton is wonderful, and I hear one of the most fun line I've heard recently when Matthew is protesting from returning to the house and killing Jennifer, "Why me? Why me, I did not say!"
