I can not believe anyone would think that this film is something original or interesting. I'm a fan of science fiction as well as another guy and I can enjoy old laugh movies if they're written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my glowing review of Altered States [1980].) Monkey could better explain why I should seriously take the second thought behind the film. The problem is not that the producers had a low budget - that is, they did not care. Now publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose hot reviews appear on the box: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> effects, I'll show it to journalists and remind them what they said about the Ada concept.)
