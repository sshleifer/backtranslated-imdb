I am very sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany, and most of his films are considered a "masterpiece" but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004 I wonder what is about this movie everyone and gone! The game is just awful - Hanna Schygulla smiles like an idiot! - the change between Nazi spells and battlefields is ridiculous, the whole movie looks as though it had been done within two days in the attic. It was probably exactly like this and many people consider it a "real art," but for me this movie is simply bad and cheap. Compare it to Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
