The story of the approaching divorce - or is it? - the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Corny dialogue, carton characters, supplies, red herring zombies, and worst of all, no pay, emotionally or dramatically. No one teaches creative writing anymore? The true sign of a weak narrator-if you can not make any satisfying affair-it's enough to end the story. I'm forced to ask, "What did you think it was a story worth mentioning in the first place?" <br /> <br /> The good, but unnecessary debut of the child's actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was at best forgotten. And wondering why nobody is watching indie movies! That's ninety minutes of my life, I'll never go back.
