Definitely, surely the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions! Contributors to this opinion could claim that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, because it is an independent, low-budget film, but is it? amateurism and modest innovations are scary. <br /> <br /> I agree with all that was said about this film, for example about mutilation, poorly acting acting (when it is wrong, you take the next step in shooting the scene, that), the thing I thought was the most common, was a complete lack of common sense in the scenario, assuming that such a thing existed during production. There was an obvious lack of dialogue with respect for the audience, the girls switched to personalities several times and seemed not to show absolutely no singing of any rationality, or the brains - the five relatively fitting girls against one light feminine psychopath? gang is on her, why not? The only thing that can be seen as somewhat conquering this title is that the camera does not leave the van anytime, so the viewer sees everything from inside - which is like the rest of the film a good idea exponentially done terribly. Oh, and by the way, this movie is NEVER like a Blair Witch or Cloverfield project or any other title shot by a handheld camera? it's an effect and not a feature! Used smartly it can be breathtaking, but in this case it is an excuse for lack of cinematography.
