I usually like lesbian movies, though not very good. I'm interested, I think! <br /> <br /> But this is just a pit. Yes, scenery and buildings are beautiful and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this film is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between annoyance and high / stoning / exhaustion of any drug or booze, and Ella inexplicably delivers the whole film with this atrocious behavior. At no point in time, we provide no insight into why it is, or even why Annamarie is so depressing and withdrawn. If there was no closure in a potentially romantic case? do not know!) between these two sides, it could have been some satisfaction. But though Annamarie asks Elly at one point, "Why do you love me?" Ella does not even recognize that. It is never clear whether this is anything other than a lesbian on a boring road with an equal woman. Even the interactions between the two women and the locals who encounter a journey that could be lively and informative are instead flat, tedious and mostly incomprehensible. There's one good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it was unintentional. Women travel in Ford's two-seater coup√© with a medium suitcase. Yet, when they founded the camp, they have a huge tent, baby cots, sleeping appliances and even a desk, chair and typewriter! Besides, when you board a ferry, we see piles of luggage, probably theirs, probably also in a small Ford trunk! <br /> <br /> And in the whole movie we never see either a gas station or anywhere that would look as if it had a place to buy gasoline. They mostly travel through endless miles of deserted deserts. So where did the fuel come from? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many lesbian films, good or bad, but there is plenty that is better than this and few that are worse. Leave it in the shelf.
