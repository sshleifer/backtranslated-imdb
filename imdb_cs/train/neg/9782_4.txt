This movie had such a promise !! What a great idea, a small paintball team that fights for recognition and personal fame, is losing speed due to poor dialogue, bad editing, and half-written stories. The figures at the beginning were interesting only to lose half the pair to become one-dimensional people scattered from tired one-off. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spend some time on the story and the interview, it was a great movie, instead of effort almost after the idea.
