How long do we live when someone like this Joe Swan - whether it's hell, is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker at all! Where are the new crop of creators with brain and talent ??? We need them bad and into hell with mumblecore! This film is about nothing, just like the characters in the film is worthless. It's so terrible, the so-called Gen Y, which is full of poisoned idiots, some of whom claim that movie makers do not bother to learn anything about the vessel before filming. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Contemporary movies as such show how silly the young, the so-called filmmakers can be when they believe they go without script, without direction, without thinking, without a legitimate "camera" DV), no craft of editing, that it is a "rebellious" or "advanced" movie. No, it's called ignorance and laziness, or just pure cinema masturbation (and in fact it's a "face to face" shot shot, "so be prepared). <br /> <br /> Watch the early films of each completed India Linkman, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... no one has done anything boring and aimless like this, yet Swan - no matter what hell is - he's going to SXSW every year and celebrating like some I can not imagine anyone liking it and all that this so-called creator has done (everyone sees me) is just as bad (the newer thing is clearly attracted to a more ordinary audience, one of the sitcoms Make sure you are not a friend or family member of the party ... on the other idea, if you are a family member or a friend, you would probably be embarrassed with a family member sink or friend in such an emergency situation. <br /> <br /> Utter garbage is not an art. This is the opposite.
