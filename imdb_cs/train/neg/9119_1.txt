Actually, I saw this movie in the theater in the original edition. It was painful to watch Peter Sellers so afraid. The story was incredibly poor and difficult to trace, and the end was ridiculous. It was sad to see how powerful they were falling. I will not say that I am a huge fan of Petra Sellers, but I was looking forward to the Pink Panther series and I felt he was doing a great performance in Being There. But this film should never be made. From what I read, he tried to produce this film against the advice of the people around him. Well, it still does not justify the studio that actually releases the film.
