The girl calls the murder and becomes another target of the killer. Director Brian De Palma is very carefully proclaimed here: the camera appears on the corners of the museum (after a long stay above the image of the monkey), divides into split screens for artistic purposes, practically distributes its conspiracy sequence (again in a split display) the two characters watch the TV program about the transsexuals and get on to his (first) final during the stormy storm. "Dressed for killing" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and to return nothing substantial. Much of acting (except young Keith Gordon) is average and (the second) final is a reflection of his own "Carrie" De Palmy - not to mention "Psycho". Explanation of dirty deeds plays like Hitchcock's spoof, not a tribute. Stylishly cold, the results are clearly half-finished. ** z ****
