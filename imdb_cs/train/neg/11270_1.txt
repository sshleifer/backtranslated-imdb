I saw bad movies, but this was p ***. It did not make sense, and all the characters are swearing every few seconds, and I think a person has a low sperm count. It is alright like this. Welshman plays a singing tap. A simple English kid plays a dirty, unhappy roe paddy, and some of the smaller lights are playing poor tarts. And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh, yes, somebody has a gun and maybe he's talking about waste while high on drugs. Avoid this movie as a plague.
