From a misconceived conspiracy line that has almost no sense of bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can not find a way) "Finding John Christmas" is better to lose. Mrs. Bertinelli's image is devoid of depth or emotion, just like her stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as Noe's loving interest. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the father of Noah's father, is almost unbearable to watch her listen to singing. But who can blame them for such material. Michael Murray's screenplay is at best juvenile. <br /> <br /> Every year at this moment, I'm looking for a TV guide and I'm anxiously waiting for some really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday movies that appear on a small screen. Films like "Miracles on the 34th Street", gorgeous Ernst Lubitsch "The Shop around the Corner" and of course the "Scrooge" version of 1951. There are classics Frank Capry "It's a Gorgeous Life" and "Meet John Doe." Hey, forget the classic. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift offers advice. Your time would be better spent searching for these movies than finding "John Christmas Search". Merry Christmas!
