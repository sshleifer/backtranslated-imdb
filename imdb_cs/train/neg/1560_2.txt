This movie can not even be said to be bad, because it is unfortunately only painfully average. If a real joke or imagination is missing, the thin fence is stretched to the absolute limit, and "jokes" (predictable and colorless) are shot in such an excessive length that boredom and yawn will quickly overtake the viewer. Another notation that reminds of John Wasser's sad decline and recalls that what "shocked" us or amused 30 years ago did not work the same way. We've seen it before, and it's been down because it has long vanished. Big mistake.
