If you first met the wonders of cinema, if you've never seen Moving Picture before, you think this movie is a child of the gods. But if you've seen a movie, a television show, even Barney's dinosaur, then you will not be amazed at this movie. Heck Barney Dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this movie. Now I like B movies. I just watched "The Giant Gila Monster" just before I watched this coincidence, and I liked this movie much better. It works as a movie B. It has a lazer dialogue, a hockey acting, a cheese effect and a true true Gila Monster as a monster! Carno 3 simply does not take power B punch. She has a gore, and that Polchek's fellow approaches to being entertained several times, but this movie is stunning, almost ... fake. It's a small engine that could not be made of Dinosaur films. I'm not saying the film should not look. Some people can watch the drying of the gums on the sidewalk and feel entertained. If you are one of these people, then put this film shot.
