I saw this movie with my mountaineer instructor and we found all the funny thing we were out of pity. (One if Stallone is free to climb himself, there's no need to carry some gear, but I think the hanging carbines look like "mountain climby" so they're throwing). For those lobotomized people who think Colorado looks like the Dolomites in Italy (where the film was shot), the Hollywood moguls have a much smarter and dirtier scent than to swallow.
