Adrianne, he really should get his life - without Mr. Brady. He is angry with me and is one of the main reasons why I know I've been on the show for a long time. It is a fairly insignificant show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be included and analyzed until death. It makes them look like they are different than ready for marriage, and yet I know that these disagreements are part of life. I think it's fun for some people. If this happens next season, I'm going to apologize for someone who has nothing to do with their life, but watch this waste. Even though I would not be surprised. can not even hold on to this show anymore! I hope they get enough money to keep up with the camera a week after a week. However, girl "A" has one heck of great ass!
