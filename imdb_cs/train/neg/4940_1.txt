This show turned out to be a loss of 30 minutes of precious space on the DVR disk. I did not expect much and I actually got less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by the second episode, I can not believe that Geico will try to re-use the Cavemen EVER advertising campaign. I'd rather have spent the night when I checked my daughter's hair on my head everywhere I tracked this waste. I wonder what ABC has done to bring this show into the '07 fall, perhaps a hospital / crime / powerhouse reality show featuring the AFLAC duck? If I have not been able to comment on this show, let me clarify and say that it is not very good.
