This film has successfully proven what we all know is that professional basketball players suck everything except playing basketball. Especially rap and acting. I can not even describe how this movie is really bad. First, is it me, or is it the worst child you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth can be used as an opener. Secondly, why would the genie want to continue his career in the music industry when, even though he has magical powers, he is scary to get music? Thirdly, I read the Bible. In no way the shape or the form meant that Jesus made the genius. Fourth, all the dirty special effects? I assure you that any indecisive teen with a computer could have better effects than that. Fifth, why did it end so badly? And what the hell is djinn? Finally, anyone who has created a nightmare known as Kazaam has to be thrown out of the plane and the Eiffel Tower because this movie will take the word "suck" to a whole new level.
