This film is nothing but a religious tract supporting classical Hinduism and New Age Occultism dressed in Western paintings to swallow those who do not know about basic religious comparisons. The basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some of the characters appear both now and in 1600) are clearly reincarnated. God is impersonal power. Live and plant life is the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield tried to combine Eastern mysticism with Western Christianity. His attempt at syncretism may crazy or confuse those who are not seekers of truth, but this film is a weak justification for every final reality. As advertised in the old Berkeley Barb for $ 10.00, it will show you how to start your own religion. As one famous prophet said, "Use the power of Luke".
