Universal Soldier: Return is not the worst movie ever. No, this honor would have to go to a movie that tried to make a statement or achieve some artistic performance, but failed in a pathetic or offensive way. Maybe, however, no movie I've ever seen has been a little bit successful and succeeded just as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This film is a sci-fi / action travesty that practically has nothing to recommend it. The game is just as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The conspiracy is terrible and predictable. Special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who even remotely joins this movie should be ashamed of itself. USA: The return makes the previous Van Damme fare look like a pioneering movie masterpiece. Some movies are so bad, they are good. Believe me when I tell you it's not one of them. I'm really not sure what to say yet. I doubt many people were considering seeing this movie, if not yet, but only on the case: no.
