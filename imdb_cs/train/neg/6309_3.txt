This movie has good intentions and a good story you can work with. The director and screenwriter of this film failed to create a dull, boring film element that reminded me that I went back to the 8th class of social studies of Mr. Hartford - the way back in 67. What will somebody please accept this story and come out of it a true movie - the story deserves it. Each time the scene had the potential, there was only a few clich√©s left in combination with the black and white shots that they probably got from The History Channel to show action. Shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this tedious feast. Another acting performance was incredibly boring - it fits into the movie well and who played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery. However, if you are willing to accept all the many flaws in this movie and are not interested in having fun or having fun, but want to learn about the USS Mason, it is worth watching.
