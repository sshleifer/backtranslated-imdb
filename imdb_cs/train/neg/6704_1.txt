it's just a terrible comedy - it's really a bad movie. there are no funny elements. no jokes that are fun. I do not know how some people can claim that this movie may be "smartest" or "good". maybe, if it's the only movie anyone saw you, what the brothers say. but I've seen thousands of better movies: namely leonard part six (now, it's funny)! I do not know how brothers are even considered eligible to be featured on the internet movie database: it's more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Jokes aside, just skip this movie. The root canal is much more fun than this endless material.
