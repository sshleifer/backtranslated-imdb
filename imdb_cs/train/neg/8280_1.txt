When watching this, I mostly noticed the ad placement. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It's one product placement after another. It is quite clear how this film got the money. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is ridiculous. Any Dick should never work because he plays the same lame figure. The "story" is just the background for this very long ad. I can not believe that this film was even considered for a theatrical release. The longer you watch this movie, the more you feel embarrassed to all of you. The only minor rescue is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who has almost no time on the screen like Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed to watch the whole thing. I would recommend that you avoid this.
