When I refer to Malic as a noir movie, I do not have such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor compare Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I only register a protest against the darkness that penetrates the movie from start to finish, to the extent that most of the time you just can not find out what's going on. I understand the darkness in the night scenes, but this film was dark even in bright daylight for what reason I understood the loss. Nor would it make a big difference if director Becker made a film in utter darkness.
