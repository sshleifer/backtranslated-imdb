Cedric Kahn's films are more character-based than action-based (I think of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so he has difficulty seeing this series of truly professional hunters scattered with some frustrating attempts to give the Succo character. I did not find Stephan Cassetti as an interesting actor; reminds me of professional athletes who are in films like Bret Favre. That empty look looks like a really sinister deer stuck in the headlights. A real actor would have to think more about Succa than to admire his skills in carjacking. Little actor comes mostly from Isild le Besco, because the Succo schoolgirl needs revolt. Interview with the police office is a miracle of non-violent stubbornness with little fear of the future. Le Besco apart, it is little to recommend this movie.
