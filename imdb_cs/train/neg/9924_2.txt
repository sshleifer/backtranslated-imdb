The Dutch Schultz, AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real man, and his rather ugly life is quite well documented. This film, which wants to portray his life, should use a fictional character, because the too dramatic event is too much a deviation from facts and chronology. Not only does he ignore some interesting details that included other versions, such as public relations fiasco in New York and his religious conversion. It is true that they were executed by Luciano, Lansky et al. al. but it is so far. The explosive plaque scene, which represents Lucian executing Bo Weinberg's execution in his own home, with his mother's help, is disturbing. There is also a scene in which the Dutch approach their own mother to pay for Legs Diamond protection. It simply does not work. The figure of Mrs. Fleggenheimer also does not work. This film does not need any Jewish mother for comic relief. The poor representation of Legs Diamond was quite humorous. I'm sure you're rotating in the grave. And by the way, the Dutchman actually personally killed people, but it was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which he spends the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it was a comedy and I just did not get it.
