He saw this piece of work at the CA film festival. My God, what did the director say? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when shooting a short film. First of all, this project does not make any sense. The film takes place partly in "The Waystation", a stupid faulty bar in the middle of nothing where nothing really happens. The effects are out of the question. So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. The lead actress Julia Reading is a step in playing in most amateur pornographic movies. There is one or two good performances, including those who played Jacob and Fenner, but as a director he had no idea how to work or enjoy his Thespians. The only thing worse than acting was dialogue that bordered with absurdity. The writer (who I suppose to be also a director) writes every character, such as audition for the comic bookseller. The total production value is pretty good, but to be honest, it's easy to ignore this bad movie. The production design is quite good, although Waystation looks like a regular bar. Costumes and makeup are all right and I understand that production works with a low budget. It's just when they talk or try to move the conspiracy forward, the film melts into a pile of crap. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is terrible. He's like a director / writer watching a lot of science fiction movies and throwing all the parts he liked in the mixer and came up with it. My only hope is that he used the money of other people, because if he uses his own, it's a fool.
