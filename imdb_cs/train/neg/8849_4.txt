That's a pretty bad movie. But not as bad as the reputation suggests. The production values ​​are not too bad and there is a special effect scene. And it has 80 cheesoid veneers, which means it's always fun. Beware of Jimmy Nail's short occurrence - his attempt at the American accent is such a staggering trash, it's fantastic. Sybil Danning's breasts are also fantastic - they appear briefly in the film, but the scene is repeated 14 times in the final data, which can only be described as Sybil Danning's 12-month remix. He must be seen to have believed them. As a horror film it's not scary, the effects are stupid and Christopher Lee returns to the nautical night despite his performance. I think he bought a new house and needed some money to make a deposit. woman - was so insignificant that I almost forgot about them and I was watching this movie tonight. Werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact they are bizarre sometimes they look more like a bad burning monkey. The European setting is quite good and the music provided by the new Babel wave band, although quite horrible, gives the film at least some added cheese. Overall? Good for laughter. are you seriously supposed to be that? And at least you always got Sybil's knock.
