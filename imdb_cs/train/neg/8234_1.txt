Writers and producers of this small trip have fallen to new depths of abuse. The writer's block was so bad, OR they had so many dry ideas that they were forced to include the disgusting scene where the young woman sank in the back seat of the van and then immediately squeezed the excrement of the car for at least that summed up what this film is. We have been treated with one of the other women who have been urinating over one of her friends with a gun, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would be enough ... we got a message! This is really toilet humor to the next level! If script and acting were better, I could easily forget that I was watching a movie shot exclusively on a low-budget video. It was a fairly original story, with a clever (single) direction, in the sense that we only had to take a look from inside the van; making it much more real. We have never met in any other places like a shop or a field where a lot of women have disappeared, which could have given the much needed tension. The script was terrible. Rows such as "I do not feel well ... I want to go home" after one of the girls was persecuted by a psychopath; exposed to rape by a screwdriver and shot, looks a little inadequate. The game was evil (except the maniac). It was all the top 5 actresses who learn to take part in the postal correspondence course during a long postal betting! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles on. The director seemed to have an easy job in this job. It seems the only direction he had to put was "Scream girls." AND AS A DEVICE ...... If you look at it, make sure you have some paracetamol ready!
