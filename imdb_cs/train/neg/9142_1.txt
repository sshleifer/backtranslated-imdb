I just watched after I heard about how bad she was and wanted to look for herself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you will not be able to understand how terrible this movie is, although it must be one of the most fun things I've ever seen! He never bothered to write a comment before, but he really bites this bite. <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is ridiculous and nonsensical. The brother of the lead character (either Ben or Arthur, I forgot, which is, and frankly, that it's never clear) wants to stop some homosexual marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians, but apparently mass murder is not 't. Then another bull appears in one of the ex-husbands of a homosexual couple trying to force her to get married again with a gun. It does nothing, but it gives us one of the most fun parts of the dialogue in the whole "movie" - "I have no sense, you do not make sense! That's who makes sense!" Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there is an acting that is just cruel. It must be seen that he believed them. My personal favorite is obviously a stoned woman of lawyers in the field of civil rights, which clearly reads something from him, but they have succeeded in doing so. Enough was said. A homosexual couple could not be less convincing. There is a little attractive and absolutely carefree guy and his friend who looks like the little cartoon man who reported in the bistro. Only thicker. And less talented. <br /> <br /> "The movie" was also shot by someone who is unable to hold the camera even remotely, and the number of errors in the whole range is amazing. The whole thing starts with a fat main guy in a bed with two boots. Yes, but we all know how terrible this thing is and I would like to highlight some of the most valuable comedic moments that the film offers. <br /> <br /> - When the fat guy lights up the church and then appears as a six-year-old girl in the parking lot to escape. Cheerful. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! You have no idea what relationship you have with the main characters - sometimes they know it, sometimes not, but they appear on a few scenes. Cheerful. <br /> <br /> - Stone Lawyer. I've already mentioned it, but she's so funny it's worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> - The evil brothers' dinner of the tumblers he put on his guests. <br /> <br /> - gay potion. <br /> <br /> - Cats of the evil brother. <br /> <br /> - The end that can not be surrendered because it must be seen to be believed. I warn you and make sure you are not eating at the time !!!! Litter of the main character / director / producer is naked. It's a foul. <br /> <br /> In essence, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comic thing you will see for a long time. Virtually nothing about this excuse for the film is nothing good, the director's introduction even makes it possible to make introductory credits to the joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
