I'm embarrassed to write this review. I say that, because those of you who are reading will know that I've been sitting all over the thing and it's annoying to admit to strangers. But I had to warn those who read IMDb comments in front of the viewer before watching a movie that does not have to look at this. That's the smallest thing I can do. That's a bad movie! Believe me. The story is scary. The game is amateur. And director, camera, sets, costumes, etc. They are all the other. Let it be.
