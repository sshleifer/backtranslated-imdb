Whenever the story of Columbo deviates from a well-known conspiracy (a colorful murderer has committed a crime, Columbo smokes a killer, Columbo becomes a pest in the process), writers sometimes disagree with the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in the extreme case and the result is the main flop. <br /> <br /> Would you believe that Columbo has never seen the villain until the very end? !! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds over. <br /> <br /> Oh, the victims are self-appointed reviewers to do!
