As a big fan of Corman's horror films, I waited a little more from my West than I got. Well, I enjoyed it well. I had almost as much laughter as I watched Mel Brooks's Hot Saddle. Take a look at the spectacle of mobile tires on the Old West Prairie. You can kill time by counting it if it happens that the scene is happening otherwise. It seems that even horses have speed in them, they are considered to be a rapid pursuit. See also the shuttle cafes from the traditional wild west lounges that make a number that resembles some fashionable dance from the 1920s, decades before the style was invented. Let's hope the salon around them does not fall apart. <br /> <br /> In the midst of this chaos, the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all right. Special praise for doing the best they could with the material that seems to have been mostly picked up from "Johnny Guitar," but it does not quite work the same way. But with such a ridiculous Western nothing is wrong. Just like a really bad old horror film, it could be a failed one, but it's also a good thing to enjoy. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work refers to me, so I would like to recommend that you take this film if you have a chance.
