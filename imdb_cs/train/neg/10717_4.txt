I give it generous four out of ten stars, or dots or markers, or something. There were two really really fun scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved well. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual trading with stereotypes, stunning speed, stupidly pushed a silly soundtrack, and the "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Every two really really entertaining scenes are attended by Amy P. She is really cheerful in an animal way. It's a mixture of that monkey who's doing on SNL and Lucille Ball. I hope that (Amy P and Tina Fey) just admitted that they did it for the money, because when it's done, it was the parody of Sarah Palin, then I think we can say that, yes, it was worth the black guy to return to the role servants, who is really there to help you be a human being. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10, as I said, is generous. But no more, girls, okay? Oh, I almost forgot. Mom of "Two and a Half Men" is in this movie and she has some plastic surgery, so her mouth now looks like a 30-year-old mouth, so every scene she's in, to the question: "No, wait, wait, has a plastic surgery?" Because as a viewer you really do not want to have plastic surgery.
