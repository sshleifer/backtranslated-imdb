When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder are in the same movie, I was glad to score! I admit I wanted to see the movie. And I must say that the first fifteen minutes were nostalgic enough. Then it all went down. I did not expect it to be a landfill of politically correct civil rights, mumbo jumbo. All possible controversial themes were taken and fed them into one stupid story. I was horrified that Noah was involved in such a thing, especially his role. No one with a fully functioning brain would actually accept all the crap about the Vietnam War. If someone really wants to know what communism is, sit down and read the book. And no one who praises or is against it, just cold hard facts. I just watched a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all about me. Everything else about this movie has irritated me.
