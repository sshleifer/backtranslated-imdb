How can Disney get? Preppy rich girls behave like idiots, buy a lot of things and teach a lesson. Disney tries to send a lesson to herself? That everything might still be a human being when shopping? Whether psycho-analysis is anything, this film sucks. Girls want a rich party for their rich life. But then the money will disappear and they have to use their wealth to get a dairy factory (yes, milk) that will employ laborers. They leave it on the water until the father comes back home. And the man in the beginning who seems to be the one who takes the money is the man at the beginning. But the end is stupid. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh? My time did not take time again. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's Moving Castle. "D-"
