Much is in Sugar Teen Ape. When she wakes up, she's pretty hot (the part played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel), and out for revenge by those who have done her wrong. How subtitle and box art means it's really a start on Kill Bill, but it's Chris Seaver, it's a wild incompetent satire (and I use the last word very freely) that it's better than the first movie, but the truth it is said that I was so ridiculously drunk from my ass when I saw the previous movie that I can not even hope to compare it at this moment. But I had to enjoy it since I bought the sequel (see when I'm drunk I like it because of lack of better words, complete and completely miserable movies) There's a few laughs aloud moments (few) but I remember Bonejack but it's more fun. At least in a little over an hour, it's over the power fast for what's worth.
