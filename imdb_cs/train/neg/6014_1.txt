Left Behind is an incredible loss of over $ 17 million. The game is weak and flat, the story is even weaker. Listeners are asked to believe a very unlikely and many-time mixer line and give them nothing for their good faith. Not only is the film misplaced and scenario, but in all technical areas of the film is hardly missing. The production proposal does not help in credibility. The effects are completely neoriginal and flat. Illumination and overall continuity are inexorably terrible; even compared to movies with a tenth budget. None of that matters, however, that millions of families will doubt that the film will be considered integrity and religious behavior; and who can blame them. However, it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept third-level filming.
