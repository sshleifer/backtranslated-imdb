The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately it fell apart due to the weak / unlikely story line, miskasting and general lack of content / content. One of the most obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arabian man, did not know how to pronounce his Arabic name! This may seem a small mistake, but it points to the seeming lack of effort to pay attention to detail. The quality of acting was evenly below average. <br /> <br /> The lonely rescue of the film was a turning point in a plot at the very end; and a French song (I do not remember the title). Overall, it was a pretty bad movie when Sean Connery was visibly bad.
