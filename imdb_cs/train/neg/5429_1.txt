The film starts with a nice sand It looks like a thriller with Arbaaz Chan who walks on a suspicious journey but suddenly we are forced to comedy With routine silly idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshare, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal who behave like adults Their scenes are first quite funny and then they are boring It's a bored signature of a plot of Tanushree's brother who's killed In the end, the film tries to get serious with the bad guys who are kidnapping our heroes but here it's even stupid Then the long, screaming culmination culminated with HERA PHERI and wait, there's even a long </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is wrong, the film has a left look all around <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene where he will pay his rent and I was happy that the actor is not loud and over top as other movies But no, He's becoming his usual self and irritating most of the time Tusshar should not talk in the movie, his delivery is terrible Sharman's salvation grace, he's the only actor who behaves very well in this film Kunal Khemma is trying hard in his first comic film as an adult but does not act too much Tanushree is wrong as always Arbaaz Khan gets less space and is customary Payal is a non-actress Murli Sharma is terrible
