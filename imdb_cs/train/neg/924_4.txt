WARNING SPOILERS ***** A really stupid film about a group of young excursions in Italy that will find the armor of a mythical warrior with demonic souls. One of them wore and became obsessed with the spirit of the demon. It's killing time and some of his friends are dying under his blade to revive a corpse of demons. Loss of time for viewers, how delicate young ladies leave the dress, as absurd as possible, and acting is terrible, perfect pairing for such a bad scenario <br /> <br />
