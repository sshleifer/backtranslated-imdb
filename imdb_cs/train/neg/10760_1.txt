This film is the culmination of everything that's wrong with modern film. unnecessary slowdown, unnecessary switching / jumping / sommersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue ... essentially unnecessary. (is it a word? Well, it just invented me, Robot.) What happened to the practicality? (that is a car garage, a spray on the skin) the only tool that displays a combination of futuristic and realistic features is the reversal of a card in a cafe. What happened when it showed respect for women? (that is, the blacksmith figure does nothing, but the doctor worsens the movie, and yet still "wants" it.) Where is the tension? I'll tell you where, good looks and not admiration or common reason) /> <br /> What happened to the detective she detects? Smith did nothing but sit and feel compassionate about himself, complain about other people and when they said something that caused the thought of being gone. this is such a faint way of getting a story from b-c-d-etc ... it was fine once, but not several times in a row. (talking a few times in a row about what was "I snoring and I do not listen to you joke, twice in one scene?") What happened to the small parts of the movie was somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to support rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (child) in the movie Overall Two Scenes, we know that A-on degrades women and B-knows Smith ....... so from the COURSE should we take care of him and whether he hurts or not what happened to Hera? let's forget that there are people, women and children wherever robots are attacked and selfishly rescued only by the person who thought I had some acquaintance and why he had to leave the motorcycle with the air showing off while the doctor was some in a way able to reach the same distance in a few seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm all for the show, but I'm all for shredding realism and meaning. film in a long time <br /> <br /> I pray that the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and easier things in movies ...... but mainly simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Big Movie Budget Projects: "You Have to Die"
