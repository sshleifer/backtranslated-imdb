Scary Movie 3 is so dirty that it's hard to put it word. It makes movies like Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar material, he just lets say. The original Scary movie was great fun, one of the better 90s spoof films, coming from a big team that had previously rocked our world with Dont be a threat to the southern central while drinking its juice in the hood. But what the hell happened ?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, I thought the change of actor and crew would help but worse. Within 20 minutes, I smiled twice. No laughter, jokes were recycled, and originality, of course, was not a factor. The fact that at this point in writing, most people on this website voted that I felt physically ill. When there are great shots like the School of Rock out there that have jokes that are funny, anyone who spends their money on a tripe needs to explore. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
