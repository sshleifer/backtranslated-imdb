The Invisible Man is a fantastic film from 1933, a top-notch film for his time when the objects seemed to rest on the top of a man who was really invisible. Go ahead, let's see the movie, you'll be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true effect movie. Come 2000, computer specialized effects look like a child's game, the audience is not blown by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the HG Wells story update, are fine, but not the biggest problem with Paul Verhoeven's filter, which you can remember Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist in the world of bio-invisibilation dabbling (yeah, I know it's not a word) but of course he is fighting with higher fans who are threatening to refuse to fund the team. So, because movie characters who are about to limit their finances are prone to make a final sacrifice and become a guinea pig for invisibleness (yes, I know, I used the wordless process). The process has terrible consequences, no Caine dies, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a fellow. Now that she is invisible, Caine meets her sexy neighbor, co-worker, ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who fired his funding. Then there is a funny thing, Caine becomes a new supernatural being: "A thing that does not die." Laughing face to face with all natural, Caine faces death and spits on his face because it takes what feels like the hour when this creature will die, pulling the end of the film out. The film is stupid, silly and ultimately ridiculous as realism sometimes is used, sometimes not. Hollow's men are smart, but none of them are explored. For an interesting view of an invisible creature, get ready for some good old-fashioned black-and-white cinema and look at the Invisible Man from 1933. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you return, probably still living at the bottom of the volcano.
