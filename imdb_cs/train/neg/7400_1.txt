I've seen some bad movies and it's here. No plot to talk about is like one of those bad comedy episodes on soap operas. I just wanted the little girl to give it because she just says she's really suspicious all over the movie. The creatures running around were funny. I also saw a little "Silent Hill" there. And I read that he did or did he look at the Finnish metal band, Lord. No wonder it does not make much sense. It seems to be a means of promoting the band and nothing more. FX are very good, film looks, monsters and even acting are good. But the story and storytelling are not.
