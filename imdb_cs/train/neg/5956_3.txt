Another horror in which the teenager fights with the crazy and his supernatural partner who wants to take over? Yes, but the fact that this was from Canada gives him a somewhat different feeling. "Brain" has a harassing teenager Jim Majelewski, who has entered a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cultivated leader with the help of a big ugly "brain." Can Jim stop him? I think that since our northern neighbor has done everything he has done, he has the right to make at least one ridiculous horror film. Yet he will probably want to be known for having national healthcare and everything. <br /> <br /> The evil man had a brain. Why people filming this movie?
