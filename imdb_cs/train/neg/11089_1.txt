A rather good film, but not a true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, murder and never found guilty. The state of New Jersey did not go for the third time because it left for 20 years. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Go through the lie test and go for free." He did not take it. This movie should never be, but money talks. Many people wrongfully spend their life in prison and no doubt more black people than white people. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
