First of all, it is possible to divide this film into three parts. A promising opening with a reversal of some Cheyenne ride. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle part, with a totally dirty candidate of Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue" passengers to get to the safety of the army crew. Miss Bergen writes unacceptable words with four letters every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just came out of 1970's Jack Nicholson. I think he has zero interest, with no credibility. The third and final part includes the complete indiscriminate killing of an Indian village. It is so exaggerated to lie on anti-war propaganda that it simply becomes long, abominable and conceived. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's the idea. Why are you actually looking at the film you are commenting on, instead of shaking your liberal nonsense. This is not a political place, it's for viewing movies. - MERK
