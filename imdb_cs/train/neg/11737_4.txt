Well, I do not think the picture is as bad as most reviews do. . . but it can not be denied that it has problems. <br /> <br /> Mostly there are problems in the script. There is a conspiracy - but not a story, and certainly not one could call it credible; it exhausts any number of confidently strange and / or stereotypical characters, rows, moments of what you have, and ultimately did not get too much in this department. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I could not worry about what Farnsworth would try to solve; there will always be a population willing to do something to crush their brains, even if it requires running around cornfields that try to steal ammonia or what they do crazy. So, like a movie, you will not find me to call "Iowa" "important." But at the stylistic level, the painting is more than interesting, and some of the possibilities that Farnsworth portrays is a rendered picture, it is beautiful, cheerful, disturbing, and - yes, I say - inspired. /> <br /> The performance is uneven, but it may just be the victim of the above-mentioned style. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a great actress - but it's not very good, so a discriminating member of the audience has to ask, "What happened?" It is strange that Diane Foster controls the simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere. For example, I could seriously consider any explanation that Farnsworth could have given Michael T. Weiss as a probation officer, but I doubt I would ever buy it; It simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Then it is the liveliest once again, and when I saw John Savage in years. So go ahead. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of work that tantalizes but does not promise - and that's fine; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is obliged to shoot movies. So, no matter if Farnsworth has another movie in his movie, he must be seen, but if so, it seems quite likely that at the age when people plan their life around the last installment of "American Idol", maybe we could, not ugly, Farnsworth's legitimate and undeniably flawed film. <br /> <br /> What's more, maybe we could welcome, not tug, with his energetic and sometimes blessed idiosyncratic imagination.
