Spoilers Forward - Follow on your own caution. My main problem with this movie is that as soon as Harry learns the identity of the three blackmailers - quite easily - he continues to uphold his demands. And then the whole scene with her wife is kidnapped, she decides to get her classic car to explode (with the money in her), which makes us a relatively high leap of logic. Well, so he wanted his relationship with Cini from the public eye to involve his wife in the DA campaign. I see it, but why not hire someone who would get a little wrapped around these sticks or even killed them as soon as they find out that there is no real blackmail (like Ciniino's body?) It was a pretty interesting film for the first 2/3 of that. Then it gets a little broken.
