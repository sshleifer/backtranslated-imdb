Ripping this movie is like shooting the fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to get the positive aspects of the little man. First, I am amazed by the special effects. It really seemed that Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a little man. I never even questioned it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved some unexpected cameras. David Alan Grier played the troublesome singer restaurant, and his performances "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were invaluable. John Witherspoon, who was accidentally played by Grier's father in Boomerang in 1992 (when you recall, he "coordinated" the mushroom belt with a mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessin's father in Little Man. So it was fun. Besides, this movie is about as credible as White Chicks. How stupid is it when a doctor can not say he's a 24-year-old man, not a child? It has a complete tooth !!! How is it possible that no one notices that it is not a child? The little guy is so bad that there's a casual story by Rob Schneider. And if you're so stupid that you lose $ 8 on this movie, at least give me a favor and DO NOT ASK YOUR KIDS. This movie is too sexual for young children (lots of jokes and cues about sex, going down, eating, etc.) And I felt embarrassed for parents who brought their children to the screening I had to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiot movie, at least you will save your children from pain and suffering.
