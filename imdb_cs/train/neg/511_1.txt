In this big bomb I was one of the few accessories. I have just found myself in the right place when working on racing scenes in A.I.R. as it was known at that time. Very good scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I do not have to sit down the whole thing. It was more of a party than a movie set, but hey, the salary was good. The attention to detail was not for that strong point, but who knew it. The funny thing was to see the cars in the track at a really slow speed and then accelerate in the movie to what was approaching normal speeds. Many scenes have changed when they were filmed, I suppose that you have the cost and time. But everybody had such a good time who cared for it!
