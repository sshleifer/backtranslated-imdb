A family of terrible people must stay in the house for one week, otherwise they will lose their inheritance to servants who will have an inheritance only if they agree to stay in the house and we will be fine. People are dying (and so are you, if you try). If you ever wanted to see bad actors - many with naughty teeth - act or try to act in bad horror, it's your chance. That's awful. It's so bad that I called Al Adamson, one of the worst directors at all, but I was wrong. It's so bad I'm not saying anything more about it, not because it's not polite, but because I started it once, maybe I will not stop it. <br /> <br /> Avoid
