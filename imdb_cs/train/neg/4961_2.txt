And that's all. This thing is slow. Actors have the ability, they just do not seem to be motivated to make efforts. This conspiracy is not so great and it is made difficult by the above-mentioned slowness of all. Accents, if any, are British. Uh, many of these people should be Dancers. OK, OK, accents are not so important. But the language is. I do not think they used words like "yeah" and "OK" in Beowulf's days. And the allegedly cold weapon the King gave him? Did he ever find the thing? Did he ever see it? Or was Beowulf so bad a target? Well, his goal has at least adapted to the computer graphics used to generate monsters. They were rather gone. Bad special effects. Clear place? Just one thing I can think of. Marina Sirtis has lagged over the years.
