Now do not mind me. If you need a clear summary of everything that was wrong with the history of human civilization, as well as the flawless path to a clearer future for mankind, what better way than to comedians and practitioners of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid, good reasons why religion has survived its usefulness, then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God (?) Sako! This is a good point in itself. Maher rejects our religious past as a neurological disorder that comfortably ignores the whole society, art, and science. In this film, he relies heavily on his enormous skill of irony and cynicism to try to show eruditely and wisely. Unfortunately, his intellect is not a task. <br /> <br /> Maher laughed at us, but it is obviously not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to the respondent (and I volunteered freely, since there were obviously all "ambushees"), claiming that the existence of Jesus is a dead-end historical fact, "No, it's not," followed by a long look to explain disdain for the naivety of the subject device that is being exploited in this movie). The problem is that the person was right and Maher dead in his statement that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be historically suspected evangelicals. I think Mr. Maher has never read the current historian Josephus. But the masses gather for this pseudo-documentary film because they are making fictional works by other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and will loudly hear that the loudest and most similar show occurred during about 70% of the time that the film devoted to it is anti-Christian tirade while the audience was totally negligible during the 10% token that criticized the self-described Peace Religion. Hmmm. Either the criticism of Islam is beyond the boundary of the hip and the liberal target audience, or they were just afraid to laugh. Exactly, either ..
