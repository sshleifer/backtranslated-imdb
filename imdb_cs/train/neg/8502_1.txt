At first I find an interesting film, a Spanish thriller in the interesting Madrid today, but that's nothing of the fact that the film is just interesting for the future films of directors who learn about what to do in the film is worse in the other words the presence of the Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent on seeing this film, acting is terrible, and actors seem to be waiting to finish their daily shots to come home, lead to nowhere and are boring, weak and bad, they do not spend time or money on this movie.
