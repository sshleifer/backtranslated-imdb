It has to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time. Wonderful acting, terrible script ... and good points! One is definitely missing! Jokes, if you could call them, were so predictable they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to lose the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I was sitting willing to give a chance, I hope it will improve, which, unfortunately, did not do it! If it was between a book and a book, I suggest that you settle for a good reading! I like Denise Richards, which is why I made this film but why she let her be cast in this movie is behind me!
