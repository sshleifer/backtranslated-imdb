"Power Play" starts interesting but goes down quickly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and has a very small role. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than a year in California. The herd of earthquake in the store is so elaborate and absolutely unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like a lot of coaches who play. It's terrible, just terrible. If you created "Power Play" in the mid-sixties or seventies, it would be considered a "B" bad movie. The fact that in 2001 was "Power Play" is really sad. Is there anything like a "D" movie? If so, "Power Play" casts the form.
