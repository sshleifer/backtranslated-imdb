A man wakes up from a nightmare on bats. He and his wife go to the desert for a picnic on a honeymoon. She seems to hear a strange noise and she is concerned about looking at a bat that crawls over a picnic blanket. He wants to go for a cave tour that has something to do with some kind of job he does, but he wants to enjoy the honeymoon. He refuses. They're on tour, but the group lets them go out. Scrape down on a slope where it is insect-stricken. He follows her. He hears a strange sound again and seems to know that the bat is approaching; one, and gets into her hair. He fights it out and attacks him, bites his forehead. They emerge from the cave, but when they are in the gondola in the ski resort, they begin to have seizures in which they have hallucinations or the visions of bats invading people. When that happens, he'll be angry. He is unable to drink alcohol without spitting it. His wife takes care of rabies and starts Pasteur treatment, but reacts violently to the injection. And then some people are killed. We see the parts of a man's transition to a bat. It does not seem to be just his mind. Whether impatience causes these transformations to be unclear as it has already had some symptoms. <br /> <br /> While it seems the name is inappropriate, the end result is that the same person is happening. It's not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of desert, cave and ski slopes and some of the wild scenes. I did not think it was as bad as other people, and I did not think the 1999 Bats movie was as bad as the others think (I rated it as 5/10).
