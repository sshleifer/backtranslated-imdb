Worse, the show is on a serious fall. The first two sequels were acceptable and since then we've seen a lot of really horrible movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance like Freddy, but the rest of the cast can not act. The story is that Alice, who survived the previous nightmare payment, found that the fatal dreams of Freddy Krueger were starting again. This time, the assassin smiles through Allen's unborn baby's sleeping mind. His intention is to "reborn" into the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her son? Look at the first three, omit the next three, and then look at the last one.
