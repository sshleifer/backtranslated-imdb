This deliberately bizarre adaptation of the Borges short story is typical of Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, averted by the terrified half-baked effect of most cast. The film is definitely in the surrealist tradition of Bunuel's Mexican period and looks at them as a poor man on Lars Von Trier's Elements of Crime. Cox's obvious preference for individual shots, jump cuts, and recording of surround sound work against the effectiveness of the film. It's worth seeing, but it's disappointing.
