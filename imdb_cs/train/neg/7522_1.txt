Wow ... where to start ... he raised it to Big Lots for only $ 2.99. These are three dollars I will never see again ... at all ... and for what? I'll tell you that. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring chat and anxiety in the dormitory that seemed to be more suitable for Lifetime than horrific flick ads on the box. (Maybe the marketing droids who have designed it to burn in hell for all eternity). Watch it with a little cheap gore (not even a good gore you think ...) and a conspiracy at the end that comes out of nothing and makes no sense. Amazing, terrible, terrible ... Have there been some redeemed qualities? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, it was six breasts, but it's hardly worth the three dollars. Without them it could be on sci-fi, say, two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
