because that's the only way you will not think that this movie is a total waste of time and money. Remake "Heaven Can Wait" (which was at least appropriate to watch) is a bad apology for a romantic comedy. It's more like a vehicle that will give Rock the time for a film for a poor comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes generally come from the body of an old, fat, rich dead man, but are shown to come from the rock itself. When it offends Blacks and Whites, chemistry is wrong. The film is not funny, he shot badly that acting is at best weak. Go to rent "Heaven Can Wait" and Live Rock Video and you will get ahead of the game.
