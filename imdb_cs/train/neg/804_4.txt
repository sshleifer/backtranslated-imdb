I rated this movie as 1, because the plot is incredible incredible. Judge for himself. Note that it follows not only to make a plot but also to spoil your taste for watching the movie. A computer virus, designed by a frustrated jerk, sends code over TV screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye, it can get to the "electrical system" of your body. What she does is forcing the body cells to excrete calcium. Within a few seconds after infection, the patient reaches the neck, develops the tunnel sight, removes the skin, then falls and his hand and skull break into the cloud's cloud. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When he finds that an expert on a blind computer attempts to break the code using Braille output - hand-held - the device is set to very high voltages, causing severe burns on the skin of the expert head. The virus also feels aggressive against the remote controls and the ATM keyboard. Fortunately, this could be stopped by throwing an obsolete desktop computer into a rack and electrating the disgust that had its back on the broken computer and legs in some spilled water.
