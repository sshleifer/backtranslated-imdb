When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLECH! This show is moody, poorly written and rarely funny. All three were all good actors and entertaining men (Saget stood much better than the stuff with which the show came, just as Coulier was better and Stamos was better than the average actor). After some time Stamos wanted to show up because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was eventually canceled when many actors demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that crazy bring me to the show: <br /> <br /> 1. Phrases of error - how many times one person can deal with tedious phrases such as 'how rough' 'you kid', 'nerdbomber', 'miss out' and 'love' in 24 hours? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most difficult character she ever wrote for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Font - stale and cliché as oreo cookie. There is a good typing cliché and bad typing cliches. Full House had a bad typing cliché. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco - Enough said. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic Things - Too Many Reminders. <br /> <br /> 6. Modern kids - Girls have all the youngest fashion and you can see posters of fashionable recording artists that they would get. Now this show is at Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing to say about the people involved because I think many of them are talented themselves. But this show was so sweet sweet, I could not stand it after a while.
