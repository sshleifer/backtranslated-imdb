I'll be so quick and sweet. The five girls on the way home from the soccer game decide to take a "short cut" that would lead them to a deserted forest-driven road. Naturally, nothing good will happen to them, and they will arrive safely at their destination. All right, no. Soon they are persecuted by a guy who has serious mental problems, and that's why he's 90 minutes of boredom. I hope I will never see any of these actors in any movie. Their shrill, shouting voices made me headache, and the script was so badly written that it contained many repetitive phrases and nonsensical hysterical shouts. Overall, it's one of the worst cheaper horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
