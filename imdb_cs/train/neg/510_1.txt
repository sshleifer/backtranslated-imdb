This is surely one of the worst movies ever recorded and released by a large Hollywood studio. The story is just stupid. The dialog is written in a cliche; you can complete a series of sentences in this script. The game is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is stupid and totally unwise. One can only regret the reviewer who saw 23-year-old Yvonne dance as sexual; it's just a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the movie is particularly ridiculous. If you're on bad movies and you like to wet some Hollywood turkeys, it's for you. I bought a color version on VHS, which made the film worse. Yvonne is a heavy makeup when colorful, it looks like a clown all the time. And that's the best part of this movie. What a way to start a career.
