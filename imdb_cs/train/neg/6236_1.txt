This film was most out of bounds and liberally fed the movie I've ever seen in my life. (Except Farenheit 9/11). All information was supported by the opinion of FIVE scientists, while 80% of the Press Association strongly criticized the science promoted as Gore. Global warming is mass hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was either incorrectly quoted or it was wrong. This film has been researched again and again, and it has been shown that his lies are just lies. And to think that they show it in school, it proves that the media created our brains to believe this waste!
