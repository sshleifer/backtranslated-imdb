I give this film ONE, because it's really a horrible movie. The soundtracks of the DVD are so bad that it hurts me. But the vision, no matter how disparate, shows Italian society something really enchanting. I will not go into the details of what was really so shocking, but the various incidents are totally abnormal. So for the value of the kink, I'll give it one.Otherwise, video, photography, adult actors / actresses are just a nonstandard, practical jock for people who love foreign movies. Robert, the main character, has a whole spectrum of emotions but exaggerated until is unbelievable. However, the children in the film are mostly at the age of 3/4 years and are real and the film provides a view of Italian life.
