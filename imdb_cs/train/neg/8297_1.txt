Ugh! Where to start ... Campbell Scott will start to become a real turning point after a moment (just a brief moment), as internalizing his anxiety, curiosity and anger. It just does not care! These characters, as presented by the writer and the director, are completely inaccessible and the key is in it. They did not do anything to worry about if they were adulterers and whether or not they are still in love with each other. When Scott says quietly to his wife, "I could kill you," before their three daughters came to dinner when the shock of her selfish poverty came, I almost wished it had - and then did the same thing before he was pulled from the looney binocular, Denis Leary appeared. Total waste of time and perhaps - only possible - resources.
