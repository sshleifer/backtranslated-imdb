"Laughter is a state of mind," says the label and hesitating to Barry Levinson. What could you think about making a "toy"? When he watched the rush he saw a successful, fun fantasy? If so, then he works on a different plane than I do. This is an unbearable picture, in which 90% of the design is produced (and even color drawings are disappointing). Robin Williams and (in particular) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brothers and sisters of the toy mogul who are omitted as factory heirs when their dad dies. There is nothing strange funny (satirical or slapstick-wise) on the screen here. It's equally attractive, ugly, and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS from ****
