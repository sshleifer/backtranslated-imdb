That's a lot of .. so frustrating to watch .. I waited until the damn movie ended and finally I got some answers !! .. and what I had in the end, was nothing but HUUUGE neon-sign question mark over my head !!!!! I've never seen such bad acting and such a senseless movie for a long time ... and what worries me is how did anyone (actor) read the script of such a bull! # @ Movie and say: OK, I'm in Let's Let It Movie! That's awful !!! THIS FILM SUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS !!!!!! I can not believe I spent an hour and a half on this one!
