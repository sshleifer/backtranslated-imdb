This movie . . . I do not know. Why will they have such an indelible nature as Pippi Longstocking and take away exceptionally carefree Tami Erin, I will never know. Why they will spend money on artistic trends and some non-all-to-bad special effects, then do not bother to adjust properly, I will never know. Why are sets and costumes sometimes in the season, and sometimes bizarrely, why not order such bad songs, why the script does not make any sense at all (even at the silly, child-level film level). . . . what did they think? Nothing in this movie is the way it should be. Each part is nicknamed (and always wrong), each sound effect is slightly wrong, every editing is in the wrong place, every performance is wrong in some way. It will create a complete atmosphere despite all the problems, but NEVER capture the spell that is the creature of Astrid Lindgren.
