Seeing as the finals of the World Snooker Championship ended prematurely and disappointingly way with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeated Greame Dott on 18 shots on 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their schedule so he decided to broadcast A WALK on the moon movie I had absolutely no knowledge I missed a couple seconds of titles so he had no idea that Viggo Mortensen was playing in it and thought maybe it could be a cheap TVM, surely opening with mawkish Pearl and Marty with their kids into the summer camp have such a feeling that television feels clear illuminated cinematographs seem to indicate that it was a movie film and it was not until Viggo Mortensen's appearance as a hippie boy Walker that I realized it was a cinematic release but someone in Mortensen's character should not play in TVM, it's like a legend like Robert DeNiro, who appears in a direct movie. Wait a second, was not Bob ...? Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are unconvincing on the screen and agree. I can understand why Pearl would attract exciting hippie boys, but they have no idea why Walker would be attracted to ordinary Pearl's wife. The 1960s were my time, but of course, if you have a choice between hippy babies and bored women in the house, it's not a choice at all. I think a lot of people have LSD in those days, so I think it explains it <br /> <br /> I feel that the main problem RIGHT IN THE MONTH is coming close to the fact that it's a romantic drama in the heart like you waited in TVM ) with several different ways of coming down the age categories, so why does it belong to a quite explicit sexual scene? The glasses are hiding with the rest of the film, and it is possible that menopausal women who were in 1969 have discovered something. I say this perhaps because the film also seems to be focusing on the teeenage market with the advent of age scenes, and these teenagers will probably bore the historical and social connections of man walking on the Moon and Woodstock. In other words, A WALK ON THE MOON is trying to attract many types of viewers, but probably none of them
