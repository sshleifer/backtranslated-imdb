I barely managed to make an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialog was coiled and left-right. The game was tragic. Eion Bailey, in spite of his best efforts to be dramatic, remains mostly insignificant. His eyebrows are evidence of recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani would just as easily play in a restless girl in a silent movie. Characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotyped tooth in a sketch of a mostly random, meandering conspiracy. Special effects of cheese can be justified with regard to the budget of the television miniseries. But he tries to create tension and surprise by scattering cinematography. I feel the end was funny and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare my overall quality to another thing, I would put this episode "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" on the same level as NBC Hercules.
