Only sheets and newspaper campaigns suggested (as often as they did) a much more eccentric and violent piece than they appeared on the screens. Claude Brook is actually the americanization of Claudia Brook, who for years worked in movies. This is hard to find; I would like to see it again to compare it with other international horrors of the day, but I do not remember how it was particularly impressive. It's likely that it was a choppy version that came to American theaters and videos. But oh, this sheet ... still the jewel of my later horror collection.
