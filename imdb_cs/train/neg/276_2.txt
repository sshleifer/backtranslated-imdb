Characters are cliche and predictable, they are either snowy white or totally evil. The game is too cramped to be bad in a fun, overwhelming direction. It's a double disappointment if you're a fan of Bette Davis because her character is not a typical Bette-Davis type; she just frowned a lot. <br /> <br /> Overall, neither my wife nor myself found the movie that would be interesting, moving or enjoyable at all.
