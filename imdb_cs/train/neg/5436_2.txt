My friend gave me this movie. My friend is now in the hospital because the team of doctors is trying to surgically remove the cover from his DVD ***. <br /> <br /> I'm excited about the prospects of another Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels brought a lot of fun and the previous adaptation scenario was great, but the boy, I was bad. First, people who have casting have to sleep while doing so. I imagine the castings were something like that. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I have fish." "You have full experiences, you have hired, you have some money." <br /> <br /> Before the script is. I read Chabon, who I hope he went blind before he could see this dong and has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not entirely sure why it was ashamed as it was, but it might have something to do with hearing the speech of a 90-year-old drunk duck hunter with a dysfunction of the right cranial lobe would be a treatment compared to Disposable models that culminated in kids from the 2nd degree of the massacre model. <br /> <br /> This is the current line from the movie; "If you tell me something you've never told anyone before, then this moment will be unique!" Unique? That makes? It is really? Of course not. Please give me Imodium. I will have the **** **** belt. <br /> <br /> Direction is ... well. I have nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just got word that his grandmother exploded or something. Stay tuned for comedy. No ad for the ad. <br /> <br /> This movie is so terrible that he let me collapse my head so hard that he brought me back to the Stone Age. I give her two stars because I do not want to be a guy who watched one star movie.
