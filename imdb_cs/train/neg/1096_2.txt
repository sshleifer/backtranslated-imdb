While some training scenes were realistic, too many of them depicted military instructors as former Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the screen were either anti-war, or written for the audience. <br /> <br /> I am a Vietnamese vet and even during this period military instructors who behave in Some of them would probably still serve in a military prison. And I really loved the scene where the "hero" and his friend (both private persons) sit in the captain's office, smoke cigarettes and talk and behave with the captain as if he were their friend. Such things have never happened in training or in a formal situation as well as a purpose for the scene. Finally, I asked myself, "What was this movie about?" as it seemed to be wandering all over the place without interest, except "I hate all authority". Thank God I got it from the library and did not pay her for rent.
