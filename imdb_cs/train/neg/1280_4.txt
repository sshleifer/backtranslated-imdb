When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical style. Like "The Harvey Girls". It is not. It is a pudding that is baked, slapped in the kitchen ceiling and sealed and piled together. No music, not a bit, but quite unlikely. It begins with Patriarch James Woods, who says the oldest of his three daughters, a little child who becomes Barbara Stanwyck that he must keep his surname and home. <br /> <br /> So we think it's going to be a historic story among generations. And it's for a short time. Then it will become the story of the cold heart of Stanwyck's fight against George Brent's lawyer. Why is he so dead against him? Well, why else? As we learn in the strange retrospective story told by Stanwyck, she once thought she could inherit some money (of course, for her sister, of course) by taking it. She hit someone she took to become a compatriot, who was actually a Brent lawyer. <br /> <br /> If someone did not think he had a child he had, about eight men at the time of the main conspiracy, it's - well, you know ... They had an accelerated marriage and they were together in a very short time, he was conceived. One of his sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young who plays Gig Young. The other nurse tries to take him away. Atd., Atd. It's a dizzying, uninterested mess - it worked well, but without shredding logic or credibility.
