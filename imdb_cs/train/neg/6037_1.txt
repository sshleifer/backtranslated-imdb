Moron and girlfriends perform a ritual to restore the dead to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life again. It is no surprise that they resurrected the dead soul that began to mow with the ax, and the following day some people at school tell the tale around the campfire. A boy with an ax appears and hacks idiots telling the story. The group calls the cops, the policeman sees the blood spreading across the country and thinks he is a mountain lion (!?) And soon there is a distorted murderer who may or may not be a ghost. Moronic, a small, filthy film that was filmed in bright daylight, but where several characters carry flashlights and talk as if it were in the middle of the night, and wanted to send a flare to attract attention. One person has one pistol and one bullet in one hand, but it does not bother to load it, and after finishing it, he has several opportunities to shoot a killer, but he does not bother, because it would eventually become too soon. Then he destroys the gun! Also, there are bad characters that show no emotion and do not seem to be the smallest affected when their friends are cut into pieces and miserable effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken, the car blown at the end was clearly a car model) and terrible dialogue and some really ugly nudity on a woman does not help. And finally he tries to get away with being disconnected by saying that it was the whole invention of the same college age that he told stories about the camps at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer actually appears in the last scene and packs them into pieces. Again. <br /> <br /> Mediocre is kind, good only for some unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
