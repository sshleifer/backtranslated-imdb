The vampire vampire is called Dr. Who - funny, does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally portrays who is pride and joy, a huge robot monkey that looks like a bad metal statue of Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's films, it could have had some merits before the American audience taught it and added new shots. The Rankin / Bass animation company had a hand in this mess. They should apply for superior children programs such as The Little Drummer Boy.
