I did not like this movie. I thought acting was not very good and the story was boring. 20 year old computer saved the day? I thought it was a bit far, even for the movie. I could not figure out why they just could not turn it off, why not do it. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, but after the original movie of the eighties, you expected much more than what was actually delivered. This movie could have been an old film in the 21st century, it was not. If it's what you want to watch, do not look at this movie! <br /> <br /> Even though the old computer did not appear to save the day, it would, in my opinion, be very shameful.
