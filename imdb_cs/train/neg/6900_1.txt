I just sat in the theater bored like hell, I wanted to leave half the movie. This is a simple matter for four boys. So they have to get the data to get to the wedding. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The thing that attracted me the most was the so-called Rough Jokes ... They were very unfortunate, clich√©s and thrown in your face to get into a boring movie. The acting was below average and I felt that this film just went on and nothing but a pile of unlucky jokes and a predictable conspiracy. Overall, it's one of the worst movies I've seen since 2006, unlucky, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank God, he called me a friend. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
