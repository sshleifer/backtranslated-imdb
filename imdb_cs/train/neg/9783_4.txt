Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly not really good. I myself am a paintball player, I played a lot of airballs, and I walked from the forest to the plane is quite a big change. The movie shows similar quality. First, a movie begins with this team, which apparently tries to shoot this "Phantom" guy or whatever, seems to be a professional team and wears jerseys and shoots mags, autocopers. One guy who is sporty. The movie is not too bad, but more as it is perceived to be very tame. A lot of kids who are good boys are wooden players who do not seem to have a lot of money and have dreams to get "better weapons". Another team constantly chooses and hurts them because they play forests and blah blah Phantom to help these wooden children train and train them, and all these crap, gets them to airballs and basically defeats all teams including "professionals". <br /> <br /> So what's really wrong with the movie? But the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie NEVER would be bad, but the budget is rather low and the film looks like it was an amateur. There are no big names in this movie, and the acting is very raw. The perception of paintball is also bad. They seem to mean that you're all going to speed up and all the other bullshit. In my opinion, it was just a poor film and does not give a real perception of what paintball is. To be honest real paintball, it's not all buddy, it's a lot of torture and bonus balls, not "respect" and playing according to the rules. Do not look at this movie and then expect to go to a field that screams "4 is 1!"
