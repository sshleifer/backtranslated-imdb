Surprisingly, the film has a certain redemption in this case as it moves towards the end. On the other hand, this film is really bad and chaotic, with a small budget, an offensive bad script, and all that is related to it. It is foolish that all the money around Christian Circles never seems to be getting enough money to make a decent film. I'm not religious, so I really did not have to worry, but shooting a movie does some as a good tool to reach new listeners for the churches and get people more interested and curious about reading the Bible, for example. In this respect, these films always seem to be an unnecessary opportunity. A low budget really hurts the movie and brings it to him. It makes the film ridiculous to watch with its effects and it just gives the entire movie B movie as a feel. But what hurts this movie is its writing. The thing that is happening in this movie is just an insult to the news and then I do not even hate or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is so unlikely, and the people in this movie make such unlikely things as offensive to their viewers. I also hated the film as a soap opera. It seemed to me that it was just hard to turn this film into the whole movie and to join some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things. I could not take care of that much less. Sometimes, however, it must be said that the film becomes stronger and stronger towards its end when its story focuses more on its essence. It still remains predictable, but it has prevented this film from being the complete wreck to watch, and it is far worse for those types of films than to watch it, even though I do not think this movie will win new souls . <br /> <br /> 4/10
