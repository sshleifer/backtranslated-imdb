... or maybe just that's bad. The conspiracy is a cheap rehasis of the first, which is strange, because it is supposed to be prequel, not a sequel. The whole movie seems like a left remake of the first, with scenes imitating the things that happened in the first one, just much more ridiculous and unlikely. Where he had the first big actor, they were actors and B-list rejection. The game is mostly bad. Half of the good lines in the film are taken directly from the first film, just like most of the main characters, including those who were not in the first film. I realize it was created by an episode of a TV series, but that's no excuse. They did not have to write (bad) recordings into the movie. Only one thing is marginal and these are erotic sequences. However, since these are not as good as you did at first, it does not even increase over rating 1. If you have a chance to see it for free and you are a straight guy, it is worth noting if you want something erotic that is not porn. If it is not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
