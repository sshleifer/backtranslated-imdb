I like the time period, I like the try, but I was looking at a movie that looks like I'm looking at it over a bottle of coke and giving me headaches. If I played computer games that were so blurry and blurry, I'd improve my computer. It could be that look that the director drove, but not that it hurts his eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I was filming someone with me, I was out of here. Although it was a series, not a movie, a group of brothers did it. They seemed to look like shots from the Second World War, with little, but it was a pleasure to watch. Films need real people, real sets and real places; Use CGI, if appropriate, not for the entire movie.
