Slaughter High is actually your emblematic 80th slasher movie. The prank lost his hand and left a marvelously burnt fellow. A few years later the murderous guy returns and begins killing people who have hurt him. Now the story can look interesting and entertaining, but what makes this terrible movie so different from other 80's slasher shots is that it has some humorous flaws and ongoing mistakes. The game is terrible, but it's not really as bad as you suspect. Though it does not help that every figure in the movie is so deep and inexorable. Head, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the easiest puzzler of them, and she is the one we seem to share our compassion and root. Not to mention that he is a pretty guy who is almost too wild and I think even stereotypical riders would be sadly saddened and just inconsistent with how nice he is, so when he gets in his eye, does anyone really care? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of unintentional laughing potential. Munro's lack of talent is quite obvious, giving it the same level as other horrific casts. However, the most entertaining is easy when the film mistakenly attempts to pose as Munro, who is in her mid-30s, as a teenager among the teenager cast. And then, when it comes to later life and Munro plays around his real age, the rest of the cast does not go as adult. It all goes well with the dark song, which is a cheerful pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and the voice shouts "I'll get you." With that being said, Slaughter High really is not a very good movie slasher, but it has a bad cheese value fun for it. Perhaps essential for fans of hardcore slasher, but do not expect dilemma, tension or credibility. Grapes!!!
