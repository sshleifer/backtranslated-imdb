That's the kind of movie that's so bad that you can not keep track of it because you still say it can not be so dirty to the end It just can not do it You know "worse than Jaws 4" - a little bad . I honestly think I've seen only one movie that's worse than that, and then we're talking about religious crap about dying in hell for lying or watching football. <br /> <br /> Gore? In fact, and a lot of that. Well done gore? It's not about it. <br /> <br /> Negotiation is out of the question and all lines are miserable clich√©s. The same goes for a genre that really consists of gender, blood and violence, as well as many other gore films. If you hope to have a mix between Ichi Killer and August Underground? look for it. You will not find it in Live Feed.
