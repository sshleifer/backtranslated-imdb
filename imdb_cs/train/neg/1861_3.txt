You know what kind of movie you get when the main serial killer is transferred to an electric chair (in what appears to be a baker truck) just to make the prison vehicle collide (and I do not do it) a genetic engineering tank. The anger that emerges will melt him and combine his DNA with the snow and create our protagonist, the killer of the snowman. My favorite part of the film, however, is a snowman over his shoulder, who was throwing a bad schmuck in which his hands looked suspiciously like a pair of white gloves.
