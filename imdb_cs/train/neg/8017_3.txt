I did not actually finish the movie. You can say that in this case I have no right to examine it, especially so negatively. But I do it just because I stopped it because I can not look anymore ... I got over half and I got there by promising that something good was just around the corner. This movie is so anxious, so insignificant that it actually offended me. I have not read many other reviews so I'm not sure if they are other gay adolescents, but I'm gay and I have gone through "similar" apparitions, day dreams, problems, etc. There may have been two moments when I actually felt that this film could go somewhere, where I felt it might have some sense of meaning or relativity, but these hopes were interrupted by the moment another set of clichés of narrative narratives appeared. I mean, just look at the quotations on IMDb. Unfortunately, you can not hear scratched playback, or echoes are lost if you just read the quotations because they are just too painful / ridiculous / stupid than they are missing. I gave the film three stars and all three of these stars belong to the movie cameraman who performed a fantastic job that tried to transform Archer's tired "concepts" into something attentive. Be aware that it was not the one who decided to include all the long shots of television footage ... another unnecessary cliché that had already been in movies like Korinin Gummo ... I think it is extremely fitting for this film to premiere at Sundance just because Archer had a connection at the festival through a volunteer work he did, by the way ...) because it seems Sundance is the only festive venue where clichés of heavy crazy moves are still considered "arthouse". No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just a house. Do not look.
