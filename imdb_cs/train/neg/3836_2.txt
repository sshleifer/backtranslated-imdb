As one of the few commentators who did not see the first film, I found it to be a very disappointed film. Yes, it has a funny clumsy type of humor, if you can carry (highly) a morally dubious assumption. However, it does not succeed in important areas. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and nonsensical fictitious line involving generous friend Gordon Sinclair, who may or may not be involved in a conspiracy that delivers dangerous electronics to Third World countries - perhaps on free computers ... or perhaps not. Indefinite, long and inconclusive. The lack of any essential end is so enraging, and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The movie feels half finished. Suspension of distrust is extremely difficult when witness to a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can be attracted to the incongruous nature of Gordon Sinclair, especially when it reflects her backups. Ridiculous. Later, in the film, it worsens when it reaches its romantic ambitions, and then throws it for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguity. <br /> <br /> Many movies leave me feeling cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
