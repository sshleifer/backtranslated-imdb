The big concept has gone wrong. Poor acting, even worse writing ... After watching the first two episodes, he wondered why he ever did it for season two. Characters are forgotten, writing is wrong, files are fine. The special effects are simply sad - in the same timeframe, much better has been achieved - where is the money for this? The first episode begins to be interesting, then goes down the hill quickly - the whole show is just stupid. Do not let me down, I'm a huge fan of Sci-Fi and a "geek" - but this show does not just cut. As I said at the beginning, I'm really surprised to have done it for the season two - much better was canceled after a single season (like Jake 2.0). This show was bad.
