If the only sex you ever had is with the farm animal, then the brand for this movie is probably still misleading. It's by far one of the most boring films I've had the pleasure of watching recently. I found a DVD that lies in my friend's house, and I made a sad mistake not to burn him. I can not say any details without destroying the movie because it's just about 5 movie details. Just try to imagine that someone is making a movie about things on c-span, just a fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate about c-span. I think somewhere in this plot is a plot, but I could not tell exactly what it was after I put my eyeball out and threw it on Richard Gere.
