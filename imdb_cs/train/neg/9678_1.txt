I'm sorry I said it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Though visually fascinating (for example, the use of color was absolutely amazing), it was quite boring and disturbing (see incest father / son). What's more, the music is totally absent, and if you think these great soundtracks Michael Nyman (who wrote soundtracks for most of Greenaway's films) then you can imagine what a difference he is doing. <br /> <br />
