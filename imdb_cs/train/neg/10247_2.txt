This is one of the most demanding movies I've ever seen, it's terrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he is barely in it, the only good part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "The end of the world" is really a bad movie, I stopped watching it so closely that it was so bad, just because of hard b-movie fans who have the brain to vomit it.
