The former private protector, who turned to his eye, jumped his last small job and was immediately offered the opportunity to return to his previous profession. His job is to paralyze a mysterious French woman who has recently come to California ... and apparently wanted to earn her. Unsuccessful attempt to update the movie noir genre, without stinging or joking (or including plotting dynamics) in the scenario. Director and co-author of screenwriter Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the picture was edited without his engagement) does not imply that he should greatly respect the films of the 1940s of his "Chandler". his nostalgia is reasonably crumpled, but also hotly tuned and somewhat indifferent. Manipulation is curious, praiseworthy, and Warren Oates is well-occupied as the "70s" on the archetype of a "private bird," but the film has no fault. I can see Leslie Caron and Gloria Graham in the cast - though they have little to do, and Caron's hot and cold running nature is fine. Live cinematography by Alan Stensvold, a nice location, but it does not make any boil. * 1/2 from ****
