I remember this movie when I was 13 years old (it seems a lot of reviews say the same age AGE 13!) With a group of friends of the school. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in their first movie and dropped on typical commercials that told us it was a great comedy. We spent about 45 minutes and all agreed to abandon the theater. It was grotesque and without a taste, and far from the way Billy Crystal had to make us laugh, we were not laughing. Randomly, I came across this review and decided to register to tell the rest of the world what it means to be a nasty loss of the movie. Now that you rent it, you deserve what you get, you are sure!
