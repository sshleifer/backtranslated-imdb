As a fan of silent movies, I enjoyed the first time I saw this picture. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the film seems to be long, long, commercial for the Maxwell car. Perhaps if there was about half of the persecution scene, maybe I enjoyed the movie. But she cares very quickly. And when I realize that the reality of the movies is widespread, without worsening the audience's delight, what about the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're haunted by a car over a mountain range, a car that moves most of the time about one mile per hour, yet they can not get it?
