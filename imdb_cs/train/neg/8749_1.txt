A terrible movie, as everyone says. What laughed me was that Scott McNealy looked like an actor and awarded one of the murdered programmers in front of the SUN logo wall. McNealy is SUN Microsystem's CEO, who practically defines his hatred towards Microsoft. Helped in filing complaints against antitrust businesses against Microsoft. So, were they stupid enough to think that this bad movie would add fuel to this fire? There is no public record I see from the involvement of SUN, but clearly the creators of this movie know Scott McNealy. Interesting secrets.
