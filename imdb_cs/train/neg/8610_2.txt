Just as I love Rodney Dangerfield, it was a terrible movie. This conspiracy was a sort of holistic ripple of various films, but unfortunately they forgot to tear off all the good jokes. Besides, it was uncomfortable and boring, and it is kind. If you are looking for a good laugh, ask for a copy of your private parts.
