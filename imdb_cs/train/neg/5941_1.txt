As a fan of Notorious B.I.G. I'm looking forward to this movie. I'm unhappy to see that it's a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. A lot of the story follows the real son Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. like a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In short, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this is the real people they play. It was boring and did not provide any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans likewise did not know. I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress, played by Voletta Wallace. The film slugs and slugs thought that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend a lot of money. I have the misfortune to say that it happened. Nowhere near a good movie. I expected it so much, but unfortunately I did not get anything out of it. I think you should definitely omit it.
