This movie was ridiculously bad. My friend rented it from Netflix and he did me to watch him. There are so many gaffes and goofs that it is impossible even to bother to get to know the characters and the plot. For example, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Complete with a folding card table <br /> <br /> A very good story is a very bad film. But even if you look at technical shortcomings, you find horrible acting and casting. I was most blinded by playing a glamorous homosexual actor to play a real religious brother pious. His opening scene, sitting in his impeccable apartment, stroked his cat's cat, was cheerful. I applaud the writer / director / producer / editor / star / chef / cast dentist / composer did in this step) actually get a movie like this one distributed. If you have nothing to do better, it could be a fun group movie, or even a base for a drinking game, but do not lend it a powerful story about homophobia and homosexual marriage.
