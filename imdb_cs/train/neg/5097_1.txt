Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. It starts to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes until the last episode. At the end I still have not understood what all the extraterrestrial attacks are (maybe I miss something, who knows?) And I realized I was sitting in 26 episodes consisting mainly of my own hatred, self-esteem and self-compassion. In fact, they spin between the aliens / robots battles and these dark, depressing blinking scenes where one or more characters can only say or scream "I hate me / you / it" 10-12 times in a row. /> <br /> I can not really see that Shinji or Asuka (two main characters) show growth or change. (I can not see that any of the other characters are learning or growing either.) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling did not change during the last changes. Shinji really has such helpless hopelessness that annoys people rather than charitable, and Asuka is such an enraging consciousness - everything I wanted a broken screen every time she appeared. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything and they say it veeeeeeeers often. I'm another big fan of anim√© and manga, and I've never loved so much before. I read that the creator / writer of the series wrote it when she suffered from depression, and I can believe it; it struck me to look at her. The goal of this series is? I sincerely ask. Is it designed to confuse and disturb the viewer? And if you suffer from depression, why do not you just write a book or biography about it, instead of mixing it with aliens and mosses? This alien war plot, if I did, has done absolutely nothing. Finally, because I'm really fascinated by how many people say they love this tangle of dead shots, I can not help but how many of them really feel good and how much they say they do because they've been told.
