I do not want to throw like this, but in this case I feel like I have to: American remake GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in theaters over the last 5 years. That's where I said. Now, when I got it out of my system, let me explain why. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, filmmakers take it further. Those who encounter a "curse" are actually consumed by its rage, and that's all you get. Do you want more? It is bad. Some critics and fans point out that the only purpose of GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot, horrible pictures and sounds can go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, who pulled George Sluizer and transformed his own original film (s), is humblely trying to build the atmosphere in the first hour? repeating the same scene over and over again and again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> carving into black <br /> <br /> Before the audience even gets a touch of conspiracy, this exactly the same scenario is decomposed 5 times in the first hour. For the first time it was a little scary. Every other use has become ridiculous as the movie continued. When the end of the movie was shot, my friend and I were ridiculously interested in whether the scene would end up in a "loud shout and black cut." We have never succeeded. The film has no plot but instead develops in a series of vignettes that leave the audience upset. I have no problem with non-linear stories when it's done right. The movie jumps from a period of time to a period of time without a rhyme or reason. I have not seen any movie since the beginning of the HIGHLANDER 2 theatrical release. And this story telling technique divides some of the secrets the movie might have. If you already know that the ghosts are afraid of two characters, how shocking is their body being in the attic? And why should we take care of it when the detective tries to test the mysterious disappearance, knowing what happened to everyone? Apparently the green second American version of RING made $ 15 million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but a calculated imitation masked as a real movie. The worst thing about GRUDGE is that it made $ 40 million its first weekend, and some people see it as "the worst film ever made". I wonder what happens to those who have furiously paid to see GRUDGE?
