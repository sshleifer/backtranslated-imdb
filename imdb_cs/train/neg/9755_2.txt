This 1974 Naschy trip is driven by Leon Klimovsky, and a brief look at the pictures and advertising covers can lead to the belief that this medieval story lies somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Sadly not. <br /> <br /> This is a strictly PG issue with advanced sequences of torture, nudity and a small margin at all. Naschy (whom I am a fan of) recalls Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de lacion". Unfortunately, it's more of a pantomime villain than anything else. One feels from this film that we have seen it (and all) before. Strictly therefore only for Borsch completest.
