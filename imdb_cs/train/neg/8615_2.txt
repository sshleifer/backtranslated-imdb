This movie was so bad, obsolete and stupid, that I had the rough times to watch it until the end. I saw Rodney's guy in Natural Born Killers, and I thought he was funny, but this movie was bullshit. The jokes were not fun, the actors were not entertaining, it was not even distant. Do not waste time on it! Only positive things about this were beautiful women :) and Molly Shannon, which I certainly tried the best, but the script was just terrible. That's why I called it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
