If you study Welles and want to see how far he's going down to Citizen Kane, this movie can do it. The inexpensive apology for the protagonist to become a machine gun to explain how he could fall into a half-burned scheme can not explain the absurd theatrical situation in the courtroom and the ridiculous plot that eventually arises. Do not get a high rating of this movie in db like me; All I think is that there are a lot of dirty old fans of Welles and Hayworth.
