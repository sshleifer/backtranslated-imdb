A full mark of the content of this movie, like Brit, I was not aware of segregation in the US Navy during the Second World War. A very brave attempt to bring this to the world. The film is pathetic, however, the direction does not exist, the playing is wooden and the script is just one clich√© after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat and started from the beginning to the end to boast in a very bad way to get it together. This could be a great movie, a story for many of us outside the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of this matter is the way it was assembled. It is unfortunate that a real story like this, which could change the attitudes of people, was wasted on a low budget, poorly controlled film. I just hope that sometime in the future, one of the main studies will have this topic and it will do justice.
