Come on, let's be real. The Royal Knights, Ordo Templi or Templar Knights, as they are commonly called, did not exist until the early 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides, if you wanted to have a real Templar, why should not you just use the Knights of Christ who still exist in Portugal. At least they should take the story into account. The only redeemable quality I found in this film was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to go through the medieval or Gothic periods. The game was bad, the story terrifying, the awful action and the props were all right.
