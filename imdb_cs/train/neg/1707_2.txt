and a budget of $ 30,000 and this movie still looks like it was made for $ 50. From the first picture you can see that he does not like the continuity or plot of the films, he was happy to make a zombie movie. What the end result shows is a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It could be great if he had to take care of himself. The end result is an endless approach to badly made gore, and it will still play badly made metal. What happens when you combine great hopes, great dreams, decent budget, hard work and one idiot behind the camera.
