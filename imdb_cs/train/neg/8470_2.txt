I watch a lot of scary movies (or at least try to be) and it must be the worst, if not the second worst movie I've ever had to do myself. I never knew the depths of the massacre until I borrowed this piece of stuffed cheese covered with latex contraception. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but it's worse than I'd hoped for. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was impressed ... the first minute and half of the credits rolled and I still saw what pain looks first. Maybe there are some viewers who are looking forward to showing me the right direction, but then I know those audiences who understand if they will not remind me, especially when we had to turn off the video and it just was not done with our observations (we had to do one exception). <br /> <br /> If it was a remake, I would give it a chance if it had a maximum of 1% of the original. That is all.
