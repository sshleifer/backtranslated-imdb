I'm glad I leased the film for one reason: its shortcomings forced me to read Allende's book and get the whole story. Pros: The movie is beautiful, the period is shown well and consistently (to my best of my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn are doing good work. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: This is the worst actor's work I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I was wondering if something was wrong in my mouth. (And I hate the awful English way Transito says.) Winona Ryder does nothing credible except for the young and idealistic. Most other performances are fine, but so few things hang together in the character's curves and the development of relationships that I was frustrated and angry with before the end. <br /> <br /> I am very curious if this film is typical of Bill Augusta's work. Maybe I'd have to drop another couple of money to borrow Smilla's sense of snow.
