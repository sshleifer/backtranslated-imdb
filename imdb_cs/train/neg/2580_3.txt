and his clerk. just killed an American pie. The first three were totally hysterical, but this and others were terrible. I am referring to the story of two fellow brothers who fight each other for their houses, I think we are talking about a weak conspiracy, the first three dealing with growth, change and marriage, which are all good points for the development of human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, and I know it's hard to try to match Steven Stiffler, but not a cigar. I give this movie 3 because there are 2-3 funny bits in the movie. The best character in this film is, of course, Jim's father, I do not know why he continues in the developed films.
