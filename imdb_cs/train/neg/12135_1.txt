Though it lasted for 2 years, I still remember the complete waste, which consists of the entire plot of the film. Unfortunately, I came across this movie by my friends and I chose him when watching new releases in Blockbuster. We chose to choose the movie because it was the only one we did not all see and it sounded like it could be nice. Although I have seen the movie for some time, I still remember the lack of conspiracy (seriously, there is no real plot) and the total loss of time that was spent watching the film. If you are in a video rental and this movie captures your eye, go ahead and find a better movie. If you finally saw this movie, I understand your pain :)
