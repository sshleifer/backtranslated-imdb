Rough guys, sexy women, lots of oaths, and the most unconvincing monster that comes from the depths of the polluted lake. Do you think "Monster" would be fun ... but it really is not. It's star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book that makes it worthwhile to view at least once. In an interview with Fangoria in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock was driving most of the film, but Kenneth Hartford, who only shot the shots of his children, Andrea and Glenn (showing the figures of Andrea and Glenn, particularly inventive turn), got full credit. Considering how terrible the final result was, Strock was probably glad he was not credited! "Monster" has the look and feel of medium to late 1970s, which is why I like it so often. As a passion falls on the face with a flat, but as a reminder of another age and the disappeared film type is very effective. The only thing missing is the pursuit of cars.
