It was disgusting and painful. What waste from the cast! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. It's not a lie. Do not let it or rent. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was just too bad to be credible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was fine. Just fine. I was sorry (actor) if people remember this mess. Roberts was the same as ever. Charming and sweet, but without purpose. "Romance" with John was absolutely unbelievable.
