This movie has an interesting plot, but the acting is pretty bad and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is interesting, but because of bad writing and discarding, this potentially successful premise is plundered. Two of the four other people in the theater left about 45 minutes and the other two laughed at how bad the film was. I stuck to the end, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my cell phone to be tolerable in the last 30 minutes.
