I enjoyed it emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain any violence, sex, drugs or special effects and does not need them a little, all my attention keeps visuals, stories and scattered wisdom. <br /> <br /> However: 1] some foreign language accents have made the dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] is unnecessary excessive use of curse (especially F-word, which is the only reason why this film has been called R). [3] The film is balanced by humor and emotion, but most of the emotions that hold you all over the film, with the exception of the last resolution in the last minute, are unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-term dysfunctional response of some characters to the loss, living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] I'm not answering this film because of a 5-second background story that did not add any bit to the side character she was referring to, or the film - just turned me into a movie and stuck in my brain through the movie and then: mother of the main character of the German of origin when watching the old films of the Second World War "secretly roots for the Germans". There would be no "local color" nor art if the Nazis won the war. I do not know about Germans today, except for radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis won the Second World War.
