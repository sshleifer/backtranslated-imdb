This is one of those films that is more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from the point of view of entertainment. I make my assessment based on how much I enjoyed it or enjoyed the film, so I give it 4. If I rated it as an academic film, it would get 10. <br /> </ b> It is filmed in a very interesting way, as a pseudo-silent film with elements of sound effect and reality. It means that it brings inconsistent memory and fragmentation of the mind, and this is interesting in these respects. The film, however, has a lot of disgusting elements that I have not found so many fun things. They are mainly worrying. It also has very interesting pictures and some interesting concepts, but some characteristic relationships (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. Overall, this movie will either appeal to you or it will not. For me it was interesting from an academic point of view, but it was not good tracking and I would probably come back to it again. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for fun. 10/10 from the academic point of view.
