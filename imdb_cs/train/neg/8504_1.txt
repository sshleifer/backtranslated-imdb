Semana Santa is wrong. It's so bad in many ways I have no place to start. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose wife was shot dead, went from Madrid to Seville for her police. During the Holy Week (Semana Santa, you see? ... everyone starts to sleep ... it was bad in so many points, even from the beginning), the killer carries out his victims as bulls on the bull arena. He cooperates with male masterpiece Olivier Martinez and pretty Feodor Atkin. He soon finds out that he will be the next target of a murderer (who wears a red cloak). Why, but why? Why ... this is the question that was in the head in the whole movie. Why it turned out that A: Because I Love Mira Sorvino (even excuse her for seeing at a glance) <br /> <br /> Question: Why did we finish the release on Saturday in the first week? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-man got in that day. But also the fact that the movie was explosive with executive reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why was this movie made? A: Money, I think. But the boy Mira needed money. Then ... why ???????????? In the first place, European co-production is still something wrong. here you have French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then he wants to play the same game as American thrillers / slashers / whodunit / secrets / anything. Even VALENTINE, though unnecessary and ill-scripted and shot, was much better in tension and entertainment. Then, to get the story a bit, the scriptwriter wanted the story to add some political insight. Bad: In a flash shot in a similar mode of photography, it is surely the most interesting in the movie. It could hold it, it would not have to sit the whole movie. Rather, go straight to Guillermo del Tros "DEPIL'S BACKBONE" (El espinazo del diablo) for some clever experience. Then homophobia. Bullseye! The first victims are homosexual twins who have been stabbed to death by drug addicts at S & M. Martinez's olivier Olivier goes into a dating agency with a badly shaved transsexual overweight with a blonde platinum wig. Sorvino says the character is like a permanent castle. Do we need such things? Nah. Just unnecessary insulting remarks, just like ol'times. <br /> <br /> Then the tension. Yipee. No obvious motive. The first murders are simply illusions because they represent a glorious painting. But not. And the revelation of a murderer (of course, a terrible fascist) could have been done from the very beginning when he appeared at the end of the film, because it was time for the director to say, "Good time, time to end what the killer is and why he will kill." The director, that he is a director. Bad: no sense of tension, no sense of directing actors, no knowledge of tempo change. Giant, mega-hole. The scenes of the weekend are unnecessary (maybe a co-production rule says: ok, shoot in Seville, but show some credits of this beautiful and historic city with the Easter celebrations.) There is a mysterious movie for tourists! Everything wrong. Mira Sorvino throws herself to death: practically nothing happens, except that she is stabbed in her right hand. Everything she did best (Replacement Killers, Mighty Aphrodite ...) was like it never existed. Olivier Martinez ... hello, somebody here? When the producers learn that he is not an actor, but is he a mannequin without the ability to talk and feel? Feodor Atkine, motionless and transparent. We only pay great respect to Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses in the last century (and I hope for some other role in this present). It is the main attraction because it is the only one that gives life to its bad lines. I will not mention the other actors because they are just one-sided characters, uninteresting and shallow. <br /> <br /> Inconsistent direction, inconsistent actors, unlikely plot. Idiocentrum is incarnated. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
