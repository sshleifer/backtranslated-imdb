I always thought people were too cynical about Andy Hardy's old movies. Some of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not those who usually prefer to be nice, so good - two boots that are so rarely praised <br /> <br /> However, I can not even defend this film. You can still have a dated dialogue, but still laugh and cry over the story. Watch it, just shake your head, ask, "How stupid can you get?" This is stupid than anger if you know what I mean. It's so dirty that I can not understand too many people who really sit for an hour and a half. The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney), who is trying to get out of jam, because he does some story about the fact that some d√©butante from New York participated as if it were final. In ancient times, people were very socially aware. You hear the term "socio-climber" as if you knew rich or beautiful people were the greatest success you could make life. It is, of course, complete nonsense, and it seems much more today. <br /> <br /> However, it's like an innocent and pure story and a series (it was half a dozen Andy Hardy films), as you could find. Also, if you want to listen to Judy Garland singing then it's your ticket as she sings a couple of songs here and she's going down the road to Andy's heart. Oh, man, I almost came up, even writing about it!
