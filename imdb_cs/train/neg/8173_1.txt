One of the most boring slasher ever .. If you can even call it. I would not want to watch it even if a porn movie that is totally similar is over. The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. Did they make these movies for teens, and who really did when they did this sleep? My favorite part of this movie is cover art and that's the only reason I decided to look for this movie that was part of the Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack .. and after seeing other movies in this 50 pack, it is not anywhere else. So, if you're in the mood of a decent slush in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
