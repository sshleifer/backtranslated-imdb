European Holiday (aka National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of Vacation movies (the first and third highest film). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they get a weaker script with a very bad interview. This causes them to suffer suffering, jokes are not very funny at all. More specifically, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that "jokes" as they are, are simply pulled together in pavement fonts), rather than serving the central conspiracy the other 3 Recreational films have. Well, they can not win all of them. 4 of 10.
