This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I am studying French at college and I understand dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I have to say that it is really hard to feel sympathy with any of the characters shown in the movie. Only one professional actor is cast and I do not nominate any professional directors or writers. Although I rated it 1 in 10, it probably does not count such a bad rating. It is just an unnecessary effort to reduce the current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Maybe 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the movie is a real 100 minute crash or so long you never come back. The real shame is that I'm sure some college student is busting his matrix to make the movie twice as good and half the length. However, if you want to join a signpost that seems to be in the image around IMDb, you can also release "Lost in Translation" also 10.
