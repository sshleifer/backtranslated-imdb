It really should deserve an "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I have been watching this show for ages and the show jumped around the 7th shark. But this episode is evidence that the show jumped shark. It's writing is lazy, absurd, self-forgiving, and not even good rubbish like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, the mummy, the Count of Monte Cristo - all the "funny" movies that are not to be taken seriously. However, it's as ridiculous as in "It's the worst thing I've ever seen." And it's really the worst Stargate episode I've ever seen. It's totally terrifying, and it comes from someone with a star gate in her basement. I want to sell all of my star gate props in the most serious way.
