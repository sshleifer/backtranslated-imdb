This film was different because it did not show typical gay stereotypes that I used to see. But that does not alter the fact that there is absolutely no action. I'm sure there are many homosexuals who like to see on the canvas, because black gay figures are seldom seen, and when those characters are usually totally undeveloped. But how hard a writer could really write a story with the beginning, the environment, and the end. Or what is the story that was targeted. This film does not seem to make any sense, and although it is a low-budget movie, it still is not a justification for a lack of story or plot.
