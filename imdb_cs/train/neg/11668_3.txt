There are beautiful landscapes. Writers put the mouth of the cane into the mouth. With smaller actors this show would be stupid. "Art must raise humanity or it is BS." Not so because the art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side. The lead figure even says that those who do not drink hide the shadow side. He lived badly in the dark, suppressing his dark side by drinking and being one dimension that did not spread his horizons beyond the landscape. In his work, the respiratory organism was not the expression of pain. All artists, however, limited themselves to proving dozens of landscapes. Interviews between the characters were a classroom, small things always give the only character that the writer wanted. I tried it after reading all my first comments. I had to dig deep to see those with whom I agreed. I think great comments were from those who joined the movie. I was only moved once to the end. The child was too passive. The landscape was pretty and the music was ridiculous. Just my opinion, but it will not show it anywhere.
