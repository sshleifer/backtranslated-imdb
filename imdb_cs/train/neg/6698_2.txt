To say Funky Forest: The first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions. I can actually get into a good artistic film, even into surreal and twisted romp albums such as El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the loans are rolling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> This movie is badly done, the visuals in this movie are not inspirational, the dialogue is worse, the music numbers destroy this movie .. I laughed at GUITAR BROTHERS, but it was instantly destroyed by something completely futile and insignificant. I tried to be profound and meaningful, I suppose, but it was simply a difficult, disoriented nonsense. Students of a fresh movie without a camera can create something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar brothers and rising sketch routines get every 1 point, everything else is bad, pseudo-creative, hard to be as good as movies from other real-life directors such as Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that the people who have been doing the FFFC are doing this because they have no idea what they saw because it was nothing but gentle promises that were mixed together with stupidity and mixed together until you came to own shoes. <br /> This movie was an extreme disappointment coming from the top that was Survive Style 5+, a movie that really makes sense, combined with an excellent use of scenery, cinema, catchy dialogue, fun moments, good soundtrack, outstanding performance, fantastic stimulation and flow. FFFC represents the exact opposite in all directions, the boring scenery (20 minutes staring at the boring beach at night? A completely white stage? Alien balls floating in white space? Boring school corridors and then ... school corridors?), Stunning cinema, forgotten dialogue, nothing funny or humorous, to save the fact that you've lost your life unnecessarily for two hours, soundtrack ?, amateur performance, uneven, disjointed and often flat, zero flow of everything. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim that the FFFC is a great movie that it is so untraditional at every turn that it is its pure genius. It is simply a way to blink your own ego, as it seems, because "unpredictable" could be a good quality for the film if it were not associated with "boring", "inward" and "terrible". I personally talked to two people who admitted that the FFFC was awful when they left the theater, but the overwhelming rave by artistic elitism made them watch the film again and then come back to me with ... "Hey I liked it pretty much" . <br /> <br /> I'm going to put my foot down, this movie is a jump, I do not care if Roger Ebert says this movie is the best thing he ever saw, he lost his own virginity. "Emperor's New Cloak" I say ... this film does not affect other psychedelic / trippy films that have come from Japan over the past 10 years. Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even with a low budget) and no one can cope with the surviving 5+ style. Watch FFFC only if you are interested in making a tricky pile of anything you need to clean up.
