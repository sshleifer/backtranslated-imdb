I have not seen many low-budget films I have to admit, but it's the worst movie ever to have occurred, the main character the old man talked about had lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a year old to act better. The story had the worst conspiracy, and the Army guy gave what he considered an army, and then he just went over the top, just watching how laugh it was, and hoping it would lead to a real movie. I can not believe that it was under 2 night charter events in the barracks, instead, please, take it for free and get it from our point of view. I think there was one semi decent female actress besides a woman, I think the only thing OK with the budget was makeup, but they show every important scene of the movie at the beginning of the music bit. It's just terrible.
