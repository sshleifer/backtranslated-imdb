I recall this miniseries from the point of view of someone who first read the novel. And from this point of view, I can honestly say that even though it's nice, I see why it has not been re-broadcast recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious issues, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It is terribly wrong. The actors who played the young generation were 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 at the time) played Natalie Jastrow, who was supposed to be about 26. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at that time) played Byron Henry, who was supposed to be about 22. Other children Henry and Pamela Tudsbury also played actors are too old for characters to be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some players were totally horrible. Ali McGraw sometimes made this mini indivisible. I have seen more convincing performances in college games. <br /> <br /> 3) The mode was bad. In order to be fair to Ali McGraw, he would probably have a bad acting performance and the character of the character. The depiction of Hitler was exaggerated. His character came to look and behave more like a cartoonist than a charismatic, sometimes charming, but always devilish genius Herman Wouk painted him as a novel. Some of the other characters are so stereotypically (Berel Jastrow) that they do not get the depth of the character Wouk has created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very dated. Hokey music, demanding narrative (it sounded like a story in a junior high school history), and the whole mood for the miniature soap scene in a miniature form has occasionally provoked it. Also too often, Byron and Natalie are dressed and made to look as if they were in 1979 rather than in 1939. Someone who watches it without the benefit of reading a novel because it will look more like a late seventy / early 80's "too seriously" a primary-time soap drama, rather than a television version of what is definitely a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes badly done, but it's probably one case where a creative and inspired director can make a very stunning, unforgettable and critically acclaimed production. I never see it happening because the remake would have to be as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right. Due to the brief attention of most of the current American viewing public it will not fly.
