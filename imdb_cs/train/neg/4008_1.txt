As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse, I consider this series to be totally indecent. Vampire Bill does not see too well and looks much older than described in the book. I have found that they have done great colorful characters, they seem to be very common and vulgar. One of the things I loved in the books is that despite all the crap that Sookie is going through, she's always a lady, and yet it does not look like a TV series anyway. Not only that, but the prejudices shown in television series are not nearly as broad in books. I did not expect an exact copy of the books, but at least I expected them to be used for the series.
