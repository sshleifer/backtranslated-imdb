Complete Time Loss <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. Scenario and dialogues are misspelled, the direction is bland and playing borders with hamms. This film was clearly aimed at the crowd of Rang De Basanti, but it drops far beyond the mark because it has neither one of the elements that made the RDB merged with the audience_great script, the amazing an actor, a good direction and a strong social message that has never been preached but shown. Compared to the close masterpiece, Halla Bol is taking a step back by resorting to such scenes as the hero who has suffered a leak on the Persian rug and the hero is a mentor who looks into the balls in the truck! All this could have been acceptable in the 1980s, when the quality of the film fell, and bad films such as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but the filmmaking became, should be more gradual and later. <br /> <Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he does, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He is admitted to exercise without care when it comes to the intelligence of the audience when he understands what he is trying to say. Perhaps he should just focus on entertainment and leave social reports to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. While you disagree with everyone I say, you agree that during the entire screening you will be that Rang De Basanti is much better and Mr. Santoshi should leave an industrial attack on Om Shanti Om. Industrial whipping? That is right! Santoshi depicted the industry as a place where he nests, whips and casts a couch that the hero happily accompanies with the old inquisitive name of Sania. There are some people who will think these parts show the real face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * Apart from ****.
