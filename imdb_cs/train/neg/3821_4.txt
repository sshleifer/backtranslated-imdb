What's the most difficult movie ever? Gynecological Nightmare "Screaming and Beating"? Fassbinder acid psychodrama? Uncompromising Black Comedy "The Last House on the Left? I'm sure the part of the movie that loves the public that connects masts to a good ship by Buster Keaton is just one answer - each of its soundtracks. <br /> <br /> I do not know what in this film he destroyed his soul - the creation of a complicated and extensive physical art of Keaton on a humorous slapstick, the painful hesitation of the filmmaker with dialogue - not that he does not have a beautiful, funny voice, or that he can not make a humorous dialogue, just that the studio probably did not get it so he seems to try to recall his lines before he delivers, which only causes - Keaton, not his character, to look stupid, because it's humiliation when we see Keaton getting into the dirty sexual Fear when he gave us the richest stories of romantic frustration in the movie? <br /> <br /> No, I know what is most worrying - having to watch Buster Keaton, the biggest his comedian in the cinema, sitting aside to watch Jimmy Durante, who made his schtick. It is such a horror as Dante Dantes has composed of Infernos. MGM seems to have a curious opinion that the best way to adapt Keaton's sound is to change his brother Marx, supplemented by verbal pedantry, complicated, boring "clowning," shambolic ghosts, theater environment, triumph in chaos, and Thelma Todd. Keaton was not such a comic, and where Grouch's dirty language and merry opportunism could only make this conspiracy, Buster's socially awkward professor can not be too studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed, an experiment like Lang in 'M' or Rene Clair should be allowed; he would never try to keep the tide as Chaplin. When the film, such as "The General", which deals with trains, is even more apparent. <br /> <br /> And the thing is that the film is not so bad in patches in the middle of the flat direction - it's great shooting when the camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at the station; and if the layout is somewhat original, it is at least livelier than what it used to be. The way Keaton slows the storyline that needs all the zip that he can get is something almost adorable. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie about loneliness, an emotionally paralyzing order, a disturbing influence of education, etc., trying to get out. The best way to realize this film is to watch not the narrative of prof. TZ Post, but the furious genius of Buster Keaton, imprisoned in an average jail, confused by the new technology, ridiculed by the malevolent fate (in this case the studio) of preserving Stoic grace. He looked at it by becoming a masterpiece.
