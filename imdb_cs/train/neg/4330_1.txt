Last night I decided to watch my predecessor or call Prequel on Carlit's Road - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" which went straight to the DVD ... no wonder ..... it all. and I think totally S% & KS !!! that it's going to be a clear band of time writing about him ... I do not understand how De Palma has agreed to produce this sh # t-fest movie .... except that Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigant .... reminded me how De Niro got Brando's shoe to portray young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the De Niro difference was amazing and he even won the Oscar for it! Jay Hernandez is really lucky to try to be young Pacino ... too bad for him I do not think he'll be playing in the movie anyway and by the way, when I was watching this movie, I was sitting down and watching the original way for Carlitos to get the bad taste from the mouth.
