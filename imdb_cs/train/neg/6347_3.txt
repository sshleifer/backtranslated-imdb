I will probably always see Woody Alleb's film because one never knows when he can really go back to his past. Only one or two great moments or lines could be useful. but sadly this movie just does not make any score. Let's say it really makes me sad and even a bit guilty. I'm sure my reaction is similar to a lot of other Woody fans, but what can she say? Probably the time to concentrate on his Clarinett, which in my opinion is rather good. Let's say it all, I'm still going to probably go to a new movie that Woody can do in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect WOODY!
