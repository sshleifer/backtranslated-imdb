Cuba and Angie watch the movie from the news camera and see ... a trace. They are largely going to protect the film, believing that they are the only people who have a copy of this very public film. Cuba speaks with a presidential employee. The PSM commented that there was no conspiracy. Cuba says it is more than one person. The PSM then argues that the plot includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. God, I wonder it's PSM. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Archer, the first lady, is a horrific artist. Cuba can not take a picture, and she says, "You're too close ... look back ... look from another perspective, look from my perspective." Can someone miss me?
