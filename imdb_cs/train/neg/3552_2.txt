Finally, I saw THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something special to see it well and it certainly was not worth waiting for it all this time to see it. INCUBUS is a strictly horror film: an invisible killer / monster rapes and kills women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film looks like this: the movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; the continuation of the blah blah; yet another killing (surprising, what?); bla bla bla, etc ... <br /> <br /> The film is completely predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red herring used throughout the film did not convince five years. And I came to the secret identity of ink when I saw the character, so when there was a "shocking" surprise, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that after a while I saw the movie. It's so stupid! The film is the number that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few extraordinary moments in this terrible movie. It's an exceptional scene, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so fun and unnecessary: ​​the big screen movie shows a rock moment like a guy in red leather trousers who apparently got his fake long hair. it was adjusted by scenes of a girl who was attacked in a cinema toilet at the Inquisition. The best I could say about this movie is the cinematography I really like. But besides, there's almost nothing to mention about INCUBUS, except that it's inadvertently cheerful.
