I saw this movie last month on a free preview and I went out. It was quite terrible. In the process of trying too hard, they acted and made a terrible movie. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors had made a decent choice in the past so this could not be so far from the brand - but I was wrong. I was hoping they would do a survey at the end of the film so I could tell them she would not get rid of this movie. I was attracted to the free aspect of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and I'm usually very entertaining. She tried to be innovative and creative with shots, ideas and shooting, but because she had put together so many ideas at a time, she failed. I'm not usually picky about movies and I do not feel the need to show my opinions about movies, but I have to warn everyone not to look at it. I registered to IMDb just to tell you all
