Capt. Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) are reportedly the hot subject of this death journey; luxury 747 airplane decorated to look like a nightclub-slash-hotel? is even an invisible pianist who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is a hysterical b! $ 3 and who will do anything to get attention from the henpecked husband Martin (Christopher Lee), and later, the rest of the people on board. Memorable Moments: Boeing 747 makes a belly flop in the Atlantic ocean, Karen gets his burnt candles when it goes too far, and furniture (and screaming people) who become "ball bearings" in a diving "pinball machine". <br /> <br /> Action and rescue sequences are fairly phenomenal, but there is not much between them. Hitchcock was supposed to drive this sequel, but I forgot why not? He would do miracles for the original 1970s, on which this sequel is partly inspired ('77 was also inspired by 'Phoenix Flight'). Cotten and de Havilland have been joining "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte" (apparently not playing hard here, just gathering lovers from autumn years). And she is not an actress who plays Emily's companion who played a fornicated-death-service on "What Happened to Baby Jane?" TV actors include a girlfriend from "Mayberry RFD" (her character daughter won a drawing competition, or something so naughty), "Buck Rogers" Gil Gerard and "Dynasty" Pamela Bellwood. <br /> <br />
