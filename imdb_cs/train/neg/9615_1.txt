This adaptation does not seem to be the case. Not only did he leave the conspiracy, he created his own! The things he decided to leave were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy to have decided to omit some of the most important parts of the novel. This thing was hazy, inconsistent and upset. I do not want to say anything about what's going on, but I can not act! Dickens is of course difficult, but it's pathetic! Micawber was no more than Kramer in the mid-nineteenth century, and the less he called Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, check out the amazing BBC editing in 1999. As for the screenwriter, I think he read Cliff's notes!
