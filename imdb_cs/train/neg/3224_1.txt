When I was a child, I remember watching it while visiting a friend of our "Uncle" Phil. We are back! Dinosaur's story is a stupid cartoon movie about a dinosaur called Rex (expressed by gorgeous John Goodman). He tells a small dinosaur boy the story of how the dinosaurs returned to Earth to live. She explains that she is part of a thing that brought her back with her friends. The doctor / professor of the villain of this movie thinks he could be responsible for being back, but I do not care about him. Children might like it, but it's too deep to be personally. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing to do. Poor!
