There is no one around ... this movie is terrible. I've seen old movies by Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu, I know my characters and it's serial, but it's still God. However, Peter Sellers's genius still shines with his portrait of Nayland Smith, with echoes of mourning, tragedy, and wind power over the stoic facade; it's a performance that I can cope with the depiction of Van Helsing, which appeared at Peter Cushing, but I made a tenth of the cumulative display of all Cushing's "Dracula" films. If the film was made in more sero-comedic hairs like BUBBA HO-TEP via the AVENGERS TV show of 1960, it could be something special. If you are Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, it's something you have to see, but it's proof for someone else.
