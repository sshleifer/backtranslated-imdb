I'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's a great way to go. Acting with enthusiasm chews the landscape and parcels have holes that you can drive through a truck. That's not what I'm really saying. It's so serious that he wants to be "relevant," that it only shows how to cut off Rob's reality and his staff. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found out that this is the best snooze-fest and, in the worst case, more than a bit unpleasant. Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the above-average style of the show.
