I gave this film 1. I do not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of Italian film, made such a movie so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the film are irrelevant, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. The only thing I can save in this movie is Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope Scola will radically change the themes and style in the next film.
