What is happening with ITV Drama. First of all, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst television track I have seen for years, and now "Perfect Parents" is completely broken from start to finish. Who is responsible for putting into service should get the P45 special delivery there. In most dramatic / thrillers, it is necessary to suspend certain levels of belief to develop a land line, but "Perfect Parents" took it to a new level, I broke so much conviction, until the end of that nonsense I felt I was forced to bring to The cost of "Magic mushrooms" on a truck, it was like scriptwriters decided to try and create "Drama by Numbers" involving some serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophily The only problem was, as the big Eric Morecambe once said playing piano: "I play all the right Notes, not necessarily in the right order". For more scripting boys, I suggest trying to read scripts for scripts rather than Script Writing For Dummies. <br /> <br /> Due to the absurd script and the utter lack of tension in the direction, the concert was a suitably low key, not the guilt of the actors, because the cast was top-notch. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this shy drama should instruct their agents the next time the postman tries to deliver a scenario from the dramatic ITV division, make sure the mailbox is tightly closed!
