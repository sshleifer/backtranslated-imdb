It's amazing that this film is after all in one of my lists. It's by far the number one worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only have I been sometimes boring before (fortunately not more than 1.5 hours), before adolescent humorous attempts that the function is not even close to getting, but one of the corners of my mouth slightly inclined. After the first very unpleasant part you tend to hope that the other parts will be a little better. Hope you're hopping from there just downhill. The film has no story to tell about anything and repeated this story three times. One can only hope that by some miracle all the remaining copies of this movie will be lost forever and Trent Harris will never leave the camera again ...
