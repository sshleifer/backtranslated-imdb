Remake H.B. Halicki's classic seventy movie is just horrible. Together with the Dropping Point, Gone in 60 Seconds is a major autofilm. Remake takes the original and stands on his head. While Halicki gave us 75% of the car and 25% support for drama, GISS 2000 receives 25% of the auto transmission and 75% of the drama. A horse like a super man, rescuing his brother, kissing a girl. MTV editing, breasts and ass. Save money, borrow the original. At least Halicki does not live to see his child (he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the movie "74").
