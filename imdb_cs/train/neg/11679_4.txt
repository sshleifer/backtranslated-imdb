First of all, this movie is not a "thriller". Nor is it "gripping, tense". It could have been based on the scenario, but the slow pace of the course is difficult to get into. The fence itself is very interesting and sophisticated. Unfortunately, we have the feeling of being brilliant after the picture is over. This leaves us with more than two-hour long sequences of music playing through some scenes that are not interested in the viewer, and scenes with a "clever vixen" that squeeze some clearer intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish it was the fast thriller that promised the box. It would be a great movie. Instead, Spike Lee stepped forward.
