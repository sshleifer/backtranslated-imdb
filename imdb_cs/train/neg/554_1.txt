This movie is terrible. The script is bad, the script is average, and even sex scenes are worthless. The excitement and intrigues of the original film are totally absent. This film was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochrome style (a la "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey is an adorable character showing one facial expression throughout the movie. The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; those couple that exist are simply anti-limitative. The only culmination is the performance of Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continuing this sequel, but it is not enough to replace other shortcomings. The only circumstance for which "Basic Instinct 3" should be, would be if Michael Douglas agreed to become a member.
