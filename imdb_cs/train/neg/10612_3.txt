What a great movie premise: Place it around a filmmaker with a writer who decides to take tango lessons. And what a better idea plays the lead role of a filmmaker interested in tango. God, I wish I had the talent for a genius. Yes, I think I'm sarcastic. I am surprised that this type of zero potential for creating money is being created. Come on, if you're not a frantic tango fan (I admit there are judging by comments) or a dead member of the Sally Potter Fan Club (?), Nothing is in this movie that takes you to the cinema to see it. Even if you are in tango, most of the film is taken over by insignificant scenes such as a renovated house or a wheelchair man walking along the road. Soon, REVIEW LESSON appears, where the screenwriter did not come in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but very fun reviews of the movies he saw. When Theo Robertson got into the latest Hollywood blockbusters, he cried in shock when he took another rejecting letter from the movie company, feeling lust when he bought and cleaned the soap over his well-toned body. READ LESSON soon in the cinema near you, if anyone is stupid to fund PS Sally Potter's film is not related to Harry Potter
