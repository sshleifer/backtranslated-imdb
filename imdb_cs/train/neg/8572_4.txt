A thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles for family honor. David Morse is responsible, straightforward cop and "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, a "bad" boy, is a former soldier and ex-convicted. As an actor (especially in his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performance according to the method. As the first author and director for this artistic, blunt drama, he works through the same methodical scenario and characters, slowing the step to crawl (seemingly to capture all nuances and inflections). This approach could be fascinating if three-dimensional figures were taken care of, but the photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as siblings. Worse yet, we expect more of the prominently featured veterans of Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who barely get a chance to go through something interesting. The image is blurred with turgid sequences, spiraling narratives and confusing editing (always inclined to show artistic excesses). Penny tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but they are mostly irritations. * 1/2 from ****
