There are films like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have a spell on them, there are some like "Waterworld" that have the same unexplainable drawing as a traffic accident, and there are some like "Desperate Living" that you hate to admit you love . Cowgirls do not have any of these purchases. The cast cast has enough talent to be able to track almost any conspiracy, and from what I have been told, the book is pleasing. So how could this movie be so unbearably bad? First, it seems that the director has assembled the cast of names with no other tie than what he brings in those 20 years. Then tell them to make their best imitation of Kevin Costner. Open the book randomly and start taking photos of what's happening on the page to make sure that America's wide expanse will not be of any interest. Finally, do the editing work for your brother-in-law, because it was just a wrapped meat plant. He has twenty years of cutting experience. The film now defines the basement for me. It's so bad, it's not good or bad.
