Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actress, such as Demi Moore, get into such shit? The "first blood" could be rated as a bull, but this type of nonsense is just a Rambo with a breast, a point. Of course, if you are interested in crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be a part of NAVY Seals), which is the deepest clich√© I think, you say "GI Jane" is a great movie. Only the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this film tolerable, but damn, I can not think Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not the last, unnecessary, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve credit to bring this film to women with the same rights, it's just a helpless propaganda for the US Army, and it's more attractive to Moore. Amazing film.
