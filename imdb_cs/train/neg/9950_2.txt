If the original casting idea was preserved (Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie could work. Sadly, racism (literally) had to come to an end. Predominantly black manufacturing staff could not allow the antagonist to be black, and thus replaced the role of Rutgers and Ice-T. It was just the beginning of the descending spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's access to the "overhead" intelligence sites only verified that this is an additional role in adopting later actions. Master shot, close up, close up. Gaddy, "Who's the Line Is That," even uses more creative camera work. Eric's transcript "Safer Games" is at least an attempt to modernize the classic story, but it does not give us any reason why the characters are doing it. We are never given other reasons than "no one will miss these people," why the leader (transcribed as Rutger) does these things. In addition to John McGinley's glamorous performance and great work from Charles Dutton, you do not have to bother with this. One small piece of trivia, during a shooting that injured F. Murraya Abraham, had a real alcohol-crash accident, resulting in the death of a drunken young driver who caused an accident.
