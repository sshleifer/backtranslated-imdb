I went to school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard about this movie, actually I do not know if it was in the theater at all. I do not remember a name. I saw it, it's like one of those who attend school specialties. The game is fine, not great. The conspiracy was a bit weak and the lines were pretty cruel. So the only comment I can give to this movie is "Eh" I borrowed a movie from Jeremy, if I had a place to borrow the movie, I would walk around and after watching him I would not recommend it to anyone of the past Middle Ages schools. I also noticed that many times when urban children are depicted, the slang is overused or just obsolete. Many times I think what makes their characters incredible.
