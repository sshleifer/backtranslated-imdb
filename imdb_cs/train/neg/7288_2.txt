NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. However, it is not good. The scenes were driven out of the way, way, way, way too long. Sexual scenes were useless and often too long. The film was shot in 2 hours and 10 minutes, which would be exceptional but unfortunately it was so long that I can only give 2 out of 10. It's below average. There are other problems in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays the entire pedigree. The boy who played his grandfather does not look the same as he, but his grandfather, father and son (who gives us a constant unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic person with bull heads. Nobody seems to notice that each of these children looks like the clone of the last one, even though they appear on them. This is tiny, but if the movie was not in 3 weeks, it would not be so unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany was long after whispering about the rounded and broadcast Jews is ridiculous. Any word would come to them and the idea of ​​trying to escape would probably have been discussed. His uncle in France would definitely send a warning to try to get them to leave. 3) Love stories in this movie are absolutely bad. You spend it forever and tell us this thing, and the development of relationships between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... married. Then have children. Then we draw things for six centuries and forget to develop relationships. Again, it would not have lost so much in a two-hour film, but with time spent nothing was given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The end was bad. I do not want to mess with someone, but you will not like it either ... unless you're sadistic. The director / writer should be tortured with having to watch this blown waste for a week, I mean an endless loop, oops, they are the same. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did something for this movie, I think I think Istvan Szabo must model his directorial career after his film. A long-shot film that completely destroys some substance in the movie. Short description "The Horse Whisperer" and Sunshine. Sunshine, the perfect title. If you start watching when the sun shines, it will probably be good in the dark when you leave.
