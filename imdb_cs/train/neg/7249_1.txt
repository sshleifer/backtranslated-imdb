This film competes with "Plan 9" as one of the deepest films ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman & 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink performed all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were western "stuntmen". So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example from the movie: In a movie, the sheriff must take a witness to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys find out and wait for them. But what happens? Good guys go and shoot rings and attack the tree near them. When the camera shows us all bad, they all just sit on the diary and chat. What's wrong with this image! <br /> <br /> I could continue. Perhaps this movie was perceived as a comedy. If so, it did not do well.
