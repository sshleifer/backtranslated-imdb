This is an incredible story. It's about an hour into the movie than we have a great idea of ​​what it's supposed to be; characters often mumble silently; Activities often have no relationship to each other; no one seems to be concerned about who really murdered the girl; a few scary children go swimming in waters that seem to be terrible, but nothing happens; an Irish person gets into the face of one of his friends for no obvious reason ... he will continue as boring as the film itself. The only half-fun element is landscape photography; but someone could show the camera on the Australian inland and get unforgettable shots. Overall - sorry, discontinuous, demanding - and totally unpleasant that he has lost so much time to the viewer.
