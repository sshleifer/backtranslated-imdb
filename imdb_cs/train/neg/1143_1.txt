Even more than 20 years later, Ninja Mission is the worst film I've ever managed to sit on. Scandinavian ninja silently enters the scene, burns their noisy submultiples with wild abandonment, and then quits silently. Wow, how do we find silent invisible murderers? Just watch envelopes and smoke! A painfully bad dialogue (or was it brilliant and simply badly translated?), Not Asian in sight in the cast, and an incredible 3 Asians among the stunt crew. This conspiracy is ridiculous, it does not really exist - then again, the ninja can not act! Keep it - avoid watching at any price!
