I love Don Knotts, let me just say it forward! It's a huge talent and the best he does, which is a portrait of a nervous, mercilessly lost loser who has taken the position of authority. He is amazing in this role as Roy Fleming, a reluctant astronaut, but the film is pretty boring, really, though as a child, my brother and I like to watch this and his other films. It's still worth watching, but it really is the movie that kids enjoy. I would put her in the categories as 100% family friendly and something you could sit and watch with family-day kids. As with all Knott movies, there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can not just smile when Knotts gives one of his shattered open eyes, no matter how old and furious you are. From an adult perspective, one thing I think is great about this movie is how NASA captures in the 1960s - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how good and cold Leslie Neilsen was at that time. The only complaint about the story is Roy's loving interest, a rather shabby and insurmountable woman who can not give her the time of day until she gets a big shot - if you're like me, you'll hope he'll throw her off at the end. Beware - you will be whistling the theme melodies a few days after watching, it's catchy.
