What? Is Jamie Foxx considered fun? Do he really believe he's fun? Well, it's funny watching his confidence in being funny. Man has no identity ... I mean by immediately seeing who his idols Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence are, because he really imitates them in their films. The only problem is that it is doing wrong, unevenly and what comes out, there are some parts where it looks a bit like Denzel, with that macho-s ** t attitude and then suddenly switches to being Martin Lawrence, a funny and awkward-stupid comic. There is no personal relationship, that is, it does not contribute to the personality he is trying to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing in person. He really is Mr. Dull-boy in person. I really hoped that Hollywood and the black community in America would find someone who could better run into a superstar such as Don Cheadle, but maybe a pathetic Jamie better represents a generation that remixes the old one.
