Err ... this movie sucks. LOT. <br /> <br /> I read some of the other reviews. There seems to be a lot of people who think that everything written by Woody Allen or the stars is automatically good ... I watched a few of his films, in vain hope that I was missing something. No, they just suck. Badly written waste. The characters are very stereotypical (not to mention stupidity). The story is ... I think it's supposed to be mysterious. You're not sure. Mr. Allen has the character ... Woody Allen, on any other movie you've seen his. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Woody Allen, check out this movie. If you are less than 50 years old, do not worry. (If you are a Woody Allen fan and you are under 50 ... well, you are atypical. I do not know what to say.)
