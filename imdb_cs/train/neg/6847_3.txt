It was one movie I wanted to watch every time Promos was an eye and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise But the movie is not that good <br /> <br /> She has a lot of defects. Start is good and everything goes well until the murder, but the movie is falling when the romance track begins between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow <br /> <br /> Then shake the Govinda and Tabu who are in love leaves more doubts and shortcomings, and then how does Govinda turn into a rich criminal from a poor villager? The last flashback is also long and the whole clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu N Chandra disappointed Music is fine, Bahot Khoobsurat protrudes <br /> <br /> Govinda tries a negative role and does it very well even though it exaggerates too much sometimes Karisma is good but sometimes irritates her shouts Tabu is alright Nirmal Pandey still does not know that the difference between loud shouting and resting are the eye
