My father is a fan of Columba and I have never loved a show. I always have my shows for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he is watching it further. That's his right as an American. But my senses were tuned to the series when I discovered that Spielberg was driving the first episode. At that time I was grateful that my father bought this show that I really can not stand. I went through my DVD collection and jumped up when I came home for a college visit. My opinion on the series as a whole has not changed, but I got Spielberg's respect because I knew he started like most of the directors with a low grade. And it makes a small dribble until a big fish comes (get a hook, HA, HA as Spielberg did It's like Jesus before he became a man or that's at least what I think he'll feel, Columbo fan, than you probably would have liked it, though it contains little information about Peter Falk, because it's the beginning of the series and no one knew where to go, the crime perpetrator instead of Columbo's investigation, as would many other episodes.
