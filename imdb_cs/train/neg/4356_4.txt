Since I'm not a fan of blood and intestines, I find that bloody scenes are totally useless (that's written) and too real for what I like if you're a type of person who has rock spots on the Internet or movies say, go for that it begs the conviction of what sort of man dreams of this sick carcass yet. <br /> <br /> In addition, it had the potential to be a great movie, the music was also top-notch (through film and especially end credits). Some parts were a bit unbelievable, as if you just found your girlfriend, they believed they were waiting for torture and death, and everything you do is tell her what happened and how you got there (why not ask her, she had some or even some fresh air or a piece of rubber when it was on it?), come on now, most would probably just scream "hurry up and break me up and then leave F *** THEN QUICK!". where there were flies, worms, and so on, and when the girl came to the scene, it sounded like the sound of a fallen body sounding a few alarm bells! I only recommend this movie to my friends Dennis Niellson and so on, I'm sure such a video would cause such pains to have a very happy Christmas.
