Like most reviews, I've seen this movie under the title The Witching, which is a reissue title. It seems that necromancy that is original is better, but I doubt it. Most scenes of witchcraft still contain most of the necromancy scenes and they are still bad. In many ways, I think the added nudity of witchcraft has brought at least some value to fun! But do not be fooled - it's only 3 scenes with nudity and it's from the people standing around the variety. No diabolical curly pump! <br /> <br /> This movie is so terribly horrible that it's hard to know what to criticize first. Dialogue is terrible and directly from the Troma box. At least Troma has a tongue on his face. This is a personified boredom. The actor is changing with Pamela Franklin (Flora possessed child in The Innocents would have believed!) The worst with a high voice. Welles just seems to wait for his salary check. The other female leader has a haunted face so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is too bad. It looks like Gene Wilder. He is cautiously filmed with scenes that change without reason and editing is blasting. It is because witchcraft is copying and inserting work, not gentle. Only the illumination is fine. The sound is also terrible, and it's hard to hear an awesome new soundtrack that never stops. Mother of "ghosts" is just as much garbage, but the actress is so badly bad at playing that at least gives some unintentional laughter. Indeed, this movie (at least a witch) is only for the enemy. He can not have a lot of healthy fans because it's quite inconsistent and I actually found that I thought insensibly boring! <br /> <br /> The best bit was when the credits were rewound - so much so that it was simply better for this bad excuse for the film BEAR!
