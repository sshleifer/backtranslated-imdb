I decided to watch this film because it was nominated for the Oscar this year. I think so many people really wanted this movie, but they were bored and disappointed. The first scene was fine, but the rest of the movie in shake hands mode of the camera is really annoying. I think the main reason for filming such a film and nominating an Oscar is as follows: <br /> <br /> The American "military machine" (people who make money for the war) urgently needs justification or justification for the war in Iraq by saying something kills (patriotic). the "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character to get the audience to imagine a "loving war as a drug"? .. Oh, please come on! what boredom! <br /> <br /> Watch to get an idea of ​​how low the Academy of Movies can fall ...
