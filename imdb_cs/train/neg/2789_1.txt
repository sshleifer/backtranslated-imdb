Savage Island (2003) is a lame film. It's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horror. Not just that the story and the script were unfortunate. I do not know why this movie was made. In my time I've seen a lot of flicks and those I really hate are movies that make me angry. This caused him to have blood. The situation was at best ineffective. If I made such a movie, it would be short. Indeed, because these "idjits" in the background would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by D.V.D. I'm a passionate observer of a bad cinema. But this film is virtually impractical. I do not mind films that are filmed on D.V. but if you're going to make it a nice movie, not some tired protector horror horror movies (sans Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this disc waste. If you meet this at a rental shop, talk. <br /> <br /> Movies that are really angry will get an automatic 1.
