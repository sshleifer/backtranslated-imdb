A lot of the time movie - an extremely long sequence without dialogue, bad flashes and almost entirely male. Both women who appear have less than 10 rows in total and exist only as romantic interests for men. <br /> <br /> O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; Unfortunately, she spends most of her time peering through the scrub. Alastair Sims is always glad to see, but he is also scarcely used. The film has one more positive aspect because it portrays many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathy (as an occasional appearance of Mosley graffiti) that many people do not know today. Too many today's films about World War II paint allies as all-good and axis as everything-evil when history tells us that people are much more complicated than that! <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie about when you recover from flu and you are tied on the couch and you do not have the ability to absorb something too complicated. If you need something to make time when the electrolytes stabilize, it's the film for you.
