Philip. K. Dickian's film. And a decent affair. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and the abomination called the Minority Report (Spielberg). But let me face it, the twist and the end of the cheese was a little too much for me. In the middle of the movie, I've already started to worry about this end and I was unfortunately right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth the time. Not at all. The first half (as many have commented here) is amazing. There are a few parts where you start to wonder whether the director wanted to report that showmanship is a very important thing in the future (we do it on corny sf because we can) or it's just a combination. But paranoia is there and feeling "off-the-knee" too. Good.
