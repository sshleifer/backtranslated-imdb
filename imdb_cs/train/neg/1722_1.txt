This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's extremely boring with a lot of boring dialogues and it has some very uncomfortable characters and laughs. The only reason I've seen this waste is that it was the eight disc terrorism I got. The story is absurd and totally stupid as well as the final. No blood, except for a few bloodstained creations and a few bloody gunshot wounds. The actor is TERRIBLE !!. Richard Cardella is terrible as a sheriff and he was pretty ridiculous and his character is uncomfortable. Glen Roberts is a comic relief and was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and he was not even FUNNY! Bob Hyman is decent, but nothing more than that. Richard Garrison is annoying and does not have a chemistry with Kacey Cobb what happened. Kacey Cobb is here and he has no chemistry with Richard. Overall Avoid this waste at all costs! BOMB of 5.
