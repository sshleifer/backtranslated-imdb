Could it be the same director as Do not Look For or Bad Timing? Bad <br /> <br /> was, constantly edited. You have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar in Below, look to find out how much Roeg has lost his touch. <br /> <br /> And generally reliable Teresa Russell (now looks a bit horny, I'm afraid to report it) can not save this. The story is a pure pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is wooden, and Roeg's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as a plague.
