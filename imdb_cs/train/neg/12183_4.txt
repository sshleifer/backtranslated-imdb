Christ. Continuing to one of the best movies of all time, it's at least a mercy to skip songs (a bar repeating the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but continues the tradition of being inerrant and unhappy. This time, Annie and her friends are leaving for London to join Joan Collins's conspiracy to blow up Buckingham Palace or some kind of battle. The film has a bizarre sycophantic attitude to its eponymous character, contrary to how irritating she is: every time a little bugger blossoms "leapin 'lizards!" I felt my teeth crushing my teeth. The bottom-shot, blurred and fertile film has only one monument ("Unhand me, you stupid genius!") And the fact that it's not an original recommendation.
