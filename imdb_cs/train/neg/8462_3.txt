The "Bullfighter" was produced in 2000, but it is published on the video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: a confusing story, an incomprehensible dialogue that Oliver Martinez said, and annoying adjustments? It has to be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) are going on mystical trips. They encounter many furious characters and avoid some bad ones. The movie looks great and there are lots of styles, but there is no substance. Most movies, when trying to calm down, do not pay attention to themselves with unresolved drawings and weak special effects. Do not be fooled by the envelope: Willem Dafoe is in it 2 minutes the most.
