"Home Alone 3" is the first of the Home Alone films that do not have the same role as Culkin and the same villains. The film, however, is very similar to the original film "Home Alone". Instead of two comic cribs we get three or four of them. This movie contains some traps, but also has a long scene with a remote-controlled car. Pears of humor is also consistent, but young boy and villains really can not influence this movie. (No pun intended.) This film offers nothing new or anything other than the previous films and it's really not warm, the feeling of holiday or the scam that had two more movies. It's just a pure comedy, but I could not make it laugh because these real characters did not really do it. I do not want to recommend this movie; it's pretty boring. If you're looking for a good family movie with comedy, then watch the original "Home Alone" movie.
