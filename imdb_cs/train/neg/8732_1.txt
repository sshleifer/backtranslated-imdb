The story is about the deaths of young children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the murders. During the film, she seems to have some problems with her daughter. Eventually the serial killer grabbed. And it is done. But before you find out who is born, you have to see some terrible behavior of all the actors. It's unbelievable how bad the actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but I wasted a waste of time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
