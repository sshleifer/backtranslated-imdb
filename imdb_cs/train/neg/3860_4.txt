In the best times, I'm not a big fan of rom / com. Several of them were pretty good (insomniac dream control), but this is more the same but less. With a running time of 100 minutes I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. The only real belly of laughter is when strange men and friends instinctively help the character of Lee. <br /> <br /> I can only say I avoid. I guarantee that there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $ 3 (and just because I'm a big Lee fan)
