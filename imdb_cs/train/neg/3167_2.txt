Henry, the vet (Paul Rudd) and his boss fable, Kate (Eva Longoria), are looking at the last minute for their adoption. It's their wedding in the morning, and Kate is in madness, and he's giving chefs attention to her food presentation requirements. But the horror of the horrors, the ice sculpture "angel" ordered by Kate, comes without the wings. In a subsequent struggle with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" girl falls on Kate and sends her to another place. A year later, Henry's sister arranges a psyche to tell the young vet that Kate would like to start dating other ladies and keep going. However, a beautiful medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) will be interested in Henry herself, much to the disappointment of her eating partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to make Ashley confused because she has no intention of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to bring Kate back to heaven? This is an incredible romantic comedy that is one of the worst that a devoted fan has ever seen. No, it's not a cast when trying to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny because she is a sister-in-law and Bell has an extraordinary style and humor that is equally infectious. Biggs, also a funny thespian, is totally useless. As for Rudd, a very talented artist (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please), he is trying the hardest of all, and in fact is the main reason to see this flapper. Its spell, appearance and easy impression of a long journey when filming. But nothing can make a winner without absolutely nothing. So, if you are a fan of a romantic comedy dyed in a wave, think long and hard before you see some money for this. Even the free tickets that fall into the lap, it is worth noting that this movie is an almost death experience for those who adore the cinema with love and laughter.
