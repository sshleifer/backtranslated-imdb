Okay, so I'm an original Wicker Man fan and I do not like British films transformed by Americans, so why oh, why did I get into the most painful cinematic experiences at all? Am I not a fan of Nicolas Cage and maybe I had a moment of madness? The movie was frightening! Bit at the beginning of the crash / fire was not relevant to the movie at all, and the female policeman knew where Edward was going, so a bit at the end with two girls visiting the mainland would not be the whole thing to be investigated. History of the wicker was not really explored - and I think I was in America, it did not help the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and did not contain any atmosphere or tension. I have to say that the best piece was at the end when Nicolas Cage rises flames! I'm in such a desperate need to see the original again to cleanse my disappointed soul. I really can not say how disappointing this movie is, please do not see if you: <br /> <br /> A) You do not like the American re-make of British films B) They are a fan of the original C) Hatred Nicolas Cage
