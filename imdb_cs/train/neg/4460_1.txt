HORRENDOUS! Avoid the plague. I would rate it in the worst of ten worst movies. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. It seems to be done by day carers ... wait, I've seen programs better than this. It opens like a soft porn show with a blond naked woman who makes a shower scene, and from there goes badly. Good naked scenes, but that's it. Problems with sound and light last throughout the movie. Sometimes I swear I hear the roar of the camera engine. YIKES! I would like to see another movie about this story, but from different people. This group of actors and crew needs more acting and film lessons. Voted 1 out of 10.
