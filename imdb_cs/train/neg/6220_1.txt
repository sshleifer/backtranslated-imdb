This film was a real disappointment for me. I've been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out they were making a movie about him, I was very deserted, got a movie on VHS when he came out and was angry with what I saw the movie was not about his life, about his death. I thought it would be a downward movie about life and music Grams, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I wish people to look at his life more than his death. The only thing that was good for this movie was his soundtrack. This film is a disappointment to every Gram Parsons Fan.
