I was looking for the right words to describe this movie. At first I just wanted to skip to major issues because the film does not increase the level that deserves comment. Still, I stopped, wondering how to describe such things and somewhat taken up the challenge posed by the question: "What can I say about such a movie?" Garbage? No, it's not garbage, waste can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, its not greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow big and healthy. Finally, I hit "Not Bad", a reworking of the phrase "Not Bad" sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of repair. That's it, Georgia: Not bad.
