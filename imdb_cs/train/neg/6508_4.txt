This is the breaking away of the old Frankenstein assumption. The celebrated scientist is killed in an unfortunate accident, and his father, a known brain surgeon, rescues the brain. He is then placed into the robotic body of his own construction. His brother, the electric genius, gives the impulse "colossus" to move thoughts into motion. The whole project is bad when it becomes berserk. <br /> <br /> Special effects are undeveloped. Script missing. And that's funny, it's not a little frightening. Well, very young kids will think it's good. If you're all morning three in the morning and it will appear ... at night. <br /> <br /> The characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played "Colossus".
