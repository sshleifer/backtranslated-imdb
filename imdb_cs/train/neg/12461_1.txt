Unlike most other comments on IMDb's "Syriana" website, me and my family found this movie at home at home full time and space. In short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was far too clever. Rather than trying to communicate a complex story in a smart and clear way, it has been assumed that constantly throwing mostly unclear and difficult to interconnect the 30-second vignettes of various stories from a dozen stories to the audience for great and clear viewing. No, sir, no. What makes for great observation is full clarity, accuracy, drawings and stories - and features - that have a beginning, a middle, and an end. This kind of movie presentation - similar to the Dim Sum Experience in a Chinese restaurant - is extremely demanding and unintelligent. Thank you for good, for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British film noir of the 1940s and 1950s, whose writers, director and actors knew the value of a clear tale of storytelling, diction and acting meant something. This is one DVD that this family will not sit on again.
