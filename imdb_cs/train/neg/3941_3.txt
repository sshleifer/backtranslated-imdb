This is what happens when you live in China, and the local video store runs quietly on the names of the English language. You are blessed with this work that seems to be a Romanian cinema. But I think he has a real comic potential. <br /> <br /> Spoilers are technically the following: <br /> <br /> Although I do not think it would actually spoil someone who watched why the movie at the casino has a beach archery scene, even in a flashbase . This mystery and many other quarrels remain to be used by desperate comedians, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. I'll also wonder why perfectly-looking people allow themselves to abuse such a movie. It is sad.
