This movie began with some form of plot, and then left it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to keep working with this film. This movie is a very cynical garbage collection made by some people with animation skills but totally inadequate creativity or storyline ability. It's a terribly bad effort from a big studio. Obviously, there are moral and motivational issues in Disney, not to mention the total lack of supervision and quality control. This process enabled this film to see the light of the day, which speaks of its incompetence and despair. This movie joins my very short "worst film of all time".
