"Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "It's about Mary" or "Meet the Parents," but rather comes from a rusty room of rejecting these two films. Luckily I rented it for a 5-day rental because I could not sit and watch for more than 20 minutes at a time. The assumption is decent and I liked scenes where other people automatically cover Paul's mistakes (the save-mart check was great), but writing scripts is terribly terrible. Dialogue usually becomes flat, and just when you think things are finally getting on the road, any unnecessary observation ring will remain for no reason. And how many jokes in the toilet really need one movie? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the humor of killing is great when it's cleverly done like the other films I mentioned, but this film just lacks a mark. It's bad because I love Julie Stiles (The Ten Things I Hate About You Was Great), but it could not help me to sit in this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go to rent "There's something about Mary" once more.
