I recently watched this film twice, and I do not seem to understand why the makers made it from a pile of bullshit. I mean, yes, it gives an impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean how Austria reproduced at the end of the 1990s and the interwar period. What I do not understand is why they represented Hitler as 100% pure evil, mad, unreliable, psychically unstable. He was, in the end, a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had his dark side, no doubt about it. But why is it described in this way in heaven? All its positive aspects were omitted from the script, so nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating World War II. Yes, he was racist and yes, he was sometimes unstable especially at the end of the war. They are all true. But again; why the hell just made LIE to the public? Do you want to warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was that they were able to get to power in moments of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable, despite being hugged by almost all the Germans alive (not to mention the Austrians and many other people), makes it a warning for modern civilization, not the fact that Hitler was such a "strange." If we were convinced that the producers would believe us - I would be convinced that the German people were slowed down. A man like this one in this movie would never reach the leader of the party - not to mention the ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
