It's not a ubiquitous horrible comedy, but it's very DULL. It is barely wet and loses its rich production value. There is one ugly moment near the end when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "nemesis" and tells him "You were my one good opponent, and now we can start over and over again." This scene, along with Burt Kwouk's entertaining portrait at the beginning, is the only unforgettable part of the film. (* 1/2)
