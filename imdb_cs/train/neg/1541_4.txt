I disagreed intensely with this film and left during the scene when the loyal gang fired the British. The film effectively accuses NIs of being the cause of their own troubles. This suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and had nothing to do with the British division of Ireland and the domination of its history, ie the NI was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as unhappy fools even though they despise loyalist paramilitaries who fought for a thing - preserving their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is well known that the British intelligence cooperated with the loyalists during the war, no doubt keeping Catholics in the bay and demoralizing republicanism. The 1990's "machismo", masculinity, and so on. They are transposed to Belfast in the seventies, and are portrayed as part of the alleged Irish "psychia" that leads to violence. A silly song from a woman in a club - old Ireland from green fields .. blah .. blah .. - has a symbolic position, that is, poor, poor fools fighting for impossible cause. Boring, ahistoric, cheap and ugly baskets. O'Sullivan made a personal statement on the conflict, which requires a serious political analysis.
