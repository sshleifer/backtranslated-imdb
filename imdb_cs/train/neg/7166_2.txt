This movie could be very good, but it came so short. Cheese special effect and so it works. I wanted to see if the story was not so bad. If there were more stories, it would be better. The conspiracy focuses on a poor Druid witch who is associated with this woman who gets migraines. The film moves on and on, and never tells anything. Christopher Walken has a role to play, but it's totally absurd, like most movies. This movie has the potential, but it looks like they are really bad for a television movie. I would like to avoid this movie.
