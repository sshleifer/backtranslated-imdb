Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. She survives a relentless series of disappointment and trauma, she raises anger at the nearest targets. When he sees that he has been transformed by violence and focused on discipline in a boxing club, he knows he found her home. <br /> <br /> The film goes on because Diana teaches the usual teenage lessons besides the skills needed for a successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in this role, especially when she delivers the thoughts of a young woman who touches on all sides and fights not only the personal situation but rooted sexism. in the direction of all young actors who are fading compared to older, experienced casts. There are too many pauses in the scenario, which reduces dramatic tension. The overall silence of the film emits the intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good image that can be seen once, perhaps only to see the power of a fully realized young woman, whose femininity is so complex that it involves its power. Its limitation prevents it from being classified into the "see it over and over" category.
