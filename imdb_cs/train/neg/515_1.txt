Oh, man, this movie is bad. It flows horribly. The story is about a racing car driver who falls in love with himself, and then he has to promote a chain of fast-food chicken, and he does not like himself. They are trying to get out of the contract and they get terrible, painfully dysfunctional gags. Jim Nabors seems to be asleep, ineffective. Missing Burt, like Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed, when they look at this arsonist. Last year, Anderson's hair is totally frightening, which proves that there were no hair sprays in the 1960s. Or maybe it was a wig. He talked about Burt's wig not being bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and Bandit 2". In any case, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie ever, where "Cannonball Run 2" is. Original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", which fortunately did not follow) are great, fun movies. This is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, smelled. You are looking for a Jackie Gleason villain, which is fun hate. And you think this is not one of those fun movies that will be brought. It's miserable, clean and simple. Even the outputs at the end were tedious and boring and the worst of all, unhappy. And I forgot at least that Stroker Ace was one of the first heavy nails that Burt's coffin sealed before his somewhat revival years in "Boogie Nights," another film that, like "Deliverance," a year ago shows quite well when he has a decent platform to do so.
