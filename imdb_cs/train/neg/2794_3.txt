Well, since I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I'll check this movie on TMC, no good. One of the worst mistakes in my life so far, and that's only half. I seriously thought it was one of those fine-core movies with a messy plot and miserable action, poor filming and dirty effects. But no, I have no pleasure. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping maybe maybe some laughs, but I was not sure if they were trying to throw in one line or not. But now I have to sit and watch the others until Pulp Fiction begins. Or maybe something better. And now I'm sitting here to write until I have 10 rows
