I hated the film so much that I remembered it alive. It's not funny either. Every film that relies on unfortunate sexual jokes and racism does not deserve the money that is worth it to be. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a hot milk carton. All I could think of is "it deserves it because it makes such a bad movie." Do not waste your time or money on this.
