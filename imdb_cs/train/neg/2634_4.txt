It must not be confused with the above-mentioned average supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". Sentinel was a great part of the film for me that did not provide consistent action, several promising critics on my back. For me, it looked like it was all when I did it and just to make some quick cash because it was really like a creative film. Sentinel is a rehash of several quality films, such as "In the Fireline," with no originality, and looking at Michael Douglas, who, in my opinion, felt a little foolish. The main problem, besides uncertainty, was to have a bad pace. I often looked around when I tried to view this movie and at the same time I looked at how much time left, more than once. Not only what happened to Eva Longoria, who could not convince her that she deserved licking. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, here, of course, is going through the motions. He did not convince himself as a runner or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also turned off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here's just fine, no more than that. He tries to come across as crude, but he has been much finer than anything else, and to be honest, he did not seem to care. Eva Longoria Parker is quite average. She does not convince her role and she was pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is quite horrible as the first lady. It looks bored with tears and her role is to throw away, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a big role at the end, but it's not enough to care. <br /> <br /> Beginner. Sentinel is another political thriller that shook me. It's too old, too tired and the most important is the lack of effort. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
