The couple moved to their dream home without realizing that they were and their neighbors were built on land formerly used as a cemetery. The film is said to have been based on a true story, although the truth is not disclosed. The plot is barely unique - see Spielberg 'Poltergeist' (1982). In a short time they encounter various supernatural phenomena, ranging from disturbing - mysterious shadows, serious illnesses to their daughters - to frankly absurd - the toilets are continually flushed and garage doors are out of control. The story has only a small depth: as soon as it turns out that the earth was used as a graveyard, we do not read anything more. It does not seem to happen. Characters are not particularly well-drawn or memorable in any way, nor are they particularly strange. The film could be disturbing to some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive news from it.
