There are some elements that have saved this film from total disaster but are overshadowed by misconduct, plotting holes, deep dialogues, weak script and predictable clichés. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a horror film with a story that does not lead most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes, including the black guy who first got it (yeah, it seems that this cliché is still very lively even in Finland), they seem to have trouble leaving a mysteriously empty hospital. There are ghostly spirits (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought they did not at least use zombies, but they came), and a Finnish glam rock band with a demonic makeup that had come their way. There is also some time shift doodle, but it adds nothing to the story. The autistic girl and the hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of the situation, but they never explain it to the viewer or to their confused friends. Their lines consist only of deep thoughts about life lessons such as: "What happens ..." or "Light can not live in the dark ..." or the ominous "I need a red crayon ... a red crayon." So all these characters (including a wiping father and a sweet doctor in distress) eventually do, run around dark floors and from or mistakenly to the demons. Sometimes a ghost or a group of zombies appears, and if the demon keyboard does not seem to be able to see a group of six people coming to him, he waved a flashlight and an interview, only pretending. And it seems that this demon can break the walls without great difficulty, but the opening of the elevator door is beyond its capabilities. Eventually we even got "it was all dream" twist. Or maybe not. Oh, boy, I wish this movie was, and it seems that time is moving faster, so it's all in just 10 minutes ...
