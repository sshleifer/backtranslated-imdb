How come I've never seen or heard about this unsolicited movie before? It's across my avenue with bloody teenkill, smashing conspiracy and an irresistible 80th cheese atmosphere. For some reason no one really cares, employees and students of the elite Catholic University are lost to an unknown psychopath. Freshly received teacher Julie Parker gets involved when all the people with whom she contacts are either dead or behave strangely. This movie is cheerful bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence, and each character is extremely absurd for others. For example, a girl is killed and her body is stored in a container. Then, and for no reason, the story suddenly moves three weeks in advance, but the murdered girl never mentioned or even missed. Not her boyfriend! The game is pitiful and is not a bit of nudity that you can enjoy. The apparitions of the assassin are quite funny, because the creators really seemed convinced that it was an original twist ... It's not, boys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst creeps ever.
