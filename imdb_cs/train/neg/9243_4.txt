Simply put, I'm not interested in the Westerns. And I never met through someone from start to finish, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see it all the way, no matter how painful it was for me. Initially, it was terrible, as expected. I find that acting is ridiculous, scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) are bored, and music and its timing shake on the edge of the painful. However, after a mental pep spoke alone to fight on, after the first 20 minutes it started to be a little easier for me to last. The focus on cinematography and the way John Ford has managed to do even the poorest situations (I think boring they are) seem occasionally somewhat amazing, making it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not go so far as to say that I have enjoyed the movie to the end. But it was good enough for me to sit down to the very end, and that in itself impresses me.
