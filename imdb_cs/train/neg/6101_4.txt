Almost two-person play, and as such will be an important dialogue and leadership speech. They are not particularly good. This could be stronger if it was first created as a game for two people and then started working on the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a confused vampire who seems to be slightly autistic, striper (as a result of watching too much porn in his miserable house). He wants to tell her about the daylight. It would be better if he found someone with a day's work, or someone who excelled in painting with words like a poet, but then maybe they would not have a hot spot. do what he wants (and it's not really good), he wants to eat at 6am when the sun rises. There is much to do with this term, despite the fact that he says he can go without food, it will just be more hungry. In addition, he says he can not let the editors know because he knows about it, but he leaves many other people who know what he is. There are a lot of inconsistencies. Why does this vampire decide to live in a house so poorly laid out that light from streetlights and surrounding buildings is poured as if it were in the daylight, I'm not sure. Throughout the world, you would think he would do a better job or have a little calming the place. Probably not a rich vampire. This is supposedly a remake and I'm curious to see the original version of this, Dance the Damned. Although it was directed by Katt Shea and other films directed by Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II), they were pretty bad.
