It's hard to take it from the Hammer studio and the fact that it's available on DVD when it's not good movies. Our peoples are ashamed where the working class is portrayed as working shy or worse! The problem is you can not help Clippie nostalgia on the bus. Try to keep the contents of your stomach when you see Olive on Fluffy? Blue "sparkling" nights or something similar to Shirley Bassey wore at a concert in 1972. Warning this film shows the illegal practice of dragging a combo with a red double-decker bus that informed me that it was not Routemaster but Bristol. <br /> <br /> Take care not to bother to watch something like a decent place like a chestnut or dad's army ... or a fly crawling into the wall.
