If it's a black experience, let me out on the front or back door. Mother's boy one day sees how two young hoods are going through and everything's down for him all the time. Angela Bassett, one radiant grace in this film, plays over her protective, religious mother. Despite her anger, as his life turned, in the middle of the picture, she really decided to accept it. She allows her friends to come, and suddenly it is okay to use wrong if it is not for the children. This is a sad state of affairs about gangster rap. You knew where this movie was heading. I literally laughed at the end when Bassett accompanied his son's body to the funeral, saying that while his life was shortened to 24 years, he became a human. What man? He was a convicted criminal, he wrote the worst rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. This scene in a classroom tells teachers to get more than a teacher as a sanitary worker is a perfect example of what's going on in our schools. Complete and complete lack of respect for the teacher. The East Coast, the rivalry of the West Coast gang rap is never fully explained. Everything we see is a weapon. <br /> <br /> A terrible image that does nothing to prevent gang violence. What terrible models are these rap singers and their bad music. The African American community should have fun in life itself. Who was the homeless person who portrayed Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show as a thin comparison. I know it was the Bedford Stuyvesant alley that changed this bastard boy into the vulgar monster he was. What is the dubious state of things when it's called movie entertainment.
