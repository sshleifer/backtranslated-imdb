This is the best film Derek has ever done, and if you think it's a recommendation, then you have not seen any of the others. There are usual ingredients: it is as badly resolved as their other efforts, we can see if the bo disrobing or auditioning on wet t-shirts quite often meet, the story is just ridiculously idiotic and the film is taken too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? But it does have a few things. Bo looks great, production values ​​(sets, costumes, etc.) They are fairly good and this greatly increases the value of the camp. Oddly, it's really quite fun, simply because it's trying to be serious and so badly fails.
