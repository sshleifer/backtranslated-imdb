This movie must be the worst I've ever seen. The name of the movie deceives the audience that they are thinking about hope. The story of the movie is at best ridiculous, with so poor acting that you just have to go crazy. The title 'Zombie Nation' suggests a pile of zombies when there are actually six. It can not be considered a horror film due to the introduction of cheese 80 music when the zombie 'attack'. Zombie really talks and behaves like human beings in the movie, the only difference is the make-up that looks like something from the La Roux video. If you ever have a chance to buy this movie, do it then drink a copy.
