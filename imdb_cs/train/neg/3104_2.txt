I've done a lot of reviews on IMDb and this movie is unique in that I've never seen the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and unfortunate that I just could not sit - even though I was trying. The biggest problem with this and any movie Mel Brooks, which I call the "cup Mel". In other words, the better his film, the less you see in the movie. Think about it - the producers and the young Frankenstein were great movies, and it was hard for them. But, movies such as Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of Mel and are quite dopey movies (yes, I did not like space balls - but that's not a place to talk about). <br /> <br /> Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itching, and mental retardation, I can not think of a less fun theme than homeless. It's just a comic circuit breaker. Think about it, people. FUNNIEST (?) The scene in the movie has Mel to make whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in the dumpster! And that's funny, in what way?
