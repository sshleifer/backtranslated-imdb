Like a huge fan or Cracker series, I've been waiting for 7 years for another increment. This episode I'm afraid I just do not meet the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after seven years for marrying his daughters and engages in a murder investigation; he was a soldier; his tour of service in Northern Ireland continues killing. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode is the exceptionally comfortable way that everything is set and how the wind is guided to the killer. It's all thick, attracted. But there are some good backstage scenes from Northern Ireland that are filmed great.
