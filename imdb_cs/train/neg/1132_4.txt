The principle of the extensive preparatory phase of this star is a born story, it seems to have a much more noble ending. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a young woman who is trapped within herself, but she is never convincing as an actress scene of growing fame that overcomes the profits from this department. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting lessons we will never see her doing the teacher's instructions. After the suffering of Esther's (largely self-inflicted) pain in unbearable details, she does not give us any convincing sense of her triumph. The obsessive presence of the heroine's pain appears to be a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. The causes of this pain (poverty, quasi autism, judaism, sexual betrayal) never meet in a coherent whole. A 163-minute film with a simple conspiracy should be able to knit their free ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go in front of the audience.
