I remembered the title so well. For me, the film Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh was in supporting roles. Vincent Massey's voice was from his beard. Flora Robson was great. Her next signature would be "55 days in Beijing." Same role, but with different luxurious gowns. And the same voice. As for the army, it was a subtext. I love black and white movies. Was everything done in the Elizabethan times of the night? It was occasional and difficult. I did not know which interest in love. Was he a Spaniard or was Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe Elizabeth I would be a great strategist who recommended that fire ships be sent against the army. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This could have been more accurate in history, but Bette Davis had more compelling scripts. And I missed the daylight!
