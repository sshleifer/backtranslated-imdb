In my opinion, the name of this movie should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". A few months ago I went through the film and I was quite disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate the fact that the director made a film about men from 442 - a topic that has long deserved to appeal to the film industry - the activity in some parts of the film was quite obsolete. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were great. However, the director would NEVER find the main character in the film. I'm sorry Lane, you're not just a movie actor. Hold on to what you are good about - theater acting. The performance of Gina Hiraizumi in this movie was also terrible. She should never have a speaking role, and her gaze was not suitable for playing part of Miss Nisa's queen. There were other young actresses in the movie that were naturally beautiful and whose performance was amazing ... Why were they not cast for this role? Another major problem with this film was its action sequence. Japanese-American soldiers do not look like they are fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. Since it was a low budget, but because it was a war-based film, is it not important to show some real fighting? This movie was a good attempt, but it definitely does not cost a significant division.
