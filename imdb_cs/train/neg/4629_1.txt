Apparently, Misty Ayers' famous stripper "plays" talents. Pity he can not act. Exhaustive little story about the sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers), who is drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets a nice Tommy Cole who immediately falls in love with her. She wants her to escape, but can she? She will not really like it. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin - Ayers is just going down into underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little story that is badly acting, a terrible "comedy" (I never thought prostitution was fun, but what do I know?) And a terrible dialogue after dubbing. I admit that I did not change at the end, but it is not enough to listen to it. Ayers' attempts to play are hysterical too! Real Bomb. Avoid.
