Avent-Guards Nightmare, an extremely low budget "movie" that has delusions of grandeur. Hard to sit. I get the report that child abuse is wrong. Wow great revelation. I had no idea it was bad to look at it. Yes, that's sarcasm. DO NOT take care of this "film" if male or female nudity is offended. Do not look at yourself if you are the least squeamish. DO NOT ASK IF you care about playing. On the second idea, just do not look at the period. <br /> <br /> My stage: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: movie shooting, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, movies, director's comments, 2 teaser trailer versions, music video The Azoic and experiment in the classroom
