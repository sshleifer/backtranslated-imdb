In my eyes, this is an almost perfect example of the Hollywood ego, only beaten by the new King Kong movie. Superman is an original superhero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears stockings. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, from the beginning of the movie u just want to put a piece of kryptonite in my throat. It just seems silly to wear a costume. Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for him for lois lane, she should be a hard-line reporter, but she looks more like a schoolgirl in this movie. Give it a weak and predictable (WOW, it's actually a supermans son who would ever think ...) and the acting was terrible. This movie has one good thing to do, and that's his name Kevin Spacey. His portrait of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but he could not save the film. What this film needed was cast "lois and clark" (except Kevin Spacey of course) and another story. I watched this movie after watching "the hills have eyes," and I was poor when I found out that there were worse movies.
