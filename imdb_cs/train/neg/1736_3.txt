Let me start by really liking Betty Grable, especially from "Down Argentine Way", but when she got to this disaster she was also "round" and frankly the whole movie was embarrassed. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who had to be quite desperate) the story was bad, the colors good, and the movie too long. Some of the old emergency regimes, such as Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, tried to stimulate interest, but without success. The musical score was terrible and I have to say that not one song was memorable ... because I was such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wish I never saw it!
