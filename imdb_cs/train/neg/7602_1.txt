One of the other commentators said they had almost gone. If I were not with a wife who wanted to stay, I would leave. It's also a shame because I think it could be a good movie. But it's one of the worst adapted scenarios I've ever seen. It starts going nowhere and it does not say anywhere (I'll say it's going nowhere fast, but it's really slow now ... painfully slow). From time to time there are signs that something interesting might happen, or that one of the characters is potentially some depth, but that's all we get - the hints. There is no single payout or revelation in the entire movie. Not that I need a sneaky plot to have fun ... I like a good study of a meandering character as well as another indie buff. But these characters do not contribute to anything. Throughout the duration of the movie, she does not care what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost start hoping to die because at least death may be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so odd and unpredictable that you think it would be convincing, but it is not. Instead of special, noir-esquire characters in hardweights, you can easily recognize it for what it is: plenty of talented but dirty actors, bruises and raised eyebrows while reading a bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context. All for two productions, painfully slow hours. Sad.
