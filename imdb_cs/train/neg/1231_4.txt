Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is an upper class housewife who lives in a private apartment building in the suburbs along with her twins and abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della devotes attention to the twins, neglects their house and its appearance and disturbs Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, he goes to a local shopping mall at night buying a wrapping paper and finding no parking space. When he sees the old car parked in two places, he leaves the message to the owner, who calls him a "selfish blockbuster." When she closes the store, Della's car is held by an old car driver and she is threatened by four punks? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomas (Luis Chavez). When Defender protects her, Chuckie is shot at her head, Della speeds up her car and tries to escape from the criminals. However, she crashes her car near the forest while pursuing a gang. Takes the tool and is hiding in the wood, fighting the gang to survive. A few days ago I saw the trailer "While It Was Out" and I wanted to watch DVDs. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm completely disappointed with this tedious and unlikely cliché collection. Della Myers is presented as an insecure and negligible domestic woman and she does not exist as a wife; Motherhood is her only interest in her family concept. She is being chased by four criminals, but she defeats them with a tool that looks like a Batman's belt. That's why the plot is so absurd that it irritates. Gang criminals form the popular cliché of American films, African-American, Chinese-American and Latin together with the American lord politically correct. Kim Basinger has decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While It Was Out")
