Well, at first I was excited to download an animated open source movie just to be demolished by a reel. The animation is great, the synchronization of the lips is terrible and you are still watching a movie that hopes to understand what's going on just to realize that nothing is happening. You do not feel any emotions for the characters, just a shame that the creators are wasting time. I saw short films with double emotions in half the time! This could be an excellent short film if they just took the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone in Blender is thrilled to show off their software and plotting options, but sorry that boys - telling stories is what the film does.
