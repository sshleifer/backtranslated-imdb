This has to be by far the worst film I have seen in the last 20 years. When I found out Michael Madsen was in it, I thought the movie could not be too bad because he was in some decent films and he was a pretty decent actor. POORLY! No one should waste time on this movie. I accelerated over 80 percent and I do not feel I miss something.
