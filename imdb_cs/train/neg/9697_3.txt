I saw the first of the dwarf films and sometimes I enjoyed watching it. In the first part, there are many famous TV / comedians who, in fantastic costumes, are the typical small episodes of their stand-up program, and that's exactly the problem the other film has to face. Everything was already there ... nothing new that could be gained. You are familiar with most of the often boring and stupid "jokes," and you always feel that their goal is to give every comedy that wants to get back to the stage for the last decade. There's nothing important about the story: a typical fairy tale about Rumpelstiltskin without any meaning. I expected something like that, but I could not complain. I really complain about lazy writers who have had the whole background story; their only activity was to get many jokes and parodies inside, but they did not. This cage, in addition to the great appearance of Helga Schneider, is a total waste of time and money. (If you do not like, then remove the 2 points of your rating) If you want to save money and get bad jokes, then watch the bullshit that every Friday night is sung free on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you know some "laugtery" I saw yesterday in the cinema.
