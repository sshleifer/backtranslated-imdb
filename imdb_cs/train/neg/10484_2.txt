Being a fan of Elvis, I can not understand how this project could be done. It's by far the worst film of all time Elvis, a totally unlucky, stupid, and a lot of mistakes about the King. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? Mention of suspicious minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast try to do the best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an impersonator), Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy plays a young Elvis sucks. The whole movie lacks fun and becomes boring a minute in a minute. If you want to see an ultra cheap, insane, but absolutely fun little movie related to Elvis, I really recommend "Bubbu Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
