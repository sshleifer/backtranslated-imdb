This movie seemed too long even in just 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there are always too many records of people walking (jungle, rocky cliffs, rivers, or lakes) to clear the run. The film is worth seeing for mixed and naked native zombies with large, bloody, bloody eyes that are always accompanied by a soundtrack with heavy breathing and plenty of reverberation. Eurotrash fans will enjoy bad English dubbing, an inappropriate female body, and very silly makeup tasks for a monster and a native extra. For zombies and cannibals it was pretty nice light, but then I probably did not see the uncut version.
