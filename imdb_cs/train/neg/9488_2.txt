In my time I've seen some terrible horror films and, while it's not the worst of the bundle, it's certainly in the lower half. The script will start OK. The young doctor goes to the hospital as an intern and hopes to improve his work for him and his future wife. Cute, huh? The film then goes straight into the toilet when you realize something is killing patients. He shows that in the basement is a demon that harvests the human soul. It is the task of a physician, a nurse and a guardian in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient down, to make a ritual that involves to a great extent cutting the tongue and then let the creepy house dump the demon out and steal his soul through the spell of cheese special effects. At this point, the movie is so ridiculously stupid, I begged it to end. There was an hour left. It looked like a half-hour "Tales From the Crypt" an episode that somehow stretched for an hour and a half. From Tiny Lister, who makes his best rendering of John Coffey (The Green Mile), Tracy Scoggins, starring in the stereotyped frigid Ratchet series, this film fails at all possible levels. I gave these two stars only for an IMPORTANT reason. 1) His fiance is quite hot, she relieved the pain a bit to the end and 2) The film really looks OK, much better than the current trend of horror films is made with quality home cameras wal-mart. <br /> <br /> Finally, avoid this turd, even if you have a movie blockbuster (which I do and still felt cheated). As a bonus drinking game, you and your buddies shoot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head during a conversation. You will be drunk for 15 minutes in the movie.
