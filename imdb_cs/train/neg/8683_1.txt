This show is not smart. That's basically what's getting worse. The "original humor" that these writers try to pull to prevent a complete bite of the rest of the bush is just unfortunate. In another comment someone quotes a couple of merry lines. For me, George H. W. Bush tells children that they should not watch TV next to Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this series is the top of the series is pathetic. My horror problem, like this sad excuse for political satire, is that these people are getting second season. I am a Liberal Republican and I know that Bush was not a good President. We all do. But that is not a justification for excluding this utterly wasteful time. I place these writers on the same level as Genius for "See the Spartans". Their formula delete so many inactive jokes as you can, and throw even worse original material so you can actually write. <br /> <br /> Again, it's just bad. Unfunny and it makes me more and more unhappy that the bulls are being restored, but amazing and original shows such as Arrested Development are preserved over 3 fixed seasons. Please do not look at these bulls unless you are one of those green bloody liberal hippies who think that a sentence with the words Bush and silly is comic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. The only thing he does is to emulate the Texan accent somewhat and at the end of his sentences it is really hard to breathe out. At least South Park admits that voices are not accurate. If you want fun political satire, watch the Daily Show / Colbert. Or, look at some political sketches for Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, because stop motion motion animation is an exceptionally good job. Look for George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube.
