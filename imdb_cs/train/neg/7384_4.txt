STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a reconnaissance mission along with three new young recruiting teams after they did not obey a direct order from above. However, at night, before they are due to a strike, they are all found severely defeated by a killer with seemingly inhuman power. When the French police are gathering their own investigations, they are looking for responsible people just to expose the corrupt military trade faction with a deadly new drug that changes the human DNA and gives them a terrible new force. > <br /> Bad cover. Bad name. Poor manipulation with postproduction. And a bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But I have to say, I do not think the Attack Force is really his worst. I know that I'm worried by most other reviewers (maybe not Steveday!) But I think a lot of criticism comes from all the bad news that preceded the film rather than the actual quality itself. <br /> <br /> I must say that there was not anywhere as far as dubbing or ropey editing as I led to believe. Dabing was there (which sounded like Martin Sheen with a weakness problem!) It was quite terrible and fairly common, but I was not using it for such a big segment of the movie as I thought. The conspiracy also went smoothly when considering all the confusion with the original completed Harvester film that went on. Like another reviewer noted, the film has a pretty Gothic look on it, a new touch for Seagal. Absolute Killer Low Place, though, was a complete and complete lack of any exciting action, with only a few misconceived battle scenes for every entertainment. I have to be honest, but I'd rather watch it more than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out for a Kill. **
