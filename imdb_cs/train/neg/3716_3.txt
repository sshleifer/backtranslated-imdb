Lance Barton's main character is killed and in heaven some time ago. When the sky learns of the error, it is given to the body of only the deceased wealthy old and white Mr. Wellington. A young black man in an old white male body who still acts like a young black man is perhaps funny if you see an old white actor. In this movie, I finally reminded you a few times: "Chris Rock should be an old white guy." The whole concept does not play the way it was intended: the "illusion" is not well transported and the love story is not at all credible. The fact that all you see is that Chris Rock plays a young black guy, because the old white person everyone can see is shown only in small scenes is a great challenge for the audience to stop believing.
