Grapes!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has a stupid monkey IQ. What a disaster. I could not believe how bad this movie is. Dialogues are very strange and outside the subject, the camera sometimes works only horrific music at the time as a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how worse it can get. Some side kicks of "actors" are total disasters. Sorry, but all the thumbs and fingers and anything that can hang down on my body, drops to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but who knows he may be in a financial crisis to take part in such a fiasco movie. . . . . this film should be presented to all students in all film schools just to teach them how to make a movie
