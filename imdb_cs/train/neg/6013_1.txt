I read every book that took place on the left of the show, and the film almost makes no justice. Sure, I saw worse movies, but it was incredibly disappointing. This movie would make a good episode of MST3K. The script was a terrible adaptation of the book, and he felt the actors read their lines instead of actually saying it. The figures were stiff and unmistakable. The effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake. The end was terrible. At first it was not the first book at all. Secondly, it did not make sense. If you did not read the book, you would not even know what was going on. It must have been the most sweet, film student ending I've ever seen in the movie. I'm excited to have paid the money for this movie. If some miracle gets a massive release, they should do it completely and let Hollywood take over. These two young filmmakers and a handsome director should let filmmaking work for professionals.
