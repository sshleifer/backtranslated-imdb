It's one of those terrible, sex-driven B-movies that could not play anywhere near the theater. Women are dressed in dirty dressed "bunnies," an extremely fat woman is proud of many funny jokes and they all work in a dirty old man's restaurant with a sympathetic son (Jim Hanks, who is of course Tom's brother) whom the man wants to "lay" . Hanks is really good, but this movie goes nowhere and makes no sense. One must wonder why it was even done? Still, due to Hank's performance and several funny moments (but no more than a few), he earned the star "2" out of 10. I think I was nice.
