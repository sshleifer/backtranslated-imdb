I'll be honest, it's one of the worst movies ever. If not, then it's very close. Have you ever seen a bad teen solo opera? That's like one of them. Except for the worse. For example: (maybe LAST SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. Guy: Everything we need is here. Girl: But I want to take somewhere else. </ br /> <br /> Guy: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... The sequel to this line has sex. Music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you read the EVER book, avoid this movie as a plague. It completely changes personality of characters and events. They also get rid of things. Also, the movie ends in about the end of the book. It's AWFUL. So if you did not read the book, do not look at it. If you read the book, please drink it (movie). If you like silly teen soap operas that are inferior to your average teen soap opera, go for it. Then again, should we expect anything other than MTV?
