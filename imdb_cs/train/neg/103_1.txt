Brad Sykes, without wanting to be a killer, is responsible for at least the two darkest and cliché films I've ever seen - that's one of them, and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> Actor is horrible, the press is gruff and everything about this movie screaming "Seriously, you can better deal yourself". Maybe it's a challenge for everyone to match youtube with our own zombie-related bullshit? I bought it for £ 1, but do not forget you can not afford the price for 71 minutes of your life. You will be able to avoid this turkey well, even at the advantageous price of the basement.
