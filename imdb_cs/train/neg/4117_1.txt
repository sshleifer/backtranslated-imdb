Two days after I saw this thing, I'm still in agony over seeing her. It's so bad, you have to wonder how anyone can write this trick, much less let it be free in public. Started acting, a leading man who seems to be helpful, and Alison Eastwood are worried. This action testifies to the creation of low-budget films, which means it is painfully bad. Plot? Well, if you were six, you could write this movie. Simplified, idealistic and simply lame.
