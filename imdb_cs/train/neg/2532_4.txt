The Cult of Personality brought up the positions of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. As King B. Since the people of Crown International were so important they were not brought to a state they deserve. A movie like VAN can now look like a one-time Drive-in esoteria band, but it was a big hit when it was released (not to mention the subsequent re-release as a double feature with other Crown hits). <br /> <br /> VAN was a perfect example of Crown's strategy, which at the time of the film's release caught the mood of filmmakers. This was sex, drugs, rock'n roll and short "Custom Van". As others have remarked, it is ironic that the "hit" song in the movie refers to Chevy when the title vehicle is Dodge in the movie itself. I had the town of Selectman, where I was at a time when I even said that these supplies are "dunes of sin on wheels!" Perfect advertising line for the movie!

In many respects, it does not like the old Party Party films of the 1960s, but now it is spiced with nudity and drug use. Obviously, on a limited budget and limited schedule, the coastal film lengthily pleasant with a breezy spell that offsets some, according to today's standards, certainly the non-PC views of women. A classic touch is a toaster for Bobby's day of sin on wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you got something hot for this munchie! Grindhouse Fest.
