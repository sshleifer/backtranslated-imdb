Chief School Chief (Keenan Wynn) with a loss-making basketball team inadvertently hires a coach who turns out to be not just a beautiful blonde (Cathy Lee Crosby) but a catalyst for their new winning trips. Are you really surprised? Between the novel and the team-star star Jack (Michael Biehn), the road grows. The police will never report. <br /> <br /> Packaged along with other pictures of Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie really makes this film no service. It can be easily edited into a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as coach Randy Rawlings, especially in her modest suits, but I was expecting more than just the filth of a movie rating R. A side plot involving Dorky, his teammates hypnotized into thinking he is a former NBA player, Sydney Wicks, is the real reason for the team's new success, rather than Cathy Lee's coaching. Too much teasing and lack of suffering makes this a great disappointment.
