The first episode set the bar quite high, I thought. It played William Hurt as a hit-man who is contractually killed toymaker. We get little information about his character or who is paying him for killing, really the episode is remarkable because he has no dialogue at all. Upon returning to his modernist penthouse, he receives a package containing soldiers with toys, which gives him a smile, but he rejects it and it is his business. But he is hell at night, the soldiers are alive and are going to wage war, drive jeeps, shoot machine guns and bazooka, and even flying helicopters! Special effects are good for TV shows and become quite tense when he escapes the whole apartment with his wits to survive, sometimes getting into the upper hand and sometimes not. I do not use the end, but just say it was a smart little procedure. That gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all trash and I lost the fourth. Stephen King's adapters are always a shuffled bag and are no exception
