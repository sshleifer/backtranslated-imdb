This film shows a clip of mutilation of live animals of an animal with a hacked machete and the extraction of his skin torn. I know these horrible things happened in the world, but Im watching movies based on the fact that what Im observation is not actually going on the screen. These live clips of animals are not meant to be in movies, to show people who belong to certain organizations to help scary things that people are doing other kinds. This should be banned and destroyed. I also turned to Netflix and other sources to work on making this movie out of the market! <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from the public. The person who shot the film needs psychological help.
