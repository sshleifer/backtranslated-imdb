I can say without shadowing doubt that Going Overboard is the worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, a comedian who works on a cruise ship. This is a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's all in place like a mad breakfast, and not a crazy bare gun but rather frustrating, "throws both shoes a bit, even General Noriega appears, for whatever reason I can not understand it was not humor.) Add to the mix Miss Australia, which has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have something I will not call the worst movie ever to make, because crossing the deck does not even match the basic definition of the movie. because it will raise the status of any bad movie you've ever seen, and I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing the bad movie "at least not as bad as Going Overboard."
