It's not bad, but not a big heist movie. Kirk Douglas is recently released from a safe, who, after refusing the offer from Mob, decides to call himself. He attends circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Theft follows. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves in pursuit of the mafia gouache Romano Pupp, just as they get involved in a really fucking love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps pace fast and there is at least one excellent and creative vehicle tracking sequence including Puppo & Gemma. Although Italian production, most of the shooting seems to have been made in Germany. Douglas is all right, not just falling in Giallo quickie. Stunning Bolkan gives amazing performance. Music is Ennio Morricone, and cinematography is a great Tonino Delli Colli, who has worked with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
