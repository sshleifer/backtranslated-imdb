I'm a fan of the previous movie Best of the Best Movies. But this was terrible. No wonder I found it so hard. I tried four video rental stores until I found one copy of this movie. The game was terrible, the conspiracy was a joke, and the action was also bad. I really miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the original kickboxing characters and the theme that this movie had with the first 2 films. <br /> <br /> John
