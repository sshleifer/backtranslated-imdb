It's first interesting. The naive park referent (Colin Firth) married a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) she has known for a short time. They seem happy, then disappear without warning. She searches for her and after several dead ends she encounters some of her abused childhood and a careless recent past, which may include crime. And then it seems the creators did not know what to do with the story. Beginning, though not as exciting as it sounds, is at least observable. It then stops being interesting or even meaningful. And the end is so feeble, so dark, so without any excitement or intelligence, you think the writers did not know what to do and that they were bored. What a nasty loss of good idea!
