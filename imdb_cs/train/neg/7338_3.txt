I watched this movie by hoping to find a nice and interesting story, but the story line was not all right. The play from the actors was nothing better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shahrukh Khan was not there, it was not enough to make this movie "trusted" and interesting. "I read that this film was based on Flaubert's novel" Madame Bovary, "but for me I did not see it fit with the Indian mentality, and we generally buy the film, a good time so we do not waste time and do not change the mood. it could have been such a "high" vote at an average of 6.8 / 10. So it's a kind of movie that you should escape and ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it! You just waste your time if you do not like a "dark movie" strange and incoherent story ".
