This film reminded me so much of the "History of Violence," which pretended to be a narrow study of violence and violent behavior, but eventually ended only because it was nothing but a cheap action movie that is hiding like a thought film about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride moved to a small English city and met with endless harassment from local drunks who hang around the pub all day long and are having trouble. Did these men work? Dustin takes everything he can take, and keeps the film in his house at the end of the film and fights against any of the drunken assailants with such terrible means as boiling whiskey pours on someone, his feet are thrown by a shotgun, and some of the heads trapped in a bear trap. Funny that someone would need such a big bear trap in a small British town, except that he'd put a man's head in it. Sam Peckinpah, who made the "Wild Bunch," which also included the theme of bloodshed by violence in which no one was spared. But it was done stylishly and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not credible. First is the wrong location and it does not work. Why is he in England? I think perhaps in some inner city or in a small town on the American South in the 1930s or so. Secondly, it is not, in my opinion, ever clearly explained why these men are so violently violent, except that they are drunk and feel the need to kill a hoffman and rape his wife. Sam Peckinpah missed a mark on this.
