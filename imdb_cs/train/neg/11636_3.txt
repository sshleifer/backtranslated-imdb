I will not waste my time by writing an essay and losing time. However, I would like to say that all those who are honest about this film are absolutely ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can not play the card, and I think the patriotic card of nationalism so people do not see this movie. this is a movie that expresses free will in this country (oh that I played this card), although the director is German and deserves a wrist knock every time he gets to the camera but the world is full of controversy and the same thing you are heard earlier, such as controversy by GTA. It's a comedy, laugh and disgusted, not all disgusted, its dark humor and of course you do not have the heart to take it, the past is past, yes people remember those who were lost, but it's time to go that it was !! ! 7 !!! years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Besides being a fool and who needs a soul?
