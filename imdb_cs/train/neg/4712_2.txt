This show is perhaps the biggest, worst, most generic steam stack I've seen in kids programming that has really become a success. The lead figure, Johnny, though I understand he is to be an ordinary child, is not pleasant or even acceptable. Jokes are fragile, exaggerated (that is, "they did not see what was coming," but it was not funny for the first time, it's not even cute) and it lacks any form of primitive joke or inspiration. And finally ... it's just ugly to look at it. While children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eyewashes. I can not stop at the show, because art is just ... rough. Hidden, in fact. Just a fool. <br /> <br /> I can not stand that it's getting so much broadcast time. While I understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and I should not get the chance to come back ... I really miss old cartoons. Return the Dexter Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls ... something different than this bullshit. I think it's just a pensive thought. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you not to waste time on this show. I believe that even the big kids can look forward to really good cartoons. And that does not cut it.
