This romantic adventure seemed shocking subversive today. A rich upper class English woman misses, interprets and manipulates everyone around for their own satisfaction. She uses a privileged position to embark on secret activities of a definitely anti-social kind. There is a clever change in the roles of sex, because her activities prove it by being more bold and lively than most male figures. But of course he is a tall, dark and handsome stranger who keeps a loving interest, and this evil lady is not going forward when he meets the right man. any other character makes a conspiracy in the extreme unconvincing, but those who yearn for Romance will overlook it.
