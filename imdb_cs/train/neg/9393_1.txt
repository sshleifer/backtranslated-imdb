Really, really, absolutely, grimly, terribly. But actor Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger) frees himself as an actor. It's the only one. <br /> <br /> Rare handling, for five minutes if you want to illuminate the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, Southern California as a "moon" (over and over) and that it can be a spoof. . . except that it is clear that it is not - there is no humor, except unintentional. The dialogue may be worse than any other aspect and costume. . . well, enough. Conspiracy? What plot? The Thief (well, the head of the bad guy) and his henchmen, including his terrestrial agent called Krog (listen closely or suspect it is a spoof in the name of McDonald's Ray Kroc founder) and his incredibly awkward shooters (but weapons they never need as well as Commando Cody, so there are plenty of fire fighting) <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
