Just a stupid old movie. Stanwyck's first son got his foot trapped in the depths, and then her husband got into his feet trapped in another really silly way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck is unlucky, and he meets the escaped convict again. He has a chance to kill him, but he fails very stupidly. Finally, her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us what a stupid message to the film is. Everything is good than the end of the stupid. I could never figure out how an unconscious woman like Stanwyck sometimes did it as a front lady in the Golden Age Golden Age of Hollywood; that nose is so beautiful? So photogenic? The film is mercifully short and runs for over an hour. It's as if the director felt he was bullshit, so he thought it best to prevent it.
