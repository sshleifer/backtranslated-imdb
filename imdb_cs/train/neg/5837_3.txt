I can not say I liked this movie very much. He has some fun moments, but he does not seem to be able to think if it's comedy or drama. It really does not work like either.it is too light in the tone is drama and fun moments are little and far between. it also does not give much sense.things seems to happen without reason. and it is also extremely complicated. I feel like they just did things When they managed to explain things, it could be a better movie. I would say the end was against the climate, but it would mean that the rest of the film really was building on something that did not do it. It simply ends, and that's it. I did not find it boring, really, but as I said, there is simply no point. I'll give Winter Kills reluctant and weak 3/10
