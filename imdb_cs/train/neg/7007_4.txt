That's a pretty bad movie. The story is sentimental. I suppose the production values ​​are fine, fair shooting, unobtrusive direction and all. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never cared much about it and this film confirms this perception. No wonder he never had a career next to his Star Wars movies. Just say "Buh-bye, Mark" when he sinks into a deserved mystery. On the other hand, the very young Annie Potts completely stole the show. She showed magic, beauty, and actress in one performance. I remember seeing her recently in "Texasville" and taking note of her beauty. It's interesting to see it ten years ago. Anyway, if you're not interested in Miss Potts, get out of this movie screaming on the hills.
