This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years! You could accidentally pull 5 people out of the streets and they could work better in this movie than anyone else. Absolute loss of tracking time. I only give 2, because I like bloody movies, but it's just waste. Actor (and I use this expression very freely) is scary, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were their first film at all? Do not waste time tracking it. The Hostel was somehow a better movie. I can not believe that someone has spent money on it, I hope it costs only $ 50,000 for the producers to do it - it looks like a school project that makes babies who have no idea. Did it even make it to the cinema?
