I miss something? This "adaptation" has everything Brookmyres has got for his first novel. Everything except story, laugh, black humor, political intrigue, features, conspiracy and some sign of meaning. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from the beginning to ending. They made a mockery of the conspiracy, they had romance between Parablane and the policeman, and what was all about, Dr. Slaughter was portrayed as a viewer and who the hell would Annette Crosby be? /> They seemed to have made a three-hour adaptation, then chopped it for 90 minutes. (Although 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please do not do any other Brookmy book (especially "The Earth of the Blind").
