If I could rate this movie 0, I should have it! I see some ppl in IMDb says it's the funniest movie of the year, etc. Atd. I apologize? Are you ppl sipping LSD or ........? In this movie there is absolutely no fun N O T H I N G! Actually, I want 27 minutes of my life to spend watching this crap. <br /> <br /> I read someone who was sitting on the airplane and watched the movie stop watching after 30 minutes, I fully realized that I would actually watch snakes on the plane twice instead of watching this movie once! Do not watch this movie, do something else useful with your life, prepare meals, go for a dog, hell ... nothing is better than spending time watching TV and watching hot stick.
