It was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately it was not. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible actor - is totally incapable of conveying the great charism Biko had. Attenborough's big crowd scene is ridiculous. The Soweto Massacre was not like this, the three clean lines of the kids (some doing cartwheels!) They happily marched into soldiers' weapons. With Bikem, the dead movie quickly descended into a farce. If the fight against Apartheid was something, it was the fight of black people, but we should all be grasped by the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko is important while he was not. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire, and she does not seem to realize she is in South Africa at all. at all. A wooden family dog ​​gets more rows than a black virgin. When the family escapes, the women I've seen with the movie - by the way, one of only about a dozen black people in a big, full-length cinema - whispered, "It's like music." She had the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a film about a good, somewhat awkward white liberal about a radical black fight. Indeed, South Africa needs well-planned white liberals as if it needed a hole in the head.
