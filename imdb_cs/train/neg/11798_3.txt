For a long time, I watched Phat Beach on the cable and enjoyed it a little. The fat boy is the best figure because he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the figure are just different stereotypes of young men and young blacks. I like to look at these low-budget movies that capture a certain period of time because they are almost like a documentary on attitudes and fashion trends of the year. Phat Beach is also funny, because the low-cost children in this movie are strictly domestic girls. Most low budget movies have the quality of a "local babe" and you can say that kids in this movie are local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite in the bikini that it was fun to watch the "youngsters" go wild over what was actually a really over-excited sketch with a mile mile high. There were also some cuties. This is the magic of these low-budget, horrific movies. You will see lots of dogs and some real cuties! I checked some of them on IMDb, and seven years later, Phat Beach is the only credit. Very bad. It would be interesting if somebody ever managed to make a book "Where are they now" on all the cuties that appeared in the history of the movies and then never come back. What happened?? There are about one or two young people in almost every movie that seems to have a lot to go for them and even years later when you see the movie again on TV wondering "what ever happened to X?" In any case, this film mostly blows but has several fun moments.
