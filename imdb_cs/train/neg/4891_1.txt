I want to clarify a few things. I am not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai and I am very familiar with the art cinema; I grew up in the seventies of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Artistic films were really artistic; such as colors. People did it to express their inner feelings, and they were not seriously afraid if other people understood something. They were out of business value; just look at some old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you will understand. Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It's an opportunistic film that fools festival judges and critics, plays a lot of things without saying anything. The story does not make sense. The lack of water leads the government to support the use of watermelons for hydration. A desperate girl, stealing water from public toilets. There is also a porn star (soused) who is trying to make a film with an actress who does not seem to feel well. There was a romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The mess ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked, but I think it's less provocative than you can see in the American Pie or the history of violence. The two main characters never talk. Sometimes the style of musical number 60 appears and explains (through the song) what is happening in characteristic minds. These video clips are really welcome, because the previous scene, without dialogue or music, just the people who look at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which is too much in the movie. <br /> <br /> There are also several bits of "Difficult Sex Without Love", "Selfish Mind of Porn Industry". <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this film intended (get away) to fool the festival jury and critics. It has several pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwanese censorship), and many items are open, but nothing is closed or done anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks received a film of several (controversial) important awards at film festivals, and the film gained undue commercial success (I see a movie in France and the theater was full of). <br /> <br /> Please do not be fooled. There is nothing new in this movie, original, or even originally spoken or filmed. It's boring and empty; actually deceiving the public. Boogie Nights (which I did not like), intimacy and 9 songs are much better movies.
