I really have problems evaluating this movie. It's brilliantly controlled, of course there's plenty of money. Gere and Danes are intense (although her personality on the screen could be a bit more limited and foaming), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of those truly ill-humorous films where one can not help, but he wondered if the director himself would like to present a specific scene, and yes, one can not wonder how many copycat the film will inspire. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a purely artistic conception, it's 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a film ....
