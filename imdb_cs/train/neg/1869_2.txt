Murder veteran Bruno Mattei is back with this erotic thriller, which clearly reflected 8MM Joel Schumacher. But as expected, Mattei makes his film a tiny budget - so he looks a little obsessively when he's released. After kidnapping the daughter, her mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that manages the tobacco snuff until the exclusive clients pay well. The search for her daughter leads not only to a mother across Europe, but also to prostitution. He goes to bed with boys to get his tracks. When he finally comes into contact with the organization of the saucer led by mysterious Doctor Hades, he gets threatened by himself. <br /> <br /> This is not very good, even if it starts promising. The problem is that the film is far from as dirty or explicit as one could expect from a director who made movies like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) Is not cruel enough nor does it contain a lot of nudity and sex that really keep the viewer's attention. This is not so extraordinary, except for surprisingly many different locations throughout Europe. The end is a great disappointment. Also, acting is not remarkable, with the exception of Anita Auer, who plays Dr. Hades: She looks and acts extremely horribly. You do not want to meet her like this in a dark aisle (or in your bedroom). Overall, SNUFF TRAP only appeals to film collectors Bruno Mattei. But it's good to see men again on the rudder: it was his first thriller since 1994 giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
