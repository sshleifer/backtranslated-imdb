I read a book and the book was fascinating. The film, that is the direction, the script, and the acting were absolutely unbearable. I scrambled for lack of a script that could not follow a novel, a novel that had all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate the temerity of a big story based on reality. <br /> <br /> I see why this movie was not open to the general public in most cities. I would never recommend this film to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply, one of the worst adaptations I've seen has turned into a conspiracy, less exploring the sky on earth. Cinematography was the only culmination. But how could it fail when filming in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> To the potential viewers, do not waste time or energy on this flop.
