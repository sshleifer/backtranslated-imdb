Weak conspiracy, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. Just as a writer (also one of the stars?) He fictionalized his own outages and added untrustworthy fantasies of drugs and murders to become "hot". From the predictable rap and home soundtrack to family conflicts, it is badly eleven, stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title was previously performed - IMDb lists five films with the same title released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: You've noticed it on Showtime, which shows a synopsis for some of the other movies. She was halfway before I realized no one was a secret police. Even another stereotype would wonder if it happened.
