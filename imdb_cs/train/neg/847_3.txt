The film is about two brothers who are supposed to be the same - but they do not expect them to be smart - one is a surgeon and others are able to write a computer code. Genius, who like to call it, which is very exaggerated, if you compare it with personal qualities, you can perceive the title material. I honestly did not like the style of the movie. I believe the anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are for some purpose, but what I do not have is why there is so much. The film is inexpensive on the scenes and tells the story essentially without a human aspect in it at all. It makes the comic book an experience. However it is visually annoying the viewer, it somehow brings him to Blues with short dialogues, monotone scenes, dynamic cut, music and sudden sounds. The story of the film is very simple, most of what is happening is dramatically displayed in long minutes, mostly in a confusing delirium simulating the effects of drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I will say openly that this film did not meet my expedition a bit.
