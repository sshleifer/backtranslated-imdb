I just rented (yes, I paid the money to see!) This movie. FOR GOD. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. How the other review, Mrs. Colagrande, said, from the movies, please! Please, never stand up or appear in another movie! The lady has a cantalup charisma. No, it's not fair with a cantaloupe that probably will have more. He does not know how to act; she has a disgusted view all the time (she reminded me of her always disgusting young sisters-in-law from Europe). Not charming; she is not pretty. There is no real story. And adjustments! It was not what I could see! It's bad when you look at the movie and just to get over it, you press the "forward" button on the remote control and nothing happens! I think ... ... I kept shouting, "Cut! Cut!" What do you think? Well, of course, they thought they would make the film together and get a PAID to love on the screen! Pretty good agreement for them; very nice solution for the viewer! I think I'm going out now ...
