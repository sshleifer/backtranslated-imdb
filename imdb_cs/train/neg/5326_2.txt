"Smithereens" is such a worthless film that hangs right between the cable channels that occupy the public library as a merry novel. An insignificant trick and first effort for average director Seidelman, the film is full of bad acting, bad sound, bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many better movies never make it to the market and why junk movies like this and never seem to have left is one of the great secrets of life. (D-)
