I chose this DVD at the Dollar Store. The DVD was on $ 2 for $ 1, but because he had Michael Madsen, I thought that when I never saw the movie, I bought him the same. I have to say no like a movie. The film was more like a document or a publicity about religion than anything else. I find that the director used flashbacky for me. I would rather see the story line in chronological order. I will not throw him out as one of the other commentators, but maybe it will be relatively soon before I think again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, because it was Michael Madsen's film debut, maybe it could have some archival value in the future.
