Hands for the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would do the last action hero, but that's easy. The film is about three separate guys who meet on Sunday and discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. The fourth man - who is married and - who was part of the group, appears and talks about what he does with his wife. Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
