Ben a policeman outside the city is convinced that his sister has been brutally killed and wants to bring her murderer to justice, but he is addressing Stefan, who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, the best nurse and Stefan, are traveling to Transylvania to end this evil. This is incredibly horrible class B stuff and I was wondering how it got. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What did Christopher Lee think, because this must be his worst performance I've seen. It was really bad with this real left-click movie that moved from the real musical and wooden performances by Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not forgetting Lee), cheesy fashion (the sun), cheap and chrome special effects, bad lighting, humor ... if there was any, (some of the film concentrates only on some unknown play), the werewolf has an orgy, a sight that is seen and a difficult story with a flat and annoying conversation. I thought if it was so bad, it would be horribly fun, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positives were the placement and setting of the movie looked great, but that's about it ... actually, I'm going to add Sybil Danning a short scene scenario too. <br /> <br /> During the end of the band the band plays their crap-house song during the weird assembly of the scene from the movie that I raised the question why? A terrible piece of mess, but it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
