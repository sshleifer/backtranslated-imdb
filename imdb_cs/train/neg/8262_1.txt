This is really horrible: painfully irritating stylized artists are grinning and potted grid-like incoherent dialogues that take place in scenes that seem to be insignificant, without a beginning, middle or end, which are solved without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention, all in some uninteresting and almost undetectable "story" service. Worrying the film demands for "style": Suddenly a crane with a remote control fired spirals downwards and without obvious reasons, sudden whipping cuts or sections with a beatwheel appear: this "style" serves only to magnify the almost incredibly huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive emptiness of the material . Definitely a candidate for the worst film he ever did.
