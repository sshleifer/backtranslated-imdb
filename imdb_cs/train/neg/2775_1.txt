It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. No really. I am not joking. All "based on true story / historical links" aside, there is no excuse for such a bad deal. It's a shame because, as others were sending, sets and costumes were great. The soundtrack was typical "Asian" style music, although I could not find out where "modern" when Fernando lay in bed, he was thinking about Mary. I do not know who wrote and sang the beautiful song, but it was as if Norah Jones had been transported to 1500. Hershey's syrup blood in Phych was more realistic than the Kwik-n-EZ battle scene. But acting. Oh, so painfully sad. Lines shipped as bad junior high play. If Gary Stretch dressed potato costume at County 4H, he could be more credible. At the end it sounded more like a little street criminals. Sometimes I expected him to cry "Adrian!" or even "Do you want me?". Favorite line: When the queen says to her lover (after shooting on the floor), "I'll have a baby." Does "Child?" I expected him to answer "No, bastard, chair in a chair!"
