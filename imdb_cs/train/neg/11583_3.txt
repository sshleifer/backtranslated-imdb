This film features a whole host of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so. None of them causes any interest or positive reaction. I was waiting for intrigue to start, I hope things get better and end up in the hot end, but it was not a reward. <br /> <br /> If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me, the action is not worth it. Not that this story was so bad, I think you might say I have a problem with the script - that is. I thought it was terrible. The view of the credits will show you that there are heavily occupied occupations that they do not need. Most old professionals in this movie are doing good work; actors I did not see much before I really liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's all I like about this picture.
