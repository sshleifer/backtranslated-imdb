This post is certainly interesting for a series of fans (like me), but it is mostly incomprehensible. The story is confusing as well as the continuity of the sequel. Some amazing effects, of course, but we never know what it all really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the version of "NC-17" that contains a gore that has been cut out to re-evaluate "R".
