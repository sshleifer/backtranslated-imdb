I do not understand why filmmakers are transforming this movie. <br /> <br /> The film from 1972 with McQueen and McGraw is almost classical. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor, and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his game. Also, the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But remake has no action! It is almost boring despite the fact that film production was more difficult in 1972 than in 1994. I do not understand how Baldwin was imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. So I do not think it was necessary, or when they choose to take classics, they have to choose an excellent actor for the first role, such as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
