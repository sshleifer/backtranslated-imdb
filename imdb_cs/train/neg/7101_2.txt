I would like to give this movie a zero of ten, but I will give him two. The reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the movie, which is no reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes Kamal smiles. I love Rani very much and I respect her that she is a great actress. That's why I did not love her in this movie, but I liked Kamal, but his big problem. Anyway, a lot of sleep scenes that make sense of this film allow you to really talk about this movie. It's good or bad, I think it's just a garbage film that yawns to me. I'm a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my name, I have a great taste. The movie is not fun, there is one thing and if it's about to be hard to beat the cinema, why there's no morality in this movie. His biased film is not a true story and it smells. Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, you can not kiss so well.
