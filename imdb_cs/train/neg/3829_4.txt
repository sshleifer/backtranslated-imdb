The murderous flaming robber near Yumy smashes his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as the hidden gold stash that remains hidden through the screenwriter). An attempt to bring a genuine Western genre in the form of violence and brutality in the 1970s is not even in the same league as some of the newly clouded Westerns that came out of the late 1960s. They are incredibly simple and square, with female figures that are just as small bags and possible victims of rape. As a former sheriff back in the headquarters, Charlton Heston gives one of his most famous, least inspired performances at all (he has one good moment, trying to read the letter and look at his glasses). James Coburn, like a half-crazy half, is pretty much a self-pilot, but Coburn has a way to turn the worst dialogue and the situation into something prickly and disturbing. It's his show all the way. * 1/2 from ****
