Where are the cannibals? Those interested in the name and "true cannibal" approach of this film will be destroyed. Instead, we managed to show a strange man and his again visit the village of Papua New Guinea full of natives, one of whom was his lover decades ago. The man, Tobias Schneebaum is New York Jewish when they come and somehow intermingle with a documentary as he appears in his yammy in several scenes. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals: just stories, some natives and Tobias alone. Not all bad movie together. Very interesting and great cinematography. Schneebaum remains very sympathetic and gives us a fascinating insight into a life that is about as far away from Western civilization as it can be. It's not just what they say is on the packaging and on the plot. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
