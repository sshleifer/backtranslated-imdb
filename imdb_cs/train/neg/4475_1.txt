terrible, terrible! my old peaceful friend was looking at this unintended thing, and it made me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people will never know what it really is like because their first impressions are from such a dribble. they have changed so much that they are hardly recognizable. which hinders me since the book reads just like a soap opera that provides enough food for modern entertainment. it's like one of those life movies that they call "based on a true story," but they're completely fictional. there is no emotion or depth of the book, just a soulless melodrama. if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I recommend trying a different version.
