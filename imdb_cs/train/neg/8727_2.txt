Let me begin by saying that I can enjoy some bad Italian horror film or a fake explosion of the 1970s jungle. Seriously. This was terrible. There are too many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them works (except for what's happening in the wilderness) very well. But there are some ignorant westerners who have built a jungle resort somewhere. I do not even remember where it happens ... how sad it is ... Essentially people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its "ceremonies, but eventually upset the" Alligator God "of the river, which then goes on to bite, kills holidaymakers and some tribes as well Does it sound good Yeah Well, do not get your hopes There's a minimum of violence to the end, the special effects are so bad that it was kind of a nursery school that did them and a love story , there is a lot of scenes where there seems to be a camera shot underwater in the pool and throw an alligator toy like an arrow in the water and it's gator attack I'm not kidding In another amazingly special effect the Matchbox is focused to an incredibly shy plastic gator that is suddenly five times bigger than a van. (A few minutes ago, he was just big enough to eat a man, but now he is dying The only thing I could remember, where the effects were so bad that I was out of this story, was the masterpiece of Bruno Mattei, the "rat" what with plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all those who could not be scared. /> <br /> Under normal circumstances, I would say something that Sergio Martino was solid, but it must be. Lose time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + label from No Shame. This is SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
