I'm sorry, but besides Kim Basinger who does a good job of fear, it was one of the worst thrillers I've ever seen. Logic is thrown out because 4 young boys terrorize this woman out of a crowded shopping mall and then shoot a security guard. It seems, however, that no one notices. Then instead of shouting for help or racing back to the department store, she leaves and ends in the middle of the forest with boys who are in hot pursuit. I can not even describe how stupid she sees as this woman has escaped from four retarded heroines, carrying a red set of implements, screaming for God to help her, and then playing with one of them after the sexual killing of others. Please believe me, it's bad and a little tasteless.
