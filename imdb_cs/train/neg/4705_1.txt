My favorite memory of this show and band was when I met a group of my friends who were hateful NBB and had a great fire and we took a CD with their songs and a DVD movie and a bunch of band members and threw them into the fire and danced happy equipment around burning material while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead". That was the best thing on the show and this show is stupid with God's band that this show is upset. I hate it so much. Get rid of a miserable car. You guys are really coughing! You really destroyed the whole channel! No misdemeanor or anything other than you, you have to get life, I mean, really, who makes a silly show with a silly leading singer who can not even sing! You really sound terrible, and you need life like a hobos or something other than Roseline. It's really nice. Yet, the boys react!
