Spoilers? Perhaps a few details, but nothing to do with conspiracy. No, as if it depended on this movie. <br /> <br /> Air rage is obviously tearing away from the prerequisites for mid-flight infiltration. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" comanders who wear sackcloths that we can only imagine that they have to hide the invisible body of the armor because their idiot tactics (similar to what the third grader uses when playing Star Wars on the pitch) hail shooting. <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed most about this movie was the use of actors of similar appearance. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who used to be in the movie you really liked, although it was so long ago that you would probably not be able to put it (that was Porky). Here Cyril plays a decent reflection of character Bill Paxton. Most of the fun is Gilberd, who is so fat you will never know him as the creator of Buck Rogers. Instead of evoking his slightly heroic character, Gerard gives us a satisfying performance of a crisp, fat, hard man who was clearly introduced to John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid look like Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. Ten years after New Jack City, Ice-T's performance was greatly aggravated. It does not work as much as regurgitation of lines that you could really remember. <br /> <br /> One of the items in this movie is a CD-ROM with classified information. It is a hand carried, and it is apparently and incredibly unencrypted, although the security aura of Gerard's NSA character. That's a joke. I have serious doubts that the information that is supposed to appear on the CD will all even be gathered in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Although it is in silenced aircraft in closed aircraft, shooting is about as loud as the canning air, and causes a person to pluck, so apparently no budget foley. Selection of selected weapons is quite funny. Using a coffee machine is the most realistic view of violence in the movie. When intuitively looking at the mini-Uzi pistol, which must be one of the worst pistol samples at all, it's simply stupid. A true elite team would have MP-5s for this type of thing, or perhaps SOCOMM .45s, or even tailored Hi- Powers if they were a really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if the new school ... Lame-o standard problem 92Fs they are absolutely incredible because after Lethal Weapon I lost most of my cool. Thieves, allegedly experienced soldiers of fortunes, have a mixed absurdity like the above-mentioned mini-Uzi gun and Tec-9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extension, which is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> It was a touch of realism to which I would like to fix the other reviewers: Aircraft and Ice-T reduced the craft to 10,000 feet in "breathable air" before opening the door. And I also have the impression that the flight attendant is NOT able to close the door that she was actually giving up at this moment. In terms of landing, there was no mention of the flaps within 2 seconds before touching. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only one of the dangers escaped by Roscoe P. Coltrane on the "passage" could make this film shameful with stock records. They apparently chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they could not get the F-117 stock. Apart from the fact that they were packed in 2001, let's just forget that the SR-71 is not a purely secret aircraft in the sense of B-2 and that at an empty point ... Well, I am no expert but I have doubts about it , whether Radar will be invisible. <br /> <br /> As others have emphasized, repeated references to "F-15s" when showing the F-16s were ridiculous. Details 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would have 747 passengers at the start, without mentioning all the others who would talk about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wires. <br /> <br /> Wow. What show. Catch him on the stars or something. Do not hire her to rent, but watch her laugh. In the dispute about the worst movie ever, right there with No Holds Barred, which had at least some originality.
