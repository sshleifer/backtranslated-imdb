Except for the better than average acting skills of both films, this film is really bad. Cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you would not really notice that the production values ​​are inexpensive unless they try to convince themselves that they have a production value at the beginning. Even for the crazy B-movie genre like me, this movie is really upset.
