I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I have not seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this film was a great disappointment. Participation of all parties was bad except for Mr. Lundgren, who was fine. Kata Dobo was something you're looking for, despite her ridiculous outfit and make-up. The plot is not at all smart, it's something that has been repeated in a million films in different films. The criminals were utterly stereotypical, and Lundgren's character had no depth in it. I never expected a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately it is not a decent event. Every corner of the plot is extremely predictable, and the incredible amount of surprise unrealism and comic character has been annoying me. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to young children, comic action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average voice of 7.0 with 6 votes had to be influenced by someone involved in making this film)
