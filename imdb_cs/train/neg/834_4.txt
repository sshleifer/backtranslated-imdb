I've found it to be a complete waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always has a lack of creativity in filming "just the video", but thinking about plotting the original movie with a "new perspective" is still low ... it will soon be just releasing original movies with new animations and new songs called " a new version of the movie we all love. " Nathan Lane surprisingly returned to the role of Timon. Timon and Pumbaa, an animated animal from the world of the original "Lion King," began telling us to tell us the original story as it really did ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah ... Music sequences are chaotic and animation is crap. Vocal talents are impressive for the video, but then again when you last remembered Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane, who are in any real commercial substance? Overall, if you like the original, you will hate it. It is offensive because it is unfair to both children and adults. And that summarizes it.
