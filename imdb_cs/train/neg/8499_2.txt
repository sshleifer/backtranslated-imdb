This is something that just excites movie eggs. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will let you know that the real Truffaut men do not watch. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting if Truffaut had something to say - here. The motif of the camera, like a voyeur, was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Bicicle Thief? Or something from Hitchcock? So all we get is the widespread metaphor of teenagers like Truffaut, who spends all his spare time "plucking his eyes" on movies that spoil discipline at school, accuses plagiarism (many small thefts), and eventually escapes social boundaries to create his own film. I'm sorry ... he was there, he did it too many times to make a difference.
