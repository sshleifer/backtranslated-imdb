This is a typical late film Universal Horror: its technically compatible, if by numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting. The most interesting part of this film is stunt Rondo Hatton, a person with bone disease as the "monster" of the film. It is sad to see the man abused, but he probably used the money he paid him. Hatton is less frightening than studio hopes, because I've felt more compassion over fear or even unbelievers. Martin Koslak is aboard a mad film artist and is very entertaining in this section. I for one enjoy Koslaka in anything; for some reason, the man enjoys me. The only other part of the film I enjoyed is the absurd appearance of the film in the art world. Here are the evil art critics who are reflected in their ability to break artists; it is next to each other with the man "hero" of the movie, who is the "artist" who paint ... get it ... pin up girls. Some work of our hero is reviewed side by side with the absurd statue of villana. Very funny is the main ugly critic of the film, who at one point says he despises the hero playing because "such women do not exist" to which our heroine responds with the certainty that the critic simply does not get enough. Finally, it is a bit subversive about the domestication of the heroine (which is artistic criticism) the leading man ... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to testify. Overall, this film is a rather average picture with several fun features.
