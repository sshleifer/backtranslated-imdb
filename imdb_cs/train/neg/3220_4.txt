I absolutely hate it when the film completely falls apart near the end after you invest in it. and that's what happened to this movie. I was impressed by her actors and the fact that Malamud wrote his source story. I did not want to read this story, but I can not imagine it ending like this movie. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see or rent it because it has a library. ohhhh such a loss of excellent acting (especially the wife was so perfect). but milo o'shea as a Jew? !!!! now it was funny. I did not have to examine it, but as a director he lost his balls or died three-quarters of a film. Before that moment, the story and characters evolved, there were plenty of neat land, and it was not too much time. but for the last half an hour - if it was not the worst, the most dangerous denomination I've ever witnessed, I do not know what it is. I just hate when such piety is so destroyed; it's a feeling of violence.
