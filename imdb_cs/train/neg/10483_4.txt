I saw this movie on a Western American flight. It was so bad that the flight seemed to look longer. The plot had the potential (who would not love a movie about a woman who accidentally killed every Elvis who he meets?) But he got a million times different in it, and it's really a bad writing. At the end, there's a badly bad scene where the gang of Elvis impersonators is on the casino's roof and pulls the sky and thinks they'll be back. Then a group of stars moves together to create the constellation "Elvis," which instantly shoots the lightning bolt at the impersonators and shakes the roof with the mission. Bad ... really bad. Which is the theme of the whole movie. I would avoid this at all costs.
