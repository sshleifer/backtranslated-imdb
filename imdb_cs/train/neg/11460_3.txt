A pretty funny piece that tries to show how smart the Orcas are, but so far (and they do not quite realize it) makes the audience feel stupid by making the most humorous movie. Richard Harris plays Quinta .. I'm sorry, it's bad, playing Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a livelihood, but is attracted by a big catch and trying to capture the killer. When the capture of a female killer gets into a bad state (do not ask), he's a friend (do not ask), goes to horror (do not ask) and starts STALKING Captain Nolan (Do not Ask). Captain Nolan soon realizes they have something in common (do not ask). Pretty wonderful filmmaking here. But I have to tell you that the beginning (with whales and nothing else) is pretty scary and the final credits (with the most crazy songs) are quite fun.
