"The Three Gifts of Daughter" are hearty sweet, pink-colored views of divorce, relapse, and life with one parent. It is obvious that social problems and economic difficulties do not have a place in the perfect life of a mother's mother who feels exhausted, going on a cruise, and then meeting with a girl's conductor. Even when the "Just His Movie" screenplay justifies the real-life scenario, "Daughters" suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs, children whose personality is not based on real children, and the leader of the band Hose Iturbi plays himself. Is not it bizarre that a real person would play in the movie in which their presumed real I got married? <br /> <br /> It is true that this film was released in the 1940s. Only love for the old style of romance and comedy in Hollywood can make the "Daughters" an acceptable movie.
