The beginning of this movie was good. It was really stupid to tell people he was going to kill. I think if I came out of a small town, I would be offended after this movie. They did a lot of people who looked stupid and crazy. How these people had so little to follow him all day. Many times, these people were telling him how to kill himself, as if urging him to do it. How can so many people have little respect for other people? I also think they could make a much better end of this movie. This movie was also a good part. Some people may like it, but I do not recommend it to anyone.
