Last night I saw the movie at home, but I thought it was too long before. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were too useless of the text to even have what I thought would be a comedy movie. The things in the movie are not funny: the bridegroom hitting my girlfriend and hitting. The movie was too long - he talked about wanting to go to sleep and wondered when it would end when you wake up and still play! Some of the things at the meeting were too large - like a lady singing - I felt I was almost looking at spiritual singing! come on Perry, you can do better!
