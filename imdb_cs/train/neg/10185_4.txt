On the way back in 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​the galaxy, far or near. He tried to finish a movie called THX, etc. This short is the reworked story of a particular George. I'm sorry it's just cuteness to defend. This is only promotional advertising for director, actor, et. al. It has little inner artistic value. It's a brochure. The guy playing George is very good, just like the Leia character and the ersatz Darth character. Everything else is common business debris. What a shame. Still, I have to do it, I think. The rest of the film is just treading the water to kill the time I think. only brochure.
