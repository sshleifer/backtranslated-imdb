I'm trying to introduce a pitch for Dark Angel. "I think, Matrix, I think, Bladerunner, I think the cat who plays Faith in an angel has a shiny black skin - or a chick like her, leave it with us, you do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget , just a few loud bangs and hot cats in glossy black skin that stretches on a big vibrating motorcycle. Fanboys dig a loud bang and hot chickens in shiny black skin, are not you? "<br /> <br /> Classic, shallow, terrible , sovereign, hopeless, boring, boring, stupid, without humor, intolerable, scarcely competent. Live anime action without any action, or even life. SF just as Joe Fanboy likes. :(
