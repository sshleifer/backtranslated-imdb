Geez, like a homosexual who lives in NYC, I can say with gratitude that I've never seen the glimpse of the Gay Culture that is portrayed in this movie - and I'm glad it! This film was broadcast on television across the United States that there would be a lot of resistance against Gays and I can not say that I would blame them. People from this film do not represent average homosexuals or even average Americans Trandgender, which is a complete and complete nightmare. The inclusion of seemingly minuscule characters is terrifying and obvious racist views (anti-white) are obvious and worrying - society can not be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and refusal to educate the "cast" of the film - these people's actions are not desperate rather, by rejecting everything that resembles personal ambition and willingness to make something out of my own self.
