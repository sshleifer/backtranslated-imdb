While 3-D animation (the top exhibition) did its job well, most other elements have fallen. It was as if the filmmakers thought "well, it will be 3-D, so we do not have to work so hard on the development of a plot or a character". And the fact that it's a child's movie is not entirely justifiable. The public is drawn to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) as well as three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that one of the main characters saw was a two-dimensional Scooter, which from time to time distorts the conspiracy with the urge to eat everything in sight. And an absolute kicker? Buzz Aldrin appears at the very end (following a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical personality in an hour and a half) coming to the screen and destroying every good time by calling the film's main character "contaminants" and announcing that the situation on the screen was really impossible. <br /> <br /> !!! ??? You just wanted to tell kids that Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not exist when you're on it?
