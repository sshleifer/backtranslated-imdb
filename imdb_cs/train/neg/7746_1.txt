Virtually every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget film falls into categories that have been classified for their predecessors, contemporaries, and those to follow. Bad special effects, faint storyline, ridiculous amount of blood and gore, unpleasant and unnecessary characters, all you can expect. The "Sabretooth Attack" is a new recreation center where owners are genetic engineers of Smilodon cats for attraction. Cats escape and start killing people, the guy who runs the show, wants to save them and do not warn them of unsuspecting visitors, and there is a group of visitors and some employees who revolt and plan to kill cats. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - The film is about average success with its budget. Sabretooths are rendered with a bad CGI. Surprisingly, however, cats look much more realistic than in longer, distant shots where CGI is better hidden. Their attacks are recklessly bloody and unpleasant. As you would expect, they attack, get rid of their hands and feet and leave very little behind. This is one of the reasons why the film will go down to the wrong place. <br /> <br /> The plot and characters are just as awful. We have some college kids who come to the island and plan to hunt the hum. And take it very, very seriously. Even so much that private property would be overcome, manipulate security systems and steal. Why are they so serious playing a simple game? Did I miss something? Was there money? Or were they sent to do it? I do not know, I could hardly watch the movie. But I thought they were doing it just because they were doing it. Still, it was too normal. <br /> <br /> "The attack of Sabretooth" is a very bad film. Even for sci-fi films with low budgets, it is a very poor and inexpensive example. It will have the majority of viewers on tears, it can be attractive for someone and will make you mix and laugh all the way. And keep in mind that it's not a comedy, it's a cheap movie horror, so it does not make it funny.
