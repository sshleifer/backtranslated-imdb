It's a real challenge to make a movie about the baby being swallowed up by wild dogs, and her mother is wrongly accused of murderous murder, but against everyone that can do it. Meryl Streep gives her the performance of her life, melodramatic, overcrowded, but with the comedy genius that astonishes you, even when the mother is struggling with the ultimate horror. If a comedy about infants eating dogs is not your cup of tea you may be uncomfortably watching this and yes, it is a special choice of theme for farce but really very little of the movie has to do with focusing on that Streep performs its Aussie accent and facial distortion. <br /> <br /> Throwing in a focus in media prejudice and sensation and ignoring either truth or ethics gives the film the opportunity to make a courageous point that those things are wrong.
