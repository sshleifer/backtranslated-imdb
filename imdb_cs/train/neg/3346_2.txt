Devil action movie in the capital Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one-time military man who retired. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body left him frustrated and decided to hang him up. Things are getting enough when, while watching a group of students in custody, some burglars take over school as an operational base for armored car robberies. His Dolph versus baddies in the fight for death. The cpe was thrown back into exploitation films from the late grindhouse, when bad guys dressed like punks, and some bad women had daylight. What stupid film. Traceable in the fact that I can not believe people like this is an action movie that was probably condemned to get in front of a low budget, fake chips, and the wrong course of action was even a glimpse of the eye of the producers. See how late in the movie as cars drive through the school (don? T ask) to hit the security tower (don? T ask because it looks more like a jail than high school) and break its barely constructed forms apart as in previous pictures). What are the gods of bad movies doing? Actually, I'm confused because this director, Sydney J Furie, a really good director who made films like The Boys in company C. Was his ability unsuccessful or was it hopeless to even bother? It's Turkey. Traceable, but Turkey.
