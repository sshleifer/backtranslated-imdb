This is just typical of Bruce Willis, action film schtick. Watch it with some popcorn and your buddies. Bring it to save money. <br /> <br /> None of them are realistic. Battles are not realistic. Soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why was Tom Skerritt talking with Willis from DECK OF CARRIER? What's wrong with that? Can not he make it out of the boat? Of course Bruce W. will get the wound to machete. There are a lot of average explosions. If this movie exactly represents the Navy SEALS, then do not get stuck in Africa and expecting you to come to rescue you! <br /> <br /> A noble attack on the village was the most troublesome of me. "Front line sits on ethnic cleansing" ... when Bruce looks at the defeat that's going on in the city. So what does she do? He crawls to the city on his stomach. Yes. How many people died when they leaned? Hi ... I had to count on my body. And if the African guy was so important, why did not he get into a helicopter with elders and kids? Can he say "Spirit?" <br /> <br /> Eventually the film was very dark. Not only in the conspiracy, but so much at night, it was hard to see what was going on. Lease.
