What a terrible movie. I like the creatures, but I could not even watch half of the horrific acting, cardboard characters and unfavorable special effects. There's nothing to be redeemed on this movie. Characters come from an infinite supply of suicidal silly cannon fodder, or are also empty, impenetrable puppet socks. Drawing is a formulation, cut and pasty, standard science-running amok. Even CGI is terrible. You know it's bad if you can not rely on the movie to provide some good eye candy. No surprises here, as old as old. This is really one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman should be hung from the lamp so that children can use it as a pinata.
