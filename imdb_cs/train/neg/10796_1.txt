This film proves that "commercial" cinema or Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason why this film should be produced except that someone expected success based on Shaquille's name. it's a bit more confusing than a knot. And what else? The screen is somewhat dark, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. / 10.
