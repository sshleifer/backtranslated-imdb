The video I saw later on the cable and I could not believe how bad it was. I usually like bad movies, but this was so exciting it was not fun. Some of the highlights of this film include absurd music that is constantly playing throughout the movie, hideous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun that turns into neon vegetables and instantly falls apart) and disgusting acting. In fact, acting is what I think steals. I did not recognize any of the actors in the movie and I hope I never have to see any of them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie (if you find it, I can not imagine a video-shop with this waste) just to learn how to appreciate quality movies after seeing this waste.
