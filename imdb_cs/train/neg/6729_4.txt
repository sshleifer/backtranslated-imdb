Of course, I like a lot of people, but I find it infantilistic and quite insulting that is saved from the forgetfulness of Jane Russell and two unforgettable musical numbers, especially with opening devices (but later a significant dive appeared). I do not get along with Monroe - she should play a blonde blonde who's not that stupid, but she's stupid. Russell can not quite convince himself when she says she was never in the gym, but she's somewhat gorgeous. Men are immensely immature as well as storyline. In any case, unintentional, but so innocent that if it is a classic, God will help us all.
