As others said, "No, Luciano" is a more appropriate title or response to this film title. For fun, a great opera singer should keep singing ... not that he was a terrible actor. It's just that he's stinking this movie. The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family film he was, but it was nothing but a dirty soap opera. <br /> <br /> The singer, Pavarotti, plays like "Giorgio Fini", loses his voice several times, and the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold), comes to rescue. The singer then falls to the doctor, the doctor slowly falls on the singer, they both argue all the time and then on and on and on. Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a nice guy. It's Harrold who's ruining things, and when I watched her, she's not surprised she did not become a star. <br /> <br /> There is a nice scenery in the movie where you can enjoy good pictures of San Francisco and Italy at least in the first half of the film. I was bored and I do not remember the other half.
