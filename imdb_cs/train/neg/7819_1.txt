... That would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, maybe with Boogeyman tied up. I was really horrible. <br /> <br /> I had little expectation and could not do it! I honestly can not think of one good thing. so here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. ACTING 2. PLOT 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. PLOT 5. DIALOG and finally .... 6 PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, they made a 2:32 hour movie, and then they realized that Lex and Superman had not joined the scene and were forced to settle in 3 minutes or thought that would nobody notice that the main hero and villains have less time on the screen than the son of Superman and the henchman he kills? Was half the budget spent to convince Kevin Spacey? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why do the doctors ask, "What do you want F *** to do?!" He's an alien! "We do not know Jack about his anatomy!"? <br /> <br /> What happened in 5 years Superman was gone to make technology for 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where did people who wrote good reviews watch the same movie? <br /> <br /> And finally, why? Why just? <br /> <br /> BTW, for those of you wondering how Superman could lift the whole continent of krypyonite, I think I came ... <br /> <br /> ... because superman is not influenced by kryptonite until he sees something green in the rocks, it's obviously everything in his head. that's why the continental thing is just his suppressing fear of shiny green rocks .... and either, or the writers are utterly hopeless, who did not think it was a fairly obvious mistake.
