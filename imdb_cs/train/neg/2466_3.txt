In recent years, there has been some fashion for films that often do not concern the zombie irony, as well as other incarnations of the media from the dead. "Fido" is a movie that is either an attempt at money, just his speech, or both - and falls directly into the category of ironic zombies. The joke is here to see a walking dead in a contrasting context of wider stereotypical, whisper-clear alternative history (we are the result of a great war of zombies and animals are now domesticated as slaves) versions of the suburbs of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> It's a slightly fun concept in itself and quite possibly for a five-minute comic sketch, but it can not stand alone. The joke that sluggish corpses for servants are incompatible with this idealized version of a small town repeats itself over and over and loses all its effectiveness. Soundtrack plays tireless melodies as the zombies cannibalize nearby audiences. The word "zombie" is constantly put into an otherwise familiar domestic direction for a cheap laugh. <br /> <br /> A very wide and artistic representation of "nineteen-year-olds" can not help here, but it irks me. It is a stylized, obviously "inspired" Pleasantville that it is more obvious that the wave of markers from the 1950s did not really change any significance that could have happened between 1950 and 1959. It is something that is inconveniently shocking about how if the film boasts deliciously and thoughtlessly the way they are more open, lower to earth and better than 2000. <br /> <br /> Because the characters are such a wide representation of pop-culture of the 1950s' types, it's hard to develop emotional investments into them. Each of them is wearing several distinctive features - Helen is obsessed, and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having to kill his father - but they remain quite two-dimensional. Performances within the limits of this bad writing are fine. Best is Billy Connolly as a Fido, who in the Frankenstein tradition of Boris Karloff really adds the nature and compassion to a green monster who can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are tiny pieces of endless allegory that defend themselves - commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoid, and so on, but none of that really works at a complex level and the creators really hold on to anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is really failing to treat the fragile joke "Look! Zombies in" Let the beaver! "" for a good hour and a half.
