The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressed movies. Ri'Chard is great. He was really filled with performance, and the girl who played his sister was really amazing and wonderful. I really thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw an IMDb profile. I can not say anything wrong about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. That's a bit too "real" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis to funny little tiffs in slaving battles. Eartha Kitt was so scary and after her character did what she had done. The film was destroyed for me; I could hardly stand to watch the rest of the performance. (sorry for ambiguity, but I do not want to give anything). I'm sorry, but it's not just my kind of show.
