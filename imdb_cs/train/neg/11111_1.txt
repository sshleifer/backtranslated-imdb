Do not bother to waste money on this movie. You do not even go to your car and you think you could see this movie if the others are not calling you. If you have to see this weekend, check back on Batman. <br /> <br /> The script was horrible. Perfectly written from a random horror format. Because of: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who can reveal all the traces that can not be associated with honest cops, and an innocent and too curious, yet beautiful and strong woman, with whom many viewers would like, if they could call their girlfriend. We mix together, add a lot of badly executed gore, and what the hell are we going to do, let's have some wonders to turn a bit to the plot. The game was terrible and the characters were incredible - Borat was more believable than this. *** Spoiler *** And can anyone please tell me how a butcher vest can do a bullet ricochet from a person after being shot without a person who was shot flinch ??? I'm in the army. We need such things for ourselves. <br /> <br /> One in ten and I would put it in the decimal places rounded to get as little value as possible.
