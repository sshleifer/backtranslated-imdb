Here's a list of good points and bad points for this review. I'll start bad. Bad points: Selection of casting (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), meeting the badly chosen cast, storyline, the idea of ​​filming the film in modern times, direction, editing, soundtrack and above all the whole idea of ​​making a feature film from a television series that was not so great with its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> One could make an analogy here. In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke raises the path to Michael Weston as Enos, he asks, "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" in her frowning judgment she tells her where they are. "Enos, is it a good movie?" The red bikini would mask his judgment of saying yes, even though he would say in the right mind, "No, not really." As good as she looked in bikinis, she could have been naked and would not even save that horrible piece of film. Become Hazzard!
