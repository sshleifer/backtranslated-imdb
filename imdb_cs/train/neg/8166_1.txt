I was looking for a copy of The Forest because I watched a special VH1, I think "where are they now" and saw the videotape by lightning on screen during the segment on Corky Pigeon. He played a terrifying childish spirit in this horrible horror B, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons TV show. This overturn is a great disappointment. There is nothing. In fact, it took me four months before I looked at it. I still stopped him in boredom, put it aside and forgot about it, then struggled with him and tried to go through again. Obviously, the angle of this film, which was designed to be different from its counterpart, was a supernatural element, revelation. And of course, it does not work here. I can not stand the men. I still expected them to look at their palms in longer dialogue scenes so they could read scams. The situation at the start when couples decide to leave alone is clumsy and simply stupid. I think the only positive thing about this thing is the scene in which the boy falls and breaks his leg and you see the bone pulling out of his body. There's really good gore makeup. Man, I'm really good at posing, um. The only other free horror film on a level as bad as this Home Sweet Home.
