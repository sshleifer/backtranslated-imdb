I'm in bad movies, but it's NEVER going. Despite what the aforementioned fools said, it's not funny. I know comedy and underground movies, but it's so boring that the director / writer should be forbidden from EVER to point everything except local cable EVER again! To love movies and comedy, this film is despised. I may never be able to see how this work was boring and boring. If you like this movie, you are a pot as sober, NEVER here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, check out the "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The film begins by defining satire and not protested by anyone to show me a satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUNNY, you can say or do ANYTHING, but if it's not funny, you're not satirical, you're not nervous, you're just pathetic and this movie just is not funny. ZERO!
