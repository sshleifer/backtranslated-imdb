It's pretty simple. Friends is a very basic comedy focused on teenagers and young adults, with an unsatisfactory sense of humor. It is also painfully obvious that they have been desperately trying to make the last 10 seasons at the end, probably supposed to have defeated Seinfeld for the 9th season. The problem is that Seinfeld had nine amazing seasons with great fonts, friends had (and here I am very generous) at the latest 5 or 6 OK periods and then 4 relentless years. a soap opera with recycled humor, and recycled character traits that were not as good as that, and then worsened at the 100th time you saw them. It seems so hard to understand why people appreciate it so much. It's really terrible.
