After exhausting this inaccurate film, I admit that it's a more modern storyline story than previous versions. Still, it's so inaccurate, and it was so politically correct that it made me angry when I watched him. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought he would probably be better off because Sam Houston gave both men love for the oratorio. I think Dennis Quaid (a real Texan) would be the perfect Crockett, and he would definitely be able to get his proud sense of self-denial. As a Texan and true believer in Texas thinking, I feel Davy Crockett was a typical Texan, even though he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is that "it's not compelling if it's true," Crockett said. And the last scene in Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, must be the greatest insult Davy Crockett has ever done. Even indicating that this giant man and seasoned fighter would allow him to be alive is ridiculous. Three different eyewitness testimonies dying him in the body of ten or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly raging hand combat. Finally, this chrome end of the film allegedly portrayed the Battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 texas and 700 Mexican soldiers when it was actually closer to 1500 well-trained Mexican residents. Every Texas teenage child in Texas knows that the battle has taken the Mexican army by surprise during the siesta, and the Mexican army was so confused that it could not create positions and fled because it was not trained to fight with the border hands.
