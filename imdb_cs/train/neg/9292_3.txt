Above all, I also expected another Hero - fantastic artwork for the action genre. I only saw part of the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine it's better than HoFD. The basic elements of Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, charming cinematography and honest acting (I mean, if you can not understand the word they say without captions, but you still like it - it's a good acting) What happened? What begins with a political intrigue goes into a love story. It's worse, it's a triangle love like a soap opera. You have three characters that I think will fall in love with each other - without good reasons. This movie basically breaks down after jailbreak (I fell asleep for about forty minutes). It's almost like changing the writer at the time. The rest of the film is about how the character is "like the wind." Ick. You also really had to stretch your suspension of mistrust to believe that the action is happening. This is not unique to this genre, but because the story is weak, you can not wait for action, and then when the fighting collapses, it really was not that good. The beginning grabs you, but then the film just exhausts the gas.
