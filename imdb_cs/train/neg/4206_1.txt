I was at this film premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After screening when the writer / director and some cast members offered to answer questions, nobody would even bother asking. Rarely, the film is so misguided (why were some random scenes from some scenes on the ground?), He acted furiously (David Arquette to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not have an emotional range from A to B. He stays at A and brings lunch) and totally useless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason, except to move the plot in certain directions. Finally, the film comes to a totally random and unnecessary end to "really think you through." Unfortunately, what you think is, "Well, it's 90 minutes of my life, I'll never go back."
