I rented this terrible movie. The worst thing I've ever seen. I believe the first class could do a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen has seen some bad ones. Nothing scary, except I paid 1.50 for rent and that was too 1.49. The game is terrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of waste. The scene of a famous house has such a low budget that it makes movement B looks like an Oscar nominee. All I can say is that if you wanted to waste a good dinner and a little money go to rent this horrible movie. I'd rather watch the killing clowns out of space as they sat in a bucket of barbers than to sit again on this flop
