I really wanted to like this movie, but it was simply impossible. It was very fictional, the conspiracy was unpleasant and the pace was slow and slow. All the while I'm sitting in the theater wanted to end the movie. Twenty minutes into the movies and I pray for the end. Sure, some of the visuals were nice, but I think they really are boys! And because of the movie about magic magic tuning, there was not really much music to talk about. The music was uncomfortable and boring. At times there were sounds that were noisy, and they were also annoying. Mostly, this movie I got bored, and I am exhausted. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I have to go see "Tideland" and drink the bad taste from my mouth.
