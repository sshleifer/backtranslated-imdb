C'mon boys some previous reviewers almost wrote a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60th TV show! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable for the brightest babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was shot in a real outdoor environment. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series, which were totally limited to the sound scenes. This use of the outer space (and babe) gives the right depth and almost the film as the quality of a fairly common episode of this now and very well-known show. In addition to several notable exceptions, such as "a city on the edge of eternity," "Earth assignment," and "tomorrow it is yesterday", the Old Star Trek series must be seriously moth-wrapped and discarded from boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is a fairly bad average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the tedious things Gene Roddenberry produced at that time, in fact, unlike the general belief where some people worshiped the land, he actually did a lot of rubbish! He does not deserve to talk in the same breath as Irwin Allen. <br /> <br /> Look at the Enterprise bridge from a modern perspective. On the floor, they used corrugated plywood, plastic-backed chairs, and expensive cardboard above the dashboards. You can see the folds in the paper clearly! Every cargo scanned or what!
