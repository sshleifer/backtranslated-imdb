Not that I want to be ruthless, but this film really surprised me. Throughout the movie I was like ... erm ... what is this film at all? I have no animation at all. Probably this movie will only be suitable for those in the 1980s. A group of people performs during the film. After the film, many people said, "Is that it?" Frankly, I can not believe that this film was awarded the Best Children's Film Award. If you are thinking about watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you do not do it. You will regret it. I'm not joking. You will find that you are just wasting your time and money to go and watch it.
