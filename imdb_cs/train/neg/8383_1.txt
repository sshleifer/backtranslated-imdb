...At all. That's the bottom. I'm not joking. The theater had some warning. "Leave everyone hoping that those who enter here" would fit. I do not have words that would exactly describe the hell that this movie is. His weakening stupidity will not even get rid of it. This film is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sand. The story was ostensibly tricked out of the 10 minutes of the Bugs Bunny cartoon and then stretched as Mr. Fantastic on an unbearably painful minute. I remember when Wayans were funny. I think the Hollywood pressures for producing them produce crops, they are to blame for a shudder at a consistent rate. I'm sad and offended that they think we're stupid enough to enjoy the 90-minute joke of copying in a ball with a thin conspiracy based on the cartoon. I do not like almost everything about this movie. I will not spoil anything, but the baby is actually a tiny body with Marlon Wayans' face, poorly covered by the body of a tiny body. What I was doing was the end. It's not about the film's distinction, it's the real end that we all got up and left. <br /> <br /> I gave the film one star but clearly deserves less. I do not have the feeling that the six minutes they spent writing a script are behind the star. That's what Razzie deserves, and I pray to God to get it. <br /> <br /> When people learn; if you stop paying for seeing this idiot, they stop bathing. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at all costs. You were warned.
