This adaptation will inherently inherit a classic that is loved by its finesse. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea of ​​Rochester's various nuances of character. I feel he has not read the book, just filmed in too tight trousers on the canvas, and received a summary of the characters he read: "A gruff, silly, dark past." He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real man, but as over the upper grouch that never bursts a smile until it engages, at which point they are miraculously morphs into pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation was excited by me was the distrust and sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who is definitely turning to her grave. SEND AND ORDER THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS PERSONALITY. And in the way: "THE PASSIONATED" FASHION SCENE DOES NOT KNOW THAT YOU MUST GO.
