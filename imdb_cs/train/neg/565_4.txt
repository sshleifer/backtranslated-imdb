The same difficulty that I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" is equally "Oliver". Instead of writing composers in the stylistic era of the game settings, they only wrote Broadway tunes that were historically unidiomatic and stylishly sloping. Also, the spectacular brutality and rude activities of dramaturgy do not mix well with some sun ditts that penetrate the score. It is an uncomfortable mixture that leaves a definite sour taste. Casting boy Oliver does not help in matters: a precious commemorative and exciting precious, there is something more than rigid. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, although the melodies he has to sing have only a small base in a periodic way. "As long as he needs me," he gets a sharp hand, his throat and strained. The two big production numbers, "Who Buys" and "Consider Yourself" seem overcrowded with everyone except the kitchen sink that sinks in. One thing is to go out and one that crosses the border. <br /> <br /> The stress, despair and corruption of most of the novel does not seem appropriate for such ditts and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must admit that I have problems with Mr Dickens' consciousness because his work tends to emit negative vibrations. It could have been to prolong his impious personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all the combined talents of this production, whether behind or behind the camera, can overcome the non-structural nature of the base material. All this has an uncomfortable experience for me. <br /> <br />
