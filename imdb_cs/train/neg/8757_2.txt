Seemingly a movie that predicts upcoming trends in British pop music is bad on so many fronts that it's ridiculous. Tommy fast? Balls? DOES includes the song by Spencer Davis, two animals Animals and one band on the live movie The Beatles, which makes their live version Twist and Shout (1:20). But in all, clumsy interpretation of British music around 1964. And Herman's Hermits.
