Seriously, there is nothing good about this festive celebration at all. Randolph Scott, a homosexual wardrobe who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is in his most wooden and boring in the least role. At age 57, she was far too old for these romantic roles, although it does not matter because Gail Russell looks much older than 31 years old and she's so terrible because of chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual rogue role, but it's not enough to save it. Thank God they no longer produce the Westerns, they're just rancid, racist old movies that enchant weapons and murder. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
