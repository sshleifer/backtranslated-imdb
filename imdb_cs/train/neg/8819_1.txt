this is undoubtedly the worst most idiotic horrible piece I've ever watched. The film plot is that a guy gets mad and dresses like a Santa Claus and kills people because he saw his mother giving his father oral sex when dressed as a santa clause. WHAT IS INSANE? it's just me or is it the worst reason why anyone goes mad like EVER? and that's not the only thing. I'm serious when I say nothing happened in this crazy movie. no more than 1 hour and 15 minutes passed. <br /> <br /> There is a whole friggin scene where the gentle sweet fancy santa is on it. It's a long frying minute. WHO IS HELL YOU WHO IS RELATED? but I have to say that the end of this movie makes me laugh at him. so if you see this movie on TV or something that will return as 1 hour and 20 minutes to undoubtedly watch the worst end in all cinematic history. and I mean it seriously. <br /> <br /> It's not that good, it's bad, it's tiring, it's idiotic, it made me break the vcr. it's just not worth your time, I'm also sure that every other review mentioned it, but the actress who played her mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a fraction of a second. Would you like to know how this movie is really bad? I am RATHER WATCH HOME upgrades for sixteen hours afterwards still viewing these films again.
