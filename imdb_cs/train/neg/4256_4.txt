Ascension is, in fact, a step in the original film in the story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee is good as a vampire hunter who is looking for the count himself (if you remember it was from Dragon The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny like Luke, a boy who helps a woman he loves Dracula's body is far from discarding . Diane Neal is good as a woman who stole Draculino's body to find a cure for her dying friend. And Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Providing better performance than Gerard Butler did in the original film. Roy Scheider captures the rest of the cast in this film and does a decent job as Jason Scott Lee's mentor. This is the second sequence in the trilogy and they have a good start. It's in the air if the last movie closes the series on a good note.
