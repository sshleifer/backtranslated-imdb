Even if one did not realize that Sellers was ill at the time of shooting, and died before the film was released, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be painful watching. It is reportedly a lamp of the famous oriental villain Saxon Rohmer, but he has no attention. The potential of the satirical commentary on the anti-oriental tones of the Rohmer concept is ignored. The film actually harbors racist insults. There are no real jokes or gags, mostly actors that act idiot and radiate furious lines. It is particularly disturbing to see Sid Caesar, who is forced to banish curses and racial misconduct. Most other actors are also ashamed. <br /> <br /> Then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the dual role of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to build a formula to regain his youth and his standing British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not a hundred percent bad; he emits a strange feeling of warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishist attachment to his mower and he is oddly moving like Manchu when he expresses his love of English musical entertainment. Mostly, however, they play both roles with tedious cruelty, further suppressing any comical possibilities. Sales routines, when revitalizing their power of fading with electrical shocks, are especially unbearable; seems to be too convincingly agonized to be entertaining. Several really funny lines, the applicable battles by Burt Kwouk (Cato in PINK PANTHER) as one of Manchu's helpers, and funny Helen Mirren's musical figures can not save this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedic genius, there will be nothing to learn from FIENISH DRIVING DR. FU MANCHU.
