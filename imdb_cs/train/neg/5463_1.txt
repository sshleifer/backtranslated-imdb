I saw Arthur (television series and books) years ago and never liked the show (if you are a fan of this cartoon, I'm sorry to spoil it, but that's actually what I think.) Many people liked it, but I do not. <br /> <br /> It seemed like the school children's characters were fighting all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were a lot of each other, but gradually I lost myself from Arthur's complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister DW (however the name was written ) and DW was ADHD (or ADD) - similar to the four-year-old sister Arthur, which was sometimes demanding (which might be why Arthur got angry with her routine, her imaginary girlfriend and her stuffed animal collection, ), Arthur's friends acted as teenagers instead of what they were in the books of Arthur, and parents, well, they did not care much. The greatest cartoon was Rocco's modern life, not Arthur (no misdemeanor).
