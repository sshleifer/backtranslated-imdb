How this piece of waste came into the film is outside of me. The only actor I know is Judge Reinhold, the perfect actor, whose presence is a mere justification for his production. I do not even think that it is worth nominating for the prize for rotten tomato, this film really makes B films a movie enjoyment. The car that runs on the highway with the police and no one knows how to stop the car, yeah, right. The script must be written on the back of the cigarette box. Most of the films for television are terrible, but they redefine the word. Check out the acting skills of the bridge operator, the pure Oscar.
