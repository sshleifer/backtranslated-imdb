It's not a terrible movie, really, and Glenn and Keitel are top actors. They also do an acceptable job with a very weak script. The landscape is fresh and the plot has interesting twists. In addition, I realize why these actors and crew have made a movie, they are professionals and they get it. But I wonder why the studios spend time and money on film making and then they do not publish it for theater audiences? Even if the movie is a box-office flop, it will definitely make some money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, find a video or capture it on TV. As I do, the film will not help solve Mexico's immigration problem, but the experience is much better than the 90% TV Today standard.
