Jeux d'enfants or how the film was badly translated into English Love me if you Dare is a movie from silly people and stupid people. I just do not know how I could expect from a movie with such a conspiracy something to look at: Two stupid ignorants make a bet that each one will do something (certainly extremely idiot) to make each other (wtf?) Are "cool men ". I know I've overturned some aspects, but that's what the whole movie is all about. They're old ... and instead of realizing that they are a few stolen wizards, they continue their crazy things and think they are great people. Can you expect such a movie from Hollywood, but France? It is even more insulting to watch the film from a country that Amelie a few years ago did, but she is far away, far away. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
