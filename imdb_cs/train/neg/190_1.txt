I've always felt that a good movie should have a conspiracy. This particular movie was missing one, and I feel it would be more effective in plotting. This was even worse by the fact that it seemed to continue forever; I was excited to finally finish. I just noticed it was only 123 minutes long; it was like four hours. Not only was there no plot, but the film also lacked a significant conflict. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I thought it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious". So do not think my review is from someone who needs nothing but to act. Today I hate most of the action movies; it's just the film that's on the other side of the spectrum. There's really not much going on in this movie. However, scenery and costumes were nice.
