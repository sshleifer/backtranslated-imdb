I would not make this movie a rating, it's not good. I watched it just because I was a fan of Pfieffer. I love her and look at everything she has done. Even in this mud she did not disappoint. Every scene with her kept an observer there ... waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing ever happened. She had some good stories, but as soon as it started, they suddenly ended. Some of the other characters had the potential, but nothing happened. Pfieffer was 29 years old when she made this film and her most beautiful. The wardrobe and set was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can usually watch anything and rarely find a movie where I can not find something that he likes but this was crazy. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this is that at the end he had a big curtain on the cliff. She had the final scene that woke you up and said wow, this movie eventually goes somewhere, then the credits are rolling. For God's sake. <br /> <br /> I agree with the report he said .99 would buy 3 cans of cat food and watch my cat eat would be much more exciting. Well said. In fact, this commentary was more fun than the movie because it sums it up. I also lost 0.99 cents to this dud.dud.dud.
