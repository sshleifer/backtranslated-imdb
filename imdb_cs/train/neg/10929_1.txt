This film has been the strongest Mormon movie ever since. This made RM & Sons of Provo look like good movies! It should have been funny to what I was told. The best part was the best actor in the movie - Travis Eberhard - if it was not in the movie, it probably would not be! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. It was hurt 8. It was Thurl Big T Bailey, who had a character not meaning 7. It was made in Provo 6. He did not want to make fun of Brokeback 5. He had it Larry H. Miller's 4. It was the first movie Clint Howard was not funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 and comeback 2 had to be cast in Surreal Life auditions 1. It was made by Halestorm Entertainment !!
