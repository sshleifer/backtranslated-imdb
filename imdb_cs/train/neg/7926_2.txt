The original classic exploitation - though far from pleasant at almost any level regarding some boys who convert cats into a human body eating monsters because cat food makes them with humans is a remake with added scifi elements. Cats do not get enough, and when the meat of the spilled food runs out, the cats turn to their owners. Badly assembled on almost every level, it is an example of the absolute bottom of a barrel material that actually played in the first half of the seventies with cats and dog races fighting for domination. Director Ted Mikel is a hack but he is such a nice guy (generally, I like the guy because of his smile provoking interviews and commentaries) that you can pretty much apologize for the garbage that has turned out to be the most. Mikels wanted to make movies, and he did not care how it turned out until he produced something. More power to him, but I wish he did not make us home movies
