I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of movies. When I want to preach, I go to church, but I do not want one of the movie. I do not mind some supernatural motives (after all, religion is as supernatural as you can get!) But this movie had so many sermons that I was really upset. The creature reminded me of the witches she saw in other films. The bad one even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a stupid end: the hero went to the meeting and screamed at all those old men, and that broke the spell. If life was so simple. I think that if movies are so stupid they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! DOSAGE CONTAINING HERE!
