Who in his true mind does something as stupid as this movie? Random killing a policeman ... characters that are so two-dimensional that they could paint them for two years, ... better ... <br /> <br /> Red set of death instruments? Please <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < thriller, voyeurism and ... woman ... (uhm) Rambo? Unbelievable and an insult to every thinker. Do not look, go on, it's more terrible than you can imagine ... And it's all trying to be hip by being overly graphic in this violence ... <br /> </ b> Mrs. Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and fun, it's just pathetic and horrible. Good luck for the next time. :-(
