This movie is so bad - dialogues, stories, actors and actors - everything! - it's hard to imagine that we will see a worse movie this year or in the coming years. "Love Brother" (in Australia is located among Italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clich√©s on the offer of Italian culture and it is quite good that Italians from Italy and Italy speak ENGLISH in the film. The message of the film - nasty people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - it's really uncomfortable. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good in movies like 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here's his pseudo-Italian accent heavy. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash like rubbish!
