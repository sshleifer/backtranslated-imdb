Just the fact that the envelope is a drawing, just like the old B-movies should warn you about the quality of this film. This is not a movie B. It's a D-movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors and animals - WOW - the worst data animation ever made over the past two decades. <br /> <br /> You can hardly see the SCAAARY chessboard on the front cover. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying, and occasionally seeing teeth or tigger paws. It's so amateur! Maybe it's worth seeing, just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "That's the best movie I've ever seen and wait for their reaction." He, he. <br /> <br /> The film is weak to give him a warning Spoiler! THIS IS SPOILER.
