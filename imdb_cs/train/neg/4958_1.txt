Not only do these characters do badly, they do not just hear voices, but writers not only need a girlfriend, but the drawings are really rough, but it seems to have been designed primarily for children aged 1-6. The only episode I've ever seen from this show that kept me in mind was "Matt's Family," because I loved the character of Robin. And sometimes I think it's just an ordinary copy of the Batman Animated Series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce's friends with Harvey Dent, right? During the two-episode story, he turns into an improbable villain, TwoFace. In "Show" Bruce's Friends with Ethan, and through the story of two episodes transforms into the unlikely villainous ClayFace. This was just a small example (perhaps not true), but in short, it is the worst attempt at the Batman series. And that says something.
