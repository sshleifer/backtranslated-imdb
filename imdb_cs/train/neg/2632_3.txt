I'm sad to rate the film with many of my favorite actors, places and genres, such as Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC and the political thriller, but "The Sentinel" really hits the low. It's as if they had a great idea in front of them, they signed the right cast and they had some great city shots and then they took a vacation and let the remaining crew improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame it on another unspeakable performance from Basinger (not only do I think it's one of the worst actors in Hollywood but still in steam more than ten years later that she was the only and definitely just a bad actor in the movie to get an Oscar for "LA Confidential".) But it was not the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love Jack Bauer to "24" again plays Jack. I miss my old days "Time to Kill" or "Some Good". Douglas must have taken a break from acting and called this. Fence: Someone, a traitor from a secret service, wants the president dead and Douglas (randomly) framed. Will anyone trust him? In fact, no spoiler here: as soon as they came halfway with the subplot, it's more than you know. And why does someone want the president dead? Should it be revealed in the sequel? Too much plot of holes, too many doors opened and never been closed and too predictable "The Sentinel" is. If you see only one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with these types of movies or even saw one episode "The Law and Order" you see in the first few films. It was awful? In fact, cinematography was not good, and despite the fact that Sutherland again played Jack, he still has it.
