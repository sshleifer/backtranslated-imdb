Does Every Good Story Have To Be Improved With Added Broadway Music? It seems that those who can not come up with their own land think that classical literature is just for pillaging. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, for it is certainly true that Dickens has often written the stuff that leaves you, and that was a great example of that ... So of course, take this serious story and add naughty music and show it to every character, since the orphans go out to grind the beans, and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Get me a sink. The four stars in my rating come from casting, which I can resemble to my righteous lady. Each of these films had a cast to play a playable version, but then they must go and let them sing (see above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sang here could actually do that and they have mercifully saved us singing the voice of Oliver Reed (forgive me if I'm wrong, it's a while). he said. Why are everyone, except for the truly non-asshole, shamed by putting stupid songs in a totally good story? Rarely it has been done with a good effect. It generally destroys the story. It's done with this. The jury is still wondering if this story is worth saving, but with what's going on around it, it's hard to say.
