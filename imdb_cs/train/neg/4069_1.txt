Good God! (and it came from atheists), this movie is bad! Many respondents have already said (about those who rated this picture 3 and below), with whom I fully agreed, I just want to add a few things: among the three boys who had to eat their own digestive products, chopped the ax, raped the broom and their the balls were blown - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture, and at the same time he must listen to the endless and useless gossip of the girl on the kitchen table (just as we do, but at least we have the mercy of the mute buttons). <br /> <br /> The director cuts a point and endless cemetery and inverted scenes, our suffering would end in 30 minutes. The only thing that made this move at least a bit bearable is Emily Haack's breast (one point). <br /> <br /> do not buy it. do not waste your time. and your mental health. my brain is so fried after watching it, I feel the need to watch (and suffer?) "the notebook" right now.
