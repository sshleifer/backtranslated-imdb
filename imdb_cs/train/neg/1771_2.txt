It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only interesting thing in this film is the acting performance of some great genre directors and the King himself. The film has a big premise, but it decays about 15 minutes into the story. In this movie I liked Madchen Amick and thought she could have a very good career in the movie.
