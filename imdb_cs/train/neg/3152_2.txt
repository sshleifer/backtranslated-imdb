Badly structured, poorly written, laced clich√© and flat dialogue. No scene will experience. Actors fight a painfully boring script that can completely avoid surprises, conspiracies or conflicts. You know from the first ten minutes when it's happening. For a movie in NY there is almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other Indian movies that can look magical on a small budget. Apparently it was shot dead in Toronto. When you stretch Natasha Henstridge, why dress her in a bag of sweaters? Why does Vartan look boring and boring? Where's the attraction? I had the feeling that I was looking at Christian movies in the week that is so ruthless and moralizing. Steven Feder's great success lies in persuading people to make this step film.
