WARNING: SPOILER! ! ! I personally do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams's life, I think it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think members of the secret service are people every day and there is a reputation that the writer was a secret service, now the motivation is clear, well known. But as a rental of this movie you will not satisfy yourself, it will cause old, but used twists, average acting - these are just things in this movie, just because you wait for the end. Clark Johnson as SWAT Director has done a much better job than this time, and I'm still wondering how producers (like Michael Douglas) have left this movie in theaters.
