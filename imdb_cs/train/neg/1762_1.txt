This film seems to be breaking off many of the films that have previously dealt with the same theme. Let the future audience warn that "Art Heist" will not add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the filter. William Baldwin is still appearing in movies, and honestly, one is surprised to have a great agent, or directors and producers love his unusual gray look, complemented by a strange hairstyle that he sports in most of his films. The only good film he has appeared is "Squid and the Whale," in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, does not fit much better; there is no chemistry between Mrs Pompe and Mr. Baldwin. The film will be seen at the audience's own risk.
