Can you say, "Every shock, no plot?" There were so many unprocessed directions in this movie. There was nothing but death in the room. * WHY * Was that bad? What caused it? Why Countdown "Hours"? Then unexplored things appeared; for example, we saw the camera in the vent which he mentioned. But when he climbed up there was no camera. And what about the fact that all spirits looked "Digitally" and things "disappeared" before they hit the ground and caused static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all these things together, it makes room 1408 look like a top house. Except this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... the electronics did not work in 1408. Well, except for the television ... the cell phone does not have a signal, but the wireless internet works well. How much trouble can you add? I'm sorry, but this movie was nothing more than a shock shock. It was all before. Reflections in the mirror. Things that are out of place. Change painting. Bleeding walls. "Oh, that was just a dream ... no, it was not." And if the room was "bad," why does our main character cope with her daughter's death if she still wanted to keep her forever? It did not make sense. In addition, there was no basic information on the "First Book" he wrote. Just some unclear information about "dad's a jerk" and so on. When they talked about dads, what was with the father? "You will be in my place". <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a really hot movie. It was a 100% adrenaline shock factor, with no new or innovative effects and certainly no backward look, character development, etc. The overall impression is that the whole movie was made at "Cheap"; almost using one set and several shots of placement and was nothing but an effect film of recycled, cheese "seen" effects.
