** HERE ARE SPOILERS ** The government is continuing to develop UniversalSoldier, now called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and are able to suffer more damage than before. However, the government is declining, threatening the project, and the supercomputer, who feels threatened in the midst of everything, is taking steps to ensure its own security. He activates and controls UniSols and begins to run chaos. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreography of struggles. The story is bad and will soon drown in all the fighting. Whatever happens anywhere, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie it's not fun to watch a fight where you know its part is indestructible. Normally, you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel that the matches are between two fairly equal fighters. Not where one is indestructible and can not lose. Then fighting becomes a tool for extending time. You wait until the last fight when Deveraux miracles finds a way to defeat his unbeatable enemies. To further reduce my opinion, the desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much more dressed women are. Well, there's really not so many of them, because the characters are mostly men (there's at least one UniSol woman though), but almost every woman is unnecessarily shown with at least just a bra once. The female leaders will get it, but we'll also go through the strip-club (using the computer no less) with a lot more stripped women. These moments do not give a story, and they are just there to try to please the teenage male audience. <br /> <br /> So, finally, the boring fight. Nothing more, nothing less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
