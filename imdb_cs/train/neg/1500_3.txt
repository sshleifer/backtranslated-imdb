Oh, that's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain this is to be a porn with drugs, which has resulted in a solution to make the film just for fun. I mean: you can see porn actresses without topless, have sex, then kill human mutants. There are a lot of gore, including the classic "Something wrong with her, no, it's half that she used to be," and a random murder caused by panic. You can also find fun things like the intestine that stretched in the ass, and the guy running in the woods, and then found the boards with the wire bound between the two trees (it does the metal doiiing sound afterwards as in cartoons). Somehow, the market for people who go beyond porn has to really know what's inside the actress, simple genitals are not enough. That's why you can see a lot of cumulative autopsy on killed bimbos. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really care what Richard Grieco wanted when he took that role. I think this is a movie that needs to be watched by pushing the button forward and watching just juicy things just to remind you of old class C horror films.
