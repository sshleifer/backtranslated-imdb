Richard C. Sarafian rejected this disaster, destroying Japanese theaters before it came to the States, and immediately got to a video where it was not visible until the Turner network needed anything other than infomercials to fill their 3 am-6am time slots in the bottom part of the basket. The name Smithee is to be used when the studio film so deeply kills that the director no longer wants his name to be attached. But I'm afraid Sarafian can not blame the studio for this studio. Actors, mostly recent graduates of "Overacting 101," add one line of crown after another. The plot is complicated. Special effects are insurmountable. Parts that are not ridiculous are simply boring. The script or book must be good - why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree otherwise to appear in this fool? But something got worse off the screen from the screen. Summary: Avoid. It's not bad enough to be so bad - it's good.
