Polyester was John Wather's first film I saw, and I must say it was also the "worst" movie I've ever seen. The water group "talent" included several people who I'm sure worked for food and was willing to say that Waters wrote. Every thing about the movie is horrible, playing, camera, editing and the story of a woman playing a 300 pound transvestite Divine was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> I said, I recommend this movie because it's very funny and you will not believe what's going on with the poor Francin. Her son delivers solvents and stays by unsuspecting female legs in the grocery store. Her daughter is the smartest bitch in town. Her husband is a cramped hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to please and humiliate poor Francine. Francine's only friend is Edith Massey, perhaps the worst actress ever. Edith looks and sounds as if reading the lines from the card and never seen the script before. <br /> <br /> Despite all that Francine does, Waters prepares the wonderful Hollywood end and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
