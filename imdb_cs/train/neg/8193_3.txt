Well, during this past break with thanksgiving, while along with the whole family everyone has decided to go to the film, and because the Freda clause was mostly elected, that's what we went and said. <br /> <br /> To start the movie having so many plot holes it was pathetic. A simple explanation of why an event is happening is invalid. example; who the hell is trying to "shut down" the clause of Santa? Is it a company? A little explanation would be beautiful. <br /> <br /> Second: The film has threw you with fragile characters that have not compelled you to feel their feelings and actions. for example: a small elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice, and then there are a couple and I could take care less because I did not care about this movie. <br /> <br /> Third: I suppose it's a family movie? His rating was low only for PG. For family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. It did not bother me, but if I were a parent, I could see the problem. The entire film, Paul Giamatti, looked extremely bored with his role, but he was the only one to watch the film. Vaughn had some fun moments, but he played the same character as he had for the last two films. guy. (nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other movies), so this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me just because someone has had to put an effort to produce, film and release that movement. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely pass this movie, or if you have to see it, save it on a rainy day of rental.
