The sequel (really remake) of Disney's 1996 live action remake of 101 Dalmatians. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being "cured" by her obsession with a psychologist's furry psychologist. Pavlov (ugh!). But the "cure" is broken when Cruella hears Big Ben, and she goes on a crazy search to make a perfect coat of Dalmatian skins. This movie is bad for so many levels, starting with the fact that it's the "Thanksgiving" movie designed to sip every last available day out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close is over-over-over-acting as Cruella. What they had to deal with in this movie - the slim scenario, the endless make-up, finally baked in the cake - I hope they gave her an extremely large paycheck. <br /> <br /> When we talk about where to find a fur coat factory in the world, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelit restaurant located in the same building - as well as the culmination of this film?) Of course, the real stars of the film are dogs. Serving as "Macaulay Culkin's" this movie, they pull out all the silly "Home Alone" gags on the villains. (The bits are in the crotch, running over their luggage, shooting them with icing, etc., ad, at the museum.) I have to admit that dogs are pretty good actors - much better than humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely unnecessary in this film as a French furrier. Two human "dog lovers" - new from the previous movie, but with different actors - are totally boring. When they have a Spanish dinner at an Italian restaurant, the film fights back and forth between the two lovers and their domestic dogs and looks at the evening scene from "Lady and the Tramp". I thought, "Oh please do not go there!" I did not expect people to make satire for "Lady and the Tramp" dinner - as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - doing a "pill kiss", pushing nose meat, etc. <br /> <br /> And do not let me start with annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> Costumes have been nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the movie * are good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest is unbearable.
