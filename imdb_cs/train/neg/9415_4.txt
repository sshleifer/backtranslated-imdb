Strongly reworked and often confusing, the original version of Man On Fire was ten years out of date when it happened, and the years that had happened did not improve. This is the kind of film that producers with too much money and too little experience are paying attention to, and everyone else simply pays off their excellent nutrition or drug dealer, while bodyguard Scott Glenn goes to the limb to save her 12-year-old a charge, a kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. Interesting acting actors - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello and Jonathan Pryce - all did better, the action is slow and sparse, and only a remarkably good score by John Scott (part of which appeared in the last album Die Hard). One case where the remake (made by Tonym Scott, the original director's choice for this release) is an improvement.
