That's a joke. I watch it on Channel 1, and I think watching the dry color is a lot more fun. What happened to Caspard Van Dien, who got him into this nightmare. Scary acting, a very boring conspiracy, and a terrible direction. It's terrible, it's funny. It's supposed to be full of tension, but it's a comedy. If you want to see horrible acting, absurd writing scenarios and partial plot, check out this movie. If I was Van Dien, I would not ask for my 10% of my agent, but throw that bastard in this process. What is Turkey? It is not even suitable to be on MST 3K !! It will be a good movie that will cure your insomnia. I especially love the part where Van Dien goes overboard and then returns in a few minutes! I can only imagine that it was written by writers who are not unionists who used the writer. What a terrible movie !!!
