This film was more effective when it convinced me of the Zionist plot than the Muslim plot. And I'm Jewish. <br /> <br /> Are we going to a journalism school? Read the editorial office? Freshman rhetoric? These alarmist claims, presented in a tasty way, can be convincing. But by not offering any acknowledgment of possible contradictory arguments, nor a viable (or at all solution) solution, few resources, and any doubtful origins, this argument renders an ineffective diatribe. And thanks for that - I would not want anyone to leave a theater that would believe any racist explosion. A good lesson for me - and perhaps a warning story for you - actually read about the movie before you see it.
