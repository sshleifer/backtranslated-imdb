I had a feeling that after "immersion" this would not be better ... I was right. He has to look for money for champagne and he does not care about the end product ... his voice repeatedly calls a stranger who sounded the same way he did. editing is - well - just above the level of amateur. It's nothing but B or C, who has enough money to hire a few talented cameramen and sound designer "OK". Just like the previous poster said, it seems that problems appear in the post-production (... voice dubbing, etc.) The pity that the plot is really OK for SG movement. <br /> <br /> I never borrow another SG movie unless I sent an e-mail asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
