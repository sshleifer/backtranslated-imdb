This movie is NOT SO WITNESS - such a loss of great stars that seem to be caught in their own star they will forget. John Cleese is just a glamorous moment as a hotel manager who likes to dress - he almost falls out of the chair with helpless laughter as he dances at Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" when he wears high heels, a mink coat and a soft hat. The rest: WELCOME!
