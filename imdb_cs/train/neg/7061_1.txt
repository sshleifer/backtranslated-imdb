I'm still trying to find out if there's any point to this movie. For the content to be so "rebellious" and "controversial", the things Maddox distributes to students are terribly lame. It seems that students are easily controlled by vague anti-authoritarian views and snippets of words that are unlikely to be leaning on flyers. Rebel, everyone. I suppose there is too much to ask for a teen revolt movie when the school fire alarm is not enough. <br /> <br /> It seems like a "huge fight on football pitches" is a fight that consists of two people. <br /> <br /> Celebrity personalities seem wild to change randomly. The football that Maddox fought (and who subsequently got a cut on his face), everyone smiles and apologizes for the next day. The fact that there was no real conclusion to the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could be equipped within half an hour of school. If they removed most of the pseudo-glitch soundtracks.
