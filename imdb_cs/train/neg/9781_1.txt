I do not think I'm too far from the base to say it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I worked on a list of my favorite war films: "The Longest Day", "To Hell and Back", "Bridge on the Kwai River" (all black and white), having all good lands, great acting. I have seen a better dialogue and I have been in a written grammar school. This conspiracy, however, is not a bad prerequisite - just wrong. It's like a traffic accident, but it did not seem to me to turn it off! The film does not need big money or great sets, like "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is not a justification. What did they think?
