There is no denying that Azumi's first film was a commercial product; it was the adaptation of the popular manga and the cast of young, attractive actors and certainly not lacking in the budget department. Still more than enjoyed what it was, and I can not deny that I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" lacks almost everything that made the original so beautiful. The first thing that should set the bell ringing is the absence of the excellent Ryuhei Kitamura on the rudder. It seemed to him that he had not only his own visual taste and kinetics but his original style, beauty, and above all his heart. While the former had a simple plot list, it has a corkscrew corkscrew with too blunt characters that have been stabbing in the back, and so many times that the potential of any sympathy or pathos is destroyed. Gone is an effective interplay between leading characters; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of teenagers who quarrel in the woods. Characterization does not exist; if someone watches really cares who lives and who dies, I'll be shocked. The same applies to villains. The last battle - in fact all the battles - is completely without any strain. The fact that they are badly choreographed and ambiguously focused - not to mention a few and far between - becomes side by side with their own total absurdity. The villains themselves are trying too hard to be camp and even if they all get together, they have not entered Joe Odagiri's original milestone of Pete Burnsian's wrath. <br /> <br /> ## The main tracer at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto tries to make the best of herself and also keeps her hair in good shape between the movies. Azumi is now a full-fledged killer, which means he can slow down his sword; unfortunately the character is now instilled with some secret with the name of Man With No Name, model Ueto looks even more inappropriate. I know this should be the reason, but in combination with the inefficiency of everyone else in the movie, the stupidity of conspiracy, and the general infertility of the movie generally means that it's absolutely impossible to get her figure this time. The less it says about Chiaki "Remember me from Kill Bill" Kuriyama's performance, the better; it is enough to say that her "turn" from good to evil is as gentle as napalm. Overall, it was just a colossal disappointment. Any merit in the first movie was ten times better. Lazy, unsatisfactory - and generally boring - a mess.
