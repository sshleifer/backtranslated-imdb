Yeah. I'm pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about domination. Another recycled storyline glistened in Hollywood style and borrowed scripts from high-quality films about the music industry. br /> <br /> Nothing original. <br /> <br /> More makeup, glamor costumes and choreography = more money for dubious "talented" Beyonce drawing. <br /> <br /> As a return style, you should appreciate the real groups you were struggling with (without digitized voices and the Hollywood realm). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocrite waste.
