Bah. Another tired, unrecoverable reprocessing of a copyrighted work has never been designed for filming. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Toni Collette is great as ever (she's a real actress, you see), and there are some carefully crafted cuts between the scenes. There are even a few really funny lines and filmmaking, scores and edits are competent, besides the bizarre overcoming of the voice and talking to the camera to conclude. But, ah, but. Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared ages. Worse yet, everyone speaks "Austinese," that a strange falsetto alone is singing a song that could not be further from the way people actually spoke on Austen day (thinking Yosemite Sam, I'm not doing you). This is particularly sad because it seems that we are finally seeing the disappearance of the same-sex "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his friends were so glad they were going to the top of their lungs. And the worst thing is Gwyneth Paltrow. In her films, she played only one character, and it remains true that she is shaping herself, going through her whole range (smiles that she's angry) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating for the rest of the excess film. There is absolutely no chemistry between itself and any of its admirers, nor any obvious reason why they should be interested in it. In short, there are very few reasons to watch Emma. It's a nice customization, but if you're going to pack a movie full of anacronisms (that is, a Thin Slim Lead that can not shoot a bow or master a time accent), then you could do it just like a huge superior "clueless."
