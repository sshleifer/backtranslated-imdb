Nothing positive to say. Crazy nonsense, humor and inflamed with a "message". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (cuckoo comes to mind), yet many have a bouquet of cardboard and asbestos smudge (Nochnoi Surveillance would be a good example). It is the "supervision" type of emptiness. Efficacy would be terrible if not for the saving mercy of a totally unpleasant direction and incompetent adjustments, which is sometimes so terrible that it drives away from the impotence of the actors. A special award for the cameraman to make sure each shot is shattered (anyone would realize that Blair Witch has 15 seconds of undeserved glory?) And take the focus on juvenile preschoolers who suffered in Counter Strike and Masturbation. The female eye poses and tries to look too seductive; male anti-heroes need a trainer with dictionaries (though genetics are not bad: rather expressive eyes.) One (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile is non-arthritic. Everyone who evaluates it is better (distant) cousin "auteurs".
