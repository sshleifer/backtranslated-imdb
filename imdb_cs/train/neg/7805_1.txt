The first film actor is usually something that one can afford to miss - it is often the first time that there is actually a lack of film experience for everyone involved, and this film is no exception. But worse than it is so bad in 1982, it is hysterically fun. Overall made in Chicago on a distinctly small budget, most actors in the cast are solid, wooden and cartoon - the cross between high school play and poor social theater. The noise from nearby transport often drowns dialogue and the dialogue is really a bad, very declarative way, which is more of a forced and effective rather than natural and organic. Scenes are invented and torn, and although the characters are going through a long time, children and adults do not start. I believe that it is possible to create a Christian film that appeals to a great secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on "The News" or in this case on their own autobiographical ties to the project that the values ​​of good film production are thrown aside. (It's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member). Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and credible - to watch in his other films. His career is certainly not based on films like this one.
