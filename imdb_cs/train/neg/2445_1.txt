Hi, can anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you are the viewer of this movie: join the fan club! This movie was so unbelievably bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think he has to see it, it's nice. Any clich√© that has ever been invented for horror film can be found here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the ten worst movies.
