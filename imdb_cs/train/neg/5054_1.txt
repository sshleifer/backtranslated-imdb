We know firefighters and rescuers are heroes: some of them could attack. Friends and family of these and others who died in a World Trade Center attack could be driven by this horror film. Sweet, serious, though the tied firefighter remembers what he can lose to his colleagues, to an embarrassed journalist who transforms his fragments into eulogy. Thinking about the results. It mumbles even more, it has another eulogy, etc. Atd. The terrible events that prompted the need of several thousand eulogies are utterly sad, but this fruitful insipid of dramatization is terribly boring.
