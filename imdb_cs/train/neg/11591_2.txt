This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt bad watching. Up to this point, the other installments had at least one good thing. Part 1 was thrilling and cruel. Part 2 was off and fun. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 had great music, good special effects and new fun Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen. Alice, a much nicer blonde, the 4th part is back with my friend Dan. In parts, this supposed part of Elm Street turns into a daily soap. The newer characters look harsh and even the sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be out of this. He looks tired and does not seem to be so awful. Its unicorns look in place and different, where, as in part 4, they can be quite fun. The story of Leslie Bohemov never gets out of the ground and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that it makes grandmother look good! The whole conspiracy of this film is ridiculous and unreal. It's also confusing and quite stupid. Avoid part 5 at all costs!
