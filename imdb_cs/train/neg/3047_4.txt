I have seen this film several times in the late 1960s and early 1970s whenever a head appeared as a reindeer on Saturday in December as a Saturday show of matinee kiddie. There has always been a hard competition for the CHRISTMAS WHO WERE NOT (oops - I can say "Christmas"?), Perhaps the biggest and most specific Christmas season season of all time. But that's another review. At that time, I was surprised that the wall paint of SANTA CLAUS was almost "pink and white", so the color of the torn cubes was changed. <br /> <br /> The film is a little scary! That's what I meant-and I still do. I was very entertained because I'm still! It's fun in the "retarted-elf" kind of way. By the way, the image quality looks a lot better on the DVD I have now than in the theater, around 1969-74. If you are expecting "Lost Christmas Specials RANKIN-BASS, If You Want To FELLINI CHRISTMAS CHRISTMAS - Read on ... <br /> <br /> Naturally dubbing on these foreign movies (the original version here was in Spanish) is always" "It's also terrifying that" bad fire "(as described in the original American trailer) spends the whole movie trying to turn decent children into" evil. "" Boys who want to have parents at Christmas - Suddenly, the "port-a-family" will emerge from huge "Christmas gifts" until they realize they just dream the day! if you're a stoner, save your stash - this movie will make you think you're hallucinating ... no drug!
