Casting, though nothing special, makes everything OK, the story looks like a good idea, the script is tolerable, and the end is pretty good. so what's wrong with that? <br /> <br /> The start of the special effects is really bad (if it happened in the 1960s), it might look OK, but there is no excuse in 2003 for visuals as bad as this. I am laughing that DVD packaging claims very proudly "from the creator of Jeepers Creepers special effects." Secondly, the direction is weak, this film simply does not capture the essence of the story, the doctor feeding the mental prisoners of the devil's hospital (or the creation of demons) should be tense or frightening; it just is not. Overall, this is a pretty bad movie, and although it is tolerable and sometimes slightly fun, it is still probably best left alone. <br /> <br /> It's a sad 4/10
