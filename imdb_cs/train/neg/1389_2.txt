I was very disappointed in this movie. Was it a flimsy border of stupid: the souls that can influence reality as they do it? Is the mission clearly critical to the Soul Hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? The whole B-story with a "holobothele" and a lawsuit against the station were so horrible that I went on television at one point: "Why are you wasting your time?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, the "soul of the river" actually did not come to the question of the soul at any depth than the original "Soul Hunter" episode. We see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not feel their culture. (Is there a female soul hunter?) The efficiency was fine, given the material they had to work on, and the special effects - especially the planets in the first act - were very impressive. But overall I would say I will.
