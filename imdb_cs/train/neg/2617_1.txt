This film was pure pain. I sat in the theater for x minutes, I wondered when the movie would start. All settings were in place; a typical love story, characters have to overcome their short gifts, a villain must appear, but none of this has ever begun. By the time these things happened, I was already bored and the equipment was totally ineffective. In scenes requiring huge tension and buildup, it seemed that the necessary frames were cut. Children's things do not have to be like this. Children's films can be as boring and engaging as adults. The excuse, "hey, for the children," is the bull. I'll take "Sword in the Stone" every day. It was horrible. I feel like Disney does not do anything today. And when it comes to children, the ten-year-old I've seen, will agree ... clean waste.
