OK, anyone who can frankly say that this movie was great or even good is either vicious or knows director, writer and producer and trying to revive the buzz of this movie. I was watching the movie because my friend was working on it and it was terrible. I'm an actress and I'm working in the industry for a while on big movies and even on independents, and this movie bored me. The reason why I'm so cruel is that this movie was obviously different to take on "Mice and Men" and they should sue because it's such a terrible breaking of the story. In the industry where Hollywood seems to be a creative bankruptcy ... for someone who takes a classic book and the film "Mice and Men" Actors, accents, dialogue and direction were amateur and writing was grim. I mean, if you're going to take a new shade on the current story, make sure it's as good or better as the original so the new spin becomes legitimate. I did not like the movie at all.
