This cowardly and offensive movie caught me. The characters are known uprooted young men who are often seen hanging in a boring town in the city. Robert is an outsider but has his own music that could be his soul. Instead, Clay made the monster of Robert a monster who went on a trip to cannabis and ecstasy and got into a bad crowd. Clay seems to believe in the "stupidity of hunger," and Robert ends the film as a murderous murderer. One is interested in how much real life experience this young director has. No one can save the poor Robert. Clay tells us that young British men are out of control. A very unsatisfactory link is the Iraqi uprising; during unnecessary graphic rape we are exposed to explosions and images of war. The film shows that male group extremism has reached the border. Young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful description of a modern man. Clay suggests that men simply can not help in the face of terrible acts of violence. It is surprising that the British film industry is making it possible to invest money in films that promote such terrible propaganda when we are still unfolding in London from recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I'd like it if it was his last.
