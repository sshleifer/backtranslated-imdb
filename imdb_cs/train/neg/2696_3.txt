I know John Singleton is a smart guy because he made Boyz N The Hood the way he wrote and drove this? It's like a pilot of a bad "first drop in college", a teen of soap, shows of boring stereotypes, and clich√© with some gratuitous violence that suits it to be commercial, I think. Who would realize that a rape victim would unload sausage sausage? An angry loner would be protected by a group of neo-Nazis (and should be placed with black AND Jews - just laughing!) Even the ghastly reactionary story by Laurence Fishburne Professor just irritated me and I love that guy, it's like everyone with this movie deals, just lost conspiracy. Besides Busty Rhymes of course. Big ups.
