Funny how the studio thinks she can continue the classic Christmas story with a totally new cast and expects to swim. Of course, they used different actors for Batman, but in that case, Batman was a classic character before some of the actors dressed his cloak. In this case, you had classics in blonde-headed glasses with a corner edge that wears Ralphy, who wanted a red knight's weapon for Christmas ... Somehow we should have forgotten him and picked up another little boy who has no resemblance to the original one. . If I did not know it was a sequel, I would not have made it out of the cast ... besides, of course, Charles Grodin is trying so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that he constantly recalls that the original was much better ... <br /> < br /> Finally, it could work if the movie gets better. They were looking for the look or simply ignored the originals and did not try to copy their appearance and impression. It's just a cheap imitation. Ralfie does not evoke any condolences, just the desire to see that his character will shoot his eye or die.
