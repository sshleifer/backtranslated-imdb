I was wrong. After exploring the box, I thought it was a story about traveling from the road and sci-fi. Instead, it is a "Christian" story, and I think it is quite a typical example. If you sell in a message, you probably miss the clutter of plot / acting / etc, but I found it somewhat painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was bothered by the transcript of history in this story. He is painting the 1980s as a paradise of family values ​​and morals (the figure is horrified that 5% of marriage ends with divorce!), But overlooks the very unpleasant aspects of this "highly moral" society (rigid racial, sexual and social discrimination have been extended, for example). And at one point, the hero will become the owner of the clothing business on things that are not totally different from the complaints of some Iranian women-style women leaders (as noted in the recent WSJ). Overall, I thought it was such a thing you would like if you like these things, and it's certainly healthy ...
