This 2003 television movie was naturally portrayed on a female channel. As a person, why am I even trying to? I do not know, but I should look at my head. And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of giving the men such an injustice. It takes all the strength and conviction that one might have by bored by several boring women. The biggest hole is Joyce Hyser as a wife. I could not wait to drop him. Her revenge was stupid and stupid, and most of the film was very confusing. Another femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, the coldest person you would ever want to meet. Her appearance does not guarantee that our leading man crosses the monkey and that her acting was so obvious that only a fool could miss her. Definitely defeated. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow to be brought up when she kissed her seduces her husband, playing again like a guy defeated by David DeLuis. Incorporating our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but frowned at our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or I should say the victims, was not that good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He had never been able to get out of the country, and he did. Although I was a man I was furious when both women disappeared. Men, beware of this channel, which puts people down and women get rid of the murder. LMN is a channel. Attention. Note: When I was watching this for the second time, I am convinced of my first thoughts. Especially the writer / director Simon Gornick. I still believe he despises the male species and the horse should be whipped. Only saving mercy in this movie is Tembi Locke, who has no chance to show her talents with the terrible acts of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz, and DeLuise around her. Plus a stupid conspiracy that only makes it worse. Down with the movie Gornick and his empty stars. Please LMN does not show this shipment again.
