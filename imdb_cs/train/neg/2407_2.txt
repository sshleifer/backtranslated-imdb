I looked at it today, partly attracted to all-star casting and partly because I enjoyed so many other films of this film. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of badly cut scenes, where continuity simply does not flow, like a snooker challenge at the beginning. Battle scenes with the natives are about as good as you remembered in those old black-and-white films of Tarzan, you know where you see the lion fly through the air and the camera cuts on a dead native lying motionless on the floor, his thigh. Is it instantaneous death? There are also quite a few unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, as a little girl is rescued when collecting flowers. Too badly animated toys made of clay are too painful. If you see this movie, crabs that are ahead about 5 km / h are highlighted. Somehow, one can get to David McCullum and give him luck. It is as if there was no time to get out of the way, as if the obelisk in the city overturned, the native has all the time in the world to make 2 steps to the left but not scream and fall on him. I only give it to Eklanda. And why is McCullum's voice trying to do the movie?
