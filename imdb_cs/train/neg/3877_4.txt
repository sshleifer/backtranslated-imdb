I just watched The Incredible Melting Man the second time and was even more boring than when I first watched him. I do not understand why it became such a "classical culture" when it is so boring. The opening scene looks promising when a fat nurse runs a canister of blood and runs for her precious life. After what really happens is a melting man stalks around some forests and houses, while memories of his life as an astronaut. Make-up is pretty good and its melting gooey looks pretty realistic. There is a cold scene where he throws a man's head in a river, and it floats until it reaches the waterfall, where it falls on the rocks and tears. There's nothing you can get wet, most scenes are shot in the dark and you can not really see what's going on. There is not much gore there, at least in the DVD Vipco I was watching. <br /> <br /> No, The Incredible Melting Man is not that great at all. I'll give her a token of cheese, but it's about it. If you want a true science fiction / horror cult classic, check out The Deadly Spawn!
