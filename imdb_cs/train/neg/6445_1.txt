When evaluating documents targeting a relatively small group of Ugly ultra-right and conservative groups like this in the US, you need to consider the following. The United States of America with 270 million inhabitants and its complex history as aspiring democracy and its hopes and aspirations to promote human rights has its own shortcomings and disadvantages. Of course, extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups are expected to exist in considerable numbers, but relative to their population size they are very small and isolated. Based on the number of inhabitants in Europe, Britain and even Australia have similar right-wing groups actually per capita, the real size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States. For the above reasons, it is unjustified to humiliate and disparage the American people and its level of discussion in the Educated American Society with a very fraudulent and fraudulent presentation of this ultra-right block of psychopaths as a representative of American society. In this way, Greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups at the opposite ends of the spectrum to create an image of America, which is an outrageous and deliberate sensational lie. This film is clearly designed to fulfill the views of people who have this unconscious and morbid hatred of the American people and the way of life under the guise of the spuristic fashion and clich√© of idealist left-wing ideology. This movie was intended for a profit that was not to support the truth about American society and the state of man. Greenstreet can create documentary films that focus on the ultra-right conspiracy, the military industrial complex, but unfortunately do not provide intelligent and balanced factual discussion, let alone an alternative solution to the shortcomings of living democracy. The film show is exhibited as Anti American thanks to the support of this waste. SENSATIONALISM in his worst anti-US garbage shameful.
