This movie is not funny. It's not fun. It does not even contain one second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead you to be less interested in the character or situation. It is added that it is like a young film as something in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15-year-olds in high school who never really met or had a relationship with a real girl sat down and wrote a film based on false fantasies about what an adult would be. This movie is boring, incomprehensible, and sometimes insulting and abhorrent. It contains at most one or two moments that make you laugh. It also appears to be twice as long as his 85-minute run.
