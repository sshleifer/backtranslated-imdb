Why oh, why do people get good stuff and feel that something needs to be changed? After reading the book on which this film is supposed to be based a few years ago, I can say that there is little in the original book. I went to this film with low expectations - I knew it would have dirty telemovies - but it did not even make it. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. It's not the story of Carlito Brigante, it's the story of a completely different person who got the same name. They just washed out completely in the face of all Carlito Way fans; adding insulting that Luis Guzman, who plays a decisive role in the original film, has a different role. What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been shot, no other film will be created to address the original intact material of Carlito's Way - something I really would like to see. Likewise, I felt about Chopper - they had four books as well as interviews about valuable fantastic material and could make a great biography of the most feared characters in the underworld, instead of filming a horror film about a turbulent, but strangely pathetic, little time step (although Eric Bana's performance spot-on). Now we will never see Carlito's actual initial ascension and fall. The three stars are because when we look at it purely as a separate film, it's not so scary - there are decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but in other roles it may be good) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits his role. But at that time, they completely misunderstood the nature of the underworld (I'm a bit of a crime-fiction buff) - something the original movie and book is right about (written by the then lawyer and now Judge Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The fact, however, is that it is not in itself - it is perhaps the most disappointed prequel ever filmed.
