I admit that my reviews are from the point of view of 2006, almost 30 years after shooting this film and at the time of its conception, it can be a brilliant horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> Starting at Halloween Night 1968, 6-year-old Michael committed a brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later he escapes and returns to his home town to murder again. From this moment on, it is clear that the film will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of each scene is easy to predict as it ends, while the music for each scene containing Michael (the killer) is exactly the same in the movie, thus alerting the viewer to the possible events that follow. For a horror / thriller enthusiast, there is a serious lack of blood / gore compared to modern films, although I am not related to the quantity that is displayed on this day and age. A happier medium was found. There is no unexpected scene from half an hour to the movie. The horror / thriller film is quite typical for the era, and therefore lacks some punch for modern enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> Positive for the movie is its still camera shots and dark lighting that creates a terrifying atmosphere. The second positive friend would be Dr. Michael's character, which will give us the clues to the likelihood that the story can lead. However, it is clear that star Jamie-Lee Curtis is in her career career and therefore fails to provide a truly frightened central victim. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to rate this film as it did in its days, but from other horror / thriller films actually in the 1980s and to a lesser extent in the 1990s, there is a lack of really great horror / thriller film. I suggest that you move and discover classics from the 1980s. Cheers!
