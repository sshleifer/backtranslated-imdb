I am Irish and I lived in Denmark for a while, so I was looking forward to home last week so I could see a break. And I'm going to record when I say: <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS BIG. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as "The Most Powerful Man in Ireland," but it definitely does not stand there with other Irish films like Payables, I went down or Michael Collins. Some aspects of the movie are really quite funny, such as the Colm Meaneys American Guard. But the film itself is in the wrong direction. Jumping camera and constant zooming and zooming tries to give the film a nervous look as if it was a drunken drama. But it's not. It's Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like that. It should have smooth motion from one frame to another. The film simply looks negligent and hand-rolled together. The performances are fine due to the terrible scenario. One of my friends told me, as if it were like Colin Farrell had gone to Dublin for a week. He gives a decent display like Dublin Dirtbag, but it can not be compared with his performances in the Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. Best performance was won by Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who was just expelled by her husband's bank manager for a younger woman. I think she should leave her terrible stall and concentrate more on her acting. Overall, this is by no means consistent with the expectations the Irish press has listened to, or even deserves to be considered one of the best Irish films at all. <br /> <br /> I expect a response to these comments because most of the people I spoke to have said it is great. But before you say, ask yourself: Could he make this film if he was in England or America?
