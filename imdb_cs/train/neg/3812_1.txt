Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so irritating that it's impossible to wear. The best figure is Joey, though sometimes irritating. to mention when Danny begins with his philosophy. Example: The DJ earned in the casino about ten thousand dollars or more. However, she is not eighteen, so she should not gamble by law. ready to pay her money, but then Danny, her father bought it and do not let her take that money because she's not eighteen. Come on, give me a break, okay? Because I saw that it was a stupid and childish scene and I immediately switched off television. Some thing says that in this series the baby would not even buy. Who in the world could think that the Full House is fun and entertaining? Every word they say in this series seems like Shakespeare wrote Besides that Shakespeare knew how to write and besides it would not be childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the Full House script! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart or any bad health or any will to life or any sense of the real world, I strongly recommend "Do not watch the whole house"! episode as a try. Avoid this series. Secure your own from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV show ever! I'd rather watch Teletubbies then this.
