This movie should never be made. Frankly, I must admit that before I saw it, I had serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, though she has done a lot of movies in the Netherlands, and the young woman who played the lead role is a TV personage with a constant smile on her face and not too self-criticism. An actor who played the next major part that I recently saw in "The Bride of Flight," and though the movie is better, he did not believe me anymore. To begin this story, I did not read the novel on which it is based, but the script that undermines the film is something that could be done with the kids having their birthday party on Sunday afternoon, not the same age as the director who likes watching good film. Something overwhelmingly overwhelming was over-dialogue, and it was mostly spoken out loud. My wish to go cameraman, at least he tried to do something about it. It's a shame that the movie is badly edited, if not, some scenes were certainly more plausible.
