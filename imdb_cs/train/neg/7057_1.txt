This is one of the most irritating, senseless movies I've ever had. Every time it seemed that it could get there, another sepia of tones came back, followed by a paranoid idiot that masquerading as a social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, future rebel who lives in the house, seemingly without parents and responsibility. Support for casting is much more enjoyable and interesting, but unfortunately has never developed. We did not really understand John Stanton, who allegedly influenced Maddox to commit a rebellion. At one point, I thought, "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and secretly creates all the communication from an escaped mental patient, Stanton, now we get somewhere!" but of course it will end up not to do that and the whole movie will prove to be useless both from the point of view of Maddox and the viewer. Where's Ferris Bueller when we need it?
