This may not be the worst film Peter Sellers has ever done (I think the laurel goes to "Prisoner Zenda"), but it is certainly the most depressing. Sellers, especially insignificant as Nayland Smith, appear to have undergone chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, he looks barely better and spends most of the film (except for those strangely disturbing scenes where he shakes his electric currents) on the brink of collapse under the weight of the whole makeup. Supporting players also look tired and run away and Sid Caesar's presence is insulting even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (One light point: it would be one of the last moments when the main movie would portray the Asian as offensive ... or again the non-Asian star as one!). The movie looks surprisingly inexpensive, with soup and jar - even the Elvis number at the end looks like a cut. Just the stunning Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous guy who takes his pants wet adds some sparks of life to this sad matter. Overall, this film provides amazing premonitions of sad comic death and perfect documentation of his death.
