That's a bad, bad movie. I'm a real swordsman: believe me when I say it's just that this movie is convincing. This is especially true at the time of the horrific little scene where the swordsmans combine night work with pop 80's. The end is predictable and the movie is a drill from start to finish. Grapes.
