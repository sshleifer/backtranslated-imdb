Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light quickly disappears. If not she, then what other reason to follow. five college children are enrolled to prepare an old dormitory for the due demolition date. Problems occur automatically when a strange person is asking for it and the group is only a few people short. Then he's a killer. Frankly, I wanted to say I'm looking forward to this. She had a fair deal, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga. The movie is too slow and almost as quiet as a library. Most acting is below average, and moments of "point-of-view" are old news. Classified composer Christopher Young of films like "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" recorded this in a repeating line that was better for television. Still, it seems to be higher than the film deserves. So other than Young and Zuniga, this destroys the bottom of the barrel.
