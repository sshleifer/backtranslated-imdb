It's a comedy, but mainly a bad taste, and nothing is done in the movie. The film is about a couple who are looking for a baby, and those real people in this situation will have fun at the pictures that are shown. For example, scenes at the fertility clinic are not funny and are frankly embarrassing. The male leader who plays the builder and in his hard hat is like a bad apology for the Village People's refusal. The female leader is looking 20 years younger than she. Both potential customers meet as unwavering, unattractive and unconvincing. There are a lot of ridiculous and insignificant scenes in the movie, for example, with a budget airline that has no humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for Shirley MacLaine, which is a class above anything else in the picture and one mark for some decent (though old) music.
