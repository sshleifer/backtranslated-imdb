This movie sucks the ass. Something about a hot wave in some European country, a complete waste. The film has nothing to do. maybe 30 seconds of sex, but that's it. There is a very poisonous cat that moves with people and really upset me. This movie is a complete rash and you should not look at it. I regret that it is boring. I would throw it zero, but I can not. No bodies in the right mind should see this. I'm sure you'll regret that I did. How could they think of something so bad? Even the Mystery men were better. MYSTERY MALE. It sucks. The film did not work. total waste of time. The characters in this case are very hard to understand and I'm very very bored.
