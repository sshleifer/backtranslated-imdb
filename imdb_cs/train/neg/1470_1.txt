I watched our DVD tower last night to see something. We were among the NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled out one I never heard before and realized he was borrowed from a friend. The jacket sounded like the "Big Chill," but he felt it might be worth it. I was a bad boy !!! Not only was it like "The Big Chill," it was almost a character. Bill Paxton was a copy of William Hurt ("where have you been all this time") - spoilers warning - and, behold, he will stay behind to take care of the old place (cottage / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk fiddler Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found out that I was wondering why I was even watching these people. There was not enough character development for me to be interested in. How did Unca Lou find these characters after 20 years? Besides, it was not funny, but when Perkins fell, he fell badly out of bed from the first bed, it was a sign and I missed it. At the end I asked my wife: "Was there some cute characters in this movie? ... Are you sleeping there?" She said, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, no one can imagine it."
