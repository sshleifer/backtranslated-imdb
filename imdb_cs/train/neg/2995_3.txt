Only on very rare occasions the episode of the x files does not cause any excitement or the episode does not contain anything that is totally boring to watch. Detective and his former partner die under unexplained circumstances. Death is related to the presence of the girl who was there when she died. Mulder has devised the theory that a policeman murdered colleague is back as a little girl and is a heavy revenge. Now for a bizarre bit. no connection at all and seems to be just a random person selected as reincarnation. I think it was a bit lazy writing writers and this episode ranks among one of the worst in history of x files!
