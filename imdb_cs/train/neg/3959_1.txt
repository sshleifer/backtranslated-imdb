it's not one of those movies, that's one of the biggest tricks I ever have scenes, working with the camera trying to be crazy, but it really just looks like it looks like red boots, but without a sex, the only reason, why i bought it was that i wanted to try a dvd and this is the cheapest i could find maybe the worst to buy in my life and it could postpone dvd forever, soundtrack is really kind and most of the movie is composed of endless repeating clips from the first two films why anyone would like to shoot the movie as awfully as if it were for me if they really tried to make an original movie and failed, I would be better in this review, but they have not only the right to reproduce things from the first two and then edit them and repeat them in this movie for about 1/3 original recording, which is about to the standards of film school students Do not buy this movie. the only fun this DVD can offer is if you keep it in the microwave and watch flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER UNIQUE GUARANTEE! 0/10, if only the voting system allows.
