Korman did not forget because he was very entertaining at the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing a secondary character in Mel Brooks movies ("High Anxiety" Comes to Mind). But he is not a man who can carry movies in duel roles. This is basically "Gremlins" knockoff, following the tradition of such films as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It's not a good knockoff, like "Ghoulies," but with a very light tone because it's not where it's as dark as the movie got. In fact, it's too light and foamy and unfortunately many of the jokes are over. Although I gave him 3 for the score, it's just because it's a movie that's even worse "Gremlin" knockoff. If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know what I'm talking about ... about the infamous "Hobgoblin". This one has a guy who finds a little work in an underground location (I've seen this movie long ago, so I do not remember it clearly) and it's getting friendly enough. However, this animal quickly becomes hostile and, of course, is more of a kind, and that is a movie. More mistakes than hits in the joke department, and is also really lame to see Korman playing the role of evil brother. It is best to skip this option, but then you might just want to look at the kicks.
