This film lacked ... everything: story, acting, surprise, resourcefulness and soul. In fifteen minutes, I looked at the screen and said, "How could all these guys get together and consider themselves friends (even without a girl)?" In the next fifteen minutes, I prayed as much as Amanda Peet. When the wrong film rises quietly, it's a ugly head, the candy's eye is a nice consolation. But there was not much! He cheated on all fronts!
