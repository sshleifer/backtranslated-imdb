I was chasing the movie when I heard it was not referred to an Oscar, but it's easy to understand why it's not. Despite the beautiful photograph, the film is incredibly slow, although it has almost no plot. The plot is about a young boy who tries to cope with the deaths of his parents in what the accident may or may not have been (the film is never clear about) and how his old father told him the fairy tales. Fairy tale fairy tales contain only those interested in plotting, but they are very short and really seem to make no sense. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale is especially about a boy who tries to get a magical flower into his dying girlfriend to save her life, but a boy with a delay by first tasting a flower to make sure it's not poisonous , in which a few seconds are too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then states that the morale is that the boy is too impatient, but that does not make sense because it was the excessive caution and the slowness that resulted in his failure. The perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> Skye shooting is beautiful, but then Stardust, which was released this year, is another film about Skye-made fairy tales and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one.
