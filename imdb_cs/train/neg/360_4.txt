I read a book and really enjoyed it from start to finish. But when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. First, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a woman 24/25. Late Christopher Reeve was also a miscast - the same reason. According to the book, there are about 30 people. I'd like to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red and Elly's trip to see him, because it was an important part of the evolution of character stories. Also, Miss Beasley was disappointed because she mentioned in the book she is Plus Size Lady. I know the movie did not have a budget "Bridges of Madison County" that I believe was released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me it was a very badly created, low-budget movie that was in common. As someone mentioned, I wish Miss Spenser came out of retirement and wrote scenarios for her books as they should be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope Film has left me!
