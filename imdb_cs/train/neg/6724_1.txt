When you select a movie, I hope that one of the factors you consider is film actors who use their glory to influence the moral structure of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement, it is a moral question that affects society. When a comedian / actor looks at sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and father, should we ask ourselves (do I want to behave)? In this case, Mrs. Foxx's behavior is ripped into a social structure that teaches our youth directly from wrong, good behavior, from bad, that kindness is better than hatred. Mr. Foxx should remember that it's just fun and there's plenty to choose from. Let's say I do not miss him out of the hook. They will not unnecessarily hurt or eliminate the bad behavior that spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan. They can not see anything they are part of. We can not change them, but we can stop the glory we give them.
