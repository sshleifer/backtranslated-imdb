After reading all the horrific reviews about this movie and the couple that give it so-so. Finally, I decided to drop my cents. Mostly I agree that if it were not for Laurene Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would be a disaster. He shot in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch, where all true talent had fled south down 77 years ago, at least as long as the gas tank allows. For a moment, I laughed at the reviewers who gently claim to feel a little better than most by claiming they follow the conspiracy without confusion. This story from the Crook Brothers is like an old record by skipping it. As an American, I understand the difficulties faced by Indian filmmakers. A trip to Romania would definitely lose the budget. Let's see that the whole movie was a loop of Claire's loop at the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire under the whip, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire and Claire. It has become almost monotonous and should not be the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but do not write a two-page script and do not change it for an hour, twenty clicks. Before you start writing another ghostly dreaming scenario, watch the episode or two of the Ghost Whisperer or something and get some backgrounds. All players except the above mentioned and several others joined their first and last film. Also appearing director Jeff, who is in all his films. Like Alfred Hitchcock, right? One thing the movie was about is that the cameraman seemed to have a fix on Derri√®re Lauren Lewis. Well, with all the sarcasms that I have now assured, I still recommend a horror film to just see this young actress in the formative time of my career (hopefully) and that Chris Ferry has assured himself as a villain that is worth watching.
