I will not spend a lot of time or energy on this commentary. I just want to add this because all the comments were so positive that I felt like I just had to know that not everyone is so excited, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt to create a captivating philosophical film mystery. Some scenes looked promising, they played with visual dimensions but could not hold the rest. I felt like I was once again stoned and had semi-philosophical interviews with adolescent colleagues. What a futile attempt to lift Dutch cinema to new heights. I'd rather see Jesus as Elias Palestijn, without all the complaints and direct humor, which also raises questions about life and the things that we create for ourselves. Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and will never seem to be.
