3 pounds is, of course, just a self-service program for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / moody deep doctor. Unlike the house, there is absolutely no personality, and unlike Gray's Anatomy, cases of brain surgery are not interesting either. This program should be placed at the headquarters for cases of neuralgic illnesses - nothing interesting or exciting yet! Even the so-called pathetic "conflict" between him and his opponent adds nothing to the show and not even hallucinations. In the cockpit, he briefly saw the social life leading as a father-snooze! boring and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> This show is trousers, there are a lot of medical dramas and there's nothing to make it special.
