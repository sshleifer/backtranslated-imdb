I never played the movie online, but after seeing it, I felt relocated. One does not show up at someone's funeral and says to the survivors: "My relatives have died, so why should I care about you?" <br /> <br /> Minus propaganda, there was little, if anything, we could call "art." As a daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly concerned about the use of deafness as a T-shirt. Any deaf person who felt the vibration of this immense would probably investigate and forget. The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer there are several subjects I would not like: The Holocaust is one; that's another. I wish these filmmakers were not so arrogant (and awkward).
