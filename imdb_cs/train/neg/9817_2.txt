Wow ... pure brilliance. Turn thriller / tension / horror into a comedy. After watching it, I never felt so sad in the horror film before ... a ridiculous conspiracy with three characters that were simply crazy - whether they were written in depth or too deep. If you want to watch a completely written horror movie with a silly conversation, frustrate conspiracy, unnecessary scenes, unnecessary characters, bad sound and poor development in the whole, then it's the one to watch. <br /> <br /> Make sure you are focused on the classic "kitchen processor" and the totally ugly scene of the cops. /> <br /> This is a remarkable new performance and writing with low screen value and crawling all the time makes you either stupid, courageous or courageous.
