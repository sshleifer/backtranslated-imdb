When I'm going to see the movies, I'll stick and watch it, or if I do not like it, I'd go to sleep, but this was pure bullshit, actually I got up and went out! ... It was badly written together I hated it. They also should not take Brendan Frasier, he was much better. This was not as good as I expected, because I realized that I really liked George from the jungle 1 and the graphics were not as good as the first one, for example a bird, and when he sometimes fell on a tree. I hope the director will take this into account, and the other movies he does have to re-evaluate ... terrible! I really would like to give Ursla a job well done when she made the film for it (when I left) ... overall I give this film 2 out of 10
