This documentary document (or I should call it a moccumentary) is a perfect example of how people can be ridiculous when they have something of such enthusiasm. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It's ignorance, it just destroys it. Something positive about it was visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally false and it is really disappointing because it came from scientists and that is why it deserves 1 in 10 and not 0. An example of untrue information might be a hydrogen idea: It is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to produce in such proportions, so in that case, you need a good explanation of what really happened in the dragon's stomach. There are plenty of substances with hydrogen in nature, but there is no need for a loud animal like that to fly, and hydrogen does not seem to be useless, so it's impossible. Anyway, there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: This element is harder to find than gold and I can not explain how dragons survive depending on it. It's ridiculous, they represent kites as creatures with low probability of conquering the planet Earth, but at least for that reason they explain why they were extinct. Probably the cryptologist is called scientists, but they are not. People like them say lies as in this mercenary and what's worst, some buy them. But I do not think that a man who knows about science could believe in the dragons after watching it. Those fake scientists are wasting time.
