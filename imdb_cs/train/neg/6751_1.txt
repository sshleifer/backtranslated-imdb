My friend and I rented it because we thought it might be a good "take-off" of Halloween. A killer terrorizing young people, a white mask ... you get my drift. We were dead wrong! No word game was determined Not only did we discover one of the worst movies but also the classic culture! It is filled with holes and has no meaning. The actress who plays Maddy is pretty, but that's probably it. I recognize that it is shot at a very low budget - I always support such films. Just not this particular. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good if you find out if you are drunk or tall; otherwise do not bother. If you do not want to lose the privilege of a movie like me!
