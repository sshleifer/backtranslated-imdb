After Chaplin created one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen of the Nerve. During the first year in the film, Chaplin gained about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in ad-libbing, editing, gagging, filming, etc. This is happening on a racing track where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without paying. Mabel Normand is also there with her boyfriend, and Chaplin can get rid of her and Mabel's friends. He then made Mabel in the tribune without the obvious consequences of his behavior. Lots of fat, but there is very little that recommends this movie other than watching Chaplin develop. The print I saw was badly aggravated, which may affect his joy. Charley Chase can be seen. * from 4 stars.
