A night girl at a reform school that plays somewhat like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is there when she runs away from her annoying father. Once in de facto prison, the gang is raped by her colleagues "inmates". Excessive (even in 98 minutes), with utterly unnecessary ending, making the film unnecessary. /> <br /> Linda Blair, 15, is doing the best not to show her body when it's unfocused, but she lets the nipple slip out while showering. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *** * *
