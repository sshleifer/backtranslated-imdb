Lee hosted 100 years of horror for Ted News and talked about movie werewolves. He said something that his only lykantropic brush was The Howling II, and then he spied: "The less it said, the better." He was really right because this movie can be very worst in his entire catalog of screen shows. Joe Dante's first Howling was a pioneering werewolf movie with an incredible special effect and his Caucasian sense of style and subject. It was a movie to be taken seriously. Like other good film originals, for some strange reason, filmmakers thought there was a need for more campaigning than what went on for the first time (see CHUD and CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles and miles away from the first on each front. There is absolutely nothing terrifying about that. It looks cheap and is black in most major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the movie that's worth mentioning (well, well, Ferdy Mayne). Lee looks embarrassed when he says unpleasant dialogues and makes ridiculous things (look to end with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what this is, which is a bit more than two potential customers who leave America to go to Romania. The story here is really worth exploring and you can bet that there is a very little story worth mentioning when you have to play Stephen Parson and his band Babel at the beginning and end of this terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here and yes, she's getting worse once, and then we've seen the scene again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten - but maybe it was so bored from my mind). I gave the movie three stars, but it really deserves zero - the three that I gave is 1 for Lee and two for Miss Danning's contributions. Fuj!
