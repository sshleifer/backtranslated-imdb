I find it obviously disadvantageous here. I did not see the first two films in this series, even though I saw a lot of Larry Cohen movies. Fans of the series think it's a good movie. When you judge it, it was quite boring. You never manage to really look at the maniac's face (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was pretty grim. Death scenes seem to represent the most of the films to avoid excitement. Maybe when I saw a cut on the NC-17 director, I can be more amazed. The end of the car with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulana and Robert Davi was quite intense. the best part of the movie.
