I write it because I felt I was convinced that Dark Remains is a good movie. While this is not the worst thing I've seen, it's definitely not good. Weak script, weak actors and weak directors. Even if they can not afford great acting, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive actress? It was painful to watch a simple actress in a movie with her boring performance. The story was cliche and misspelled. Special effects were minimal. Repeatedly used "stretching" tricks were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark Remains are no worse than many episodes of Masters of Horrors. But it's not exactly the same as high quality movies. Dark Remains is recommended only to fans of horror horror who do not want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it is badly created. Just like anyone else, time should be devoted to something more valuable - which should be very easy.
