Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (like Fred and Emily Hill) get a backup for heritage. They use the money to travel. Their lives become exciting when they begin to relate to the exoticism of Betty Amann (for Mr Kendall) and lonely Percym Marmont (Mrs. Barry). But they remain boring as before. Probably bored director Alfred Hitchcock is trying to revive fanciful titles (as quoted in Shakespeare's "The Tempest"), "Rich and Weird" by ordering a scam. Initial tribute to King Vidor "The Crowd" is the pinnacle. The low point may be a few dishes on Chinese prepared cats. *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
