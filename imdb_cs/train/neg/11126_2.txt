Of all the movies I've seen, it's almost bottomless (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble, and several others leave it out of the rock bottom.) It's fast, the story is turbulent, and the events that are displayed are badly done. Of course, we have to put it on the door of the writer's book. The film was filmed after being humiliating and illogical. Oprah gives a delicious look like a "bigger" mom, but it is not nearly at its potential. Other famous artists also seem to be in their worst. A plot that focuses around an African American who has decided to take the job as a chauffeur. They will be introduced to the family daughter's management at the communist dinner. One thing leads to the other and the girl gets drunk. The family he works for is not against the blacks, but they think they are. So when she returns home, she puts her in bed, but starts moving. A blind mother (yes) hears it, so Bigger attempts to silence her, but instead dies her. Now she's afraid she's really having trouble killing a white girl, and doing what a logical man would do to throw her into a coal furnace. So the investigators carry out the case of the missing person and they control the furnace (the idiot had no foresight to get rid of the ashes.) Then he is arrested and the last hours are unpleasant segments of the courtroom. desperate for a bad film, this one could do this job, but if you really want to learn about cultural issues in the nineties and fifties or see good drama, there are much better options.
