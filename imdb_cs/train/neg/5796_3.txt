I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was horrified by the graphic, sado-masochistic child pornography I was witnessing. The story line is hidden under too many graphic sex scenes - and neither is the least erotic - the sick is the more feeling. The director seemed to be shocked about examining different levels of why these characters are similar. Find out if you can make it your stomach - I still have flashes.
