I do not believe they shot this movie. Completely useless. The first movie was fine. But there was no need to continue, certainly not after the TV series, which was already the continuation of the first film. The film feels like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's absolutely simple. Jokes are not found, playing flat, filming like soap, lacking any direction. The first film had a good emotional backbone. Each character had a small arc. It was very simple, but somehow it worked and I saw the merits of this film. But this time there is no coherent story. Characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting will happen. One good thing: a Brazilian boy who plays son Axel Daeseleire is quite well occupied. That was their only moment of creative success in this film. I hear they've already made the second TV series as a continuation of "Team Spirit 2", but please, God, do not let them make a third installment ...
