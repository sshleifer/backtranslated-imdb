Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it has no advantage in terms of own title! In the movie ENTIRE, zombies and vampires fight each other or two. Besides, we are never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One could say that they are trying to "tone it" or make it "realistic", but eventually end up boring. More than half of this movie takes place in a car. Scenes that are held anywhere else are not even very good. There is also no clear antagonist, and you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I would say that for a film with low production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly suited and instrumental (either with original score or with sampled music elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm for independent movies, but it does not seem like it was ever meant for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "Worse than a scarecrow killer."
