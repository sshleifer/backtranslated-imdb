This movie is not as bad as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I'm used to seeing gray CGI blobs and amateur special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very clear that blood is a strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. But I thought I saw all possible minima that the Sci-Fi channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. Do you have a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with a syrup? These are the main foreign vampires in this movie. You can clearly see your fingers inside the rubber socks. The talking hand comes from the guts of the victims, and the vampire hunter's vampire can talk to these rubber puppets in Transylvania. How do foreign vampires learn Transylvanian? And is not Romania in Transylvania? So they should not speak Romanian? Why would a small town have its own language? If you can pause your gag reflex and overcome the talking rubber socks with your fingers moving clearly inside the alien heads; then you have to deal with other foreign vampires. There are "leather surfaces" that want to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are just nasty things that all have plenty of scars on their faces. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their friends who are human traitors and interwoven into space colonies to sabotage defense systems to attack these space vampires. Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth laughing, you have to deal with third-level TV refuses to make this team of stereotypical angry heroes who are constantly fighting each other. Why do almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying, abrasive, rough or just totally indecent? I found out that I hope the talking rubber socks will win.
