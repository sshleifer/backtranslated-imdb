Egyptian films have a lot of high drama or romance or comedy or even sports ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was forbidden in Egypt because it contains nudity (full frontal female nakedness) and this kind of Nahota is forbidden in Egyptian movies .. When I saw the movies I felt ... Fool Story .. Nude actress .. Bad action .. Some horrors and crazy colors .. Dear friend .. If you want to see a great Egyptian movie ... Simply: Stay away from "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" .. We have great movies in Egypt ... We have great actors who have won global winnings like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great directors such as "Yousef Shahin" So believe me, pall .. You do not have to see this movie ..
