This film is considered by some to be a classic - I have no idea why. It's terrible that it's laughter. The only saving grace with this film is the delivery of cheese lines that are so sharp that they are embarrassingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. There are some good songs and good choreography in this movie, but CO CO! There is no conspiracy, it is located in the theater without changing the scenery and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this movie because he said I would not believe how bad a movie can get! He was right. Normally with movies that would terrible recommend that people should not look at it, but in this case I think people should, because it will do any other bad movie that you have seen in perspective.
