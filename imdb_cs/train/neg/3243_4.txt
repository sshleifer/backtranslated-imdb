The most important requirement for any film after confidential tricestreals seems to be that at least occasionally they have to attract themselves, as well as their silly hints, cops, crowds, and (ideally) each other. But this film NEVER pulls it off. Every scam can be seen coming a mile (especially biggen!) Not even very interesting, complex or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this through rapid dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are fine, but they are delivered in a compressed, unnatural, stylized way that I thought we could make some clever point about we all behave all the time ... but it was not. As far as psychological complexity is concerned, the main character is a little suppressed and makes some ridiculously forced Freudian slings about her father thinking she's fucking, but she overcomes her. I really liked street scenes. It looked like a painting by Edward Hopper.
