I wanted to see this movie because I knew it was Christian. The director had a good idea / intention in filming this movie, but it could have been better. I understand why someone still has feelings for whom they believe it is the greatest love of their lives. However, I do not understand why the director made his friends so insidious, stupid and rough. The main character was apologizing to his friends when they were a matter for him. They did not understand at all and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, nor anyone else knew if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married, etc. But they were resolved against the old feelings to be solved. His friends were supposed to be Christians and should be portrayed as encouraging whether they agreed to his decision or not. So many times we do things in life, where we do not apologize to those we have hurt in the past, and when he tried, they were all against him. The ironic part was his new female girlfriend, who accused him of having guarding behavior just because she was looking at an old friend when she did a really special thing to get her name, address and phone number ... it seemed to be stalker !! she did not look like a friend at all, but she looked at herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they should be with, and I feel that the film is doing terrible injustice by the fact that God does not seem to worry about true love ... just that Stay with someone you've made the wrong choice. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what steps you take to improve yourself. Just like I said the film has the potential, but I was tired of a one-sided look that was repeated and stunned the audience with the throats of his so-called ... friendly friends. This film was not faithful to the Christian faith of love, but I gave C for my efforts.
