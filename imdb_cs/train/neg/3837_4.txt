I've seen (too) many movies from this company - this is about halfway through the pack. One good page, her a little more stylized and under control than some of her fares - less of the sophomoric attempts to humor and more adherence to the story (for what its value). Many of their titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried in baaaad performances and amateur sensitivity. On the other hand, I found simulated sex scenes that are not as hot as some of their other flicks (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe, or Mrs. Frankenstein). Misty Mundae is always 10 peter meters, just like Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce in a hot hand and Ruby LaRocca sexy a little bit hottie. Watch it with the remote control in your (free) hand, at night when you need a break from porn. Do not waste your time by checking the story - you have better things to do with your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but it's not bad under this standard.
