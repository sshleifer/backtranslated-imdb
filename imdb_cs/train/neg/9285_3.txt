Since I felt like picking up the new Jet Li movie to see some but digging and helpless hands to fight, I caught this title. Unfortunately, this film contains more weapons of battle (ala Chow Yun Tuk but nowhere near as good) than Jet Li and the acrobatic battle of the company. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But unfortunately I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master or even Enforcer over this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the overall movie score
