This movie is shown over and over on the cable, so .. <br /> <br /> There is no justification for these 2 attractive women who would fight either Luke Wilson or the same gentle 'villian' in this movie. Female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason why this film looks. I think it's "funny" that Luke's even more ugly / dorkier / dumb friend is around, but well, that's what we get. None of the female leaders would ever EVER talk to any of the men in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is that they sob and weep and fight and so on than the 2 guys who were best described on Friday 13th April 4. Dead * @ $ #
