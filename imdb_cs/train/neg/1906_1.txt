They play it on the July 4th Twilight Zone marathon and it's, hands down, the worst episode Twilight Zone I've ever seen. It is completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Although the Twilight Zone is a fairly uneven series and many episodes end in a predictable way, it was completely out of place. Compare it with legendary episodes like "Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun," and you realize there is no comparison. Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and I was frankly surprised that someone in his historical comedy would stand up to this episode. Although it seemed he was making some effort, he needed money ... there is no further explanation.
