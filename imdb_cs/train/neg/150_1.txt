Dude, really !!!! where have you been in the last 20 years, is it shocking in all ways, horror? It's a joke, it's nothing wrong with a low budget, but it's a laugh if you look at the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, Dracula and Frankenstein, Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener Golem, and Ghost Passengers, you can not compare it , giving him a bad name, bad acting, bad screenplay, etc. The total passport and free time, watching a lot of movies, was like my horror favorite everywhere, I'm really not talkin ', I have nothing more to try to look at something so crazy , Please
