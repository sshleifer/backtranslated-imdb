Loss of control is another offer in the genre of erotic thriller, which can be considered the film's pulp. It is usually a roundabout route to a murderous intention, scattered by a great disintegration. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the wonderfully beautiful women who constantly inhabit this testifying world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers from a writer's bout. Just by chance (or is she?) Meet the man (Doug Jeffery) who works with her in increasingly risky sexual encounters. A man refuses to publish information about himself, but Kim firmly refuses to stop this matter. Her agent, Alex (Anneliza Scott), thinks she will do miracles for her books. As with most films of this type, the denomination is coming to an end, but some things are not being added. I've seen a lot of this movie to think there's no change - but I like it. They are so unpretentious. <br /> <br /> The cast performance differs. Doug Jeffery carries the film as a psycho / sociopath that you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good, but she can not convince her that she is a threatened woman. Clay Greenbush, as PI, did not convince either. <br /> <br /> Finally, notice DVD. Both the cover and the disk indicate the R time and the operating time of 93 minutes, but the run time is less than 86 minutes. It probably explains why sex scenes seem shorter and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is shortened just as it begins. 4 stars.
