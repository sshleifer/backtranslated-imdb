Because others have come up with problems with a summary of the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers; I do not understand to filter them out. <br /> <br /> - Because of the low budget of the movie, the creation was good. It's really nice to see a direct-to-video horror movie that is not slathered with a terrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital films is quite granular in some places and is most remarkable in the well-lit white lobby of the shelter. The breathtaking lighting design threatens parts of this film without mentioning changes over time. I understand that the director was probably trying to simulate dementia, but to be effective, a time course should be set. As it is, it seems to be just amateur. - Revitalizations of the drawings were numerous but always predictable. I did not have any doubts about the identity of the fattened cultivators or about the end of the end of a blade of evil - trumpets - a good thing. <br /> <br /> - It may seem like the characters in this movie do not use any sense of common sense. First, the Regulatory Commission would be the entire center of mental health, which unilaterally declared all deaths of patients and staff for cardiac salvage. Why would a psychiatrist be able to do an autopsy? Why was not that a storyline of these impressive qualifications, or the introduction to its special choice of religion? What is the background? What should anyone care about in this? It is equally important whoever in the right mind would go through the introduction, see everything that was terribly wrong with him, and then conclude that it is still a great place to stay in the residence? This film did not even respect his characters enough to give their intelligence a contribution of doubt. Bottom line: See The Wicker Man instead.
