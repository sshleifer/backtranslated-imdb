That song buzzes in my head. Not the biggest song, but it's the 80s. This film is a leading singer who is "suspiciously" killed when she is charged with murder when she runs down to her girlfriend who sings back vocals in her band. The lead singer, whose name is Billy "Eye" (yeah, right), is dead after two years and his band is back for a concert, this time only a backup vocalist. Billy is down and finally goes around killing all these people and scaring the girl and making people around her that it's something wrong with her and that she imagined things. Eventually, he decides to go to the graveyard and dig his grave to see if he is still there. He sees he is dead, but he still sees and hears his voice. By the end of the movie we find out why it all has it, Billy has a brother named John (right again), and John admits he's jealous of his brother and killed all the people to come back to him and blame his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy. The end is very spectacular and the acting is very chrome and wooden. But ... I still like it. I'm looking at the song. I wish I had it.
