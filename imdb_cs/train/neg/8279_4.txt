This film had all the elements to be a smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took a silly journey. Maybe he really did not know who his audience is, but it's barely a man's filming of a cast and plot, yet it's too slapstick and stupid blonde to fully appeal to women. If you've seen Legally Blonde and his sequel, then it's like a terrible sequel. Big actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also do much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller stiffen in supporting roles that are stupid rather than entertaining. Many things in this movie were painting by numbers, various uber-clich√© montages, the last minute of "misunderstanding", even childish chaos. It just suggests that it's a lazy script. <br /> <br /> This movie should be nice if you do not take it seriously, but it's such a glamorous one - better than you probably feel frustrated and still disappointed with the scenes coming back.
