While I totally disagree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfortunate, he definitely is in this movie. It's a shame because I suspect that the other reviewer had to see only a few Charley Chase duds, and he assumed the guy was not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE MOOSE and CO GOOFY PRICES? are very good chase movies, so it could be really funny with regard to good material. Unfortunately, there's nothing in this movie. Even the inclusion of a good Oliver Hardy as a film is no help, as the basic assumption (the boy wants to marry a girl but the girl's father thinks the boy is wuss) and gags are so poor. It's a shame because I really wanted to love this movie, but it could not. By the way, for those who have been using Charley's eyes since the mid-1920s, you will be quite surprised because Chase does not have any glasses or mustache - and it looks as little as you would expect.
