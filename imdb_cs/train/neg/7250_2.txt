After reading the other reviews for this movie, I believe that high markers are probably paid studio students as the movie I saw was totally terrible, with wooden gaming, tremendous scripting and fruitful predictable overhead, one of the few plus points being amazing sceneries because this movie has some stunning backdrops with great sweeping views and dramatic sky and wide open prairies, sadly when the most memorable thing in the movie is the part cited as actors it must be a warning sign as to the quality of the film, and all of the thoroughly unassigned increment to Western genre, which is also a very reasonable price that can be obtained on a DVD, is best to avoid.
