Hmm, Hip Hop music for the West. Modern phrases such as "cool" and too many others to keep track of you. "Sistah are in that house!"? French manicured nails on hard riding. Microphone package Clearly visible on the back of Li'l Kim. I can not continue with the litany of mistakes made by the director and editors. The game is not as bad as I've ever seen. Women have done pretty well with a bad script. It was strange that Louis Mandylor spoke his native accent. Girls are beautiful. Costumes are wonderful, though completely wrong. I can not believe they are stupid what might be a great story. I feel offended by the fact that I think that this film was packed with such adornments that it would play well in the inner city. <br /> <br />
