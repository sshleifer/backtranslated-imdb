Despite the relatively bad reviews, did I have to release this film? it makes it after all the star HK superbabe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all kinds of cat thieves. Are you sure it pays off? Well, as babe-fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as ever, and the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang, capture my roving eye in particular. Unfortunately, if one is to judge this movie by other possible merits, it is an absolute smell! The story is weak, the activity is dirty, and the special effects are totally pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and something else. If Shu Qi is the only reason why you thought you would see this, you'd better watch Sex and Zen 2 again!
