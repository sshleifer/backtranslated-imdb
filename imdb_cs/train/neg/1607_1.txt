This "document" proves that talent is used for reasonable purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government gives her a lack of legitimacy to find the truth about what really happened in these terrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something we Venezuelans do not know for sure. /> <br /> There are ways to lie, and the directors of these things are both omissions and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complex for foreign viewers to understand easily, and that's why. For example, * THE POSSIBLE SPOILS * show Pro-Chavez's demonstrators firing on an empty street (what the hell did they do?) So saying that they did not kill anyone but did not bother to show the pictures that we all saw here opposition demonstrators (and journalists) fell on the other side of this "empty" street dead or wounded. They can not explain why the political police helicopter is the only one who was authorized to fly over Caracas and did nothing against the gunmen who were across the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, which would show how ineffective the precautionary measures would be to protect the president. Several days after the coup d'état, the Chief of Military Guards in the National Assembly (at our congress) asked why they did not fight snipes and said, "Because they were not there to eat the president," is not that a confession? <br /> <br /> There is much more to the fact that the top dignitary army announced that Chávez resigned, and two days later he said he was lying because "that's politics," and today he is the minister of the interior of Chavez's administration. It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies shown in this "document" that were made with the intention of selling the world to the image of good old Hugo Chavez who rules the poor and poorly rich opposition who wants it at all costs when it is true, that 60-70% of people reject his government and this percentage includes the poor. > <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought will be able to see a different version made by a group of Venezuelans who show no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has returned!
