There are some things I can never understand. Like this movie. What if I created a truly inexpensive and miserable Dino model and a crocodile on a polygon in Maya and then continue cutting and inserting into a video clip that people scream and get the same thing? How can anyone even believe that a totally fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place would affect the events in this movie? I know his B-grade, low budget and all but producers could do better than make a piece of crap that nobody has seen or seen. It just does not make sense. Are people really stupid enough to sit over this? Obviously yes. For laughs? No, this thing can not even laugh.
