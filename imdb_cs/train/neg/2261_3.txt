RINGMASTER plays Jerry Springer as a Jerry talk show host, but it's not JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, his guests are trailers, but not trailers that you get on JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, attacking each other but not like ..... What's the point of filming movie about JERRY SPRINGER show and pretend it's not a JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? Plus, it's a very boring movie
