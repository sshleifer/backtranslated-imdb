You do not even ask me why I followed! The only excuse I can come up with is that I'm sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too horrible for words, that movie, not Bronchitis. Richard Grieco is adoring, it's stupid, like a string-happy serial killer with a gun that likes knocking the cops. Nick Mancuso phoned in the show as a policeman on his path, and Nancy Allen could put him in a single sympathetic role throughout the movie. The script is horrible and has a key line: "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco brings each of his victims. Catastrophic. Avoid.
