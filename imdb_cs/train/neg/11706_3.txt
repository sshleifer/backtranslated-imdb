The novel Remarque. Cast that looks great on paper. A left fugitive who struggles to stay in Paris between the wars. Strike officer secret. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that there is no synergy. Pieces and pieces will never flow. Stories about left-wing refugees in France may not be so boring. Read memoir Arthur Koestler "Scum of the Earth" (if you find it). Or his chilling "Dialogue with Death" (ditto). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest in this film lies in some random details. <br /> <br /> Leaders spend a lot of time drinking calvados, Norman Apple brandy. I welcome all the challenges to have myself. It certainly seemed that this film was going faster. According to the film, they are sold only in low-class low-cost salons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. Links to narcotics are abundant here; that he would be interested in the screenwriters. <br /> <br /> I love movies set in France because it can be fun waiting for an inevitable full-fledged alcohol advertisement that will pop up on the wall in the background. I was not disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film would have rated 10 if we only judged it by refining its wall murals. The independent film score is Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if you call it - for his "Emperor Jones" opera based on O'Neill. It was about the same time as the movie version of Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two in Lawrence Tibbett. It should come back soon; they are exhausted from potentially tradable operas to revive themselves. Opera seems to be a good topic to mention here, because the character of Charles Boyer works under his "Czech" aliases. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both of which are important in German opera. Is it just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> The name seems to be part of this movie. Notice that they called Himmelstoss on the phone. Himmelstoss becomes one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier "All Peace on the Western Front". Well, the jokes are all in place; suppose there is no time to develop a path.
