The disappointed music version of "Anna and King Siam" by Margaret Landon, made in 1946 by Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, has Deborah Kerr occupied as a widowed teacher, and her mother, from 1862, comes from England to Siam to accept work as a tutor of the king of children - and maybe you'll learn Royal One or two things in the process! Stagy image starts well but quickly loses energy and focuses. Yul Brynner, who rejects his theater triumph as a king, is a magnificent presence, but is used - as told story - as a coffee. Kerr kept his cool dignity and ride better, even though he had to focus on the vocals of Marni Nixon. Maybe that role is playing to death, it looks like Brynner has nothing to play on the screen. The other half, with Anna and moppets featuring the musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is quite ridiculous, and Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly sawn. Brynner won Oscar for Best Actor, but Kerr, who holds this piece above the water. Excessive, heavy and "old-fashioned" in the worst sense. ** z ****
