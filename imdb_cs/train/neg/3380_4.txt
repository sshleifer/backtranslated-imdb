Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway show ran for years, but proof of his strength and charisma is lost in this film adaptation that most likely results from the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, as far from the B-way as you could get) and the lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays the director-choreographer as a slim corporate lawyer). The slim story about the exhausting bankruptcy on the Broadway show, which turns into the therapy for singer-actress-dancers, is directly pushed to us, a loud, brass talent playing on the back. Nothing is modulated nor a gentle, especially ridiculous subplot about a former dancer who returns to the theater and wipes his head with the old flame Douglas. Hopeful promises are full of promise and hearing, but their personal stories of anxiety are a little embarrassing; this, coupled with the slow stimulation of Attenborough, spell disasters, and even today-famous songs can not break the artificial wrapper. * 1/2 from ****
