I tried to run the movie again twice. I put it on three machines to find out what's going on. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? Did he die while filming and the studio has to copy the sound with someone who does not even feel like it? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes you hear the real voice of the actor. Although most of the movie sounds as good as it was in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to give a copy of this Goodwill if I owned a copy. I rented it, but I will never do it. I check this database before I lend other movies that were (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you got when you watched Steven Seagal. I do not think it's anymore.
