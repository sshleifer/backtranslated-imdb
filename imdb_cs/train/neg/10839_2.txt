This was shown on the biographical channel and was about as informative as a kid's comic! I gave her 2 out of 10 because it's the attention detail, because most of them felt the 70's and the three ladies who played the original three angels looked like them, so the make-up was good. <br /> <This was to be a biography on a biographical channel, but it was invalid of what is normally / usually seen in one of the biographies. No interviews with surviving cast members, crew members, members of production teams, etc., or with their friends, families, and biographies of these people. In fact, I know about the program just like I was watching this movie, which was based on (allegedly) biographical books. If you really learn something that nobody knows about the program and was not well known, it never happened.
