Do you want a great recipe for failure? Go to the fence, add some weak, totally undeveloped characters, and throw in the worst special effects that have a horror movie. Leave for one week (the amount of time you probably spent doing this waste). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that takes bad films into dangerous and exotic low places. The film completely broke. My words can not tell how painful it is to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and have fun with. This is not plan 9 from space. It's a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. When I realize that people have really exhausted their lives to act in this shit, it may be when you say it to him. But than ever, when you're wrong, bad story telling, bad everything, acting is the last thing you'd criticize. This movie is like a huge, disgusting turd that you desire for a quick forgiveness, the fear that a friend or loved one sees it. I could really destroy any copy of the film in any way, so it does not pollute the minds of aspirational creators. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me a new reverent respect for every movie I've ever seen. You showed me what really is terrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are just bad or boring.
