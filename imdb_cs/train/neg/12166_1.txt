Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, it's related to Bruce), the murderer of the first film, is up to his old tricks again. He's one of the Camp Rolling Hills advisors. As long as girls in the camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing are all right. But a few steps across and Angela kills them - making bad jokes all the way. The original "Sleepaway Camp" was an evil and ugly shuffle film, but it had some good points to do. This is also cruel and unpleasant, but it does not have any good points. The plot was at the end of death and it adds NOT NEW to the formula. There are a lot of killer murderers (people are burned alive, heads are cut off, throats are overtaken), but all the gore is so obviously fake that it really becomes comical. It also has the smallest number of campers I've ever seen, and practically everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is a free nude woman (here rendered extremely unattached by Valerie Hartman) and a good little girl / good boy (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the exception of Springsteen and Higgins, acting is miserable - even with sophisticated film standards. This movie is also a cruel edge in which one character is drowned in a building! Boring and sick with a stupid conspiracy, unnecessary nudity and a bad gore. Skip it.
