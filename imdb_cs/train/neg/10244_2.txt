I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and I take the floor, there was nothing about the character played by Michael J. Fox - # 1 just do not go around with pockets that burst theater tickets and $ 100 banknotes! # 2 If I ever let someone use the space for some "afternoon pleasure", I would have fired on the spot! The organization I belong to (Les Clefs d'Or) has very specific ethical standards and behaviors to take seriously. # 3 Similarly, it was a concept at the end of the film that Doug simply removed his golden key and handed it to another employee - we get the keys and it is the honor badge and the knowledge we are allowed to wear them. There is a whole range of apps and scans to join our organization. This film does nothing to distract the unhappy perception of the concierge as nothing but the money the mercenaries have earned. In short, it is bad for our organization. I welcome any comments.
