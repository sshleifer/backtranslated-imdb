I only rate this film as 3 because it is trying to be useful. I love to praise a great movie and I'm not interested in "male" films. The legal blonde was an excellent movie. The rule of Georgia was, on the other hand, an unsettled, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of making films in the worst. I did not care about the lying person until the end of the film, or if something was solved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the movie is good STORY. This story is weak and never evolves (just because the subject is deep does not mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a fundamental change of character and is ready for this change during the movie. There have been changes in character in the Georgian rule that were sudden and un-developed. Secondly, there were too many dynamic characters ATTEMPTED. Getting really good dynamic characters is hard work and takes time (you have only a few hours in the movie). This means that too many attempts at dynamic characters will not have too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written story and the litter of weak dynamic figures, I can not even say that I did not like it. Each character was a mess. That's okay when you write American beauty, but not when you try a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for the human being (no, I'm not cutting her because she was angry, everyone is all, and we're all responsible for our own actions). "Dudley does the right" child Mormon should have the courage to not compromise his religion and commitment ... and Simon, I mean seriously what kind of guy allows a 17-year-old girl who has been harassed, just sometimes stays (if not an actor or a politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to recall what good movie production is NOT!
