I am a fan of Shakespeare and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh did to bring Shakespeare back to the new generation of viewers. This film, however, does not reach the overall intentions of the game with absurd musical sequences. Add this when Alicia Silverstone is struggling with the conversation (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in "Much Ado for Nothing") and other misplaced roles, all equal to the unbearable endurance of the observation.
