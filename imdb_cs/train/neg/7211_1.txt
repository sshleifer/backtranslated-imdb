I grew up and watched Inspector Gadget. It was and still is one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to slip on the banana bark and become the biggest detective. <br /> <br /> But the movie destroyed the reputation of a wonderful cartoon. Matthew Broderick, a potential actor, was certainly not the role of Inspector Gadget. The first thing - Gadget inspector is smart in the movie. Not so in the cartoon. In Gadget, the mystery is mostly solved by itself. In the cartoon it was almost always Penny, Brain and a wonderful book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was a coincidence. The gadget in the movie seems to be a competent detective, but it was pretty silly in the cartoon where the humor came from. The other thing is that it's too much "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. It's not just a silly Saturday morning. Also, Gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. I also miss the real gadgets that the Gadget and especially the Gadget have. It was a clever cabriolet in the movie. The cartoon was a sedan police car and could be turned into a van. He barely had some gadgets and was mainly there to get him out of his way. But if anything, the only thing that was terrible in the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a silly cartoon on Saturday morning. The film was too serious, too exaggerated, too much conspiracy and not even fun. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who did not see it: NEVER do not see it. AT ALL. Watch the cartoon, it's a real classic.
