I watched this movie really late last night, and usually when it's too late, I'm really forgiving movies. Although I was trying, I just could not stand this film at all, it was getting worse as the movie went on. Although I know it's a comedy, but I did not find it very fun. It was also a particularly unrealistic and exhausted picture of rural life. If someone thinks that life in the country is, it certainly is not. I have to agree that some band members were cute, but the French guy was really fake. I have to agree with trying to have a good lesson in the story, but overall, my recommendation is that nobody cares for more than eight, it's too unpleasant.
