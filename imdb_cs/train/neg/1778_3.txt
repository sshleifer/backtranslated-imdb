I have nothing against a rapid dark flash, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is too freshly clean, too bright and modern. The plot of a new teenage boy in a small town, the Sleepwalker, a sort of cross between a vampire and a werewolf, feeding on the blood of female virgins, asks for more mysterious and ambiguous treatment. This thriller has an inappropriately colorful look and feel, with almost no atmosphere. Kids are predictably nice and energetic, but Alice Kridge is a big plus as the boy's mother; Kridge from "Ghost Story" never escaped from the feminine form and it is a huge loss that it was not used anymore. Her performance is spooky and intense and suggests that "Sleepwalkers" could be a much better film with a different focus and stricter direction. It's too far-reaching and commercially driven, with unequal tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King appears in a buddy as well as real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 from ****
