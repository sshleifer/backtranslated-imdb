We remind you, this film, though a very bad story, was one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... EVER. Just remember that before you sit down on the sofa to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> So officially begins the party. Just an average party, but there's a guy. She's quite in Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; it will help later. <br /> <br /> So Kate finds George Clooney (I did not say the story was bad?), so he takes a pipe. It's the underground night in London, but she's just stupid. So the schedule says the next and last train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, a silly little girl who is, decides she can sleep in a spare 7 minutes. She usually misses a train and finds himself in a London Underground. Sama. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie just comes from here. Blood, intestines, limbs, even some parts of the body that I do not mention, are crumpled, dropped, and eventually amputated from the body. In short, it is a typical horror; nice but strong girl in women in need and sick, strange psyche. Creep. <br /> <br /> I think you will do it if you are at Saw, Hostel or Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for others, Scream will satisfy horror needs many times.
