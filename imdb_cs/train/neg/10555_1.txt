First of all: I love good Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero budget is none of that! The quality of the picture is so damn low, the soundtrack I've most poisoned sometime (!!!!), heard, and when it comes to FX ... and the super low quality makes some of them look as bad as they would in the real movie (what this does not require). No concept, slim story, primitive acting, and rare dialogue - I think I had around 10 sentences in the film, each repeating about 20 times ... the same for many movie sequences (it may be a mark for what kind of viewers it does !!!) The story seems to be such that the young boy had to watch his father's rape and kill his mother, mentally impaired, and the adult travels through the tournaments and performs as a show of self-mutilation. So far, it's so good ... But for these pseudo-art-idiot directors, this conspiracy is just a line that brings in a series of cheap production shocking scenes that have neither a message nor make sense (freshly cut guts are throwing naked, a bound woman in a land hole ... why? and why is it the only time you see a woman and throw in the whole bloody "movie"? Anyone who confuses this cheap gore-show for art should visit his psychiatrist as soon as possible, or watch Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how to resolve this work artistically ... I hope this was your first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all you scared about, remember: Not everything that looks cheap and obviously makes no sense is automatically "art" ...
