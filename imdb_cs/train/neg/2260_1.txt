Oh, dear, Jerry can be an unmistakable king of talkshow, but the movies are a whole different ball game and he is eliminated from his league. The script of this film is so poor that it has to be seen to be believed and it is sad to see such vaguely known actors as Michael Dudikoff (80th action B'movie King), Michael Jai White (Last seen on Sci Fi flop Spawn) as well as William MacNamara (who is involved in a single half-fun situation throughout the movie!) If you are a fan of Jerry, then hold on to your TV show because it's total waste for an hour and a half. to capture the last half hour of Rocky's 5 on TV, which seemed like a movie masterpiece compared, I think it says more than enough! <br /> <br />
