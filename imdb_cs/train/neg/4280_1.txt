This must be accompanied by a special assessment and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. Obsession of Daneliuc with those dirty bodily functions becomes a real nightmare. It is also obvious that a man is a misantrop, hates everyone - his country his people, his actor, his work. And this hatred is blind, and he's already forgetting the vocation he knew long ago. This so-called "film" is just a haunted chain of disgusting images, without artistic value and professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and good sense. Shame, shame, shame!
