One of them is the highest rating I could give the movie, given that zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee tis, the unnecessary mess of the movie with a lot of unnecessary B-list actors who did a better job was written and directed by a guy with the mentality of a twelve-year-old man who mixes and giggles on silly jokes and jokes and funny jokes. For example, Gene Stapelton (All in the Family Ding-Bat), characterizing the character of Marilla Henner's "sex in both directions," was a cheap attempt at humor that testifies to the general looseness of the movie ... Do you want a good humor? Rent an animal house, American cake (first part only), old school or office space.
