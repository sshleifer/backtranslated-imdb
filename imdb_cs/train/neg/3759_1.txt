Where to start. The cinema was great. When the film first began because of the initial landscape scenes, I thought I was in a good movie. Then Cgi Bigfoot appeared. It looked like a cartoon of King Lion and King Kong's drawing of a loving child. She completely discarded the credibility of the character. Now I knew there was not a Bigfoot that chases people who walk around the forest for no obvious reason but a cheese cgi cartoon. So since then, the whole movie has been shot for me. The money that had degenerated down to the toilet for a cgi that they could spend on a costume like Roger Patterson. It was the best Bigfoot costume that no one else had ever met. I'm a hard fan of Bigfoot fans and I was warned about this movie, but my pressure led me to watch this movie and I was disappointed as I warned the previous warnings. I know that after reading this review you will still say "I have to watch Sasquatch hunters have to watch Sasquatch hunters." Then you will say why I lost my good hard earned money for such an incredibly bad boring movie!
