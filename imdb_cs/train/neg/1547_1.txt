I could name a bunch of funny movies. There are comedies that have come out to be funny and they are. Some movies, such as Gymkata, are trying to be serious but ultimately funny. A female man is a film that is desperately trying to be humorous but could not be less fun if it was a man who had a lot of chickens in the middle of the destruction of the nuclear holocaust. It is funny. I do not think I laughed more than a taste for something in this movie. It's just not working. It's boring, stupid, sad, annoying, sad, but not fun. Impatience with Tim Meadows or this SNL character, but I expected it better than this. The film completely lacks logic or common sense. It's like a writer had a sack over his head while he was writing and he could not see which keys he struck. They call the "origin" of the Ladies Man, but they do not include the motivation for his bizarre fascination with behaving like the 1970s. The film is trying to get the humor of a man who seems to be enjoying pornography shortly after trying to hang. Is it a comedy? I like to have fun with a nice sense of humor (a lot of time I do a comedy like me), but maybe I was not quite clear about this movie. Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker in Something about Mary, is terribly wrong. I prayed with him in my head to silence. Eventually I pounded on a chair, mumbled under my breath, and the film was gone, probably trying suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen is coming. <br /> <br />
