I should have thought that no film with Poltergeist would be good in it. In fact, it is starting to get right, but during the first murder you will find that the movie you are watching is the movie inside the movie. The movie is watching people sitting in the cinema. One girl in the audience is so uncomfortable that I turn around and strangle her. A little weird, but far from good.
