Archival footage is abundant. The model aircraft moves from wires in "action scenes" like so many dragons in the wind. The usual sequence of mapping tattoos of the movie to supposedly dragged us into the event in Malta. Guinness must have his worst performances at all. Shocking shots in the fight against dogs are laughter. Hawkins scare us all to death in the area of ​​map rooms. Ealing did a lot of great movies. This is clearly not one of them. They should give up such an unconvincing rot!
