This tremendous waste of production money is a film proof that wealthy and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a silly play by Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey's directed (playing dead) and playing Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project shot in a magnificent cliff on a mountain island in the Mediterranean Sea had to look like a fiery winner when introduced to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that it almost defies faith. Visually, the film is magnificent, but it is the power of nature that allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. Taylor's gruff fingerprints, Burton's half-sleeping tussle, torn dialogue, Noel Coward laughing at himself, a ridiculous story and plot of devices, and absurd costumes simply irritate the viewer. BOOM is shame, a loss of money and talent and clear evidence that the praises of famous people can be idiots just like other planets. You do not even have fun. Just terrible and crazy shocking waste.
