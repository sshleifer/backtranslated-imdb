I question his importance for Queer Cinema, because it seems to be rather about meeting a homosexual through violent behavior rather than making a clear statement about homosexuality and violence. The three stories are tied together in a rather casual way. I found out that I was trying to wake up the mischievous story in the first 15 minutes, it did not fit with me. Poor plots were repeated repeatedly, as if we did not have to get the first ten times. <br /> <br /> The whole movie felt like a stuffed dialogue. Like a 45-minute Boy's Brief short, rather than a complete movie. She had a certain erotic taste, male nudity and sexual attraction, but the total amount is not equal to its proportion. The first part: The Boxer / Stalker story was the strongest and yet it felt like it was pulled thin. Bob has watched Tim for four years now and confronts him now? It seemed to me that their game of cats and mice was not sufficiently developed to deserve its conclusion. We needed more information about them and less scenes with Locker, where Tim tirelessly said, "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> The second part: Danny wants his friend, Tony, to beat him when he gets up. Tony does not seem to mind, but he does not even care about looking at the consequences of his homo erotic hobby - even after they do it naked. This story lacks a versatile transition from "I'm a straight boy who hurled my boyfriend around for fun" to "I think I could be gay and beat him because I'd like to expand his ass and make him a S / M style." It is a very important thing to omit it. <br /> <br /> Clearly, these stories could have transferred their points in half. The third part, with a man and woman celebrating around, adds to this idea. Moreover, it was useless and nothing was added to the movie. Yes, the actors under these circumstances did a great job and the four men were very sexy. But make-up (bruises and scratches) was on the same level as a talent school. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat for this story that had an impact on homosexual politics. The film made no statement, did not waste time and was not interested or worthy of a thoughtful investment. His fatal mistake is her amateur approach, which eventually makes it impossible to take seriously.
