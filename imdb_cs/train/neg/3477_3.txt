Not as bad as you've heard. There are actually some funny parts, and Affleck and Applegate have a fairly good chemistry. Applegate is particularly tempting and affectionate as Affleck's loving interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are perfect professionals. They are pretty good at everything. Ultimately, "Surviving" is not the worst holiday film you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is not blurred and much of the comedy is forced. Attempts to dark humor look dull. Affleck is harshly striving to be completely spasmodic and overwhelming, but he finds himself disturbed. His character's caricature nature is brought to great relief when he looks alongside Gandolfini and O'Hara's more subdued, credible performances. Even according to the relaxed holiday film standards, you have never fully purchased the Affleck "lease" of this family for Xmas. There are also scenes that bordering on unreal in their peculiarities. X-mass scene full of collector's humor (the discovered son looks at naked, provocative pictures of his mother) that it's not only funny or believable, but also disturbing. To make it even worse, the colors in this movie are muddy, almost none. The house on which most of the movie takes place looks scenic and inexpensive. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is mostly interesting as the fourth in box office duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and this) for Affleck. It remains obvious how permanent it will be.
