Well, answer the question of one person: "Why does not the film remember anybody?" It's because, really, not so many people who saw it in 1978 and have not known much since then. (If it's a video that would be a novelty for me!) Even at the time of the sometimes absurd comedies that were in the seventies, moviegoers had been miserable to avoid this film. If they do not love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "it" a lot! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more entertaining on Bewitched or Hollywood Squares than here. Joan Rivers at this time in her career was laughing to make harsh jokes about the lack of weight of singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also seems that every "little" famous name of the time is in the cast. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts later "Everybody Loves Raymond.") Anyway, a bit of a good idea for a story, a person who gets pregnant instead of women, will drop out. With the help of a friend, Crystal sets up a prostitute to lose her virginity, but because she was "upstairs" instead of him, she got pregnant! (Commentary on women who take power from men). <br /> <br /> The crystal stomach grows, going through all female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately, he is now socially poorly elected! It is attacked by a mob who wants to exchange it (I think). He is forced to go to the seclusion to keep his baby ... in the barn. Or, if you want, jesle (God only knows where it might end up! Ewwww!) It turned out that there was no shock that she was a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is worthless and unforgettable, humor is at college or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and a few good touch and important moments with Billy Crystal. Do not forget the rest of the Rabitt test, it's a lot of time! <br /> <br /> I can not believe Roddy McDowell that I joined! (END)
