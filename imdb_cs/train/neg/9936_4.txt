I chose it for 50 cents on a flea market, was quite excited. I found this fascinating about 15 minutes, then just repetitive and boring. It's a neat view of Mick and the gang in their main, I wish there was not so much more than a dubbing of dialogue, so I heard what they say and play. Skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, classifying poorly written Monty Python on Acid. I spent more time looking at the late 1960s England back down rather than what really happens in stupid skits. This movie is a good reminder that times really change and what is important quickly becomes simply stupid. Good song, but now it's released on this DVD.
