I can add up to 20 words or less to this movie. It's too predictable story line with the potential to be funny but instead falls on the face. Look, 19 words, but I have not moved with this star with just one star, but instead I decided to break it down to two stars because Julie Bowen smokes hot and provides just enough eye candy to fail me rip DVD directly from the device and blow it out with the M80. My advice, take a $ 4.00 payment for the $ 4.00 payment that you would pay for seeing this movie and send it directly as a deposit, thank you for saving time and frustration that you had to sit with this wreck train, or you might want to send my $ 50 replacement fee you would have to charge for choosing twelve gays to use this waste as a shot.
