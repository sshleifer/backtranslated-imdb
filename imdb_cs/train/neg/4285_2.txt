If you want to recharge good Jason Scott Lee, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: Bruce Lee's Story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision" is a horrible movie. Huge production values. Wonderful acting. An amazing scenario. I do not want this movie to be watched by someone who seriously believes this is such fun, or what progress is made in Asian American consciousness in Hollywood (This movie does not even.) <br /> <br /> I would say at least , that this movie is fun fun on a rainy day if you ever encountered it while surfing the canals. If you're curious, maybe rent from Netflix, but this movie is definitely not for maintenance. If you are one of the few people who have watched this movie as a means to increase your Asian American film reputation, and I came disappointed, I recommend the following movies for your personal viewing. These are well-written high-productive films that feature talented cast of Asian American actors: <br /> <br /> Better luck tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
