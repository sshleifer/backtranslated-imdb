It's a well-worn tale about a man who got married to escape the string, and then claims to be "tortured" by his reluctant bride. Managed to be sexist and racist at the same time. We never know why a woman who received the Indian warrior's honor is totally incapable of fighting her former husband. Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a "real man" in the saddle when she seems to have looked after things that are good in themselves. It just made sense in the fifties of Hollywood. There is a really silly scene where he is traveling, and he actually caught the whip - the second time - and then he pushes her out of the horse. It does not matter that he would have lost his eye for the first time, which would be quite difficult to catch the whip! Then she will win in the fight against her Indian bodyguard, where she spends the first two-thirds of being beaten to the flesh. This is a second wind. Later he successfully deals with some bloodthirsty Indians (as they all are in these films) after refusing it, now is his "squaw". It does not matter that he has zero diplomatic skills and has been dealing with them for many years. And the way she still rejects her attempts to seduce her just to keep her interest and let her hold on to her - yes, well. Like women, they're going to throw it all the way. <br /> <br /> Finally, none of them is convincing in their roles. Madison is just a fool who has unrealistic luck. Fleming plays his hair and frowns a lot, but he is totally unconvincing as a fire boy. The only reason you ought to root it is that you want Madison to get stuck on a fugitive horse and pull the cliff before the end of the movie. The way Madison pays Fleming is so predictable and has so little hindrance that it turns out to you if you see women as anything but blowing dolls. Even if you see them as dolls, the total absence of tension will make you bored. <br /> <br /> The total loss of time. Even the landscape is somewhat boring. Give this big lady.
