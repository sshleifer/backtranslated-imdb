STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey before the name became synonym for character in The Simpsons) is (typically) an unorthodox policeman who gets results but welcomes his superiors to something rotten. To prevent his partner from being killed at the start of the film, the conspiracy instead turns around and sees him being assigned to travel to Mexico, where he was transported to a top American super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities. be held hostage, along with the crew, the target of the gang. <br /> <br /> This cheap look (even the 80s standards), boring little action movie was a bizarre career step for Gary Busey after having made the impression of the flame hair of villain Joshua in Lethal Weapon. He's just going through the movements with his cardboard figure here, as always (with his "brother" being his trademark for the remaining guys), but without material to support him. Henry Silva is present as a screensaver, but there's a whole miscast as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) And a terrible script gives him some really clumsy lines of boring dialogue that make his performance look like a mix of wood. It's just one of a series of action actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick who appeared but did not add anything to the mix. After the boring first half without a great exciting hit, things are eventually upgraded, but it is too late and none of them has the task of being some fun. * *
