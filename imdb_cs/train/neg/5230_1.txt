Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are asian and amateur and just fun, if you are not 14 years old, with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not famous because its immature fans would like you to believe, harassing people on Wikipedia, or voting on the IMDb rating here. He certainly was not profiled by any significant media outlet that talks about his series and his work. <br /> <br /> Benfer has some insignificant skills in limited animation, but he has to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some real amusement material before he will be taken seriously as a real entertainer. From this moment on, however, he is only a child with a camera and shows it.
