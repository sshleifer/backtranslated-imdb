There are some really great ideas in this violent movie that, if it were clearly executed, could highlight it from Spaghetti-Western blandness into something special. Unfortunately, TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies you can imagine! The scenes begin and end suddenly, characters leave long stretches, performances (and accents) of actors are quite inconsistent etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) Revolutionary who, after attending to destroy the village, remains a priest !) ... Ten years later, the village governs the "mayor" of Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens comes to look for revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau comes to look for Shawa. Everybody screams at each other and a lot of them shoot. Fernando Rey is also in it (as blind). Performance is not bad, but it's very uneven. Savalas sometimes has an accent as Landau (which really grows here). Shaw and Rey show that they can not really stand up for themselves and Stevens looks quite ruthless (if there's a bit out of place between the dirty dirt).
