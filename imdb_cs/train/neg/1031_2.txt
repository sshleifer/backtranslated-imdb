This movie is a long chiche after another. First, although they did their share, there is an unauthorized dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. It sounds worse than the old Beatle cartoons. John is an ugly, jealous, boxing homosexual, a slave to Yoko, which is portrayed as discredited by Albert Goldman. Even in regular conversations they keep tough tracks, "it was always just two of us!" John would not even be that way for his fans. Just as his death showed us to be too nice, if ever. One funny scene is where a stupid fan of Beatle recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Dinner. Damaged John says something like, "Sure, and if I act, why do not you go to your knees, you will not leave your wife's wig and olinize my liggin." That made me laugh for days. Indeed, this movie is fun to be serious about trying to be ridiculous. John and Paul also did not pontificate all day long, they were funny guys with a light heart who even broke up during The Beatles where they were much better outlined. Forget it.
