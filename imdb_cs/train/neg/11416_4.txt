The fact that this film is entitled to the most successful film in Switzerland is shaking my head! It is true, but at the same time pitiful. The Swiss army might be much better off. The story sounds interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) was forced to get rid of his military training by the army while in church, his holy love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). Playing in some way does not really differ from just a few recruits drunk and stoned in reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as a strong Michelle Bluntschi average, I personally found her rather uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The story contains comedy combined with romance that does not work as expected. The romance-part is too cruel and the comedy-part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap attempt and does not change in the whole movie at all. It's funny for pre-adolescent 12-13 years, but not for those looking for fun comedy. Humor is weak except for a few shots. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cold! Stealing? Cold! If you want a real comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you have not disallowed military training, and do not even expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give it 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is quite amusing during his screen. It's not much hell on the screen
