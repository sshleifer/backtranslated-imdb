This movie made me very angry. I wanted to suppress the "scientist" and the invisible filmmaker desperately during its course. Very, very painful when you sit down. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. Little good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in the new age of horses sh * t. The worst offenders were scary Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people are leading the mediocre of life and clearly suggests that, on the other hand, they live on a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes with which I agree in essence are presented in such a difficult, clumsy, superior, demanding sermon that I felt the desire to reject them. I think I was so angry that they accepted what are really deep aspects of established scientific thinking and that they were disturbed by the new age of hokum. Much of this is based on deceiving the application of quantum theory concepts to the macro world. Sure, the dramatized portion with Marlee Matlin is amateur and clich√©. <br /> <br /> I call people instead of an excellent science research by Bill Bryson: "Brief history almost everything." There are many deep astonishes about life and the universe in real, established science.
