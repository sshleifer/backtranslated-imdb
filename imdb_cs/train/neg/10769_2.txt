I found it on the shelf as I stood and bored. How can people give 10? It's not just that it's a really good movie (for example, I think) because it does not work at this level as well. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible behavior; there is nothing. Harvey Keitel is decent, but he has nothing to do with it, and Bridget Fonda and particularly Johnathon Schaech are just terrible. The progression of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to go some way and did it without really writing the pieces to get it moving. It's only an hour and a half, but it's 90 minutes of your life, you'll never come back.
