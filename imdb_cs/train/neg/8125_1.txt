"The Bat People" is a really bad movie that deserved the treatment of MST3K as well as the other movie "The Creeping Terror". We're in some mountainous terrain full of bats. We see a lot of things, like bats flying and attacking and occupying, pursuing wagon chase, accidents on alert, and much more! This all, plus the cheese average of the 1970s (hey, I think "Mitchell" here!), Doing "The People Bat" actually one of the best of the latest "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes made in series! Moviewise, it's terrible. You should avoid them as if Tom Servo and Crow have watched with you. <br /> <br /> "Bat people" - like "bad people !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
