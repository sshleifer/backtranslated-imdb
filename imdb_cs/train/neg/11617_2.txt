This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and completely useless. In fact, I shudder when I think there are people who would like to watch him. Without telling it, it's a young boy's reaction to a newborn sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the movie, the viewer is exposed to some of the most disturbing ideas. Adding an insult to injury, there is absolutely no real outcome to the end of this film, except for the fetus of pure evil in the hands of a child who had nothing else to overcome a whole group of silly adults. There is no redemption, no justice has served, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is happening around them. Frankly, I did not like to watch this movie. It was very worrying. Even for those who can enjoy horror films, this movie could be too. Despite the fact that this film was successful, the story itself is so disturbing that watching was equivalent to a 90-minute wait in a dental waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedures.
