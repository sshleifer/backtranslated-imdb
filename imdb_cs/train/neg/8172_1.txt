A cannibalistic assassin on his back is on a puddle, and two flaming pairs could be his next source of protein in this business basement on Friday, the 13th clone left. There is literally nothing interesting to see in this, the murders are surprisingly sparse and when it happens, it's totally amateur. It also adds ghosts to the mix for no reason what ever. I felt as if my brain had liquefied and my nose was exhausted. And undoubtedly Donald Jones's worst film remains. If you think you rented it because of a brand new DVD re-release that we managed to copy Code Red, you do not have to bother. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
