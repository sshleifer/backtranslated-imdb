The basic premise of the film is a political cartoon. I suppose that for those who do not know anything about the reality of the army, it is probably a "good feeling" about gender equality. The last commentator actually said: "It allows women to know they can do anything they want to do." What a shout! Nobody, a man or a woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "dresses" at Seal Hell Week in the early 27th week of the BUD / S program at several local gymnasiums, and her desire alone is SEAL will not do it so . There is an 80% downtime in what is probably the most brutal military training program - those who voluntarily fall out, can not compete physically, suffer frequent bodily injuries during training or can not cope with psychological harassment. I have never been to the superficiality of the imaginary, imagined message of this film. In the real world Demi did not take the first 24 hours in this hard and lasting physical training. She wishes it was not. Skip this film as a wish and spend your time by reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of what's really going on in this training. Ring the bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
