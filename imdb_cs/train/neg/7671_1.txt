The movie begins with a scrolling text that takes almost five minutes. It contains a basic summary of what is happening. It could be easy to do with acting, but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you've been bombarded by the characters you're learning about, remember that you'll know everything about them. The beginning falls to the ground and then collapses with the whole movie. Not only did the plot change, but maybe you even wonder if you're looking at the same movie. I've never played a video game, but I know people who have it. From my understanding of whether you played the game or not this movie will not get better. Save money if you do not like to sleep in theaters.
