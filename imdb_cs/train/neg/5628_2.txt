I'm not artistically inclined. I am a scientist and I feel that this movie is perhaps one of those budget camping camps. I watched it with my fiancé and my future daughter. We tried hard to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My fiancé and his daughter voted it and we moved to the ocean for 13 years, but that's another story. To get lost, I woke up in the morning and shot another shot. I started to watch this movie again seriously. I just could not do it, I thought I'd do it. I thought the most fun part was the rinsing of ash and the urn that found a place at the fireplace that was used as a vase for what looked like dead flowers. Interesting and still dead things inside. It was a strange and bizarre movie. Maybe it was what they were, but they will not be cheated for a second time!
