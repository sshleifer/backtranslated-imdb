It was great to see some of my favorite stars thirty years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked amazing. But it was. They were not given any characters or good lines they could work with. I did not even understand what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in the small side. They showed some talent, and it's sad they did not go for more and better movies. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten was given the opportunity to act on this one major film role. The movie seems to have some fans and I was very open when I started watching it. I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovic and I enjoyed the last movie "Cat's Meow" and all his early films from "Targets" to "Nickleodeon." So I was really surprised that I was barely watching this. Ironically, this film is about a detective agency where detectives and clients are romantically involved. Five years later, Bogdanovic's former girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd, was hit by a television series called "Moonlighting," which has stolen a story from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in the fact that the series relied on a lot of humorous dialogue, as it tries to do with the slapstick and several screwlines. Bottom line: It's not "Paper Moon" and just a very pale version of "What's Up, Doctor".
