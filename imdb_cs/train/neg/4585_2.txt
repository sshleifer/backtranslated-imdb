I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this film, but he was relatively ignorant of quantum physics except what I remembered about the excellent "Short History of almost everything," and what I could alleviate in "Brief History of Time," It sounded occasionally interestingly. The apparent nonsense of the story of the Indians who could not see the explorers' ships was ridiculous. I really began to question what was happening at the time, but then it was the revelation that one of the speakers actually "directed" a beating called "Ramtha," that made me quite upset. <br /> <br /> What waste two hours.
