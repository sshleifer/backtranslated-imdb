Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted food critic, whose glamorous, overwhelming mother moves with her. JJ, furious at this event, then blackmails restaurant owner Alex to entertain his mother in exchange for "maybe" viewing his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls to his daughter while warming his mother. There are many problems in this movie, characters are universally two-dimensional. JJ is a self-serving, hateful figure, her mother is shallow and shallow. JJ colleagues in the magazine are scorching and opportunistic. The fundamental message of a woman over 50 who does not manage it without a man's help is bad, bad, BAD. The hearing is evenly boring, the screenplay is inconspicuous. Movies that just save grace are New York settings. I would not like to recommend this movie.
