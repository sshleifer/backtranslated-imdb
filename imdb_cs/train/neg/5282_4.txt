I have to admit that I am very disappointed. This version can not in any way compete with the 1995 version. The reason I followed was that I was not entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the captain I imagined when I read a book. And he was, too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is the only buy of the quality of the film. The rest is like Un-Austen-like. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would not let NIKDY walk through Bath Street like this. It was not her character, and she was not the daughter of those times. Anne Elliot of the book was a lady, and she had dignity. There are more painful anachronisms, but that was the worst. Although there are important quotes from Book 3, they are in utterly inappropriate moments and warn those who know the book that another important part of the book will either be missing or will completely change. And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it seems as though it all divested. Very little attention was paid to the presentation of characters, to show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they eventually expel the final scenes in this way? Catastrophe! And she was not so beautifully photographed as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, then do not collect time with it.
