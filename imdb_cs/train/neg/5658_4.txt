"Laugh, Clown Laugh," released in 1928, the stars of legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. These raised his mistress (young and beautiful Loretta Young) into adulthood and is named Simonetta. These raised the girl in the life of the circus, and she became the perfect ballerina. While Chaney is doing his usual brilliant performance, I could not overcome the fact that Tito, now middle-aged, has Simonet's youth. Even though she is not her biological father, he raised her as a daughter. This kind of "ick" factor penetrates the whole movie. They compete for the affection of Simonetty with the young and handsome "Earl" Luigi (Nils Astherem). Simonetta clearly falls on a young man, but feels guilty of leaving Tito (from loyalty, not from romantic love). The whole assumption of the movie is ridiculous, and it's amazing that no one in the movie told Tito what a stupid old fool he is (until he shows up at the end). The film is remarkable only for Loretta Young who would have a great career. While I admire Chaney's brilliance as an actor, it seems to me that this whole movie seems totally scary.
