Connie Hoffman is very nice and is always attractive at the top. <br /> <br /> It is, people. The only reason why you even decide whether you are watching this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These 70s are often confiscated on the basis of their very long trousers (trembling trousers, big hair, Zapata hats, etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having the head of the romantic manager is exceptionally bad. <br /> <br /> The title that hits the sexual comedy is grossly misleading. I cordially recommend it to avoid this person as a plague.
