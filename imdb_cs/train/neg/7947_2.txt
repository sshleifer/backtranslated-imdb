When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. It was not obvious. I have no idea how this movie could be featured on this site. FearNet is a site that displays horror horror movies. Actor acting is great. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The film begins with a man with a stamp on it. Broke the seal and some disasters occurred. The water turns to blood, the oceans die, the moon is red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female figure was also annoying. The many things she did did not make sense. As if she saw a piece of paper with date. Coincidentally, it is the date he expects to give birth to his child and begins to develop and begin to explore and asks religious people what it all means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <The worst two things that happened in this movie are the executions of a mentally retarded man who claimed God had told him to murder his parents, and the end, when Demi Moore will die after giving birth to her baby and transfer her soul to her. br /> <br /> Here is what happens. A mentally retarded person is shot and killed and an apocalypse begins. Demi Moore gets to the hospital amid a massive earthquake and gives birth to her baby. She touches her head, transfers the soul to the baby and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. Why does God suddenly change my heart? Will he be furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man, then is it a forgiveness when a lonely woman turns her soul into her child? <br /> <br /> * The end of the Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is pretty stupid. It is another religious end of the propaganda work in the world. The effects of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else are excellent. That's all it is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 stars of 10. Good acting with nonsense!
