The assumption, though not so ridiculous, was certainly ridiculous. What was to happen at the second encounter with Tritter was that Tritter was simply unnecessary. The house hires some guy and degrades Tritter. In real life, Tritter would be pulled for harassment, a rectal thermometer episode would be exposed to court, provide a motive and opportunity, and lawyers from hospitals would make mincemeat from Tritter and the department he worked for. He would have been in prison, as if someone had been involved in harassing House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson, and Cuddy. The lawsuit would win the house of tasty settlements, so much to bring him with Vicadin to old age. While Tritter would go somewhere in the cabin, he tried to rehabilitate by doing good for people two years before people started to see that they had all seen it before.
