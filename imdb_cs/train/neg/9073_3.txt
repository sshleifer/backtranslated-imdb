This movie looked promising, but it was really bad. The precondition was O.K, but the conspiracy itself was terrible. The actors tried as much as possible with limited material, but could not rise above the average mood of this kind of college film. Jason Schwartzman was again extremely irritated - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast was not enough of an event. The scenes to be entertained turned out to be extraordinary and incredibly youthful. Trying to be a Road Trip / American Pie but fails to fail at all levels. The total loss of time for everyone.
