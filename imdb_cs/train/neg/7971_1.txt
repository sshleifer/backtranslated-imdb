I'm not sure who writes these hot reviews for this movie, but believe me it's STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and slasher films and this is LAME, it's only about 80min long and believe me that's all I can take. The plot is terrible, it is even worse. And there is no development at all. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau films are better than this. REMOVE FROM JIGSAW. I expected that I hate acting that can be forgiven directly in video clips if the plot is in order. This was not a fear, very little Gore, and a really unattractive cast. I was looking at it with three other friends who I hope he still talks to me! They wanted me to hit the window. I can not believe anyone could get this nickname a good review.
