What horrible writing and playing. No personality. What, can not you make a good movie with one character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with its own dialogue. So this child goes on a trip and sees his father. Child, Jason, has an airplane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid-flight. So the baby crashed in the lake and survived. Then he runs around, surviving in the wilderness until he arrives. <br /> <br /> During this time, the bear fights twice. For the first time he fights in the lake. For the second time, he rips the spear from the branch and the bear's spear. The two fake blood scraps that emerged from the bear's chest reminded me of Monty Python's "Holy Grail". Also, the kid decides to dig porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> Gag.
