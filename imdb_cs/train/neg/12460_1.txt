We have left at the point where George Clooney has characters pulled from his fingers. We were not kind because we were convinced over an hour after how it was. To say that this movie was incomprehensible, boring, demanding that it was overestimated! How did people manage to sit over this confused, slow, depressing corner of the film, let alone nominate him for the Oscar? Clooney looked as bad as we watched him. What does he mean? Oh ... and what was with these headlines? - Have we had just some crazy DVDs or were such a movie originally shot - the hints that hung in the air? The film was so heavy that even without it. I'm sorry for the cast who apparently did the best with the available material.
