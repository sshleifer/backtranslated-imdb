The story, character development and gag in this movie are very weak. Plenty of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace is to feel warm and blurry as if the characters have grown into battle. There was no such development that would allow such warm fuzzy feelings. A drug bottle is a clich√© and most of the film does not sound right to life. Breakthroughs build up what is supposed to be tension, but the characters are not well developed to take care of them. Then solve all the unresolved problems per minute of the screen, leaving the viewer feeling that he is just wasting time.
