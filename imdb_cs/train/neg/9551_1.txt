This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen all my life. I wish I could travel back in time and do the following: 1) Find out where the movie "War Games - Dead Code" was shot 2) Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge And preteen eyes in 1983. 3) Break the computer pentagon in the 1980s with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered. 4) Convert WHOPPER to NUKE instead of DEUM CODE minutes before the first day of shooting. 5) Go back to the present, have a beer and bring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "and especially my original" The Dead Code "6) Let another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next a bad remake of Good 80. <br /> <br /> 8) I forgot to have Jar Jar killed, I'm not sure if I'll have to travel to the future in the future, maybe I need access to the wormhole.
