Your attitude, which enters Prom Night II, determines how much joy you take from the movie. If you expect horrible work, look elsewhere. If you like campaign movies that are rather fun to be able to see, you will like it. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing at the top of Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd's Schrage anger channels perfectly "obsessed" during her time. It's not a classic cinema, but a fun way to kill a few hours with a bad end. <br /> <br />
