This is in Zatoichi movies, as Star Trek movies were on Star Trek - except that in this case each of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big, shiny re-do, and also better if the fabric was more important than Surface. If I had never seen them, I thought it was nice but empty; because I had, I thought his style was inappropriate and his content was inadequate. The idea of ​​reviving the character in bigger, blind production had to sound good, but there was no point in it except for the hope of making money; it's just a show that most of the time can not capture the atmosphere of the world of the character, and can not accept the character anywhere he was not (he was not in his best job). I hoped I would see Ichi in the late stage of his life, in a story that would be graceful to him and draw some conclusions from his experience; this is just a revival of bits and pieces from other films, tested more by sex and sfx by violence. The same experience at all.
