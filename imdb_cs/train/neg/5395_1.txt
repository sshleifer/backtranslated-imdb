Kenneth Branagh is attempting to create an incredible, rarely produced William Shakespeare comedy in a thirty-year-old musical, resulting in both Shakespeare's bad and bad comedy, as actors are rarely familiar with one or the other style, and in some cases creepily wrong in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to have the impression that he is totally hysterical like Costard but is mistakenly mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone, who deals with the Shakespearean language with all the teenage powers of Valley Girl, an English-language high school. <br /> <br /> Music numbers are introduced with the expertise of college production "Dames at Sea," leaving the cast to look awkward and amateur in singing and dancing, with the singular exception being Adrian Lester, which turns out to be a wonderful song and dance. The only other eloquence of the film is the contributions of Natasha McElhone and Emily Mortimer as eye candy, but they did much better performances than in this movie, and it would be wise to look at some of the other titles in my filmography and give it a failed cluttered passage.
