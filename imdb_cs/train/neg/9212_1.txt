the only value in this movie is basically laughing how bad it really is. with a story that makes your average high school writer look good, and an acting that is almost as good gets my lowest score. one of those who hans very early movies, where he obviously did not have the pleasure of being truly picky. the best special effect of the film is a guy dressed in an incredibly false rubber monster.
