This is a seriously disturbed movie. Even if the boys deserved something they got ..... sadistic horror executions were "light" over the top. The only figure who showed the conscience soon in love was killed before he could help a sad conspiracy. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, there seemed to be some promise of a mediocre matter, but it was just a thief to get the audience into a false sense of security from the joy of what was coming. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save the movie for me was Jack Nicholson jumping out of the bushes and shouting: "And where is the batman?". Kim Basinger could scream. <br /> <br /> Now it would be great!
