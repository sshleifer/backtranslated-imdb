I bought this DVD for 1 pound and now I realize why. The deal was the worst I've ever seen. Lighting and sound are at best dirty. The plot does not make sense even when it's sober (WARNING: I do not recommend watching this movie when it's sober.) This movie feels like watching a home movie of someone who does not get too much. It is a real shame that all the very little money spent on this project has been put into such waste. I'm looking forward to having some of those who have a career, except for Eva Longoria, who is the only "star" of this film, that apparently was not hit by a bad actress. I'm sorry that none of these criticisms seem constructive, but I'll tell James Cahill one thing, do not try again. According to the words "squirly", he is seriously missing in good separation ".
