It really was a waste of time ... the film has a weak conspiracy, the story is fragmented and ends very suddenly with many gaps ... though the animation is top-notch. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, I tried to give her the pleasures of doubt by saying that it might become interesting at a later stage, but it was never unique. This same plot was played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the hole's hole was the whole story about how to kill the baddies ... The writer could do much more with the whole concept but it seemed he or she had no heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. Overall, too humor, but he could not deliver.
