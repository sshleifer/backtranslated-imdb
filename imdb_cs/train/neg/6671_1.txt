I felt this movie was starting well. Acting acting was in place, and I felt all the characters of the characters, even though the real family unit was not completely unveiled. We never had enough questions about our father to really feel his pain in all his engagement or with his arms for his hostility to Tobe. I mean, in one scene, you see him admiring her for the strain and the other scene he's just taking. Another problem with the film was that it was melting and, to the end, it lost all the focus, and I begged it to end. Any movie with such a long pull and painful end should never get an automatic rating of 7 or more just for acting. Let's look at the quality of all film experiences. In the case of this film, the end is so bad that I seriously thought I was just leaving the theater. This movie took me out, just spit on me.
