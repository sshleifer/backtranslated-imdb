This is one of the worst movies ever. I like sausages, but that's just terrible. Where are the pictures in the movie that are on the box? I think more money was spent on illustrating DVDs than on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why would the company release a DVD that the packaging is so misleading? I feel like such an idiot for renting this film is based solely on a box. Just like I was exploring IMDb, I should have done some research and compiled the list before visiting my local video store. I have no one but myself. I want money and time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> While motivating curiosity, instead of dipping cocktail umbrellas into your eyes. It will be much more enjoyable. You were warned!
