I consider this movie one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember the thing 20 minutes after the movie ended, even making me write a review. joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is basically a good thing. They tried to make a horror film instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add tension and fear. Because of this nightmare 5: Dream Baby is not funny or frightening. What we actually have is a boring film with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). The plot (Freddy's killing Lisa's friends with the dreams of an unborn Lisa baby) is good but it's not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story is very confusing (maybe because it does not exist) and you can not stop thinking about what the filmmakers are heading for. The script had to have more openings than Swiss cheeses and the film was therefore very shy (let me say that I do not like cheese even though I'm from Switzerland). Even the special effects were not as good as in part 4. <br /> <br /> Do not hesitate to borrow / buy this movie, if not for the sake of completeness, it's quite a mess. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used to, # 6 is also dirty ...)
