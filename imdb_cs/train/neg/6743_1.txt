How many times do we have to see bad horror films with a murderer in the Scream-ripoff mask? The Bleed is somewhat original, but the film itself is a complete failure. Firstly, the dialogue is poorly developed, it is boring and too much time spends on trivial details, negotiations are bad, and so on. I want to get my money back, this rent is worse than the skunk.
