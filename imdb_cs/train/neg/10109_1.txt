BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; that man still makes absolute rubbish and the ironic thing is that he loves his bullshit. I have never seen Ulli Lommel, but I was so amazed that everyone thinks his stuff is so bad. Just like the movies I said at the beginning, there are not even six when they come together! After reading the comments, I was curious how bad the guy was. It's the worst. <br /> <br /> Credits would not end when a nice movie started and I quickly noticed that the sound was incredibly badly dubbed. The game was unbelievably horrible and the same as camera shots. Edits are easily the worst. This movie did not make sense, and I could not get tired of it because it did not end and it was only 45 minutes in the film. I could not take it anymore. I spent 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE THIS CRAP!
