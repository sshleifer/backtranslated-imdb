It was the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only has it nothing to do with other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not fun. <br /> <br /> Girls are nice but spend time watching cheap soft porn may be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very bad sex ad, made for an audience that is not older than 12. <br /> <br /> I have never visited an American college but I would seriously doubt it, that someone who could really laugh at some of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save time, do something else.
