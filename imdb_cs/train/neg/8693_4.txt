I'm from Dallas / Fort Worth and lived in Arlington for several years. This movie was so far that it looked like Arlington. I saw the mountains in the background of one scene! Texas has no mountains. I think it will happen when the movie to be in Texas is filmed in Canada. Accents are also really bad. They should have actors from Texas to play. There were plenty of aspirational actors in Texas from Hollywood. The film is really sad because it's a real story. I pray that the killer will be found and sentenced. The only good thing is that by her death, we now have Amber Alert to quickly find the missing children after they were kidnapped.
