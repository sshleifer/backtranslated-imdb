This film is one of the worst movies of the year. Major characters do not have chemistry, and acting is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has some talent, and the only one that is not annoying. I have never seen Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is at this show, but she was terrible in this movie. It's like she did not know anything about acting. Her whole temper is to whine around the movie and she can not fight that she's b **** and still fun. And the other girl, Lake Bell, has little emotion and it's like looking at books when reading them. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it's a cookbook. It goes from point A to B with a little surprise. Kate could be used much more like a spirit. The conspiracy should be more rotated around her and the things she does as a ghost. FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth watching.
