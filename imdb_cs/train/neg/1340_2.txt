96 minutes of it is cruel ... and I love old Munster. Yes, conspiracy is a thing; yes, the lines are trite; but the one who was at the head of this was not a fan. There is so much "intrigue" (and I use this word with a long pause) that I wonder if it's an old episode of Starsky & Hutch. I lost the number of times I noticed that the makeup did not have a place on the collar. By refusing to admit that since the mid-sixties (absurd), the producers simply replaced Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors. Why to let them grow and grow old? Adding Addam's family style does not add Halloween Party taste. <br /> <br /> Grandpa and Herman fly to Transylvania and back in a couple of hours (absurd) Sid Ceaser is the most, yes the most incredible character (including the bad robots) because he is banging an endless combination of gibberish and yiddish, but claims to be old Arab ruler. And yes, there seems to be laughter. In fact, there are several places where the air is dead, as if the laughter track was inserted later. It seems the actors are waiting for a faux audience. It's not ridiculous; It is sad. And the best! Yvonne DeCarlo has a series that will only show you how out of reach of writers and producers. Marilyn says, "Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa be in an accident, they could be hit by a car ... or by train!" Lily says, "You are Uncle Herman who will be here if he has to pull out of the train station." What's amazing in this: husband Yvonne DeCarlo was a stuntman in the early 1960s and lost his leg and was almost killed in a stunt train. He has never recovered and this money has lost his family. (look at the fantastic review Biography about her life and career) This line could easily be changed to make her more sensitive. <br /> <br /> If you are a true fan of Munster then you will have to RENT this mess. It shows that some things are better left alone. Even with (almost) original occupation, it is almost as bad as an attempt to remake the show a few years ago.
