The boy-girl loves the affair / sequel with the songs, only this time she is punkette and he is equal to the arrow. Do movie fans actually look like this movie? Has fans? I have to say that the mind is leaning ... "Lubricant 2" is a really misty business that does not have the courage, moxy or pure yellow to take its predecessor down in the flames (like "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, it's running slow and often just sorry. It looks and is inexpensive, with a large occupation lost in the middle of the chaotic direction and the unfocused treatment. It was the first time Michelle Pfeiffer had spotted a prominent audience, and although he does not feel embarrassed, it's a forgotten role. Wreck at the lowest level. NO STARS from ****
