This movie may seem creepy in commercials, but the real movie was a cause for vomiting. It is lower than below average (even lower than that) and has no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel frightened and confident that a dead Japanese woman will scare you, but what? Make a movie that would appeal to observers and not just show pictures of ghosts and some hair (a dead Japanese woman). Can you say "the terrible tearing of Samary (The Ring)"? Do not let me start with a "dead child". Not even terrifying! So what? He has a cat and can imitate it, a great stir! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that could be damaged by malice! 1/10! Fuj! >. <
