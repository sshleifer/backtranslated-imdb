A deceptive terrible lie on the cover, "Fun Like American Pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV and waited for a comedy ... and it certainly does not matter. You probably will not laugh once unless you are one of those Jackasses, like a regular mind. It's not even an erotic movie that would at least be something, because it's sex ... so what's this? The irregular conspiracy deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember the "loss" for one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the characters (girls) will simply come and go without a credible reason. Well, here are the dwarves (so simple: "dwarves are fun to him" ...) Actor acting is very television (as well as movies all over the film) and certainly amateur for most girls ... <br /> < br /> Amazing movie. Amateur, badly made and above all not FUNNY. Children and adolescents will be happy to watch with friends for talent and sex jokes. Besides, do not even think about renting this movie.
