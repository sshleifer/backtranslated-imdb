Why, why not learn? When you have a nice, juicy trick to exploit, use it! Do not try to ponder and think; you just end it looks stupid. Christmas's evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a little too much kissing mom (Daddy-dressed-like-) Santa Claus back when he was a kid. Of course, Harry grows obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too big, he'll fly out, get dressed like Santa, and he'll drive the town out to toddlers and betray someone who he considers to be disobedient. <br /> <br /> Simple and not bad place to start. (After all, how many other horror movies with holiday motifs uses the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this film wants to be more "Santa, Serial Killer Portrait" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film is spent on Harry's slow but inevitable disintegration when I was willing to buy the premise at the time the titles began to open. You know the movie slasher has trouble when you find that you have urged the murderer to get it. Maybe Harry's descent into madness could be convincing in the hands of a competent director, but unfortunately, we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently it's his only film and it shows it. The action actively jumps from scene to scene without creating shots or clear views of actors to show us where we are and who we see. Even when the film is filming, we are still being treated with a heap of Harry's self-compassion, uncertainty and neurotic behavior. More depressing than frightening, Christmas evil is one that must be avoided.
