I only have to add if someone actually reads and does not get it completely. These other reviewers are not interested, it's really the worst color movie you could see. When the film started, I could not believe that something like this really did it for the world to see. They do not just say that when they say it looks like a home movie. It really does. Just like the director, he took a family hi8 video camera (in front of DV cameras and computer nonlinear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.). He caught several pretty-looking actor students and went out to make a movie. No script, it just does when it goes on. When I watched it, it was on my mono TV so I only have one channel of sound (to the left of the right loudspeaker). At first I thought I was wrong. The film was silent until someone spoke for a few minutes. I got up and went to the second channel, and suddenly I heard the music and sound effects, but then I did not hear the dialogue. They recorded sound on different bloody channels! I think there are movies that can be fun to watch, so bad they are good, something like that. I'm not sure it's one of them. I think I admit that I'm a little beginning filmmaker. And when you see that bad movies just want to go out and PROVE, you can do better, you know. But when I was watching this, I only apologized for who did it. <br /> <br /> Just like them, the actors were the only ones good. I thought the cat was hot and was disappointed with the briefness of her bathing scene. A little T and A would increase her score from nothing to maybe 3 or 4. But unfortunately, no. If you want to shoot a movie, but it's wrong, throw some free nudity. He worked for Roger Corman.
