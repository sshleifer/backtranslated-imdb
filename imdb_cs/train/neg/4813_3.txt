I left and tried to find out what version I was watching. Copyright at the end suggests 1983. And although this is not an important part of my objection to this film, I say watching a movie apparently made in the age of aquarists (including long-haired hippie chickens and tricky tent cars), but with the 1980's synth soundtrack is disturbing. Extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main objection is how to watch that FILMMAKERS BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. HOW IS YOU. Seriously, it's all adorable and so, but in the two films I've seen - this bullshit and the otherwise great Legend of the Hell House - they're gonna kill her. > <br /> I would like to let the film industry know. Pamela Franklin has apparently gone out of business, but if she ever decides to make another movie, and someone who tries to kill her, she tries to kill her, MUST PLEASE TO KNOW THE KIT. PAMELA FRANKLIN AND IS WITH IT. I AM A FINAL CROSS. FURY HAS BEEN AWARNING. <br /> <br /> For B-movie fans looking for crapfest, you can do much worse than this. On the plus side, it is not a film that includes peripheral and prudent satanism - this film is a tough Satanic film. Satanic wall-to-wall ceremonies, baphomats, hallucinations, an absurd diving attack - what else could you ask for. This excellent thing is largely destroyed by the disturbed narrative soundtrack of the eighties, which is almost as incoherent with the film as possible. The soundtrack reminded me of something you would hear about the Equalizer. It's really bad. Pamela Franklin's squash also made her a charming English accent, which was also a rather crude, if not cruel atrocities (against the viewer), as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say we have the right to speak to Pamel Franklin in our own voice. Who's with me? I could forgive everything about this film if they did not abuse Pamilla Franklin. So I threw my glove down, gentlemen - ANI WHO HAVE FRONKLIN MESSES WITH ME. <br /> <br /> ALSO IN FICTIONAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> Good day, SIRS.
