Kim Basinger plays as Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who gets into trouble when she's out at a local shopping mall and is making her last Christmas shopping. After putting a hateful letter of hate on a piece of paper and sticking the paper on the windscreen of a car that occupied two parking spaces, he discovered that the owners of the car were the boys' girder boys, consisting of a white boy, Mexican, Chinese, and black. They meet her with a note, they cover the helpless guard and the persecution continues. While filming Della, the hunter will hunt when he releases her inner Bronson. I found this rather tense little thriller. The effect was good enough (except for a few scenes, "Why God, Why" It Happened To Good To Its Bad) It's a little unnecessary due to the fact that the villains Della are chasing from /. If they did not have the intellect of a bad "home alone", their possible defeat might be something that would be enjoyed instead of the reaction they make. This is an incredible fact I'm willing to ignore because both the director and one of the producers have been involved in bringing the movie "Shoot em up" (a movie that was extremely fun and threw the credibility of the window). This film, without reaching the height of this film, was good in its own right. <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: A commentary by writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; 25 and a half minutes "Execution"; a trailer and two TV spots for this film; and trailer for lower learning
