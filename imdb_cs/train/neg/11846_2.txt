When I saw this movie, I complained about my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or about whether the sound system of the cinema was defective. At least in the first half of the movie, it is extremely difficult to understand what someone says about music background 20 and the scratch of the soundtrack. I was ready to blame cinema equipment, but not so - it was the director. I have been told that the subject of my complaint was an essential part of filming a movie. Music and sound should be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the movie. These days, directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where and how you will see the movie, the sound score will be the same. <br /> <br /> So, apart from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can learn elsewhere), soundtracks of deformation are in themselves a good reason to lose this movie. You will only hear the distorted scratching of the soundtrack and certainly not the cat.
