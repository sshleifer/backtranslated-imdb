I have never heard of it until the owner of the local DVD store mentioned it to me; because I was horrified in the 1980s when I was famous for being banned in Britain, I decided to check it out. The film turned out to be a boring, amateur and ugly-looking ride; Sound recording is so bad that dialogue is an incomprehensible half of the time, while acting gives a new meaning to the word awkward! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the film follows the horribly tired pattern of three teenage girls who are involved in an accident and are in a protected dysfunctional family living in a distant neighborhood. Soon one of the girls is looking for help and never hears them. another, still bed-ridden, is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most duration). The heroine is the most communicating with the three inhabitants of the house: the bridegroom harridan (scary desire), her suppressed (and long-suffering) daughter and her strange brother, who sometimes appear on the scene to escape the sleeping guests. <br /> <br /> They often resort to dinner memories of a mother hater (as a means of filling a spooky, not to mention a non-original, story) and which are constantly developing in battles against mother and daughter; on his sleeve one ace curve is as unexpected as it is brilliant, but it does little to remove the bad taste that the film leaves in the mouth (so much over the fracture of everything like a broken gore) or the inevitable feeling that I lost 80 minutes of my time ...
