When you look back at another evil Nightmare follow-up, like Freddy's Revenge, you must at least give some credit for trying something new. And although The Dream Baby is more enjoyable, it does offer absolutely nothing new to the series. Yes, blood death is as usual as a child that becomes part of a comic book and faces "Super Freddy," but even such scenes are not used to full potential, and parts without Freddy are simply boring. <br /> <br /> She marked the official death of the Scariness Series. Freddy seems to be a comic relief now ... but what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
