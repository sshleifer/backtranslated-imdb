Dream elephants should be the flagship project of the open source community. And although it was a very interesting idea in the concept, it was actually disappointed. The movie is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeemed factor. The enormous problem with them is a huge overblown luminosity. It's terrible, though I think it will help give the movie a dream of quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to notice is a terrible voice of acting. While Proog's voice actor is at least partly competent, the voice actor Emo is HORRIBLE. I think if you have a budget that basically zero, you can not afford to hire real voice actors. For me it seems they have hired one of the animators to make his voice. Overall, the film does not really go anywhere. For me, it looks like it's more like "look what we can do" of a movie instead of a real movie. The conspiracy will not get anywhere, and it will fail to show an interesting point. The whole movie seems to be an excuse to be interesting areas. <br /> <br /> Overall, it can be useful to download quickly from the official site, but do not expect anything except nice graphics.
