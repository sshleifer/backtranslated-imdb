That really is really bad. Lamas shows how his second job is doing. But what is worth watching is the scene where the UB angrily catches her cop as if she were killed while the jukebox is playing a song with "I have proof for you!". (It makes me want to hear the rest of the texts - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I could not find it on iTunes). Talk about how you will meet in the future ... It's very fun for words. The rest of the movie is forgotten. Scores and songs are more interesting than the script. To continue. Which raises the question of why they will do anything at all. My understanding was that foreign sales are driving a lot of these films. B does not say too many world customs.
