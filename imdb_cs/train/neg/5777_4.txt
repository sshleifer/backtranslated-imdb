It's funny when you stop and think about it: fans of the haunted film tend to have a deep and persistent affection for those who scare the daylight. The Texas mask CHAINSAW MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but who did not feel like a true love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE - or to Ken Foree, the foremost hero of the original DAWN OF MRTV? His remake story made me stand up and cheer (just like Tom Savini's portrait); I do not want you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, just stand in the wind ...). These are some heroes of horror. See that many of them gathered in a single film are almost unheard of (at least to the extent, to my knowledge). If only the writer (s) was a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. Until this is another half-effort (for example, BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
