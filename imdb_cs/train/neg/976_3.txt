I'm generally more willing to be open minded for rom com than many, but it was simply not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with the British original - I have not seen and I doubt I will. It has a lot to do with the meandering conspiracy, the lack of chemistry between the leash and the divine performance / figure from its presumed male lead (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon goes to the dress and hairstyle screen 15 years old and act ten years younger than that. You should be the teacher you see and, of course, his well-known school neighborhoods around the world love to employ a less mature person than the children they want to learn. The character is so extremely distraught and irrational that I have doubts about whether an actor could make him sympathetic but old reliable like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might be able to give him a shot. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor actor, but they seem to think they are both. Not once in the whole movie do you believe Fallon in his role, or do you think these two people should cause or be together. Near the end of the movie is a scene where Barrymore (who was as cute but not able to wear it alone - it's hard to have one romance) tells Fallon that it has happened, too much has happened and she is moving on. And rather than feel bad about the scene, or apologize for Fallon, you are actively cheer her up - eventually doing what she had done a month ago. Of course, the mechanics of land will not allow it to end (the end that could actually make a statement of this mess), and instead look at a rational career girl who casts them to hunt for this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. Of course it should be stupid and satisfying, but in fact, I was more disgusted than anything else.
