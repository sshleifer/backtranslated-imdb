I have been a huge fan of Lynn Peterson since she appeared in the film "Far North" in 1988, and although I loved her in her next film "Slow" (2004), where "Francis" plays its strongest role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lynn, as I'm sure you all know (or had), plays a decisive role for the driver. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than the amazing performance of Lynn, I'm afraid this movie does not really have much to do with it. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait - it was one more thing - the amazing creativity of editing to be lost to TV viewers. Rememberable lines like: "You son of a gun!", "You son-of-witch!", "Shoot!", And "Well, forget about you!" O.K. Bye. P: Someone knows where I can get another poster of Lynn Peterson?
