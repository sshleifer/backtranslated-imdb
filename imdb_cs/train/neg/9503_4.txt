Also known as a "house of exorcism", this filthy little movie is so serious that it kills any fun value <br /> <br /> The replacement land includes European tourist Elke Sommer who has a chance to run with Telly Savalas, which looks the same as the devil she saw on a fresco in the square. Sommer gets ride into a mysterious house in a country where Savalas will become a butler <br /> <br /> There he is mistaken for a long dead woman and a real theater performance begins. The husband of the blind matriarch in the house had a matter of a dead woman who was the fianc√©e of the son of a matriarch. The couple who gave Sommer a ride? Well, the woman gives the driver a "lesson in the back seats" and her husband knows and does not care. Eventually, most of the cast is killed, Sommer's drug and rape, escapes, and the viewer is the culmination on board of an empty airplane ... which had to resemble the empty theater in which it was played. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> The VHS copy of this, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> leafboxed. After the end of the credit there are "bonuses"; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These are half-baked ideas, abandoned ground lines, and amazing amenities that do nothing to drive it forward in any direction. You have life as dummies for practical funerals, the blind matriarch does not do everything blind, and Savalas has the same lollipop he had in "Kojak" (who <br /> <br /> chases you, baby?). <br /> <br /> The project looks like they have two star names, then quickly wrote a script, something that happens in Hollywood on a daily occurrence. Savalas looks utterly lost, traces the tracks and wishes his character not to die in "The Dirty". Sommer runs around and yells and breathes a lot, but her character is empty, I use the term "character" freely. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a real strange movie and your reaction to it may depend on how hard you are to Eurohoror and Kojak. I for one can not recommend "Lisa and the devil." This is unrated and includes all the add-ons at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> to copy, including strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong gore, strong nudity, male nudity, sexual content and adult <br /> <br /> situation
