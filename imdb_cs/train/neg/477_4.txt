Somewhere I read that when Kay Francis refused to cut the salary, Warner Bros. he turned her away by placing her on the remaining part of the contract in lesser-quality projects. She decided to accept the money. But her career suffered according to it. <br /> <br /> This could explain what she does in "Comet through Broadway". (Although it does not explain why there are Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter.) "Ludicrous" is the word others used to plot this movie, and that's right on the target. The murder process. Her unhappy career in vaudeville. Her success in London. Her last scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part. <br /> <br /> Sets and costumes also looked like B-movie stuff. And her hair! Turner shows a lot of his films this month. Look at any other and you'll be doing a favor.
