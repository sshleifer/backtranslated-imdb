This bullshit could have been recognized 60 years ago, but it's one of the most racist movies ever shot by indigenous Indian Indians played by white men. True Republican James Stewart was a real giant racist in real life just like his close friend, John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart, actor Hal Williams fired from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series he had mercifully failed) just because Williams was black. As if it was not bad enough, this movie is very dated and boring. See "Dance with the Wolves" instead of a racist view. <br /> <br /> Stewart was in his 1940s when this terrible movie was shot and even with his ridiculous wig still looked like a pedophile pursuit after 16 years -old Debra Paget. I am surprised that it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
