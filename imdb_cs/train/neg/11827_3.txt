I just came back from a free screening and I'm very glad I did not pay to see this very sub-par movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults. It seemed like they were just kids who laughed at all slap-sticks and fart jokes though (a good god they loved to hit these poor mice in their crotch a lot!). The film is quite youthful, unintelligible, predictable and mostly annoying. The characters seem to be gathered to fill the empty space and the relationships between them seem to be forced without any spell. The film is on average about average and nothing that really stands out. They did a decent job that imitated Wallace and Gromit's clay, but it's also a lot of forgotten pictures. Even though I was really bored all over the movie, I laughed a few times. It's not an absolute failure, but I certainly would not want to watch it again. If you are a parent with a child (and you do not care if your children see the soulless cheap jokes), then let them loose to see them, but everyone else should not waste their money.
