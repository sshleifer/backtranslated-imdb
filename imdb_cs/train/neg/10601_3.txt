This is the official sequel to the science fiction action thriller '92. In the original, Van Damme was among several dead Vietnamese warriors who revived themselves as perfect soldiers (Unisols). This is about ten years later, because Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he is working with the government in a classical facility to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site supercomputer (named Seth as a "Cobra" snake of the same year) is too crazy to take over the Unisols command and even pull his computer brain into the new super-Unisol body. We are looking for the next step in development, people! Most Van Damme battles are with one particularly Unisole (for Goldberg), who just keeps on board: take him out of the building - nothing good; run him on a truck - no! Shoot it, burn - do not forget! Much of the humor is traced as Van Damme is now obsolete and discarded (even gray around the edges). But even if he takes a lollipop, he goes on! Most of this kind of sequel is a pretty lame-pale imitation of the originals, and while this is certainly not a bout of genius, it can be fun, especially if you are a fan of pro-wrestling.
