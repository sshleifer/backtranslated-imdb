This movie was badly written, poorly executed and very predictable. It was a very low budget and I can understand why it was never allowed and went straight to the video. It was no fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get 1-1 / 2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with a plot that has holes so large that you could drive the mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The fence itself has a young bride who does absolutely physical - that's a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something horror genre. About every movie comes to mind that it is better than this. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
