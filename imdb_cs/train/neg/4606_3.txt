This movie was an attempt to go to places they do not usually have, and maybe they should not come back. It was a similar study in the bizarre perspective that was given to us in The Cell, though not as close as it was in depth and well-presented. The land is built simply with an initial camping feeling. After the movie takes over the predicted "dramatic" turn, the conspiracy breaks down on what has several feet in the first place. <br /> <br /> It's basically a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He is interested in the assailant and kills the accounting city. Then he does not pay for his work, but he's been tortured for days, for he has devised the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use a backup set that had a leverage effect. This idiotic step tries to force them to pay back because it is severely and infinitely abused. The fool begins (some very worrying scenes). Then, when he thinks he has paid for his sins and can start again, he will visit his wife (Kari Wuhrera) of the man he killed and gained her affection. Shortly after he finds out who he is, the tragedy strikes and the revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torture (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt and Vernon Wells) for his previous "kindness." <br /> <br /> what's going on with Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore type films? It seems that everything she has recently released has become a genre in this genre. I liked the movie "Eight Legged Freaks" and was in "Anaconda" okay. But despite all her apparent cuteness and kindness (wow, she's hot!) She can act much better and choose better roles. Or maybe, I'm wrong, and that's just a misconception. For all those boys out there, you can see her "full moons" in this movie, even though it's somewhat bizarre and short-lived. I almost felt like she had some fine porn after watching this movie (something that is not alien to Carey's career). Sexual simulation is such that you have to think about what's going on in the shooting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I say there is some good deal. Just do not expect David Balwin, whose career seems forever destined to share his brother Alex. The film made several old giants, though George Wendt (Vernon Wells) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Especially Chris McKenna does the best job of playing the main character, Sean Crawley. His little acting experience and yet his incredible nature as a naive youth bring some elements to the film. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go out of this way. If you're bored and you're tired of the same old episodes "Hitchhiker", then I can advise you when you watch it. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start playing some better movies!
