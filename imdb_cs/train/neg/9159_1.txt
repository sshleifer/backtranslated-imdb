If the author shows himself 2 credits in front of the main title and 15 more credits before the movie begins, and the first shot shows how the author gets on a lycra skate bed, it is not a surprise, he has a body that should never be seen in spandex. Such an appearance that could be useful to a homosexual averse therapist. Others have given this thing for what they deserve. For me, the most important moment was the moment when LA was marked by LAX landing; and the return was marked by a FedEx cargo aircraft shot.
