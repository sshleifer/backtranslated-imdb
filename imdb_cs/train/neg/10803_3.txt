OK, so after watching this exciting film and wasting the hour and many minutes of my life here is a basic summary: Genie comes out of the box ghetto boom, gives this baby with hairy hair 3 wishes, the boy loses his wish, forget what, shaq is angry on rapping and I think it is. So I basically laughed, I cried ...... but mainly I laughed at the shey comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of a nba player / rapper and a boy with hairy hair. I highly recommend this film for high school children sitting around drinking beers with their close friends and having a serious need for good laughter. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give her 3 of 10 b / c movies based on 3 magic wishes. If I had 3 wishes, one would be to erase this terrible movie and for everyone to pretend that Hollywood does not waste the money to do it.
