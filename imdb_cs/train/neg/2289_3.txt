Unfortunately, Marry Harron has decided to make a fictional story about Bettie Page's life so she can go with her own men's problems. As is typical of her work, every major male figure is shown as weak, crumpled or twisted. To add to her fiction, she reflects thoughts and problems that are not true, according to Bettie Page. Bettie did not leave biz because she thought she was morally ill or had religious problems (though she was born again later in her life, thanks to her third husband's influence). She left her because she was at the end of the 1930s, her acting career was not going anywhere, and she felt she was losing her appearance. The indications of harassment and rape are invalid and reject Bettie's own words, and they are attempts by the director to claim that every woman who did what Bettie did, must be the victim of men. Harron could not emphasize that Bettie had designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots (which the "sick" fetishists had not sent her). Harron also failed to emphasize that Bunny Yeager, who made many of Bettie's famous photographic shoots, also made many "naughty" shots with Bettie and was not a morally upright professional photographer featured in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only gentle grace is that Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie. Otherwise, there are more movies and more perfect and honest documents for your life and the people in it.
