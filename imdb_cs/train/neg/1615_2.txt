The same old is the same as Che. This completely ignored the truly interesting facts of Chee's true character. Sodeberg redeemed the same boring story of Che. The silly, seductive story of an Argentine rich boy who was so shocked by poverty was Robin Hood, who fought the poor, eventually murdered by the CIA. Yeah, yeah, he heard it all before, BORING AND UNTRUE! The reality of Che Guevary is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian, with a messianic singing that openly wanted to create Maoist tyranny in the world. He was so fanatical that he even asked the Soviet Union to warm New York, Washington, or Los Angeles in the hottest cold war, and bring the end of the world. He confirmed that Khrushchev would launch a nuclear attack on US cities. For the rest of his life, he said that if his finger was on a button, he would push him. When Khrushchev left and literally rescued the world, Che was furious at "betrayal." If it was accompanied by Che's recommendation, you would not read this review. How he became a murderous maniac with a pop icon would be a much more interesting film. Unbelievable that no filmmaker was so brave enough to prove the real face of Che and his posthumous transformation of the media. TO PRODUCE THE WINNER OF THE FILM Oscar! I thought an independent movie means having REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING! They are only holding "safe threats against polarity", "che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazis", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than the KGB", "Christians are fanatics and stupid" ... ad nauseum. Oooh, how brave the mind is blowing. Tres anti-mainstream and nervous. I wish they had some real cojons and solved the independence of the film oligarchy! That would be really courageous!
