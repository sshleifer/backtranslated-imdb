Jack Black usually slows me down by simple breathing, but in this movie ... In addition to direction, writing, lack of plotting, constant suppression (assisting and incitement by constant direct cameras), and an average of .050 victory, it was still a complete waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential there is unnecessarily unnecessary with the absolute lack of comedy and the worst direction I've seen on this side - the tube. I still hear that this film is depicted by the Mexicans very negatively. While this is undoubtedly true, I really do not think this film is racist. I think it's more the result of a "creative" team that is desperately trying to find something fun in this mess. You hear them crying behind the camera: "Hey, look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please for the love of all things tough, LAUGH!" But put racism charges aside. When you get there, it's someone who threw good money and time to watch the mass of the remaining beans left to be offended, IMO.
