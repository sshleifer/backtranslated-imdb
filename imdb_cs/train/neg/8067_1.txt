First, tell me it must be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing and nothing in this movie is even remarkably exciting. Most of them are very confusing and as it progresses, it's enough to end it! Some people want a movie that is "thinking" over the whole thing I'm saying ... "More power for you" !! On the other hand, I just want to have fun. Which brings me back to this arsonist, it's not fun. This movie is a stupid and total waste of time. It seems that most of them also agree. Most of this did not make sense, and at a time when you think you have one scene, he discovered that another lame scene would appear and ... well, I guess you can see where it's going. Avoid this, this is upset ... bad!
