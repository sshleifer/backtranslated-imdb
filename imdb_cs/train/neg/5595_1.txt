Wow ... OK. So, when I read a little conflict, I decided I had to see this movie myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching her. I strongly recommend cleaning the cabinet instead of watching this movie, you will be more scary / entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget with bad acting. Whoever gives this movie 10s is completely wrong and should be ignored. <br /> <br /> I am in no way associated with any other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth it. > <br /> Very, very BAD MOVIE.
