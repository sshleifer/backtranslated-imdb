this movie was a terrible excuse ... for the movie. that casting might be better; Katein's main character did not see anything like her mom. <br /> <br /> It was also a conspiracy. it was extremely clich√© and predictable. the end was very disappointed and cheese. (but that's all I'm going to say). <br /> <br /> The nail in the bag was the scene where Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) had to cry, but the girl could not cry at the command! no tears tingled on her face, just a few incredible sobs. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave the same false laugh that is the same with the same fake duff on Maguire (sp?). that's when the movie went from not-so-good, just bad. it really seemed to be acting. <br /> <br /> In short: this movie was really bad! it was the kind of mix of every childhood movie cliche from the 90's that everyone is sick - just worse! I give him "F" because it was just so hard to sit (b / t / w, I was watching when I saw it). <br /> <br /> You may like it if your 9 or so. ;)
