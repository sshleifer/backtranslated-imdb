Rohmer's use of digital technology has been a lot due to "filling" the background. Sometimes it works well, the scene in which Grace and her maid are witnesses from a distance of the king's executions are especially fascinating. At other times, it gives the film a strangely amateur look reminiscent of home video. The fundamental failure, however, lies in the fact that the pure art of mission on the scene creates a dissuasive effect on the viewer. We know that what we are watching is not real how we can feel the characters? To be honest, I did not care what happened to the lady or the duke. Another big failure, with regret, I say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. She is practically in every scene, and success or else else is based on her performance. OK, she speaks a foreign language, but she is not able to express real emotions. Her emotions in the scene where she tells her girlfriend Mme de Meyler (the excellent performance of debutant Helena Dubiel) when she saw her head on the pole caused some embarrassing laughter in the audience. Also look at your hands when expressing emotions! Overall, a very disappointed film, especially given the positive reviews on this site.
