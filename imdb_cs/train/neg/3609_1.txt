It must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when I first appeared on the video and for some special reason I thought I liked it. So, like an idiot, I got to buy a DVD after it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even bother to go into the conspiracy because it is so transparent that you can see it. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to the cheese effect of gore and bad acting, but these people take it to a whole different level. It's almost as if they deliberately attempted to make the worst film humanly possible ... if it was their goal, they succeeded. If they wanted to make a movie that would scare you, or believe you in any way, shape or shape that it is real, then they failed ... INSERT! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis and you've seen it!
