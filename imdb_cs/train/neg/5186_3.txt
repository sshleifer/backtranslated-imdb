RKS films have always been commercial films that fit in the 90's from GHAYAL, DAMINI. His latest KHAKEE movies were observable FAMILY was crazy <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent film but could be better <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that a lot of old fashion clich√©s fit in and many scene looks too movies and lengthy <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan character is shown very well but his character gets heroism that could be tiny <br /> <br /> A long flashback could be avoided because the tigles are simply long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even the street game in the second half looks too simplistic and hardly the solution message is well done <br /> <br /> Direction RKS is decent although it may be better Music is ok <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks very good and very well plays his part mostly though sometimes he looks bad in light scenarios He excels in the drama Vidya stands out in front of the media scene Pankaj has an inadequate defined role and too movies you stand out in his part Darshan Jariwala as an old villain, the rest is all right
