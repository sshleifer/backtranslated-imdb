I think if you're in the 1960s, like me, you're supposed to lose about 80 minutes of your life and watch this barely traceable train. The saving graces of this peculiarity include surprisingly appropriate social commentary on the values ​​of the 1960s along with a number of relatively well-known actors captured in early (and embarrassing) shots. It's as if the Laugh-In producers have sat down and decided to write a movie that covers all the high points (and other) issues between baby flowers and equipment and then put it in the hands of several hippies and gave them about 10,000 dollars to complete it. It's barely classic, but in its own way it captures how it really is strange time, stupidity, excessive idealism, and unwavering equipment. Not for everyone.
