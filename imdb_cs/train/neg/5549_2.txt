"It can mean the end of the white race!" will capture the general how dozens of Native Zombies are going through the battlefields of Europe during the Great War. The expedition culminates in the long-lost, projected city of Kennif-Angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefield clear for the honest honest white people to defeat tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It's a little hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this movie because the acting is so wooden. Even according to the 1936 standards, acting in this film is bad. From the previous decade. It looks like it comes from the correspondence school "How to act" textbook <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter Three: Emotion ------- ----- ---- How to express fear and contempt (Woman) Push both fists, put one hand on your heart, open your mouth to scream, lay another fist against the back of your mouth, hold for 10 seconds longer than comfortable, then quickly turn your head 90 degrees away from a thoughtful object and sobbing. "How to have a complex, strongly emotionally charged scene with a former fiancee to explain your love to someone else Do not make eye contact Do not move Do not make any emotions Do not be too much eyebrows when reading your lines from the studio wall. <br /> <br /> to give us a break from the acting actor, the director will skilfully shorten long pauses where nothing happens, except that the film still runs through the projectors, so a 35 minute story is put out for 60ish minutes. <br /> <br /> Zombie revolt when it's so slow!

(even though I have just found a somewhat concealed symbolism.) Jagger is shot native as an ironic counter the punk of all the natives who are shot by the Germans at the beginning of flick.see, even the suppressed natives do not want the end of the White Race!) Chase (that's what you call it) through the swamp designed in her back is cheerful and worth the entry price alone. Roy D'Arcy has a hell of camping time, but it's totally useless like Col. Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting moment in this movie. A nice, small set of natives and white members occupied under the spell of evil eyes. face to face, crossing into each other. It works, even if there's a strange small shot in the middle of each close up. I think it must be the Neg Cutters frame between the fading. Best watched with friends and in a silly mood.
