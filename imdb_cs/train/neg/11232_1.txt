It's so sad. Although this was filmed, I think it's a bit more than a shout like Blood Lake, There's Nothing Out There &. The music they play is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I like my brother and sister in this movie. They do not try too sarcastically when they say things like "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what's up with the killer just wearing a mask? This is slow! Basically I ignored the other half. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect it uses when a killer uses an ax. Same exact sound for each cut!
