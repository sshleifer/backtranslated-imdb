I rated basic instinct 2, but the movie received less than 4 ratings. This film got me only 4, but has 7.3 out of more than 600 people. I do not see why this movie likes so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring because it hardly ever leaves those rooms in a broken big house. And there are only 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours, which is totally useless. Many dialogues are slow and insignificant. Movie tone is also dark blue, which is depressing. The movie can be shortened to a few sentences. This movie reminds me of "Three Times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien that it is equally bored that dialogues are equally boring. It also has a high rating! After the first story, I had to stop watching the movie. This film lacks passion or excitement.
