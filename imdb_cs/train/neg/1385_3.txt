"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. I was told it was a "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The movie was either badly nicknamed, or the soundtrack of the movie did not work well. The other thing is that the dialogue was to a great extent bad. The English version of this film was very little thoughtful and appeals only to the genre of "meaningless action". It was not a movie I wanted to see again.
