What do you expect if you do not have a script for this purpose and therefore nothing to do with the director? Hayek and Farrell and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, just have nothing to say or anything we can react to. Even the earthquake was poor enough. And I do not know how the film follows the novel, but two of them are a Jewish girl coming out of nothing, just showing that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes do not represent anything. And he even scared Camilla into the desert instead of returning to LA for a nice Catholic funeral where she could at least bring her flowers. Pathetic. A set L.A. was ridiculously graphically created. Something good? The window to his apartment was real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. They were from the time of the body or night of the living dead, according to what it was.
