During his short 40 years on Earth Jack Jack managed to retreat as much adventure and incident as it seemed possible. This 90-minute film, allegedly a biography of human life, but apparently fictionalized, does not even scratch the surface and remains a story very mature for modern retelling. Here Michael O'Shea performs in one of his first roles in London and his performance is both robust and compassionate. He's not a problem here. She is not a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward who plays her future wife, Charmian, whose biography in London is the "basis" of this film. Life in London has been divided into a series of episodes that are easily passing through the film. So we have short incidents with London as a sharp pirate, seals in the Bering Sea, a Yukon gold search engine, and a correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War ... colorful events, of course, but hardly anything like in-depth treatments. And the direction of Alfred Santella (he also director one of Susan's first films, "Our Leader" in 1939) is in the best shortcoming. Doing things thicker here is a DVD very poor quality, with an angry-looking source of print and hissysy sound. Perhaps the best thing to do was that the movie rental was one of the DVD bonuses for me: a catalog of all Alpha Video films featuring hundreds and hundreds of colorful film posters. Just hope these movies are in better shape than "Jack London"!
