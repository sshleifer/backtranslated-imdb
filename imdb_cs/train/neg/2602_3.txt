Drew Barrymore still sees her alter-e all over the city and actually begs back pain. When Dee hires an apartment from hackers, her encounter with "another Drew" is more common. Writer-guy thinks it's his responsibility to defeat "real Drew" from his stupa, so he does what he can to help him and seduce him as soon as he has some spare time. It's not very interesting and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when he gives a group of rough construction workers a finger ... yeah Drew, that's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene could be when Drew weakens her real mother, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
