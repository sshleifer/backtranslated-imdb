I've seen bad movies before, but this will be worth the "Worst Movie for Life". Anthony Hopkins must be totally insane to get his name attached to this - anywhere! I will never see another movie, directing etc., etc.! I can not believe the other actors and actresses I liked (in this picture) that stretched so low that they were part of this disaster! There must be some great drugs there! For anyone who would not be embarrassed to be a part of such a movie is behind me! Save money on this! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you Mr. Hopkins! Also, shame on Christian Slater! I can not believe you have built your reputation on this line!
