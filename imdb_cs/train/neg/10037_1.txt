I never thought Yashraj's standard would have humiliated! The film has a meaningless story that does not interest anybody. <br /> <br /> Saif has already acted. Kareena has perfected her character, but she is not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. I can say that the role was not good .. <br /> <br /> A large amount of levity is filled. He wondered if it should be the "comedy part" of the film. Just because the last few movies were on the flop, does it mean that Yashraj movies should do this kind of waste? It has a history of many good movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was completely disappointed with the movie.
