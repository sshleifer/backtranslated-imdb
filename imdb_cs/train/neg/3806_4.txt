My wife and I thought that this movie was destroyed, made for television (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which is in itself good but not great. The story has little interpolar tension or chemistry and it's not a story. The character of Woody Allen is just flying around his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson have nothing more to do. It is quite disappointing, I have to say. The role of Ian McShane is just a widespread portrait. <br /> <br /> The first thing that occurred to me was: "I wonder how much did BBC have to pay to Woody Allen to get him out of Manhattan?" He needed money and needed his appeal to expand his audience out of the youth market, which was attracted to two stars. I give this movie four stars instead of 3, because it is a restless background noise. If you ever want something when you're knitting or sorting a stamp, you'll do that. I'm not going to rent it again.
