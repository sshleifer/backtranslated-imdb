"Paul, I might be a bitch, but I never care!" <br /> <br /> Cheerful lines in a somewhat tiring leather film that contains nice honey in Stacey Walker, but that's all. This girl is a real teasing that lures her friends, co-workers, and even her lesbian roommate Paoula into her bedroom, but then turns into a nice job, crying to "rape" and calling the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certified c ** t may be perhaps a little interesting, but this story will eventually turn into a truly repeating one note. At least the end is worth waiting for, for those who will still care.
