Well, it looks good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer are working again, this time on a mix of heist films, Da Vinci code, American history 101 and Indiana Jones. But it's expensive, this is Speed ​​2 for Indiana Jones. Adequate performer (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights against a small screenplay and loses poorly. The film is just a little more than the widespread advertisment of free Masons. However, these free soldiers are not your usual merchants who use funny hand suppression and play golf, these freemasons are the natural descendants of the Templar Knights (and no one mentions "From Hell" or Jack Ripper.) I do not think I've uncovered any fence spoilers because There are no. There is practically no tension, no surprise and no climax - it just stops. Dan Brown's national treasure is about to hit the same intellectual level as Scooby Doo's episode without humor.
