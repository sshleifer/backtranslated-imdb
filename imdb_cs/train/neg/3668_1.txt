This movie is so bad, you almost feel polluted. In fact, there's a strong sense of relief when it's over, the relief that you can now roll the tape back into the rewinder and RUSH return it to the video store's shop before it contaminates the rest of your video clip collection. I jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looks like the movie in which William Hurt "writes" his performance. I thought he would not try hard. But lo and behold, in the vast number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we have derived from this confused mess. Cinematography and editing are dark and furious, the story is messy and the soundtrack is hardly audible. It has very little resemblance to "Falling Down," but the movie had a boldly disturbing story, great writing and acting, and a nice soundtrack. "Contaminated Man" is just some broken old European tourist passport and looks at it as a ride along some unknown back path in an unfamiliar state where you do not speak your tongue in constant rain just after the night starts misting. Do you get a picture? Do not get this.
