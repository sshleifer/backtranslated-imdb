This movie runs slowly and then narrows. After watching for about an hour, and when I did not see anything, I left. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zipper. Nada. There is no story. Characters are vague representations of the most unsuspecting people one knows of us. Producers of this film can be sued in court if they try to sell it as a "motion" image. There is no movement. I could have said the same "story" with several static images with subtitles. The script is a joke. It's scary. I doubt it would save some scriptwriter in the world. My greatest regret is not that I lost 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in Time of Money" but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to leave, but I waited too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people who left before me.
