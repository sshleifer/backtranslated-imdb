I have seen this movie in my own time period when your extramarital child not only destroyed your life but also improved your child as a bastard. These days of "free mothers" that may seem very far, but that was very true. And I'm not crazy when I smile at someone who's stuttering. Between these two problems I had trouble finding this movie funny. At that time I did not know who was directing him or what a wonderful reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she was nervous because she was so frenetic. I loved "Bringing Baby," but I find this movie embarrassing. I'm sure the blow to some church functions is probably pointy, but I was the one who needed the drink after watching it again. The idea that a girl should get drunk to "get married" and get pregnant has just added to poverty. The whole city could turn in such circumstances, so the result of this movie is really a funny part. Of course, shoot me, I do not like "It's a beautiful life."
