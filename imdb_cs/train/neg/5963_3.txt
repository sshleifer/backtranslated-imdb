This movie begins with the execution of a practical wizard and his mistress. His head is cut off and buried apart from his body ... sounds like "A thing that would not die", right? This is how it plays a little, but once the body connects again with the head, all the interesting and cruel deaths are done and the film moves very slowly. I mean, the movie is only 88 minutes long and I still thought, "When will it end?" The characters in the movie are mostly idiots and they deserve to die a lot because they are really stupid. The villain is also very bad when he moves slowly and you are really interested in how he can do anything because he is afraid of jewelery. The only thing that can track you after rejoining the head is the fact that there is so much belly that it sounds that you are actually beginning to lose track. I still want to see the horror film, not the soft core porn flick and as a horror movie is a way to slow down with the path to many slow stretches to make it a bit more pleasant. And do not read the back of the box as it solved it as if there were zombie flesh invading the city is not ... just a small scene where three or four zombies attack the house and are so easily repelled are not in the film a factor and their scene is rather futile . So I'm mostly saying you should avoid this movie unless you find it really cheap.
