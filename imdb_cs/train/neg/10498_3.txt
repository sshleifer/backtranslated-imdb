I caught the test. All I can say is: What ... ... hell? This movie plays as smooth as Mickey Mouse as she reads the Scarface script. It's bizarre that makes the least sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so bizarre that it's not even funny. The plot is crocodile hunter Steve Irwin, who is trying to "save" the crocodile that contains the CIA. The CIA comes to Irwin to come back, Irwin is missing for poachers and decides to "stop". It's probably the whole story; the rest is the supernatural illumination of Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strangely choreographies of action sequences. At one point Irwin employs a fast RV and knives fights a CIA agent at the top. Yes, that's true: Steve Irwin knife fights a guy at the top of RV. Let it be your guide for this ridiculously bad movie.
