When I started watching this movie, I saw Buffy, Xander and how nice she was still living in movies. Now we can become a strange movie because it's a good bizarre dose, like David Lynch movies, double peaks, lost motorways, etc. And you have to be in the mood for one. This time, however, I was remorselessly reminded of how a crazy website about conspiracy theory would ever be. I mean, to come to the people of the Nazis who conspired with America to create an unfair triple of evil powers? I was surprised that they did not mention in this film a hollow land with Hitler's flying plates and lizards. Perhaps if you had 60 grams of heroine with this movie, it would make sense, but I really do not agree with drugs, as if I did not approve of this film. It should burn, crush and forget, just so good that Xander could get another piece of work. It was not his acting, but it was all right, but the script just made no sense. Excuse me.
