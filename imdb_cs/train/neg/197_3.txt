While this is a great western band by James Arnes, this film went down as the worst Alamo movie he ever did. The story was frightening, inaccurate over it, and just a false boot! Continuity has been transferred to four winds. Someone caught a cannon sequence? The Mexicans were stupid enough to burn cannons, which apparently had the mud and the reeds still flowing out of the pipes. Come on! Then there's a ridiculous hat from Brian Keith! The customer had to be gone or something. Or just out of their minds!
