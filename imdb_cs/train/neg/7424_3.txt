A very, very humorous movie is here with Stella Stevens, who measures the direction of someone in disguise (it did not take long to guess who it is) in Old Nevada near Vegas for money at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads his girl gang three and finds that he has to act much faster than expected. Despite some elegant views of Las Vegas in the seventies, a very average but trusted deal from the most involved, and land with potential, the Las Vegas Lady puts one big boring egg. It always seems that the movie starts digging into the gear, and when it does it only shakes and shakes and never really goes through. I was a bit disappointed with this film. Sure, I did not expect anything great, but at least I thought it might be one of those slick exploits of 1970s movies or something like that. Not even close. No one dies. Among the lame Stuart Whitman and the officer George DiCenz, one year before his great performance as representing lawyer Bugliosa at Helter Skelter, a fake fighter appears. Weapons have all the strain when watching the waterfall. There is one stroke and one head hit by a blunt tool. Nothing in terms of negotiation. As for the girls, do not expect too much. Stella and her girls (both very average, but quite talented, get into the sauna and the bath.) What we see, nothing but Stella's side profile wearing these pretty open blouses highlighting her real talents, but I wish it was a bit more open with my performance. So I could write one thing that would recommend the movie. Unfortunately, it was not, and I have little to say in favor of this film. This is not a terrible movie at all, it just has nothing to do with it. YAWN.
