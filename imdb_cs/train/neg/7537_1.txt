And I thought the beach was bad, with the difference that this film has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not throw him in for a terrible script, if someone can make sense of what the hell is, it's instead a movie, put your heel on your back. It is the cross between the Village and the screeching script. It starts to catch a little your eye and then, as it goes on to the conspiracy, it just does not make sense, and do not let me start over! What it was? The only thing that this film contains is Nicolas Cage, the usual humor and his ability to be funny in the most beautiful situations. If you go to a blockbuster and it's the only movie you can watch, save five dollars and just go back home and turn something into the fire and when someone asks why, tell the stupid thing that comes to your mind, and you go!
