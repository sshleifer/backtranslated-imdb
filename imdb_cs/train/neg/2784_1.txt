My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same city as a screenwriter of this film. We were very upset that JCC brought this film to his Jewish film festival because of the portrayal of Frankie's mentally handicapped character. We went to see this movie at the local theater when he went out. We asked for money back. We would like to encourage the screenwriter to donate some of the Achc funds in the JCC to apologize. We did not like to see Frankie - a mentally handicapped and perhaps autistic teenager - as part of a joke in which he still holds something to look at the breast of a nanny. <br /> <br /> There was no point in Frankie's character other than saying "hey, being mentally disabled is fun." Challenges like Frankie are a serious matter. Families like mine are really suffering. The screenwriter must explain. Does she know families with disabled children? Do families with disabled children see week by week in the JCC pool?
