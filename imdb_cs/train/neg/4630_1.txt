Released in 1965, but clearly shot earlier, it's a clumsy little criminal melodrama with some inappropriate sexploitation in the front. As usual in milling the era, there is plenty of stripping and dressing for no reason, complete with dirty music, annoying narration and unpleasant treatment. The scene of the caf√© puts intolerable soil when we split the characters here and there so that they would not really be able to see them. The only thing we get is the reaction to the voice outside the screen! 50s - Nice Misty Ayers a few times before the action starts, stripes into French pants. It is continuously accompanied by what is apparently popular music from romantic to western to mother-makes-dishes, randomly mixed to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever captured on the film. Watch how he does it! Watch how the match strikes! Will he inhale or be captured by Apache? Time only shows !! The film tells a stark story about how Sally gets a scammer to work in a canteen, drops drugs and can not escape. For some reason, we were dealing with some of the most boring and dull footminds that ever tried to shoot, literally doing nails or knit rather than having fun with the customer. Some extremely poor comedy (funny lady accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) And quiet film acting does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even playing Something Weird Video. It's really more movie curiosity for those who are interested in cinema history - a very bad cinema.
