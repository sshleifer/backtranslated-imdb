I can not believe how popular it is. I consider myself a promising sci-fi scientist. I have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many science fiction films and TV shows. I really would not even think of this true science fiction. Every episode I was sitting on was like the lame version of the Star Trek episode, minus something that could make it interesting or exciting. Basically, it's a lot of people who have been fighting the ARM, talking about something boring, who sometimes passes through the stargate and ends up on a planet that looks the same as Earth, with people who look and sound just like humans! It seemed an extremely low budget. Characters are all unforgettable one-dimensional cutouts and many humorous attempts are falling. It reminds me of this when you see an ad with a famous athlete who is trying to be funny but not. It's just sad. The film was terrible. There is so much you can do with the portal across the universe, yet every place where ARMY goes is BORING! That does not mean any imagination! In fact, I thought the Alien Nation television series, a few years back (based on Alien Nation), was much better. This show had really good stories and decent characters. I was not crazy about "Alien Nation", but compared to this overrated bullshit, it was great! Also, unlike the great new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the lama film too close! It should have a minimum of updated toiletry toiletry whenever anyone walks through the stargate.
