This is not a bad movie ... but she's a guy who's watching your girlfriend. The story is not bad ... it only means an hour and a half seems so long. It's hard to destroy this movie because I really like it, but it was just long and thin on the story ... too bad. The main character will never really change so much from start to finish. I mean by going through something that "changes life" and he can barely smash a smile. I think Mac was really good. His strange indignation kept the film from a complete disaster. Maybe I can not get this movie. If anyone explains it, I'd like to be informed.
