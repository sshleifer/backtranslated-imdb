This film is about a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) who is about to catch a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company led by Kelly Lin. Basically, regardless of the plans the policeman will try to know the thief in advance. This film, covered by handsome lead actors, beautiful actress and good camera from the Hong Kong scenes, really has absolutely no substance at all. It's all lightning and the flash is fast becoming dull. I have lost all the interests of a third trip to the film and there is no redeemed quality, except cinematography that looks good. Only consider this movie if you can do it for free. Also consider stopping watching the film 20 minutes into the movie because it's the same at the end: BORING. 6/10
