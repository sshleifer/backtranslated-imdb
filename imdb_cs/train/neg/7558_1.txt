what do you do, do not waste time on it. film. Remake that did not need to be printed again. Everyone who left the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage was on a bicycle with hills, swam in the dark water and rocked the hills while bee attacked, yet his suit was still perfectly molded and the t-shirt crisp white until the last scene. <br /> <br /> Although the acting with Ellen Bernstein and Cage was as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. They will not get a copy of the script first. If you still have an interest in seeing the movie at least wait for it to come out on DVD.
