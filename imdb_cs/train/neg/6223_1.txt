If you are a fan of late Gram Parsons, then this movie definitely shares you! A partial comedy, a partial road movie, but mostly a bad fiction of one of the strangest stories of rock history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Parsons, who said when one of them died first (it did not matter which one is) that the other lived to bring the deceased to the desert, Joshua Tree National Park in California to be accurate, and set the body to burn ... so, to free the spirit and become one with the earth, and so on! Surely his word unnecessarily sober Kaufman, with the help of a suicidal friend, will lift the body of late Parsons - who previously lay in front of a plane of the drug and cocktails in front of the plane. And shortly thereafter, there are many fictions and truths, when Parsons's late girlfriend, Kaufman's girlfriend, Parsons's stone-faced father, and a group of cops and other stupid idiots are trying to beat the clock (so to speak) in an attempt to capture Kaufman and his friend before they get the opportunity to power Parsons's body! <br /> <br /> The film's incompetent direction, bad acting and lame offbeat tone generally all drop this movie faster than Titanic. And not to mention the huge fact that this film is not even in the middle of telling about the actual events that have taken place. The accuracy to replace the inaccuracies when I heard them is: 1. the number, Parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a baby, so what the hell was that it all with my girlfriend and persecution and what not? 2, Kaufman's drugged friend was a known willing participant (unlike what the film is attempting to plot) to liquidate Parson's body and finally number 3. Gram Parsons when he was just a boy, and so was Parson's stepfather (who could sincerely take care of Gram Parsons when he was still alive) in real life, who after the burn was taking care of the body! Overall, however, it is probably the most disturbing about this film that the real Phil Kaufman was actually set up to help him with the facts of the story. Still, the movie became so fake and so bad that it really shook me, honestly! <br /> <br /> Also, as the average of the above-mentioned actor performance in the film is his main character played by ultra-grating Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman) is not only a bad actor but seems to be asleep throughout most of the film and the rest of the pious cast are for the most part either hysterical, brain-dead, or seem totally clueless about what they are doing first! Overall, if you like Johnny Knoxville or really kicking so-bad-they are not-nor-good-flicks buddies then i think you could get kicked out of this movie! But if you are like me and you are a fan of late Gram Parsons, enjoy movies that try to tell the truth as much as possible, especially if they are based on a real life story or you like good movies, road movies or fictional footage of life, you really would not want this movie and advise others to do so. I obviously hated this movie and wished it was never done, but because it was made, I would have preferred it to do otherwise than what happened, unfortunately! Perhaps one day the real facts of the story will appear and will become a real biopsy in Gram Parsons's life ... not just what happened to his body after his spirit left him. But until then all of us as an audience, or fans of a late artist, will get them a sad loss of film and a ubiquitous horrible monument to the music link that Gram Parsons is known to have left behind. It should also be noted that they are actually using Parsons music and a few others, even when filming, but it is not surprising that you will never hear of yourself in the least.
