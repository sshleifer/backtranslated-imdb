The past creeps into a rehabilitation addict when he reconnects with his sick brother and former girlfriend after he hopes to be his last stint in detoxification. "Life Dramas," which we present here in the simplest way you can imagine (even the font does not have a bite or joke). Cast is made up of attractive actors who smile merrily and music and photos are nasty (a couple of visual effects are ridiculous, indie-clich√©s touch that's a nice budget). Although this was written and directed by a man, this was a woman and I'm not sure, but I think it may be a clear reason why this picture of two men, stolen by brothers ever closer, never completely gel, never feels natural or seems, that he lived. It's an attempt to get into a male relationship, but a careful, sterile presentation is a scam. No one has a heart, lives, breathes or bleeds this material. The "Perfect Son" quickly dispels too many cooks in the kitchen.
