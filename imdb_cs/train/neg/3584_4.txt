It is curious that these are the eyes and mouth of Rene Russo - not Buddy's Gorilla - that appear as the "Buddy" focal point, produced by Jim Henson Pictures through Zoetrope Francis Ford Coppola. Somehow the innumerable close-ups of the Russian face have slipped into post-production phases and literally fills the screen as many times as bad apes are upstaged. An unintentionally funny story true to Gertrude "Trudy" Davies Lint's memory of a wealthy doctor's wife who turns his house into a pet house and wildlife. The film goes beyond good intentions ... with a positive drop with sincere sincerity. The film never fits into the "magic of family film" it needs, and for too long it seems that people and animals are clearly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes, two chimps are in the Russian kitchen and start to throw a cutting knife back and forth (Alan Cumming's head is missing by centimeters); but no eyebrows are erect because it's all for daytime entertainment. Yet, when a full-fledged gorilla Buddy gets crazy during the storm, the police are called - and all stared at Buddy through the window as he grabs the furniture in the living room. Furniture should be the smallest of anyone who would be afraid of this frantic, failed failure. But at least we know that Russo is in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up, Rene will make the next extreme detail. I wonder what is the budget of lipstick in this picture? ** z ****
