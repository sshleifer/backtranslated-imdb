It seemed to me that the film is challenging me for the new Pokémon Celebi. But the plot was a matter of course and was not interested in other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same ugly humor and bloody bad guys. The movie was not useful if you wanted the Pokémon to become famous. The film should not be better related to animas like Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawing and settings are not an original anime standard. It's even shame to talk about this movie. I bet the Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the result of the movie and give up Pokémon. Digimon is rather anime and does not drop anywhere near Pokemon. It is the second film that came out at the end of 2002.
