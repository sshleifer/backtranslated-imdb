Many of the themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, then the other parts feel like some other film, I do not know what, but the whole movie is a familiar feeling. It was nice to watch but it would be fantastic! if the story was more original. The theme of a little girl, a bad murderer from Leon, is a little bit upgraded. The opening scenes are really good :-) It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in movies :-) My biggest problem was remembering which parts were from Leon, Nikita and if the French or American version. If you did not see Leon, it's a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best regards / Rick
