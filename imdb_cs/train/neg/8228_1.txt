The problem with this movie is that it is filmed on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy. Maybe it's just that the one who was holding the camera could not hold on because they had a bout or something like that. There is too much teeth and vomiting in this movie. Someone in twenty minutes vomits and I think it has caused some bulimics or something. It was disgusting. Then there is annoying high curving shout that goes on and on and does not stop until the credits turn. I also did not like when all her friends were shot (or I do not know), and she goes to the van and handles pocket aids. It was really silly that even in the movie. How much gas can a person siphon to get a van? It has to be a lot, because the rest of the film will not get gas. It was a terrible movie, and I would highly recommend it never seen in your whole life.
