Do not use it just when you order a steak, but does the restaurant give you a chicken? So I felt like watching the "Battlestar Galactica". Arguments can be made in quality, but the fact remains, it's not what the fans ordered. Imagine if you were sitting in the proverbial restaurant I mentioned. You've been waiting for years to bring you the famous New York Strip steak you loved. When your meal comes, you will find that the name "New York Strip" has been used on a chicken bowl. You can complain, but the waiter only says "but cheeken is really GOOD ZIR"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted the New York Strip - STEAK! The waiter then explains: "You zee, the chef wanted to make you feel like you are, you want us NEW We felt cheeken would be more popular that we gave him the name of our previous delicious miracle." You will ask if you ever find the original New York Strip, but you are informed that because the restaurant has a New York Strip menu, you never see the original New York Strip - sometimes again. <br /> <br /> This is the case of creating something new and abusing "Battlestar Galactica" namesake on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini series is an insult to all fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the production team that was entrusted with this new version apparently scorned the original. The team in charge of the resurrection of BG should love the original series - trying to improve what fans love and do not try to carelessly sell this new series using the name Battlestar Galactica. If SciFi Channel wanted us to show you NEW, then do it! Give him a new name! Do not use a name that we kindly remember in an attempt to bait the audience. It really leaves us the chance to see any ink in the future in the future. We've been waiting for 25 years to see what we know as BG because we love something original! We simply did not want NAME and the rest of the basic concept. There are things we loved about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, probably the BEST elements of the original were those that were omitted. Certainly, the original BG was imperfect and could use some update. This mini-series, however, was not an improvement in any respect, but special effects (which were good, but not unusual, according to today's standards). Many viewers will discuss the quality of this new show, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> It was said ... I will offer a few comments about the benefits of this new mini itself (not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> The combat sequences were the best. Efforts were clearly made to make the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at this effect". I would not say that these sequences were exceptional by today's standards, but they were in line with original cable-made films. What was this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views tried to falsely affect the "real" camera effect with later viewing and zooming. However, it was overused because of the fact that there was no obvious SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely smarter series, Babylon 5, is the only example I've seen that such "live cameras" have been used effectively when we have allegedly witnessed a security camera action. Are you asking for a script? The script had the feeling of being a teenager, for the other teenagers. The characters felt cardboard and stereotyped. In fact, the whole story felt connected with other known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were those great elements that have been preserved from the original series. It was, of course, "exhausted" to spend your average television. <br /> <br /> The human interaction was pitiful. Rather than a drama based on subtle looks, expressions, and fine timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to be so obvious that they lost all the ability to move every refined viewer. This was evident in any interaction between Adam and his son. The director had to make sure that the deepest and most dangerous spectator would not notice it, even though he did not pay attention. I'm sorry, but real people do not behave like ever. <br /> <br /> I would not consider it a bad show if it was in itself. Nothing great; it will never be worshiped by true Scifi fans or craftsmen, but it would be worthy of the masses. I personally could live without her. I just watched him see how he really caught the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> As this ministry is always remembered, it is a symbol of how the quality of the revelation was told side by side to refer to larger numbers. Even the SciFi Channel has "exhausted" its production to take care of the masses, unlike its true market place, science fiction fans. It will be the time we asked for a steak, and they insisted on giving us a chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you with just one thought. <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
