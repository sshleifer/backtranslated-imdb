Writer / director Peter Greenaway, with his latest exercise in an unpleasant self-confidence, 8 ½ women, identifies himself with the title of High Lord of the Art House. The film watches the rich Englishman and his son on their mutual efforts for sexual satisfaction as they entice and blackmail women (guess how many) to join their personal collection of concubines. Think about any possible way this assumption might be offensive and the chances are that Greenaway did it. Female characters are just a little bit more than the two-protagonists' fetish catalog. There is obsessed with Kabuki Mio, still pregnant with Giaconda and Beryl, who has something for livestock. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, it's "half a woman" to get her? Greenaway vehemently denies all charges of misogyny, but if it is not, then what is it? The film continues to eroticate anything and everything about Japan, continuing the topics of his snoring - a good (but less sexist) film 1996, The Pillow Book. But where the book of pillows was erotic and charming, 8 ½ women are just horny and exploiting. Greenaway's work is insubstantial and arrogant in its fetishism, and the only person who can enjoy it is the author.
