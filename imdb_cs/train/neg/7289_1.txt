This is a film of a huge call to a relatively well-defined group (of which I am not part). I went to see this movie without knowing what to expect - in the end I thought it was disappointing. The history of the horribly dysfunctional (often directly "twisted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. Such an epic saga should really give the audience something more. Finally, images like this are about human condition - this film has barely revealed any new light on any of its more meaningful aspects.
