Like so many media experiments, this amateur effort also involves the seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the five years and more since the release, there was a realistically less realistic real-world event in software development and, in my opinion, it's most boring than the previous commentator, I imagine ... The director is clearly Hitchcock's fan, and it's bad that the movie was not better executed, but in reality it's almost parody of the pulp, including the soundtrack that shouted when we had to pay attention. One can almost see exclamation marks and capitals on the yellow page. I have to admit that I considered it rather fun for all these reasons and more. Sometimes we will offer less of us a bit and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstruction for educational purposes. Oh yes - and although the seams showed and shouted a lot, my pulse rate came out and I was reluctant to get up and stop.
