Still another Die Hard directly to tear off the video with a cartoon of villains? How many more of these gods have been lost (and poorly) lost from the more popular action films of the late 1980s and early 90s still lurking there? For recording (not that you really have fun), it's another spectacular tear-off of the combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 complemented by a complete tweak and predictability. <br /> <br /> Unjustified villains are the usual choice of cartons cut out of pistols that come back in different ways when the film progresses, the hero is naturally an ex policeman or something that has problems with family and attitude and of course brings along with the party only the usual emotional luggage, but also the corresponding piece of eye candy and his unpleasant son. The supposed luxury cruise ship that runs between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as the cross between the liner and the ferry. does it explain a bit how it seems to be larking around on a rusty junction by ferry? in New Zealand! It's played as a wooden deck, the scenario is sad, one cloak is predictable, the villains are totally inappropriate and the plot has holes in it that you could sail over the boat. It seems like never ending the influx of this kind of ripping directly onto video litter polluting late night TV slots and DVD supermarket shopping supermarkets everywhere (though even this movie is so bad that it still does not see the release of the DVD but give it time!) Is there any the chance for something to happen at least half an hour, the most convincing and the most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I thought not ...
