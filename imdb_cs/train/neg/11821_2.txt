Encouraged by positive comments on this movie, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad error. I've seen 950+ movies and it's really one of the worst - it's pretty much everywhere: editing, tempo, story, acting, soundtrack (the only lame country tune - no less than four times). The movie looks cheap and uncomfortable and is extremely boring. I was rarely so happy to see the final credits of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from making one point is Harvey Keitel - while it is far from his best performance, it seems he will at least make some effort. One for Keite's obsessions.
