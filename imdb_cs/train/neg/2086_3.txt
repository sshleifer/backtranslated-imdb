Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired land (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in their hands. Even his casual flop (six days, seven nights) shows signs of life and humor that they thought worth it. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a relatively original plot (man hiding a superhero, the superhero is taking off superpower-revenge) and shaping it for something nice. "Girlfriend" is an unnecessary exercise. A simple pony conspiracy is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether it's a romantic comedy or a superhero. The result is a movie that both revolves without a good aspect. Uma Thurman is a habit as usual, and Luke Wilson pulls his part, though his tantrum is growing rapidly. What's even more crazy is that in certain scenes (for example, when Uma turns on the knocking face by the wall), you feel that the witty, nasty Reitman's opus practically yells to get out. But for a few seconds the spell was lost, it was as fast as the superhero, whose films almost disappoint.
