Another color apology for men in rubber suits that struggle with each other. This time, passengers in the future will arrive in 1992 and will take several people to return to them in 1944 and prevent Godzilla from forming, thus saving the future Japan from destruction. But once this task has been accomplished, time travelers are revealed as many double crusaders whose own creatures continue rampage and without stopping it? Eek! It all sounds very stupid and probably is, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the last battle looks pretty good. Unfortunately, the remaining visual effects are more garbage than pleasant garbage and the film is as boring as its predecessors. Look at the embarrassed Spielberg in prank.
