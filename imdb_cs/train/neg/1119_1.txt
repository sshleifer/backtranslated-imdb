Even if this movie was supposedly a joke in response to criticism, it's still a terrible movie. If you make a commitment to such things, at least it will make a good joke ... Jeroen Krabbé is, in my opinion, Gerard Depardieu the poor ... naturally I hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in the Iron Mask three musketeers one . Otherwise, I'm a boxed poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The poorest of the poor man ... it is not fair to the economically disadvantaged. If the "4th man" is considered to be a bourgeois critic ... what do I say? It is not. Let's say hypothetically if it should be, it was not sharp enough. Satira is a tricky thing ... if it's not sharp enough, the viewer will become a joke ... ... I think it happened. The story ends up just like a bunch of unhappy, disgusting characters who do nothing about what matters and no interesting way either ..... (for a more interesting and useful use see Luis Bunuel film .... very sharp satire <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> a good filmmaker, I give him an advantage of doubt, and I suppose it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control ..... although I guess he did not ruin Jeroen Krabbé because he's the worst actor and every character he played was demanding bourgeois ass ... except that it is incompetent, it will become a strange caricature Do you think Mr. Voerhoven has done it well And Jeroen Krabbé is also a joke ass I just do not see ... So Do you understand the dilemma that I have to deal with right? It's the worst film to be a good director. There is some kind of duplicity. I knew that "Patch Adams" was horrible without seeing it. Do not be fooled by the "deceptive envelope of the 4th man" or by Mr. Voerhoven as a good director, etc. Atd.
