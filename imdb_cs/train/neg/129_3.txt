I'm really curious about two films in one half of Lena's sexual experimental party, and the other half is her curiosity about political / socialism. Whether it is the director of any kind, they do not drive together. The director should just stick to the romantic party of Lena and make a separate film for politics. There is a bizarre mix of political / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political talks, breast floppy, and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional document than a movie. Other than interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored with the dry watching of this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the naked / sex scenes are exaggerated for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. Pervasive nudity is a great way away from any conspiracy. I think the cast has done a great job. They play their things credibly. There is not much of what I saw in American movies at the time.
