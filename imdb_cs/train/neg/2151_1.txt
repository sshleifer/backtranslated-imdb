This is a hybrid creature born in Carl Macek's mind. With Robotech Second Generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 in one filthy movie that has no logic! The story is very, very bad, and you can not forgive Megazone's action when they have nothing to do with Robots. If this movie has such a high position for a TV series and not for itself! I said it, the name can not save it!
