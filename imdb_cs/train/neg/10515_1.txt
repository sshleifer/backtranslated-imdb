This is the typical movies for "on the toilet" movies. The long story is short, a lot of teenagers / young adults have become in the midst of a haunted forest and got into the naked nymphomani demons. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basics for this slasher again: <br /> <br /> -As a woman, - a bachelor or young adult is marooned in somewhere scary, -gory death death, -the last survivor is a well-built young woman who always shows up on her midriff but never less bra, - a haunted, crazy person who knows about the evil, kiss-kiss scene, -sex to be a killer, -no conspiracy <br /> <br> > Even for the slasher cheese film it was really terrible. The atmosphere is totally dead. Nothing, sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to be interested in male and lesbian female audiences. He watched it as a feeling that it was being watched with an unpleasant heap of head or a cold cold head. Give the demon ... 0/10.
