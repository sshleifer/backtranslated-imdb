Herschello Gordon Lewis fans of Goremeist should look elsewhere if they choose this film as their normal blood buckets because there is little precious in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell a bizarre story and rely on the special effects of bargaining on a budget, which is likely to be doubling if one day's occupation changed his pockets for change. It's weird, though it's cheap and very bad (especially McCabe like Mitchell), the total conspiracies of the plot are still paying attention. Imagine what this movie could be like a decent budget! Overall, they try to taste champagne on the beer budget.
