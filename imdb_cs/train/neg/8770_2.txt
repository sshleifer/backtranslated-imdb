This film was the longest film and record movie with confidence. He had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002) I think no one had the courage to do such a thing. The film as a title suggests is based on the Kargil War but the problem is that there are too many characters and romantic subplots and songs of many characters are boring <br /> <br /> Even there are too many film freedoms like killing people with knives, wonder what soldier does it? </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> Directed by JP Dutta fading in front of BORDER queues Music is fine Among the huge cast Ajay Devgan stands tall, Saif is very good in his part, and it's also his first film Abhishek is like Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is futile, Suneil is alright Akshaye Khanna is doing his part well to rest are passive Rani is good, Esha's fine rest are passable
