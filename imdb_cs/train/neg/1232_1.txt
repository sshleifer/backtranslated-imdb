She says a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this film. No wonder he has no other name for his name for writing or directing. She made a serious professional mistake in choosing this career. It is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. The basic thing that is bad in this movie is its absurd story about women running away from the four weak criminals, is a glamorous and complete lack of logic. <br /> <br /> ** After leaving the department store, four doves who surround her. Tell me, what woman will aggressively CONTINUE the potential attacker when surrounded and sue them verbally? I do not mean that the attack has already begun, because of course it is quite normal that someone is fighting. But she pushed him out and led her to the next level. No woman would do it if it had 1) had no weapon, 2) it was sure that the deposit was very close and relatively safe from damage, or 3) the attackers were so young and weak that they could be sure to take them. None of this has been used in this situation, so she just acted like someone who asks to be raped or executed. And by the way, when the security patrol approached, as soon as Kim Basinger appeared in the observation distance, why would not she immediately come to him for help or scream? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She had a good pursuit for three minutes, but instead of just slipping diagonally across the houses and crawling through the fences, she pulled out a red set of tools and began to hide under her hood. I understand he's trying to fix his car, but he should run away. (I did not even mean a chronological summary of the movie because I was angry with the people doing it, their reviews, but that's the case that every major sequence of this movie has something so fearlessly stupid that I have to comment on it). Why should she wear the loud tool of the Red Toolbox when she tries to slip in the dark? When she caught her, one of the jokes asked her to open a set of tools. First he resists and eventually opens it. And take the key. This scene is so rich in the subtleties of the complete failure of the dramatic effect I have to divide, it's one of the deepest scenes in the whole movie. When she is asked to open a box, she first rejects her as if she was about to get one of the thugs to open her out of anger when she did not open it, just as someone in an action movie had some device that the enemy required the the person touched / squeezed / opened / manipulated, and once the hero refuses to open, enemies catch him, only to let the device automatically release the chemicals / shot him / her face / unconscious, which was the hero's plan all the time. It feels like what they were trying to do with Kim Basinger when he opens the tool box dramatically and quickly chooses WRENCH and sends one of the thugs and somehow gets out of him and the other three of his throats. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When she fled, how did she finally move back to where they were crazy? I think it was a scene where they had a radio that played loudly in the respect of the dead guy. Somehow she bowed to them when I thought they were moving from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this whole concept is so weak, because the whole reason she is being persecuted is because she "witnessed the murder they had committed before the security officer before, and they felt it as one of those thugs said, they could only leave the city and go back to the city they were driving from, none other than she saw them in the same way and probably did not get a license plate.If these options did not work for their benefit, how does hell rise and chase someone who kills them, improving your chances of getting away with the original murder?
