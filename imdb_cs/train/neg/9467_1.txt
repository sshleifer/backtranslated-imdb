If you liked the movie Grinch ... go see it again because it was not where it is as close as a good Seussian film translation. Mike Myers cat is probably the most unpleasant figure who has a "grace" screen recently. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with terrible frantic sound, which is probably the only laugh I've heard in the theater. Even the children did not like this people and the children were laughing now. Save money and check out Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun family movie.
