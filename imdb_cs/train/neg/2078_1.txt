I started to see this movie yesterday, and though I did not have the hope of this movie, I was still bitterly disappointed! I actually can not believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was bad !!! The story was shameful and the acting was horrible (though she had big names like Uma Thurman). This movie relied heavily on its special effects ... but they personally had no influence on me. I sincerely wished she never saw her and I strongly warn everyone not to see this movie. It's a complete waste of money, and you end up being disappointed. My advice is to save money, go shopping, behave yourself, you just do not go and you do not see this movie ... You will regret it lol!
