I was tempted to see this movie as a star but eventually it brings it all. It plays more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about the corruption of big cities. The biggest mistake is its predictability and total lack of tension. We know who the bad people are from the beginning, and just follow when they fall as a domino. The film, for its merits, has been abstaining from violence and sex, but has forgotten to replace a good, pure novel or excitement in a different way. All taste good, flat decaffeine-free cola diet. Q & A, also held in New York, is a much better alternative, just like "LA Confidential".
