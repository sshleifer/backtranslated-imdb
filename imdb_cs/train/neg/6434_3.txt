I'm always surprised by how different they are, and for almost every film you have both extremes. People who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst. Stigmata would not be the worst movie I've ever seen but it's up there. Especially sound. Producers spent more time on soundtrack than on editing. It was so noisy when a soundtrack was played and no one spoke, and then, when Patrica spoke in her monotone voice, she could not hear it. I usually like Patricia and Gaberial, but both were flats in this movie. Patrica had basically 3 emotions. Quiet, with a lot of pain or angry, she has a stigma. The former was predominant, the second included gloomy pain, the third included the lifting of her voice. It was the volume that made the three difficult, not the emotion. Maybe I missed a lot of deep meaning and scams that everyone talks about, or maybe I was terrified of the terrible shooting and MTV style. When looking at a 3-minute video, you need fast slices and slow motion to make a quick story, it's a nausea in a two-hour feature film. I do not see the importance of seeing her that women over the rack and baby. And no Pittsburg dies so often! <br /> <br /> I think it could be a real story that could say that it could be thought of, but the whole budget was spent on buying music and equipment, shooting shots and renting the gorgosian apartment that Mrs Arquett he lived in the end of shooting the guy with the story.
