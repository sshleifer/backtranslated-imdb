the cover of the box makes this movie look really good, do not be fooled. In 1984, the university was the last good year for horror, but this film is upset. characters are so unpleasant. only the teacher is fine. it's like no plot to this movie, who the hell would ever produce this film waste? spoilers upstairs, the teacher dies in this, and it was a woman, we all know we must have a female surviver if you are going to break the rules to do it in good horror,
