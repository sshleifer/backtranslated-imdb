I do not want to get too far into detail because I can not really justify that I've lost a lot of time to review this film, but I had to give another opinion to help people avoid the movie. Animation is raw and the story alternates between boring / absurd and extremely irritating. Humor was totally lost to the audience and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, not a science fiction or anything like that - his attempt at a comedy about mischief and humor simply did not work after being translated. It was a total effort to watch this movie and the terrible way I was at the beginning of a film festival, especially considering how excited and how open I was for anything - I did not expect Shell to continue, but I was expecting something fun and it just did not reach . Yaaawwnnn ... Instead, rent Kino's Journey.
