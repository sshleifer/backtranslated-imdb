Disappointment and irritation. The script does not have a true understanding of human nature, but instead takes clich√©s in a disjointed way. The emblem is not explored deeply. These are puppets that dropped into a conspiracy that openly admits that she needs a dramatic element, her mother's affair with her daughter's lover.

The screenplay shows Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde, without any hints, why, besides having cocaine before the big scene. <br /> <br /> The mature writer could have done much more with this subject.
