It's a really crazy little movie. Probably the original (not) holy trio was governed by the law decreasing the proceeds with the third one, "The Final Conflict," which had degenerated into a ridiculous sub-chapter about halfway through the film, apparently only to ensure the necessary unnecessarily complicated deaths, etre for the "Omen" series. But then try to throw this popped-up TV movie (be careful that Omen box buyers set to DVD - do not be fooled by the widescreen transmission ratio, it was and it's a tight little screen) on the back of a series of generally subtle chiller demons was unforgivable , in particular, approved as it was, the producer and producer of the first three films by Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. If it was any, I'd give a plot, besides the usual deaths of death (hopelessly confusing for TV sensitivity) and the worst acting I've seen. All who are involved in this project and people who eat it should be embarrassed to see the transvestite sometimes on screen, let alone masquerading under the name "Omen." If one person is convinced my reviews to prevent this mess, I will feel better.
