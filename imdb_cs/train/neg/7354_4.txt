As a Hammer completist, I was afraid of the time when I'd have to get the courage to watch this movie and the one that followed, Holiday on the Buses. I saw one movie Buses and I thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was full of horrible comedy about British TV screens around the early seventies. I am ashamed to say that in reality there are parts of this movie that I laughed at. I do not know if it was because I now figured the characters and enjoyed some situations and knew how to react. I found Blakey especially fun, although I never swear in the trilogy, saying that his catchy expression "I'll get you Butler." When I watched the holidays on the buses, thin film jokes began and these three films can be compared with the early Hammer Dick Barton trilogy, because the second film is the best (though it's probably the only way to compare it). only people who want to watch this movie are probably supporters of television series that will doubt it and Hammer even resembles. I would say in complete stories that this film is not that bad and I can definitely imagine the worst Hammer comedy.
