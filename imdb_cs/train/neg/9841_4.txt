I really really wanted to like Julian Po. I think Slater is underestimated as an actor, and many of the supporting players here are better than they are allowed to show in this movie. I realize it's based on a story I did not read. So I do not know if what I see is that the film mistakes come from the story, or it was given to him by a director / screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voice, a confessional tone that began with the cue. But then...? Nothing! Several local clich√©s ask Julian's point block to explain his intention to commit suicide. It could be said that he does not answer because it is not their business. But Julian is the one who was just pushing the token out of his mind in public. Neither Julian nor a director / writer, although the Julian figure holds a poem written record for God's cause, appears to be inclined to provide anything that goes beyond just a little bit of information about Julian's life. He says he's an accountant. He says his family moved when he was a child because of his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with locals who seem to be designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. However, none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to consider all these natives as local, as if they were foreigners from another planet, as if they were the only (and only) rational among them. This could work as an allegory if Julian Po had some defining qualities or something that might approach wisdom. The closest thing to come to reveal something about itself is in the scene in which it deliberately humiliates a naive, religious woman of mechanics. And what this scene reveals is nothing to create Julian's empathy. I only see that the Julian character - as he portrays them - is selfish, tiny and totally condescending. Several kinds of matches with the attitude of the director of this half-finished film. And the poor Michael Parks, an actor he once promised, has no work here.
