After too many bad memories, I tried to skip this episode every time it appeared in Sequence 2. I recently followed her just to remind me why. I have always considered it the worst episode of ST: TNG (except for "gray shades" that hardly count as an episode). I keep listening to the clumsy dialogue and thinking of the scenario of a red-pencilled teacher of writing 101: "SHOW, DO NOT KEEP!" From Deanna Troi's statement and all the other constant reminders of what is the charming, dangerous cheat of Okona, Guinan's explanation of how funny her droid is a prank (not) who cares about conflict resolution is not Not a point that is not stressed and a bit underlined for our edification, and in none of them is an incredible moment. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog, which is the focus of the conspiracy. On the other hand, it could be that anyone who does not have John Barrowman (Jack Harkness of "Doctor Who") could pull out of this insurance agent role. (By the way, by the way, on the basis of Data. Though I think Joe Piscopo was no longer funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to do with it.) Although it was a little ridiculous for Jerry Lewis.) <br /> day, you can think of it as a charming little tribute to the smaller episode of the Original Series. I'd rather skip "Time Squared" or "Q Who".
