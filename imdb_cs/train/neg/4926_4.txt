I saw this film for two reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to perform quite a stupid film. I like the idea that Dracula is really a reincarnation of Judy Iskariot because he explains his contempt for all the things of the Christians, but there were so many camps that this idea was not realized as it could be. I see this film rather as a way for talented Gerard Butler to pay the fees before it is truly recognized, and the way legendary Christopher Plummer reminds the public (I and the 5 other people who have seen this film) that it still exists. Actually, I had special features on the DVD than the movie itself.
