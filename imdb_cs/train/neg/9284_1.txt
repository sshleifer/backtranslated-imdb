Man, even plan 9 from space is better than this movie. This film does not have enough space for half an hour, but has managed to prolong it for more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in those over-combat scenes, but things like the Fong Sai Yuk Legend are much better than this ugly thing that would be better protected.
