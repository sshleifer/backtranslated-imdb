Ok next movie was bought by me and Joe Swatman. OK, it's not the worst film I've remeasured this week, but it's still royal. we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap. Monster Jigsaw is the Muse Mash all these dysfunctional student ideas, u only know ur in trouble when someone recalls it with buzzsaw and paper shotgun, the film was not as cruel as we hoped, I think death is a heart attack. Again, I think acting is angry, the sum of actors must be porn stars, and one gets into her bottom for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the worst part is the end, leaving it open for a bit of Jigsaw 2, but it's never gonna happen to face it. <br /> <br /> My rating: <br /> <br /> Funny 4/100 fake (how much we laughed) 73/100 works 8/100 in general 12/100
