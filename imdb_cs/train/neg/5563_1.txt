Dolph Lundgren boasts and thinks about this incoherent mystery / thriller, which is not nearly as a box you would have believed. It's really pretty good, but the story is a clutter of B-movie clich√©s (detectives, revenge, moguls, chaps, S & M) that seems to have been created when they went together. The film will pick up a bit in the second half, but instead, for a more decent Lundgren's piece, he will bring RED SCORPION.
