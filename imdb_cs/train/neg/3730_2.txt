At first there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with making a film like trying to introduce the gospel. So my doubts about this film are not in his sincerity or desire. As a Christian, though amillennialist, I believe there will be great tribulation, and I believe that Christ will return as he says so much. So even though I disagree with this movie about scare, there's no reason why I have this movie so low. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This film features some of the most famous science fodder of the 1950s. No, this movie ranks there with Outerspace Plan 9. This movie failed in old age well and was probably dated at the time they are doing the sequel. Producers of the film genre of the apocalypse could learn how to eliminate the final film, but failed. The Left Behind, Apocalypse, and Omega Code series did not know because they were dealing with FX issues and dating, but their scenarios are still bad and their behavior is wooden. <br /> <br /> There are great Christian movies with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I am surprised that the crew of MST3K has never recorded this message.
