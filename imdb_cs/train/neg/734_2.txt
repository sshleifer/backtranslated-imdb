This movie was a bullshit with the "C." The opening scene showed a promise. But the "promise" was broken shortly after the audience learned where the story is going. <br /> <br /> And a wooden statue, Morty, which was rather scary in the original movie, looks like this just goofy. It was, of course, just a guy in the left plastic. (And by the way, who else thinks that Morty is one of the most dangerous names on planet Earth? It's Jimmy or Fred when it comes to the horror value of the Henry-freakin'-Kissinger wood statute. Running, that's Dr. Kissinger! "That would be about as frightening as" Morty. "And then there's a scene where the hero hits his father's tombstone with a" hammer, "maybe you could guess -" two in four? " "No, it is an angry beat of the tombstone of a father with a twig - worse than it is when the characters go away, the tomb actually and inexplicably bleeds .. Oh, brother, there is also a native American who lives with grandparents of the main character, but apparently will not do anything Morty-maintains, keeps scary Morty-legends, warns those who mock and even fixes Morty's arm when he gets damaged during childish jokes, but for all his respect and tenderness toward Morty, does Morty give a furry hair? br /> <br /> Movie s and a few people die in a way that fits their worst fears. This movie is a real starry. Do not rent it.
