The black guy becomes a rich white guy and the rich white guy looks like he embraces hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments in the movie will bounce off. The problem I have is that it does not work and almost never works. OK, so nobody would have expected Lance to catch such a body and suddenly started acting like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I admit it. At the same time, however, it goes too far. Should I imagine that a rich white guy sings rap and develops things, plays as a bastion of hip-hop culture and people just accept it? What about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white man *, even if he does not care about his money or strength? It's so incredible that it's not funny either. I just could not stop the distrust and could not finish the movie. I added one more star because she laughed me a few times. But I just could not get around the whole "white guy who makes hip hop" a thing that was never done well in any movie I've ever seen is trying. That was no exception.
