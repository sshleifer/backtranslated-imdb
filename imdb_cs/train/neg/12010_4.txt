The abbreviation "F.P.1" means "Floating Platform # 1". The film shows the construction of the "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which is used as a "air station" for a transatlantic aircraft. He founded the current novel Curt Siodmark; it was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 not r√©pond plus" (1933) and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). [Edit] Stars Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (like Droste), and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) find love and sabotage to turn on and off the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl drove. Mr. Veidt is very fun; but in the "love of the triangle" with Mrs Esmond and Mr. Fenton is not convincing. The younger stars were married to Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak. Both the concept and the film are not older. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
