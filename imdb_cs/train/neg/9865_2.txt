I picked up this film in the hope that it would be similar to the gay player The Gamers from Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is exceptionally recommended by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is filmed in this fake documentary style that the office is famous for but it can not deliver. The reason is partly hard acting, but mainly writing and direction. True, it can be fun to use every singing clich√© in terms of role playing games, but here it happens to become extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene you know what a "joke" is about. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is displayed over the top. There is no subtlety in this movie, if there were "LAUGH NOW" or cheap 80s of laughing style, it would not make a big difference. With some scenes you can not help thinking "Yes, I have a reason why they thought it would be funny," but the way it is done exhausts all the impetus from a possible joke.
