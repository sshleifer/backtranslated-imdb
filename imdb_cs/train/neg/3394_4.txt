This film features Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a bride to order from Russia, accepts Nicole Kidman's mail, and gets more than negotiated when he surprises it is not what he seems to be. The story is quite predictable, and Chaplin is too committed to a point where he is somewhat anointed. Kidman is rather good in this role, so her character on the one thing in this movie is interesting. CLASS: C
