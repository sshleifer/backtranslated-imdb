*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you should review a movie based on the premise itself, one might think that you are watching the average animated horror. The chart is as follows. A documentary group will perform on the island to record a surfing or bloody surfing document. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as "Blood Surf.") It seems like a rather interesting idea that, if examined further, could somewhat improve the film. That's not true, however, because the part of the film of blood surfing is minimal because their documentary is interrupted by a great crocodile with salt water. The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is when someone goes with a crocodile, which appears in this movie more often, it seems that no one is damned. Most people who made the film had only a baking victim in the scene, which was supposed to be scary, but it ended up ridiculous because the dialogue in this movie was very dubious. Another thing that really provokes this movie is the fact that they are characters that are completely superfluous for the film itself. They are a lot of pirates who can see that they add another 10 minutes to a mercilessly short film. The effect can be said to be average. It would probably be much more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script that could work. Overall, there is no person who has a terrible impact on me. Every person looked like a ruined cartoon, so none of these actors had any impact on me. <br /> <br /> The Crocodile itself is supposedly huge, just over 31 feet, and that sense of size is well-portraised by the obvious false crocodile that we have provided in the film. The crocodile death at the end of the movie is so ridiculously fake and imagined that it's doing the stomach. With the giant screams of the movie hero, he announces that he has a plan that turns out to be falling on a hill and a crocodile is getting to the bottom of this hill to a happy tip. > <br /> Overall, I would like to say that this movie is one that must be seen to believe how bad it can be. What seemed like a good idea at the time was a terrible scenario and a huge sense of low budget that all created a really horrible movie.
