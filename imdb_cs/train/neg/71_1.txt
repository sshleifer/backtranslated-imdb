This movie was so unfortunately bad, I could not believe I was looking at it. Direction, editing, production, and screenplay looked like they were made by high school students who do not know much about movies. There was no story that made any sense. Big emotional moments and climax (like one at the beginning between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as one suggested at the very beginning) will not get anywhere, and where they are not set to be in a more elegant and effective film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, so it is difficult for us to have any connection with them. Surprisingly, the effect is not entirely bad, but horrible writing cancels relatively convincing performance. The film plays like a particularly bad western / epic universe and sadly reduces the fascinating (true) story it tries to say. I read a lot of reviews that prevented the film from being important to Australians for the subject. That's all very well, but only because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOES NOT FILM GOOD. Nobody says that the subject is not good, just the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was a very important event for Americans, but that does not mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad. Failures all around, though Heath and Orlando are beautiful to look.
