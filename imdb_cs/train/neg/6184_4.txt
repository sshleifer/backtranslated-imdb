Inverted film about a good-looking but helpless couple who decides to live their dream and take people to the diving. The pair almost immediately makes a poor choice of customers and mixes with some people who want to restore items that we think fall into the ocean floor during the initial credit. A great view of the video could be much better if it was not so much of a good look. Executions are workable and the plot is not really bad, or if the director and the producers are not redirected to the conspiracy to make sure we see a bunch of well-balanced people in their swimsuits (or what I'm guessing the reason for "unrated" is watching a pair of blond bare breasts). The film never creates any tension or increases beyond the level of forgotten television film. If you get to see it, you will not get your eyes off eye because eye candy is nice, but we really need to prevent manufacturers from making movies that are excuses to have a paid vacation.
