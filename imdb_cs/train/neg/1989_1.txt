I would like to give this movie a zero, but it was not an option !! This movie is upset !!! Women can not act. I should have known it would suck until I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe that I had not changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. the idea of ​​black women as gunmen in the Western days is ridiculous. it's not just a thing for a race, it's also a sex. The combination of these two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry, because some people in the movie are not bad actors / actresses, but the movie was horrible in itself. it was not trusted as a movie. it can be "fun" for a certain group of people, but I'm not in this group. lol. and using a great line from a great, great movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
