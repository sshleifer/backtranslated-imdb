Wow - this is angry. I will write it as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> Count 4 naive sluts back to your castle. Lots of nothing happens for a long time. Some chrome and neo-erotic sex scenes with a soft core are becoming. Some girls get their head cut off (off screen) - the end. The only thing that's going on here is good-looking sets and costumes, some bad dabbies that lead to some inadvertently funny dialogue, and a few short spitting nudity. And believe me - those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minute time that this movie is. In fact, the best part is glued at the beginning by a distributor that contains some goth-haired girls covered with blood and showing their breasts - and again - it definitely is not worth the cost of receiving for this waste. As everyone else knew - the title of the film is totally absurd - there is no bloodshed or even no dance in the movie. It could also be called "goat horse leads a circle - a priest" - and at least then it would have a better title, which is also not in the movie. The exact title would be '90 Minutes of Torture '- another challenging title, which would be at least true ... for the viewer. Frankly speaking, the trailer that's on the disk shows all the best parts (and the "best" I use extremely loose ...) so I really recommend watching it instead of if you're still curious. I can not imagine anyone liking this wreck of a movie - please, consult me ​​and leave it on the shelves. 2/10
