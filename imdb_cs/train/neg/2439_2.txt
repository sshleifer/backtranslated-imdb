"Intense Care" by Dorny von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies he ever did. This extremely cheap Dutch film slasher offers some gore and lots of absurd situations. Horror veteran George Kennedy is completely useless as Professor Bruckner. the acute is slow, and the climax is ridiculous. The prominent surgeon has a car accident. She's been in the coma for seven years and then wakes up and continues to bloody rampage. Intensive Care is clearly influenced by American slasher films including "Halloween" and "Friday 13th" series. The aliases are merry and the dialogues are painfully stupid. However, if you have the right mood you can put this piece of the basket look. You will laugh until it hurts with this one - you can trust me!
