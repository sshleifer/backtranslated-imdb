Let me tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice. For the first time, I was a kid and the film was very fun for me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and interesting and the main character was pretty cool. I found it again a few days ago. It was awful. Really. I do not know why I thought it was fun before, but now ... I was not allowed to. There was nothing fun. It was just stupid. The story was weak. The game was nothing special. In this film, they are great actors, but the acting is, at best, average. <br /> <br /> What's worse is the fact that this movie is racist. Really. Do not get me wrong, I usually did not complain about racism in movies. But I saw people complaining about the lack of blacks in movies like 'Temple Shaolin', or the one black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of those bad or ... Whatever, you get a point. People see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to the film as "Meteor Man". Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. Good guys are not white people. In fact, there is only one white guy in the movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All good boys are African Americans. Do not get me wrong, I do not care that a good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I care about is the fact that in this movie we barely see a white man. It's the only movie I've ever seen. It's just not realistic. If there is only one black man in the Japanese film, which is the "Street Fighter" case, there is no problem - in Japan, most Asian people are. But if there is only one white man in the American film, there is a problem - in the US, most people are white. It's like shooting a full-white Japanese film and just one Asian as a bad guy. It's just not true. That's it. I give the film a 4/10 grade. It would be 1/10 if I did not have a child like that.
