I had no real expectations for this movie and I'm glad. Even though I expected it to be bad, I would be disappointed. Where to start? First of all, I think 15% of the film consisted of static standing ghosts in a dark jungle. I get it. There are scarecrows. I think the title "The Straw" was good enough. Secondly, it is never explained in terms of scarecrows and paranormal events. Is it too many times when I left the WTF? <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film was taken seriously. I'm all for the B-film with blood buckets, the cries of femininity and the senseless violence that results from a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these films often know they are B-movies and even boast of him, such as Dead Snow (a cheerful Scandanavian zombie movie) or Evil Dead 2. But this film seems to be unconscious of his conspiracy. there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you have a horror film crap, do it with killing. And if you have one hot and one semi-hot girl, one of them needs to show at least some side arm. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary says, skip "Scarecrows" and just look into the eyes. Thank you.
