I just saw this movie on Flix after I met him. I grew up watching F Troop and I had a lot of trouble for Wrangler Jane, so I was shocked, literally shocked to find out that when she saw this movie, the degenerate sister was Melody Patterson who looks pretty good but looks completely different and Unfortunately, they are poorly photographed. I would never know it was a million years. What the hell is that picture? I agree with the boys that the film is not in a position to push. No sex, no gore, no teasing. It's also a remake of Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or there). Most of the action is boring; the main character spends a tremendous amount of time running around the home and underground of a casual doctor and the surrounding area, in general, or the cop is overwhelmed, all of which is boring and time is done. Now, if the Italians did it, half of the film would be a bumpy little girl who was unconscious, suspicious of Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam. But you only get it for 20 seconds.
