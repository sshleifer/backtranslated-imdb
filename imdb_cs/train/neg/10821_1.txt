I read the novel "Jane Eyre" for the first time in 1986. It was around the time I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark. It was an excellent version and much like a book. A few years later I looked at this version and was horrified. William Hurt is totally unhealthy like Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character where William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story of love and passion, but I did not see this version. No, back to the BBC version. Good time is guaranteed.
