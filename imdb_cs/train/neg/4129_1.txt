After I watched about half, I was ready to give up and shut down, but I held it to the end. It's a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The game is bad - much worse than in 80's T & A movies. There are several humorous attempts that fail and the film is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager, this movie will have a certain challenge, but for those who have seen many movies, you will know how the film will appear after the first 10 minutes. You spend the rest of the time agonizing and waiting for the final credits. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this.
