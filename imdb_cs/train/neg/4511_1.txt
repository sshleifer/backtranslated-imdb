Rather than long dance sequences and close ups of the characters that made the film stretch - the film would better explain the story and motivation of the characters. <br /> <br /> Marginalization of Minister Nuba, Aunt, Mother - and harassing the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri of the film lacked real depth. If you did not read a book, you would not want to understand why Sayuri loved the President and why Mameha became her teacher at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie was amazing - and the actors all did the best Cs they were given, but that was all that was good in this movie.
