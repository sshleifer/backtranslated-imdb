After a car crash, the mad scientist (Jason Evers) leads the living head of his fiancee (Virgina Leith). Then he continues in the carriage, looking for the perfect body to turn his whole figure back. Pretty lame all the way, nothing here redemption. Also in the cast are: Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. Someone should help him to exclude it from his misery. Let it die.
