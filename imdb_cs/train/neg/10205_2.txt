So, when I look at this film, I'm thinking that the producers of this movie saved money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by pulling their clothes "before" from Miss Congeniality? Also, Mrs. Bullock has become a part of her embarrassment by directing "before" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted earlier, the film is very formal. Add the experience to the audience with Cassie Maywether as a slightly darker Gracie Hart with more story and it will quickly become a snooze fest. Two bad boy serial killers were done earlier (and better) in other movies. Just as before, he was "a good partner trying to protect his partner despite evidence". In fact, none of the characters in the movie ever reach two dimensions or try to be anything other than trite stereotypes. One Last Angry - Using the term serial killer is a fake ad. Killing one person - even if it's a deliberate murder - does not mean you're a serial killer. Maybe you have the potential to become a serial killer, but you are not a serial killer or even a killer.
