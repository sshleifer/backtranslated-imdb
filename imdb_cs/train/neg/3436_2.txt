The girl is showering when she did not know that the serial rapist looked at her through the skylight. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot on their way but not quite hot because they find it after they kill, rape and eat the nipple of a girl. It's an intervention to death. You could hope it was the end of the movie. Not because it's too scary, but because the level of acting is terribly horrible. Unfortunately, this is not the end, and months later the rapist resurrects as a zombie by a Satanist covenant. So he continues where he stopped, with the detectives on the trunk again, this time the flying kid is after him too (do not ask). It was very good, very cheap movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty in the spring), but this is a scraping bottom barrel. The horrible acting, the miserable ten sets up special effects, the lame to try comedy and oh yeah, and the end too. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Theresa Bestul gets a full act; Anne R. Key gets topless
