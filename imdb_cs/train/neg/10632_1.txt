There are so many mistakes in this so-called "documentary" movie that I found on television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel might be able to create a spectacular view of the DVD, but unfortunately he misses looking for the science behind his claims. It relies either on being inaccurate, not telling the whole story, nor on the old favorite "government always lies" to us, and people who believe what they have been told do not check accuracy or detail details. <br /> <br /> In addition, his "exclusive" or "unpublished" record is freely available via the internet from different sites. <br /> <br /> Reading the circumstances surrounding the production of this production shows that he used false pretexts to get interviews and used creative editing responses to support his own views. Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies," "errors," or "notifying" in Apollo was thorough <br /> <br /> How do I get into those forty minutes of my life?
