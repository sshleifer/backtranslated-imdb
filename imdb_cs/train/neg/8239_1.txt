This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. I just have no idea how someone has the courage to put it to release. Production standards are terrible. There is no excuse in cinematography. Working with the camera, scripting, acting and sound are incredibly harsh. I think there is a conspiracy, but it could have been in 10 minutes, which has saved us time to look at it. Hysterical nevrotic girls in the center of this work have no credibility. <br /> <br /> I urge someone to avoid spending time or money on this head. It's really ugly. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
