Wow ... <br /> <br /> When I read online, I picked it up with local Wal-Mart that was released early. I was after this online for some time, and just had to buy a movie. <br /> <br /> I think the thing that really hit me was editing or their lack. Again and again, characters appear (usually a talker and whoever is), walking ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor, but I know you can cut off someone who leaves point A to show that he's coming to point B. There's no need to show almost all the way! Wow ... Actually, I ended up feeling a little sorry for the actors involved. There seems to be no direction what to do in other scenes than to look worried or look happy, depending on what action should be added later. Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is behind me. Even ILM still uses thumbnails. One of the most disturbing ways to use the green screen in this movie is the constant hurry (by end credits) of the same group of people representing citizens of different cities, including London. Occasionally these people come and go regardless of the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one footage in London, it seems that at least two men are six feet tall for their birthday brother (star Anthony Pian playing without his distracting mustache). No, because GETTYSBURG I've seen such a fake piece of face hair. Wow ... Why Timothy Hines talked this film the way he does is outside of me. It is Turkey, simple and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) she gave some of the most compelling fun laughs I've seen long ago.
