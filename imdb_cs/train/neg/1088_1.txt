I have rarely witnessed such an unreasonable loss of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of the film. What little interesting sources that the movie seems to promise first are just a little more than red herring. Actor characters - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles that do not work anywhere; occasional genius director produces a film that looks as if it was shot with a camera lens stained with coffee; the writer (John Grisham), who has never done anything of merit, discovers new depths of insufficiently motivated incoherence. The film has a left, silly feeling - but hardly on the level of commentary - is its real part of aesthetics. Usually, I deal with IMDb to write balanced comments that are generally justifiable. This immense catastrophe of the film just makes me create an infinite, white blow. I will not, but just because I do not want to occupy my "mind" with this waste.
