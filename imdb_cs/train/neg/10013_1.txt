The exhausted conspiracy of a man who, in a murder, captures a woman in his stomach + an equally exhausted conspiracy of an outsider who is eventually expelled. if the film emerged over its begun origin. But the scene behind the scene does not work without changing the intensity, no arcs and inexplicable behavior. The theme of homosexuality was totally unnecessary - or, on the other hand, totally unexplored. They seemed to be included only for the audience to be successful. When will Hollywood learn that gay figures do not automatically give a more compelling picture? Sorry, unfortunately, a terrible movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose good? I expected her better and Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely one that is missing.
