Another example of why Stevehne King's books should not be filmed. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is destroyed by adapting from the book to the screen.) The story premise revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet that "accidentally" kills an old gipsy. In court, with the help of a judge and a local police chief, he would appear, even though the accident was his fault, for he did not pay attention when he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy dies a curse at 3, with the main hero, Billy (a lawyer) who gets thinned daily. Although the movie was held with a book, for the most part, and has your typical King's end, the acting was stomped and felt compelled. We went from one scene to another without having anything in between something like reading in the game. The King himself shot a movie in the movie (something like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors should only stay like this: the authors. Let your acting. Not that someone in this movie was so great. I saw the main characters in the movies, where they were much better.
