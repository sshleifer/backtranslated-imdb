This could be explored in many different ways. This movie is upset, good or just weird. The third one explains the film best. It has strange ideas and has a strange conspiracy. So who else than Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be. Actor acting was what you'd expect from Ben Stiller. I always liked Jack Black, so you know what you got, but that's not bad. Christopher Walken is always a wall. It's always nice to watch no matter how bad the movie is. The wise comedy is somewhat fun. This of course means that it has its own moments (although very few), but it can get a bit up and down, which seems to me that the film is just desperate for laughter, but of course not good. <br /> <br /> The mode was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job. This film seemed to have much greater potential and power did not reach it. Only very mediocre, and it did not seem like much effort was needed in this film. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously it means writing here failed. At best, it's below average. Because he has his moments, it was not too bad. But that's never good to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> If not for Christopher Walken and a stupid laughing end, I would give him a lower rating. His characters are always a character. Style is just a drifting strange movie with strange characters that do not go anywhere. It's not really terrible, but I really would not recommend it, because it's a very forgotten movie.
