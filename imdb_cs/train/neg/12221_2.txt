With the exception of sound none of the above is really criticism for this type of budget-free (truly) independent horror film. Additional effects and gore are very good and the main actor was effective, the lead actress though attractive needs coaching because she was particularly poor. The main problem with Frightworld is its length, in 108 minutes of its half an hour too long to be effective as a movie slasher, it's only ten minutes of the first fifty. <br /> <br /> In places where it is visually active and sometimes there is a lack of lighting in the movies favor. However, when it is combined with bad sound, as with most films, large sections are difficult to trace. This would certainly be an amusing, albeit indefinite, "serial killer back from the dead" film with some sensible and merciless editing, in its current form playing as an unfinished rough cut.
