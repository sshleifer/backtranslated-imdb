It is said that when NASA's technical consultants were asked to keep this picture credible, they laughed for several hours. After all, if you are not a politician or a staff / space shuttle crew, you will not get into the shuttle. In addition, Space (Cadet) Camp is in Alabama, not Florida. The truth is that everyone on Earth will win a lottery win worth several billion dollars before the events described in this movie become possible at all. This film was designed for children and had to be written in one because they are not aware of the countless limitations and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. This is the most unnecessary movie of all time, and it was a well-deserved flop.
