In my book "Basic Instinct" was the perfect film. She has had excellent acting on parts of stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors in the slightest role. She had a beautiful photo, music, and the most striking scenario. It adds everything to a movie that's as good as it ever gets! <br /> <br /> This is exactly the opposite, it can not get worse, the bad acting and the lame script combined with a totally awkward direction, it's really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you a bit is a relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exact copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they laugh at you and laugh a lot because it was like watching the demolition of a glowing monument. The only thing that is good in this terrible disorder is Jerry Goldsmith's BI1 excerpts. Michael Caton-Jones, and the semi-master responsible for the script, even included the "Let's Smoke in this Room" dialog on the interrogation scenario, and yes, he sends his lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see this terrible movie that should never be done! This causes damage to the original, it's so bad. The only redeemed value is the fact that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Mrs. Stone has provided the best money to surgeons who can buy) can do a good job, but of course she can not restore the perfection of the original. And, as far as the human body is concerned, it also concerns film processing. There should be a law: Never carry on with the perfect movie!
