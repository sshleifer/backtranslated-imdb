I would like to write about the story, but there was none. I would like to quote a few of the difficult battle dialogues from the film, but "hinglish" is just funny for about 5 minutes after which it is excessive. I'd like to slow down the "keep-on-guessing tension" but it was as predictable as ... um mm, Yash Paradise movie (?). I want to talk about what's going on, but I do not like cartoons. <br /> <br /> * Sighs * <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is perfect for: 1. People who are trying to commit suicide - I promise to skip you 2. Sado-masochists - this movie is much more efficient than the barbed wire that Da-Vinci's Silas kid wore. 3. People who explore alternative ways of spreading terrorism - I swear that the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in the mood to kill someone. 4. Film Pirate: More power to them. If some movies deserve the audience not spend money on watching - that's it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton and green algae - Because almost all other living entities require an IQ factor somewhat larger than what the film offers. Next Time: The director of the film is, of course, his own. (And I hope God is the only one of its kind, just enough) <br /> <br /> Things that could make a better movie: 1. Story 2. Choreographer 3. A Scenario writer 4. Stunt coordinator 5. Story I have said it?) 6. The director - best not the mentally challenged (although the one who was attacked could do better work) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic epidemic - Avoid at all costs 8. Statutory warning - Watching Yash Raj's movies harmful to your mental health? " Things I liked in the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 "The English subtitle" Mera Dil Kho Gaya "becomes -" My heart is in the void "," Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya "turns into" Im flirt, Im a lover, im vagabond ". <br /> <br /> In short, Tashan to me is as opposed to Rubber Cube - Cube has to raise IQ player, Tashan promises to reduce your IQ, in just 2.5 hours ! Woot! <br /> <br /> * Sighs * .. But that's just me I could have been wrong You were warned the same way.
