One of the laser wedding films you will see. It's going too far, so it was outdated before it got to the theaters. Ethnic stereotypes are Henna Youngman's joke, except they are not a bit funny here. Molly Ringwald, what else do we have to say. She'll give you a clue about stupidity, she's destroying a $ 10,000 wedding dress because 'it's just not me', she's doing it in this rag, with straps and putting on her top hat and everyone's enjoying her, circling her neck. She's also a girlfriend, check out how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
