Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of fantasy. But this film is not for me. Many far-reaching arguments are trying to support the claim of this film that the dragons may have existed. The film gives links in different stories from different countries, but does not decide more closely, which would give the film some credibility. The film uses (dear!) CGI to tell us the narrative story of a young dragon's life. It is combined with the popular TV-show-CSI-style flash-forward to make it look like something scientific, which is definitely not. In many cases, the arguments / traces are too exhausted. In some cases, there were clues to show kites, or fly, or burn a fire, they are simply invalid. To see it, it just makes me cramps in my fingers. Even a fantasy film needs a certain amount of reality, but it just does not. Bottom Line: This is a fine documentary-CSI document that is not worth it.
