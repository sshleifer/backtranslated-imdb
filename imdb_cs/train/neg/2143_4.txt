I grew up as I watched the original Disney Cinderella, and I always loved it so much that the tape was a little worn. That's why I was thrilled to see Cinderella 2 coming on TV and I'd seen it. <br /> <br /> I had to know better. <br /> <br /> This movie joins the movie sequel to be just left. It holds absolutely NONE of the super magic spells! It seems to me to be quite crude and almost brutal, directly from (not) Sing-a-longing for characterization. While I remember the character telling the story through the song, the soundtrack of this film was laid across the top and did not seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into man is an excellent example: where he traveled around eating an apple and adding some small wizards here and there, he should dance and sing about how great it is! And in the dance hall, there's old dance dance music. It's as if writers have forgotten where and when this story was set. The optimal violin certainly did not answer. Even the works of art and animation in Cinderella 2 are not scratchable with the original. The works of art in this film are relatively raw and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella that does not feel right. The film itself could be his own story, I think it should be just that. I do not think I hate it, but I believe she has many shortcomings. It seems to be falling considerably from the beloved original Cinderella.
