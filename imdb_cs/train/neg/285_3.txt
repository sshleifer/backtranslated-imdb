It's not really about gymnastics; to exchange occasional training sessions as well as archery or microbiology or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like any other Rocky / Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80's market, it's about conquering a helmet with a helmet, so all your social / personal realities are insignificant to your lonely - of course, loving interest. Ronald Reagan from top to bottom, in short; like a piece of cinema it's on the details. Some actors are so wonderful that they will revive things - especially the loving interest brought to you by anyone other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, who is warming up for Ted; heroin Olivia D'Abo is a hateful alkie father and a flowery stepier are more interesting than a sick mother or her totally inert bitch-nemeses / teammates, one of which seems to be made of porcelain. It's my instinct to be horrified by black comedic reliefs, but on the other hand they're at least in the movie. But D'Abo will not understand her clumsy girl, and given that there is no other narrative, there is no interest in gymnastics. it's all just the bodies that move around, and not only the result of the big tournament is over, it's all done with a clear double.
