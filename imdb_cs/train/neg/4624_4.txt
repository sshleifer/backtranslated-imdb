This beautifully rendered and sketched episode was launched for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s, but no one who would remain alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of the female android. 2) It was not an Android but a woman, a beautiful Jean Marsh. The popularity of the sex doll industry over the coming decades could trace its origins back to this episode if it did it right. In fact, it is the modernization of sexual robots in the news when I speak. <br /> <br /> When this episode happened, the robots were not new to movies or TV, so at least they could act as one. Their body would add a spooky element. Instead, it becomes a loving story of two people on a distant star. Twilight has always stretched imagination and credibility. Normally no one cared. But it seemed that this episode was jeopardized by Calvinistic morality, which avoided what it would mean to masturbate with a machine or apparent carelessness.
