Before I started watching the show, I heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a scam, the scripts are so stupid that I'm sure the authors are the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And what about SFX and colors is so extreme that it is painful to watch, colors are not saturated, they are crowded, like overwritten scripts, and the show is overvalued. This show is like a bad pie in which the baby would only give sugar and butter to think that because these ingredients are the best they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, only two parts of the show are finally empty and complete lack of credibility.
