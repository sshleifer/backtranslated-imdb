This smart, homophobic thing was dated in 1976. It looks like it is particularly horrifying, full of homosexual stereotypes and characters to laugh rather than with them. Redd Foxx makes his standard schtick, Michael Warren at least tries to bring mankind to a one-dimensional nature, and Pearl - Pearl, what do you think -? Pearl Bailey deserves much better.
