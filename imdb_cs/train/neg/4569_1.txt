I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so hard that it could be embarrassed to allow the show to take place there. This show is like a slap in the face of really hard-working officers. I've never seen anything so stupid in my life before. If they understood it as a comedy, which would be one thing, but to say it was reality, it was nothing but a lie. I only saw it once and was horrified by what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy get to the tip with the bad guy. What a joke. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The City of Muncie, the Chief of Police, and all the officers should be shameful and they should never want to admit that they come from this city. No wonder he does not stay on TV
