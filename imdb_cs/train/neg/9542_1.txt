I do not know what to say about this terrible movie that has not been said yet. Honestly, I just have to get angry. I should have known better when I saw the name of this movie that it would be a terrible piece of bullshit, but I loved war games, so I had a whim. I will live to make the decision for the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when government officials explained that their supercomputer could determine who the terrorist was by virtue of how well they were playing a video game, I knew I was on my way, even though the country - well - wrote - forgot it. The list of very, very, very bad parts of the plot, the dialogue and the negotiations is so long that I would collapse IMDb if I tried it. Those people who said they saw the worst movies than this, please tell me. I'm really curious to see something that might be upstairs on a pile of brown pile of horse manure.
