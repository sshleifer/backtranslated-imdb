Buzz for this movie has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should continue to make the script disappear, then the stupid set and finally every visible element of this movie. Because it is nothing else that could prove to be. Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as written credits for this movie. I do not think they exist. I think you purchased this script on "Scripts-R-Us", where you buy a standard empty Monster Movie script and just fill in a blank space. There is a monster that pursues us. Let's divide. (In this movie we will "split"). Hit Alien / Giant-bug / Monster / Invisible man with swing. Still dead. Burn Huge-Rabbit / Shark / Invisible-man in unbreakable fire. Still dead. You know, standard stuff. Even the minimal number of elements that were specific to the invisible human film (infrared glasses, spray with something like color) were treated poorly. <br /> <br /> What's sad that there are plenty of options to make it a fascinating movie. These are psychological questions about the subject, the worsening of the mind caused by this process, the handling of an invisible subject and many other ideas that were usually affected by less than 2 seconds and would be much more interesting. If Kevin Bacon wanted to save, it would be a much better film. Overall, it has happened. I mentioned some incredibly silly elements of the end of the film, but I do not want to do any spoilers. Just when you say these characters are so silly that I do not think they pull the plug on the machine rather than ...
