I was looking at some pretty bad movies in the past, but what the hell they were thinking about when they shot this movie. If the production crew turned into a zombie when they came up with the idea that they would do it, because you must be the brain dead to find some delight in it. I'm a fan of most genres and I'm looking forward to "shooting them into the game," but the merging of scenarios from the game just made it ridiculous and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> As most people have said, there was almost no script and the acting was weak. I will not waste time by describing it. Anyone who scores this movie above 4 must be part of a production company or Sega, otherwise they have a very distorted concept of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> I have to say that I was more annoyed with a video rental company that gave it to me, which led me to rent. Thank God I had a second film to watch the restoration of some of my faith in movies. Comic book chalan would be right if he said "The worst movie ever"!
