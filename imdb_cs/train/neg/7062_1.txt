Okay, maybe not, frankly the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It did not make any sense, there was no conspiracy, no characterization, no acting, nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought when I first saw that May 28, 2003 ** cautiously, it's a spoiler warning. it's also a lot to complain about how bad the movie is: ok so the movie starts and the characters are introduced but there is no explanation of the character. if I knew the main character was new to this school, but obviously not. he also seemed to have lived himself ... then being a raising child ... and then that his mother was the furious alcoholic who was still alive with him. all his friends obviously had no parents and lived alone. Now we get to the mainland, the crazy guy avoids crazy asylums and runs uncontrollably. Now our main character is obsessed with this man and concentrates on him as to the unpredictability of the film. I think I had to forget the main element of the plot, there was no reason for the main character to get into the socket. although there is no reason why all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes ago suddenly follow and do what they want. The film goes on and gets well. they make a mess at school, blah blah. but wait for a while ... all of a sudden everyone knows that the main character is just leading a show. wait for a moment, did the mad guy do the main character specifically not to do it? it should be any kind. <br /> <br /> Another important element of the fence was skipped over ... The mad guy was supposed to be nonsensical ... They all said he was not crazy. but as the story goes on, it is very clear from his mind. but I thought the news people said it was not ... um ... now the movie is coming. WHAT WAS CLOSED? WHAT TO SAKRA WAS? not only that the end did not answer any questions about the main character, but did not answer any questions about the mad guy. are these people in the same situation? if so, then there are some very basic stories that do not tend to do so. if not, then what does it make sense to say, "are you in two weeks."? <br /> <br /> * The end of the thing ... * <br /> <br /> That's what I thought. that's pretty much what I'm thinking right now. it's 6 months after the line, and if I can get it for free, I could give her another chance, but I doubt it. I doubt very much.
