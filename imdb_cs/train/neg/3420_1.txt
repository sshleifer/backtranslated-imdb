I first saw this movie on Saturday night at about twelve o'clock. It's really the right time for this. I've never seen a movie that was actually much more predictable and stereotyped. To see an exciting action movie, do not look, because you might lose the will to live halfway. However, if you want to laugh good, be careful! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my nice Saturday night. What I thought was that every scene that was expensive was copied from the Discovery documentary or an old television special about the US Army. Plus, I am amazed by not making the least effort to make production look really. Afghanistan is, as I recall, near the sea and yet with just one click, Deke escapes from a terrorist sand castle with his jet pack and takes off a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the movie Deke throws an Islamic terrorist against the wall. On a slow scene, you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean flap with the stuntman in the air when they break against the wall. You have to love it. I recommend that you and your friends watch some friends and a good amount of beer until you understand why I'm pretty upset to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
