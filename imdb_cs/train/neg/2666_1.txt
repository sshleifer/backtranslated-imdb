honestly, if someone has a brain, it's nothing positive to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 for rent. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith, who says, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must be bored or have no glory at the time. Even Matthew Mc Conahay *, as you wrote it, was better than all the actors in this movie when playing a psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie and you have something good to say, IQ must be extremely low, with such a bad taste in movies it hurts. Thank you ... and the truth was pronounced! <br /> <br /> Save money from poverty. <br /> <br /> Get Devil's Rejects, now it's classic.
