Watching Josh Kornbluth 'act' in this movie reminds me of my young TV production class, where 'not fun' has a chance to prove how unhappy it really was! <br /> <br /> OBVIOUS is the word that comes to realize when I try to overcome this wannabe comedy. Jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. The delivery is painfully poor. OUCH !!!!!!! Writing is simply dorkish. It's similar to Bob Saget. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching one and a half hour Saturday Night Live skit (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and wanted to roll back the money!
