What made this film so attractive was the hope that she would live according to Charlotte Bronte's brilliance of the original classical story. I was deeply disappointed to discover that this film, which seemed to be either written or shot in great hurry, had no qualities that made the original novel so strong. Most funny miracles among the main characters, Jane Eyr and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be missing from the script or went to the floor of the room. She also lacked the charismatic feel of Jane Jane Eyre, which allowed her to suffer by overflowing and triumphing over her. Original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie did not seem to have many triumphs, including one of the biggest parts of the story when Jane escapes from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her pursuit of food and shelter, her shame that I have to ask for bread, the threat of cold freezing, everything to get away from the man she loved was, in my opinion, the filthy parts of the story that had just left the film. The title of the title looked dry and uninterested. The story was unpleasant, and for those who did not read the book, I can not imagine that this story was the least interesting. Scenario and directing had no effect on the classic story.
