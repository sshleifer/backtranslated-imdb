This was one of the worst films EVER !!!!!!!! It was so bad I laughed all over the movie! The figure was so blessed; especially the end. This film will change from the end of the world to the eel deposition! I mean, I want! And I swear ... I think they use CHESS for the eel! And there was this terrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who divorced. How predictable! It was terrible that my mom, my sister, and I did not finish it, and when we did, it was a year later! We watched it for the second time and we finished it this time. Throughout the movie we commented on as MST3K. <br /> <br /> Summary: Watch this only when you're a movie basher! Prepare for merry comments, watch it at dawn for a smile, and I think you are laughing ridiculously. Look also at the mockery. Metafora explaining this movie: This film is a very shallow field full of cheeses and puppet puppets!
