I had to register with IMDb just to comment on how horrible this movie is ... my cats and sphere balls have a better story than this. It's not the worst acting I've ever seen, but when you delete almost the entire film from the movie within 5 minutes, it will be a bit desirable. The film was not the only moment of "fear", except when they watched the movie "Halloween" on television. Everything around it looked like it could be a good story, rewind credits, and say that Chasey Lain was in it, it was a bit of a loss because I did not know her right now and her scene was over before I could say yes yeah is. "I'm so glad I saw it at the hotel and did not pay because they would really check me if I paid a penny to see it, I usually like it, or at least I can look for a redeemed factor in the movie, but this is an exception. It's so bad that it's not so much fun so good - it's bad ... it's just bad.
