It was probably the worst movie, seriously. I could actually deal better with myself, it was not even the right setting. It's like the movie, which had a budget of $ 5 and remained a change. Do not look at it. I did not even get into this movie and I had to turn it off. I'm giving it 1/10, because it was funny how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but it actually turned into a really bad comedy. In fact, a bunch of girls got into the car, broke the light, and the owner of the car went behind them. The piece I saw was a woman with a gun that told the girl's load to take off all the clothes, what the hell? it must be some sort of cheese porn porn too.
