He saw it last night at the Montreal Festival in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is greatly overrated by IMDb fans. Negotiations were only regular. The direction did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks a lot: the film is about those universities and about the game they play, it makes funny calls (7eveny 5ive). Plus, you can predict the end of the movie within the first five minutes. If you like a prank call and slasher with an ax that lets you jump only once or twice throughout the movie, you may like it. If you do not, this movie is not worth it.
