Absolutely awful movie. Ameteurish is not funny. The lead figure played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very uncomfortable. Editing by E.T and star wars is just plain stupid. Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good idea for this film. He should control English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with its features. Other than Goksal, this film is garbage. Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this film is his worst written work on this date. Music Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also has some presence. An actor who plays on three sons has no talent what he is.
