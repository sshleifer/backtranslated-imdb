We would want an idea as good as an "invisible person" to work better and better manage the age of fantastic special effects, but it is not. The story, the characters, and finally the last 20 minutes of the movie is as fresh as the gray scientist's swing since the early 1950s. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and the very idea of ​​an invisible person who is haunting the streets. But unfortunately, we will soon return to the confined space of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but also schematic. movies or TV shows over the last 10 years, and some of them have their magic. But for each film, it is clearer and clearer that the idea of ​​putting a classic under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is very bad. It is clear that money is a key issue here: the time and energy input into the script is not close enough and as a result Hollow Man is seriously undermined by clichés, sappy characters, predictability and lack of depth. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me beside the special effects was the talent. While filming this movie, modern producers are very fond of seeing children. That is why language (and sometimes violence and sex) is very stiff. When the whole world blows out, good guys go "Oh darn!" and "God of mine." "Hollow Man" graciously rejects this kind of hypocrisy, and characters are free to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural answer to something that has happened is to swear - but it is more credible when someone actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
