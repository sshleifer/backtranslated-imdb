During the first 3 seasons, relatively odd parents were as tasty as hard candies, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you will need after watching the latest episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence that do not cause laughter. Cosmo, once one of the saddest Nick's characters, moved into an abusive, unfortunate man who would not want to know about Family Guy casting. Timmy became a selfish, arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson happily defeated from the gaps (and due to Timmy's tangle, it would take a lot). And poor Wanda ... a real witch who has become the victim of her husband and child of God is now referred to as a "narco" that cares for the welfare of others. Plus, the stupidity of Cosmo causes pain to everyone else, but it never justifies or teaches it. Which basically summarizes Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are gross, vulgar and too bright. Thank God that this fucking toon was canceled, along with Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom. At least Butch had what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
