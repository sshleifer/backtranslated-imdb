This film must be in line for the most disgusting film in years. Even Woody Harrison can not save this film from sinking to the bottom. The murder in this movie is to be the subject of interest in this film, but it is not, nothing interesting. The cast is not bad, but the script is just horrible, I just stood amazing during this film and I wondered how anyone can find this movie fun. The producers of this film were very smart. They made a boring movie, but hid them well with the names of good actors and actresses for their cast. People will go to the market and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe, it must be good to rent this movie. (The boy is in terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you like to tear yourself, go and rent this movie, some people really enjoyed this movie but I enjoyed watching a movie with meaning
