I'm watching it on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so terrible I can not stop watching! I am a videographer and this film is sad. I feel bad about anyone connected to this movie. Some camera work is good. Most are very controversial. There are several good actors in the film. It is a pity that they are surrounded by what had to be relatives of the director. That's the only way they could be qualified in the movie! The music was a bit better than playing. If you can track it, I hope it is because there is absolutely no other option! The sequel (yes sequel) is coming ... I think I'm leaving it! Jason
