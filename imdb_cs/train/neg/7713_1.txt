I knew this movie was so bad that it was funny, so I was expecting it. I just found out that it was so bad that it was murderous. Whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds until you realize it's not reasonable at all, except for deliberately irritating quality. When you see things splatter with tomatoes, it will become old in about 30 seconds. There's nothing clever or entertaining on the movie, except for the assumption. It could take a 3-4 minute comic sketch, but this is simply not a full-length feature of imagination.
