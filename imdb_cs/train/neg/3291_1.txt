First, tell me I'm not a fan of the Dukes, but after this movie the series looked like law and order. The worst thing was casting Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey like Roscoe, if they ever watched the show, Roscoe was not a hard cop. It was more like Barney Fife than the role he played in this film. The film is loaded with common mistakes, cars are torn apart and continue as if nothing has happened. The worst example is when the general gets along with Billy Prickett and the general runs up the hill, which seems to slow down to almost a stop but continues to win the race.
