This whirling movie looks more like a combination of music clips on MTV than a real movie. There is no real story, and in the movie you ask yourself, "What happens?"; but nothing happens. The story about Eric Cloeck, a frustrated writer, is the only good thing. It seems that other people have nothing in common: why they are together in the movie. With music you can watch the worst movie. When I open the tap and the water comes out of the Bach music, most people will want to look at it, but this is not a movie. The director should learn to write a movie script of 100 minutes or more before the film begins to direct.
