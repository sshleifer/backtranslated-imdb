When I heard such praise about this game, I decided to watch her when I buried her cable. I do not see how this woman "touches" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the subject. I think if you're interested in stories about women's private works and how it affects their lives, then it's for you. Otherwise, it is rather dull and boring. If anything seems, I find it somewhat humiliating. I was interviewing a friend who was also following her, and she thought it was terrible too. So it's not just that guy "does not get it."
