"So there is a bride you see, and she is crushed to death by this sculpture that falls on her on her wedding day, and then, a year later, her ex-fiance falls in love with a beautiful psychic?" And then, that beautiful soul-haunted a terrible ghost of a scary bride who wants to prevent her from stealing her boyfriend, he'll be gay! "I'm sorry that Jeff Lowell, the man who dreams of" My Dead Body, "introduced his concept to studio training at New Line Cinema. The big secret is how the same big corporate bigwigs could turn right and green the project, which would allow Lowell to manage the film and write a script. Because if you think that no movie may ever be as bad as this original assumption is, then obviously you have another thought. The only way this could work is if the writer just went crazy and turned it into an insignificant satirical farce. Instead of making sure that he has supplied the fuzzy, harmless and warm heart of a romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring radii at every step of the way and dampens the absurdity in favor of unlimited connotations. In fact, "over her dead body" is so awkward and unhappy that it's hard to know exactly where Lowell thought he was with him. Virtually every set-up, joke and gag view in the movie is flat and badly executed, even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their difficulty. How else to explain the carefree ideas of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their different roles? <br /> <br /> I decided not to blame the actors, some of them had their talent in better cars in the past (this is especially the case of the Rudd). But Lowell and the study staff are sure to have some "splainin".
