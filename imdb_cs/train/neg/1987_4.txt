It was a great idea and the landscape was beautiful, but that's the end of the place. It looked as though it was a dim Set It Off meets The West. It seemed to make sense. There were so many characters and there was not enough time to develop your personality. It was too unnecessary things that were done that did not relate to the plot, nor did it help to the next story. There were also long empty moments when the site was explored, but it was used to silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should make more sense, just like directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But casting was great in my opinion. If you look only at eye candy, then it's the film for you.
