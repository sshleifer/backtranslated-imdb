In this picture, it is terrible that a script that is obvious and redundant begins. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who escaped into a small desert town after being twice raped in a large city. She is instantly stalked by a local man who looks quite unhinged (Craig Sheffer), and who seems to be attempting a third degree of Mickey Rourke imitation. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman who allegedly protects and serves. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience about who is really a good person? Logic flies through the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are even more unanswered questions than they should be. If you think the "Blue Desert" can be saved by the magnificent Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - MERK
