"The Darkness" was somewhat entertaining, but it never seemed to have a conspiracy, it lacks much more than other films accused of this harm; ie "Bad taste". It started really well when you ran out of something. It was very horrible for these first minutes, but after some time the film became fun on the gore level, which was hard to solve at some points due to poor lighting and terrible recording quality. The film was hard to believe because of the youthful acting that most of the time felt like some of the buddies who spoke with the video camera and so they ran. The fact that without any conspiracy arose, it seemed that the film started without and without any kind of script. As has been said, gore was the only drawing point of this film, hardly recognizable most of the time.
