There is only one use for movies such as Bulletproof: Reminds you how bad it can be bad. We often see movies that we call "pretty horrible" or "not too good," but then you will see this movie and you can see that although all these other movies are not "good", they are not sad at all bad as bulletproof. It was a birthday present from someone who spent less than two seconds browsing through a DVD store in our supermarket to fulfill the obligation (ie give me a gift). It could have been an unfortunate finding, but it was not: it is so clich√©, so misspelled, so misguided, so mistakenly acting that I am surprised that all the participants were not arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I guessed it for about 30 seconds, but it went on because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad they can be nice. This is not one of them. It's just bad. I stopped after 45 minutes and tomorrow I throw him in the basket.
