This is one of the worst films Clark Gable. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It is so painful cliché and the dialogue is so miserable that it's something that Gable and Jean Harlow should not be proud of. Gable is a heel whose illegal activities lead to his girl being Slammer (like a gangster speech?). He hopes to do the right thing, but he just leaves it - we do not know one of them, God, it's a "family way". They will eventually come back to do the right thing, and in some way they all connect to the happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten that Gable needed to take a rap and spend some years in hoosegowe. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are best here". By what standard? Best in the production of unintended laughs? Gimme break! <br /> <br /> PS - after what she says, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin finds me and kicks my ass. Hmmm. However, despite my comment, I think Mr. Maltin is the best reviewer and man on the planet (I hope he calmed it). UPDATE - 2/2/08. Because I did not like this movie for the first time (especially the funny end), I decided to watch it again. After all, sometimes when I watch the movie again, I like it much more and I realize I was too harsh. While this has been the case for several films in recent months, I still did not like this movie - even the second time. Most of them were not for the first half of the movie. In the first half, Harlow's figure was amazingly stupid, but at least it was plausible. But when she was sent to jail, it was all cliché until the last sensual marriage scene came to pass. The most important thing is that this sequence is embarrassingly silly - it simply does not make sense at all and is similar to shooting the film in some embarrassing fairy tale instead of love for two disadvantages. I stand next to my original review (despite all of the "NOT HELPFULS") and I think that except PARNELL and maybe POLLY AT THE CIRCUS, it could be just the worst shield movie.
