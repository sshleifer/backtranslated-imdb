"Worse people" should be the headlines of this terrible movie. To see ordinary people doing ordinary things, then look out the window in real life. But if you want to see the unpleasant people doing boring things, you'll have to watch this terrible movie Mike Leigh. The characters have been talking for a long time, but they have never been able to communicate with each other. Why not? Probably because Leigh's things that we all are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors want to film real life. But we are not, and failed.
