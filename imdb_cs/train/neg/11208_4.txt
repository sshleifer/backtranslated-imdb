Raymond Burr plays as a lawyer captured by the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) for his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was all the year before he started making Perry Mason, so the film could be especially interesting for his fans if it was the inspiration for his cast. interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one-dimensional and the motives of her crime in the secret are quite obvious. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also fond of "femme fatale", but the Burr character is quite straightforward. It's totally bizarre when I see an actor like Burr who makes these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his stop is not in line with his character, as in most of the films I've seen. the whole thing is to be around the title of the film and the way Burr's character sets Lansbury's character to engage in himself (double threats prevent him from being tempted again by the original murder). It does so with a very large tape recorder that does not notice when it comes to the room I think. A few maybe unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the things could be done for the TV.
