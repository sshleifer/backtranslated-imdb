I'm sorry every second of the time I lost when watching this movie, really. Unfortunately, I always find it hard to turn off the movie as soon as I started watching it. Especially when it's so classic or what people use to call classics. I think it's one of those films that every movie lover should watch at least once, so I watched it. Do not get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall as a couple as well as actors, but this movie was, in my view, a big scam. No really good plot, no spy movie or romantic love story. It is neither a convincing mixture of both genres. The only thing that caused the tension was that it was not certain whether Bogey and Bacall would stay with each other or only partially. I think "having and not" is very overrated and Bogart was in many better movies during the 1940s.
