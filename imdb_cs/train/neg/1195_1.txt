This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not say how bad it is. I sincerely wanted to kill this harsh experience several times just to have an end to pain. I recommend instead of seeing this movie, you buy yourself in acid, then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD case, and when he added that Jesus was following, I was so excited ... then I finally wanted to kill. I mean twenty-three minutes of the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN! The monkeys could do a better job of editing this waste. At the very least, the waste would be thrown out and smudged some of the rubbish. It would be better if I did not see any of the horrors. It was not that I did not get jokes, it's not just funny, they were like twenty times. Something is not funny if you do not see it like a million times. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances do you see it. People named the worst movie "Manos Hands of Fate". I also saw it and I agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is just the second worst. "Fatty Drives the Bus" is much worse. It deserves all the rough language, but I can not write it, so just imagine that I swore the whole bunch.
