*** It may contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> HOW TO TAKE TOKYO TIME was some courageous experiment when real life wanted to be actors got film parts on the condition that they would have to take a combination of strong anti-anxiety prescription, anti-depression and antipsychotic medication (this is the classic psychological ward that brings patients to inflamed zombies) during filming, then this film would be much more interested. Or, if film production was another type of experiment, when all actors were deprived of sleep before and during filming, it would be easier to explain TOKYO TIME. The film is filled with live, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new man sat on the stairs with his sisters, he seemed to have trouble with open eyes. Almost every scene talks about its lines, which sit with each part of his body motionless. From the beginning to the end, the expression of his face is best described as "close to sleep". They are not interested in actors who speak over other lines, as these actors can hardly complete the cancellation of any dialogue lines. Everyone speaks in a depressing, monotonous voice. No laughter. No screaming. No power. No one has enough energy to smile. The result: complete and complete boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> Avoid this without life at no cost. It is better to watch GREENCARD, which has a similar plot and has spell and energy. Or for an unconventional Japanese romantic story, look for LONG STAYS that have enough of everything that APARTMENT TO TOKYO TIME is not.
