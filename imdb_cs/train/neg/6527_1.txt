Surely there was no show on Saturday morning to the kids kids so badly. After all, these producers had to count on the return of the audience. Well, in this horrible offer they could at least count the money they saved on the sets. The script could be rejected from a long-forgotten space opera series, with a few stinking lines added to the cold guy Gerald Mohr who muttered to Nauru Hayden. No director has been able to do anything decent with such a stormy story of action, so the action is boring. Spacecraft supports are absurd - for example Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter - but planetary kits must become the worst in the history of the movie. Most of them are rough drawings, all bathed in often poorly colored red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a support. And it's bad - like a chest thin as a plot. Any viewer who can do this by the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians - and he will probably agree!
