I was willing to go with the original intention of _Cruel. It was along with the story, and it was true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. This movie was, in my opinion, a crazy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character. I did not believe what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I was not clear until I read IMDB that this movie was to be the predecessor, especially because the title contained the number "2", I was expecting a sequel, but then I found it to be an accompanying piece. Overall, I have to say that this film was at least read as a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not overwhelmed.
