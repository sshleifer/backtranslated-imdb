Look at version 1936. As personally annoying I find Charles Boye's voice, it's more a struggle to pay for the cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf - I think Omar Sharif is trying but not - too cute and alive. Catherine Denueve (sp), besides being too old, does not look like Marie - nothing! She seems too sophisticated to even think that she is dying for love for that man in such a way. The only actor in the movie that casts the role she plays is Ava Gardner who appeared as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is shortly short (and the views of the Empress are more than just an unnecessary form) as historically the Empress Elisabeth in Rudolf's Life Power did not concern.
