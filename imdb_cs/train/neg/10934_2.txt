First, tell me I'm LDS, or rather, I'm a mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically gave him an opportunity to doubt. I usually find something redemption in all the movies I watch. And this was no exception. She has her redeemed moments. But they are very little and far. One of the first things I noticed was that I was very worried was that Halestorm seemed to be ashamed of our church! In the LDS church, the gathering is called "separation," and the basketball court is in a "cultural hall". NEVER ONCE is one of these two names. The church is never marked by name and "standards" are as far as it goes when it mentions what our church believes. I wonder if the directors really are LDS or LDS wannabes? This movie had so much potential! It could actually show our church in the positive light and have helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe. Instead, it was just fun and left much to be desired. If I had not been LDS yet, I would have thought that the Mormons are stupid, idiot and are ashamed of their conviction. It's not a movie I recommend to my nonLDS friends. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Halestorm. You can do it better!
