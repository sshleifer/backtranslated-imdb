"Nat" (expressed by Trevor Gagnon) along with his accent "IQ" (by Philip Bolden) and always hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in the universe. And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft landing on the Moon, Apollo 11, waiting for its historic trip to the trigger platform near where the three are. The first thing you'll notice is movie animation. I found out that it was done. The landscape was deep, because things in the distance really looked as if they were behind the scenes. I did not see a 3-D movie because it was broadcast on HBO. But I saw that there really were no scenes that would use the 3-D effects, except for the fighting between the characters near the end. I was also not really overwhelmed by the character's design. For me it did not look like something like a fly, especially in coloring. The flies were unusual blue-gray, which scattered me a little. The casting performance was not bad, but it was not good either. I have often focused more on my computer than on the story. Writing has certainly been written for younger audiences, with comedic moments that will make the younger children laugh. For adults, I did not see anything like jokes that they would get punchlines for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> History was not tracked in this movie. In fact, I think it was totally ignored, as the main goal was a fly. I also hated when a famous astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film were a fictitious work and that there were no flies on Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for the exploration of the universe. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, it is not for you. It was not about the whole family. This is definitely just for children. But save it for a rainy day.
