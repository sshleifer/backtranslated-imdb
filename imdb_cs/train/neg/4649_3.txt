A 1957 (yes, that's the right day) J. Arthur Rate production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a smash-comedy, right? Oh, it's terrible. It's a gag movie: observing people is shocked at the sight of the little alligator. Music is worthy, most inappropriate and forgetful. Jeannie Carson is a vibrant dancer and competent singer. But what about the movie? Diana Dors is here as well and provides great shots for use in previews. Her acting level is not bad, but she's in the movie to give someone she's wondering. Well, during this film she has to do something besides moaning. The film is now sold to VHS by eBay people. Save costs and waste time. Comedy without laughter. Music without a memorable song or dance.
