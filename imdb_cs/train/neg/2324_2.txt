I agree with other users' comments that the two major roles were acting well that it was he who played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. Pity the story was so boring. I have not heard of a story I did not know about Gary Gillmore before, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be like a dead man in a walk or a chamber, but how bad I am. The whole movie simply spoke, spoke and talked about his mom and dad. The only great scenes were flashes where the father lost his mood. That was the only interest I got from this borrefest.
