This film is made by Canadians and Brits, who are Asinin, sad idiots. Men are stoned / drunk, and then screaming / choosing each other in almost every scene. Are women unnecessary? I do not understand why they are there? spends every scene that causes disgust or worse, milling like fascinating cattle. It seems that Canadian women are either arguing vulgar torture, or boring hippie chickens. She's a standard discarded girlfriend, her loser boyfriend, and her malevolent laughter mother we've seen in countless movies before. Every figure is here Carpathian, a child's stereotype. Not to mention that everyone seemed to need a shower! And the idea of ​​any scene that would have sex with George Wendt? shake? just make someone gag! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I can not understand why he would take that role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is an excellent actor - the only one with vague redemption, but his talent is useless here. As for the rest of the land? Three enemies trying to get their drugs back? yawns - or Karl? who is really dead, but who is really a character very alive in the minds of those left (just like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, even if I'm ashamed of even thinking he was comparing these two films), why even bothering? Karl is so poisoned that you find the circumstances of his death pleasing. By the end of this poor film I thought it would be better to go down with him on that ship!
