I made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film. I even got the rent to return my money because I claimed to have falsified ads. It is not enough that the film itself is p.o., but the art packaging is what sold me. I've made better make-up effects for my kids in Halloween than what the film actually describes versus the artwork. Can you call "the eyes of the raccoons?" <br /> <br /> I will not waste more time by going into full detail, but come on, the main hero of the film is LA policeman who was born and raised in Alabama - but he has a German accent! It's after the offense.
