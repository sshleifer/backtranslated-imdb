For me, this movie seemed to fall on his face. The main problem for me was casting Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if this is growing out of the formation of a type or just his behavior, but I doubt Glover can tell a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and that's always clear in his performance. In addition, the film is your task of serial killer story. Not very innovative.
