I admit that I am not a horror expert who is my partner, but a good combination, smart moves are worth it. My bits, briefly: <br /> <br /> - The dialogue is often weak and occasionally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> - Unconvincing acting. <br /> <br /> - The story never burned. Writers picked up half a dozen mainstream movies, threw them into a kettle, they did not get enough food and tried to feed us poor, exhausted the mess, al'dente. /> <br /> Long and short, without being totally horrible, it was definitely not good to absorb one of my NetFlix.
