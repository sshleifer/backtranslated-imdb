This film is soaked. Funny drying out, the screen was squeezed and the movie stretched. There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do some work to find out what was going on. I do not say it needs to be explained, but you suddenly find things that happen and are said to have the slightest idea of ​​what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Negative heroine comments about the hero. The audience will never show how much he knows about the guy and how he is bound to his fiancé's death. The audience also has a minimal exposure to the death of a human being as well. <br /> <br /> It's also a scene with a group of people who load and rock machine guns, and that's all you see before cutting to other scenes. There was no explanation of weapons and people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave her 3 because we did not feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun when you were watching the movie, and so we had some fun. ;-)
