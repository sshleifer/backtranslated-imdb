Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic apology for wasting the film, which should be recycled as toilet paper, has recently destroyed my confidence in film art. Above all, it was. Second, people went to see. Third, some people voted for the best movie they've ever seen. If a monkey could shoot a movie, I'm 100 percent sure it will be 1 billion times better. Most dirty movies have their moments (even Godzilla had some great special effects) when this movie was the moment I left the theater. The only thing that could have caused this movie to be worse would be if Jerry Springer was a star. If I want to see the crap for an hour and a half, I'll take the dump into a can. If someone absolutely despised this film, I am attacking you, your children and the children of your children's children. however, unlike Springer's belief, I will clearly not approve children who have sex.
