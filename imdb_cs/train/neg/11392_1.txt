For years, I remember reading about this "Trouble With Tracy" show in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 o'clock in the morning! I stayed about two hours driving north of Toronto and we could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not have. Well, I knew what I wanted, and what I wanted was to see what this is "Trouble With Tracy". Was she a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was she nudge? Was there tension? Was it a comedy? It would be all right if there was any promotion of the show. At least I could know what I miss. But not! The secret made me until the CTV established a radio station in Wiarton in Ontario and started broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6am! One Saturday morning I rose and turned the TV on 5:59 and finally I found out what was "The Trouble With Tracy". Yes, "Trouble With Tracy" was that it was a Canadian content and was stuck in a harmless place so no one would see how terrible it was. Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston has died for several years but many claim to have effectively "died" when he first appeared on this show. When I first saw it on a cold Saturday morning and fell into my bed, part of me died.
