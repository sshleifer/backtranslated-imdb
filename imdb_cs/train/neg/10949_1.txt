I'm going to the cinema to have fun. There is nothing fun about this movie. From the start to the end there was no departure from the gray, grounded reality of this woman's life. This is one step without changing mood. I stayed to the end just because I was convinced that it had to be improved. They do not want to, and I do not think I'm the only one, as it shows a lot of groans around the cinema, when the film eventually graciously pulled. Honestly depicting social depravity is no crime, but bored your audience to moan is not a way to get public sympathy. A horrible film.
