How unfortunate I have so many of my "and" lists, and a good "b" list of actors agree that they are doing this movie, but they did it, and that's what put me in the observation. I have never heard of this movie, but Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the cover of DVD and James Woods in the background how bad can it be? Word Very! This movie begins o.k. has some twists and turns, then just puts eggs. The end was as weak as if the writer got away, and his 4-year-old son sat down with the writer and let go of the end. How ironic about the movie "Final Game" is so bad. These are types of movies that can move the "and" list of actors to the "b" list in a hurry. I hope that Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods will get used to it.
