I just could not finish this movie. I have adjusted what I say is my nomination for the most crazy attempt to award a prize for sexual suggestion: a scene in which Pius Zador, at a picnic, stands between the two boys who want it. One (good boy) begs to see the error of her paths. The other (bad boy) simply asks if she wants to have a hot dog she will then reserve for her. At crotch level. I hope I do not hurt anything that she says will turn and take a hot dog with a smile. Only poor.
