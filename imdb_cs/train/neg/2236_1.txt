I do not know where to start. I was really horrifying in this film, I can not remember seeing so many "actors" in a movie that was not able to act. Not only was the acting bad, the characters were incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there's the action. I believe the kids know that when someone shoots, there's blood. But when someone gets to Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. Well, I think it's me. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short (because you believe me, I can continue the hours on this movie), it is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should be number one at the bottom of 100.
