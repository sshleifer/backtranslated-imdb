This movie was not totally overwhelmed. Originally called Sin Eater, he was supposed to stay that way, that's all he was talking about in the last half of the movie. I'm not sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had anything to do with the rest. It was very slow and what was with the selection of Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. That was a sad point. Overall, I would say that you will check if you look at things that deal with Catholic religion, but do not expect Exorcist or Stigmata from this movie. It will surely be after a few days on the flop and the word will come out.
