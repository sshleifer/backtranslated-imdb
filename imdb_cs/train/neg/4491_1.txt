1/10 and that's just because I'm not lower with my ratings. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie and wait for the latest Trilogy movie, do not buy it or take it for granted. Trust me that you will not miss a thing. architect does not bring any new information: _ (spoiler) _ was more NEO in front of you, it's like no. 6 or something. you could think of something like this from the first movie: Agent Smith, who told us that the first created matrix did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo "Love" brought her back where I saw it before? Oh, right in the first film role where he turned! as well as action-scenes nothing new just with more opponents. action scene (20+ ships) in the BIG battle we did not see (perhaps in revolutions?) that somebody knocked (hmmmm, maybe the guy who held the knife that Neo wanted!) that pushed the EGM button to an early. <br /> <br /> All in all the shameless label to make money (especially from those who went to see more than once), which probably worked as a spell.
