The second American guy Guy Madison plays the character he's notoriously preceded in this Spaghetti Western? which has very modest credentials that appear to be routine (although they represent a nice enough score). The drawing is of modest interest: the name, by the way, relates to the injured man who participated in the assassin's assault on the ranch? family ownership of their pursuer, Madison Equestrian Agent. Her younger siblings are convinced that the injured person who is now in their defense leads them to the responsible boss of the gang; in the end, the identity of every secret of a man proves a surprise? and both, ironically, joining one of Madison's sisters (another being raped during a raid). Starcentka Euro-Cult Rosalba Neri is apparently considered a lounge and Madison's ex-flame.
