That's when I leased it back in the 1980s and honestly I do not remember anything special about the movie - just that it's the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was funny". This is not one of those films, "it was so horrible that it left you feeling bad." It was not one of them, "what the hell was that?" movies. I can not remember the performance of actors, but it was badly shot, the story was incoherent and had no definable style. When it was over, I was upset that I was useless. I've seen lots of movies I did not understand because of unknown cultures, styles and / or stories, but it was clear that these films had some of these features. Incubus does not. <br /> <br /> I thought you were not going to comment on this "piece" for fear that someone could look out of curiosity, but I'm forced to warn anyone who appreciates the film to skip this movie.
