I just saw this movie and I must say it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eve (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She read her lines very imprudently and had a very faint expression in the whole movie. Rosanna Munter, who played Peter on the other side, is natural. He plays his role with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it a lot, many times before. It breaks, finds another, starts to jealous, breaks with the other girl, and finally ends up together. There was no surprise at all, one knowing that Eve would fall apart and Adam would "come together" with Peter. The only thing no one saw was that Peter had told Adam to go to the Eve party. She became serious, which is the Petra party that the audience had not seen before in the movie and told him to win Eve's heart back, which was really cute. In addition to Rosanna Munter, not only is he an actor who gives unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> This is an average movie with average actors so I do not recommend it!
