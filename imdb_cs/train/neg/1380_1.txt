It was the worst movie I've ever seen on WorldFest, and then it was the least applause! I can only think that they will receive such recognition on the basis of a number of well-known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's just in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally uncomfortable and he is watching. There is no real emotional depth of the story. The film that turns around an actor who can not get to work does not feel too original. And the development of a cop. It seems to me to be one of the many videos I've seen in the 1990s. And even in those standards it was not good. <br /> <br />
