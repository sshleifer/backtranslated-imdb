What I hate in this show is how bad guides are written. These women have no self-esteem or dignity. The whole thing is that they're going to kick the boys. The talent of Amanda Bynes is totally useless. She was great at "All That" and on her own show. Why they would write her and Jenny Garth as defective, airhead, desperate, men chasing, "old-decent" wannabes is behind me. Their drawings and dialogue remind me of "The Simpons," Homer says whenever his cartoon Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone should ask where Poochie is?" All talking about lamenting about a guy and then wailing on a guy. Sometimes it changes, and the boy laughs instead. Then they come back together or fall apart. 2 women are either shallow, silly or sex-dependent. The only word I can think of is "angry."
