What is most surprising in this semi-musical scene in Berlin in 1920 is the beautiful cinematography and editing. It is the top line from the first national in these departments. The story is slightly compelling and similar to the history of Miller's two other films (SUNNY, SALLY), where the girl works with a wealthy boy with family disapproval, complications and a final conclusion. All four musical numbers are stacked at the beginning of the movie and go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy. Miller Sings Part I Think of Baby And Repeats WHY FOR YOU. They are also NOT BLUE and you are not the first. Miller here is very attractive and beautiful, reminding Irene Dunne of the way and delivery. Sad that she does not dance because it's her strength. SALLY remains his best film, with this other and rather poor SUNNY, who has a huge inferior successor. Her life was tragically shortened by sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedy a prevention. It is worth seeing these films, though seeing Ziegfeld's top star of the 1920s.
