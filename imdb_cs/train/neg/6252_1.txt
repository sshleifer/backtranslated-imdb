Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers in the North Korean prison camp. They are tortured ... We learned the North Koreans Communists are bad people ... We learn that US hair grows very slowly during the days of torture ... I tried to suppress it, but in the end I burst out of laughter in this film. It was a scene when Mr. Reagan came out to tell the Communists he wanted to be on their side. Then he will ask for a bottle of brandy. In addition, he is soberly sober, takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course the North Korean Communist Guard is as stupid as it comes. So the drunk turns away the guard as Reagan goes over to get something out of the socket next to a lot of empty boxes. I'm sure the box should contain something; but Reagan, of course, causes them to constantly shake to find that they are empty. You have to laugh! I think the "Prisoner of War" will refer mainly to the family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise it is a waste. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
