What was that supposed to be? Remake of Fisher Kinga? Why do we care about the character of Sandler? What a slow, sad, boring movie that gives-and-damn-of-these-people movie! Just painful to sit down, I turned it off before it was over. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help just like Sandler; as I said, can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in your everyday life? We do not think we think deeply. Why is Cheadle still giving Sandler a chance to become a force for him? If they were as good friends as they fell apart? If Cheadle is so under control, why is he still looking for mortal advice on the street? They will never tell us. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and why it just upset. Almost 8 out of 10 Average Points? I do not agree. At all. Even the best movies are lucky to get such a high average value, and these bulls do not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
