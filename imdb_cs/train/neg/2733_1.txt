I discussed whether I should tick the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show is likely to have seen some Scrubs followers, they probably will not get into the spoiler category. <br /> <br /> Clip shows. Grrr. We all knew that buddies were following the tube when they started with clippings ... and five and a half years in the Scrubs, which left and fell into that hole. I have to wonder if writers just could not be bothered to write that week and just said "let's show other fun stuff." It did not work. <br /> <br /> Beginning, showing all the times people fall, is not sad when removed from the context. It's not fun to see Todd hanging through a banana hammock if we do not know why he was rocking his banana hammock. Secondly, what was to be a compilation of JD's fantasies was one of the Turks dreams, another was not his fantasy even though I forgot who. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is totally forgotten. We've seen all of these things before. And a collection of clips dances people? Why? It's not fun. Finally, I must admit that two of my favorite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation ... Cox realized that Ben had died ... and JD had told him he was proud of being. But even seeing these moments did not save the episode again. The summary says everything. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, please do not let your show go the same way as friends, keep it fresh, keep it funny ... or wrap it up.
