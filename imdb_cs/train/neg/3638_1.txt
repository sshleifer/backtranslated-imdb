The film portrays the unresolved issues of France with a colonial heritage in the West African (Francophone) Africa through the prolific and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (symbolically representing her nation). It is often an interest and demanding portrait of the young woman's desire to cope with the traumatic moment in her past and, in particular, the desire of the nation to address the "second" one once owned and shaped. This is reflected in the way in which it totally focuses on the concept of traveling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; it remembers the reality of the undeniable present political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> The characters play a symbolic, though limited and unconvincing role. France, which is supposed to be a visual and totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifference when she seems to be still alive with the same naivety she enjoyed as a child - in fact as a child, it seems to be more of her own. The rest of the rag-tag is just forgotten. Black Africans are, at least, sacrificed impresionist portraits of former colonized nations that have now colonized ill-treatment of the director's material. They are just the dark and dying backdrops against which crazy France is surprised to find a world she never knew and hopes to never find herself in Cameroon.
