I managed to capture it with the help of MST3K and ach boy, although riffing this movie was unbearably bad. Imagine someone whose competency with the camera could be done by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The most important events (little) were from special effects that were "okay". Most were also "OK"; but nothing special, it was better than other B-movies I've seen in the past. The rest of this movie is horrified badly, working with the camera often looks like a cameraman on roller skates and pushed him. The story (if it's so called) is so full of holes, it's almost fun, it never really explains why hell survived or needs the human body to survive. The script is badly written and the dialogue is only on the plane. The climax of the film (if any) is totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
