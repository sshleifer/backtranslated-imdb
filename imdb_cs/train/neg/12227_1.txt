This could be the worst movie ever shot and perhaps worth seeing just for this reason. Streisand is ridiculously unbelievable as a young woman who represents a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is tortuous in which Barbara challenges some of the weakest blathers ever shot. And do not even start me with the conspiracy. From this movie you really get more laughter than many comedies because it's so terrible. The embarrassed ego of Streisanda, thinking she could somehow raise this arson at the height of the Oscar, led to this disaster. I'm sure the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hated this film and never let Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is like watching a car wreck in a slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack "The Sound of Music," which is played back on an old gramophone record. It's really bad. I'm amazed that someone from Streisand liked this movie at the level that was intended.
