This Lifetime movie takes the middle-aged victims who ultimately fight the genre back to the new depths of absurdity as a cartoon. A 40-year-old ex-husband of a successful lawyer (daughter away at college) begins a new life after a divorce, helped by a female college girlfriend in opening a new clothing store as the second extension of the franchise. She even started to be friends with her attractive, slightly younger, landscaping architect / gardener (who is black). But then the horror of middle-aged female horrors, ANOTHER 20 something female that she took as a tenant to let herself, began to "take over" her life. What this new younger threat really does is to flirtatiously with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that * was sobbing * really belonged to a divorcee! Starts accounts for the thermostat not to disappear! And backed up the toilet! And leaving the old meal gone bad in the fridge! And hang her pieces (African) art objects in the living room! ... So maybe she killed a cat. "Yeah, okay, the extent to which these things are done is bad enough, but it's more than a little ridiculous, especially when it turns into a campaign. The reality of reality is that every tiny part of this buried gender would be the (So ​​why did she rented the room - and the horror of the horrors, a much younger woman?) Supposedly this arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for controlling restraint, and our brave 40 must learn to fight this evil (of course erotic looking). But whenever something starts to get into trouble, POWER uses it - and just flirts or has sex with a guy and escapes the consequences. (Well, there is actually something that might look good, > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Of course, 40 things do not know about these things, and 20 have something to help. The rent actually gives the younger woman the same entitlement to the whole house during the rental period, utility things are worth a fixed price. Although a resolution is in progress, something will soon become a temporary limiting order against the older woman, allegedly because it threatens something. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the crazy sexy young things. Finally, there is a lot of "heroic" home struggles. Woopie! The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how terribly easy TROs (or protection orders) are for women to get to nothing more than its unreasonable to say so - although they are generally just that easy against men. They are sometimes equally unjustified and motivated to take control of the house as it is here. Girlfriends who have moved with their friends can often get them out of their own homes or condos on the basis of any evidence but only unsubstantiated threat claims and sometimes without even hearing from him. Even if there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to refute threatening assertions (to prove negative) when the burden of proof is more on the accused than on the plaintiff. (This is one of the areas of American law where it is true - and it is a sign of outrage at feminist transcendence and the failure of any organized group to withstand the steam locomotive.) Of course it is unlikely Lifetime Film in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd elementary premise of this film lies in the explanation that something is psychotic and does not use its cure. It does not make sense. She does not exist after a successful former lawyer's husband, although she helps her (the fury of a former wife) in her search. She is on the house (technically, to drive her out of the divorce during the rental period). This second younger woman is after ALL what is after the divorce, after matters with the other 20 things STOLE her husband! (The former husband seems to be unbound and basically anxious after his explosion - it does not matter that he is still straying !!!) The protagonist is good enough to look for her age. But her gaze, attitude and focus is so small, meaningful, insignificant, and without fantasy or life force that it is impossible to take care of her. Well, the core group of lifelong supporters, in my opinion, judges according to the average score given to them by a small number of evaluators. (I still watched it just because it was so terribly bad and cartoon that it was on the camp appeal I could not resist seeing how far they would take it.) ** Spoiler ** (if it is with this <br /> <br /> Well, here's a clue here. The film ends with something getting rid of the prison by promising to "listen" to her twenty-year-old male coworkers and sometimes a lover and "do everything she says" and "let her take care of her" to enjoy her cure - and then deceived him and returned to the house. He climbs up the stairs with a knife, looks demoniac at something of his enemy, who enchants with candles to think that a younger woman is out of his life. There is a struggle - and something that Mums win - by sticking something 20 with a hypodermic needle full of antipsychotic medicine she found. She then begins to stroke her, my mom like, and both women have bonding, a female solidarity moment! How sweet.
