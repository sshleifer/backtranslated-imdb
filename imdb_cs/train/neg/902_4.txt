I think that this film is important nowadays, because it was soon Sofia Loren. She was 19 years old when the film was shot in 1953. I saw the film because I wanted to see some of Sofia's early works. I was surprised to find herself in a camera that had bronze skin in brown makeup to resemble the Ethiopian princess. Today it would be considered a riot and should avoid the film. In fact, it was unpleasant to watch Mrs. Loren in skin color throughout the movie. Yes, this movie would be better if real opera singers shot this movie. Then they would notice the singing and real gestures of real artists' faces. I lose others' notes about whether real opera singers are older and heavier. As beautiful as Mrs Loren was at the age of 19 and still today, the film would be better accepted as though it was done on stage. After all, on the stage we can not see beautiful young people with "old opera singers" singing behind the curtains! Do not forget the success of using heavy opera singers. One must relate to the most artificially produced television commercial for J. G. Wentworth Company with opera singers on stage singing so professionally praises the company's product. This is one of the best and most entertaining television commercials made to date. <br /> <br /> The quality of film print also makes this production of somewhat lower quality. Color ink is very pale and can not be helped. To improve this movie on DVD, the production company should add English subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the text says. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator who gives 30 seconds of the introduction to the scene. Watch this movie not because of Aida's story or opera. Apart from Mrs. Sofia Lorena, none of her teammates are known to be the author of this writer. Instead, you can watch this movie if you are a fan of Mrs Loren and want to see her at the age of 19 - no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> Larry of Illinois
