This movie should be just 10 minutes. I mean, there's really only 10 minutes of tracking content on this subject (even I mean to call it a movie). The initial credits of the movie were somewhat promising. As the film begins with short notes about the man himself, really get your hands and stay tuned for more shots of Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a decent job that includes one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of the cave's performance is even more appealing to you to see more Cohen, whose wit and the well-spoken words have already favored your imagination. But as it turned out, cave performance is just the beginning of long super boring performances literally a lot of people who do not even have the least attraction to keep you in your seat. I mean what the filmmaker really thinks? Five-minute shots close up want to be singers at a fake concert in Australia !!! What the film really thinks is hurting the audience by adding "false applause" to these endless ugly performances. The movie is the perfect torture that shows you very little of what you have come to see. There is no single record of Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of a few photos of his first days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add all the minutes that Cohen speaks, it may not even reach 10 minutes. But these ten minutes are bizarrely presented bit by bit between catastrophic camera work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming Cohen's lyrics. If you ever decided to lose your money on this movie, DO NOT! just throw it in garbage and at least save time.
