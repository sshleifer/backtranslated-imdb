This movie is so bad, it's funny. In fact, the Secret of Science 3000 Theater, a TV show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this film to laugh very much. I suggest tracking it (maybe on YouTube) instead of actually seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see the Hobgoblins unless you're ready to stop in the first scene. In fact, you do not see this movie, the period. Please. Not at least seriously. Its jokes are not fun (at least), and you'll have a much more fun parody or watch a parody about it while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel that you are watching the sick, so save yourself. Read the book. Wash the clothes. Anything is much more fun than watching the Hobgoblins.
