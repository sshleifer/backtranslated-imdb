This film is a computed attempt to make the success of Sex in the City and four weddings and funerals. In fact, if they call it sex at the funeral, they might do better at the checkout. But the film falls between two stools and can not get up. The characters emanate an incredibly clear dialogue, but they never act as remotely recognizable as a human. One arbitrary, absurd action follows the other to develop what is going on on the land, and one early tire on the falsity of the whole business. Andie MacDowell gets points for her little heart to come out, but the awards are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as a police detective (they do not have a high duty?). Mrs. Staunton does not seem to be able to make a fake move. We could say the same thing about the writer-director. If Notting Hill has mocked you, beware of this. Phonus bolognus on the half shell.
