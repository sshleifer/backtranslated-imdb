Notice how laughter in Burt Reynolds' laughter is like gnashing brakes in his later films? <br /> <br /> It must be hanging out with Hal Needham too. <br /> <br /> And from the look of "Stroker Ace", WAY too. <br /> <br /> Can you believe it was based on a book? It was not, but it was. And probably not a bestseller, I bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another good old boy in the NASCAR circuit, who is going with Beatty as a fried chicken mogul with suggestions in his team. Anderson provides what is loving interest, and Nabors makes his unexpected impression of Gomer Pyle as a loyal mechanic / best friend of Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt or Hal. The others had to work. And even the real NASCAR drivers get on this act and they seem to have more talent than those who have SAG cards. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laughing, Bubba Smith (before- "Police Academy") gets them as Beatty's chauffeur. And Petersen, full of Elvira, gets a lot of awards like a lady who wants to know Lugs really well. REAL WELL. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Burt tossed so much time and effort into the movie as "Stroker Ace," where it did not matter whether he was bothering to act or not. Did not bother to write a character why bothering to act? Two stars. Mostly for Petersen and for the final work. Now they are funny.
