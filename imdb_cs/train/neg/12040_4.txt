I do not know anything about Iliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy of this story. As a separate film, however, I considered it very boring. Battle scenes tried to be big and spectacular, but they were just plain CGI. The game is poor and Brad Pitt is undoubtedly busy to attract ladies. But he does not do a good fighter, I'm too afraid. <br /> <br /> Good points are design. This movie looks good with impressive landscape and castle buildings. I like a movie that at least tries to get characters accented true, but it seems to ignore this movie completely. we hear American, Scottish English, but what would you expect of a film about ancient Eastern civilization. Overall, I do not recommend that this film be seated for the family. It's too long and the young are bored. <br /> <br /> It's okay for adults if you do not care about the lack of realism.
