** WARNING: A POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you can get an extremely unpleasant subject, this movie offers a massful assortment of horrific camp melodies. Surprisingly, this film has been copied and torn for several years, although it is hard to understand any filmmaker who would be inspired by this horrific drama. Not one of Hemingway's women can act here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers a touch of class as a prosecuting lawyer, and Chris Sarandon is pathetic and inadvertently cheerful as a sneaky, stinky evil kid a bit. Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not produce a silk wallet from this pig-ear scenario, which is filled to explode with gruesome dialoge and extraordinary situations. For example, the last sequence when Margaux picks up a shotgun and pursues Sarandona down after his latest shocking act is supposed to be exciting, but instead causes a heartbeat. Add Michel Polnareff's notorious musical score, and you are truly vindictive, even though you feel rough and need a hot shower after your tour. Do not say you have not been warned.
