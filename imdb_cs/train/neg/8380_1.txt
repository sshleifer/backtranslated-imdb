It is here. eventually the film comes out that I can honestly say that it's worse than Larry, a cable driver: a health inspector. Still, I'm willing to bet that Wayian Brothers will make more money than I ever did in my life, which is definitely one of the five worst movies ever except my fifth year outside the class of re-introduction of romeo and julie. I mean really why would anyone ever see this movie if they did not pay. The comedy is weak, and all the distantly funny jokes of a fragile plot have certainly been revealed in advertisements. The end result is that this film was a terrible disappointment for me. And the ad looked so promising ...
