The problem with the book "Memoirs of a Geisha" is that it has Japanese surfaces, but under the surface it was all manner of thinking of the American. Reading a book is like watching a spectacular ballet with great music, sets and costumes that still played animals in the yards dressed in those costumes? So far from the Japanese ways of thinking were figures. The film is not about Japan or a real geisha. It's a story of some mistaken thoughts of American men about Japan, and geysers that go through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is a movie if it's not Japan or geisha? Is it a pure fantasy, as so many people say? Yes, but why did it become an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no Puritan hangings, no connotations about sex sin. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex in this movie? Right. As if it were dirty. The closest thing to the sexual scene in the movie is Sayuri, who is spinning for five seconds with his nose, and after five seconds he disgusted himself as if the man who was trying to join her was crowned with a handful of cockroaches. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really have sex in this movie? No way. One character is said to be promiscuous, but all we see is pulling away his mistress because he does not seem to be caught doing something dirty. Such a typical American puritanism does not have a place in the film about Japanese geisha. Did Sayuri enjoy her first favor with an old rabbit after her cherry was auctioned? No way. It's lying there like a cold chopping board. Of course she would not like it. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why could not they give her something that she might like? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and bad? For Mameha, the chairman of Sayuri's secret patron, and as such, was at the auction of her virginity. He could negotiate the auction and won it himself. Nobu did not fail. So why did the president make the old pupil win her, and when she remembered the old smell, she got her fingers on her naked body? Someone ever really forgave a man for that? <br /> <br /> Let's try to understand. When Mameha found himself behind Mameha, he made the debts of training Sayuri Geisha. In order to repay his debts, Chairman Sayuri sold Dr. Crab. Through Mamey, the chairman sold Sayuri's sexual favors to the old slave, so the president could make some money out of it. The chairman was not her patron. She was her pimp! Some romantic love story. Yes, the movie is beautiful, but it is like the beauty of a very attractive, challenging transvestite, whose voice, looks and every touch are exciting. But under that very feminine surface lies a sinister secret. Under the improperly appearing Japanese surface of the film lies a sinister secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are entirely American and masculine. It is not the best thing to happen if it is trying to be different than lying, distorted, and terribly wrong. Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style? Refined, elegant simplicity. MOAG style? Beijing opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Her hair rose. MOAG geisha ?? Free hair that surely had to get it all into a thick white makeup paste. Japanese Shining Ice - The Japanese are rather rigid towards seasonal adherence. Shaved ice is strictly summer. MOAG shaved ice - The chairman buys Chiyo, young Sayuri played amazing Suzuka Ohgo, this treatment during cherry-flower-season watching. This idea made my whole body tremble with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Trained and qualified artists. MOAG geisha - sluts. <br /> <br /> The Japanese wind - used in the summer because it hears the sound it causes, thanks to the breeze the Japanese people feel a little cooler. MOAG wind bell - bell! If one stood in front of someone else's house and made wind sounds, they would be considered mad, they would not gain entrance. Japan? Focus on human relations, group oriented. MOAG? "I want life that is my" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance? Refined elegance. Almost geometric and mechanical accuracy. MOAG Dance? Martha Graham was frightened at the LSD when she was wearing a non-very-friendly white Japanese burial cloak. Does a geisha run on a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is it a strip club where most of their research was done on geisha? <br /> <br /> Japanese fire house? Setting or even firing a fire is worse than murder because it poses such a serious threat to the community. Fires can break those wooden villages, towns and cities that destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill so many people. MOAG House Fire - A great addition to the combat scene, but there are zero consequences and because it no longer needs out-control fire by miracle itself. Technically, the film ended because Sayuri would be at least trapped and joined his sister among those who had never heard of it. Which is where Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be expelled. <br /> <br /> Enough. The film is stinking.
