Unfortunately, there were no ratings for the rating, otherwise I would have chosen it. This film lacks the starry power the original film had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, innocent newcomer Aileen Quinn, and professional director John Huston (actress Angelica Huston) are what makes this movie so charming. Even a remake in 1999 with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenowett was more than to offer this apologetic apology for the sequel. Before filming this film, Ashley Johnson was known for her role as Little Chrissie Seaver at the Growing Pains main show. She had some parts in the films, but I do not know who thinks he has enough talent to shoot the film himself. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwin Hogbottom, ridiculous! They could not get enough good actors to play major roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, and Annie, but Joan Collins will sign the game for a British lady? I'm not surprised that this movie was as bad as it was. Critics were right that they did not agree with this film, even if it was just for television, it was a bad continuation to a different kind of film.
