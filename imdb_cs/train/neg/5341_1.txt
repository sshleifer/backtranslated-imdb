Loaded by fine actors, "Deceiver" I expected much more than it was delivered. This plot is extremely conceived and manipulative. Many flashes are just a mess. Believability flips out of the window and the end becomes unbearable and totally ridiculous. I would like to advise anyone who likes their film footage to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid the "Deceiver" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I just do not have to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were completely confused by the story and the end. Blurring the line between reality and lie simply does not work because the whole movie does not make sense. - MERK
