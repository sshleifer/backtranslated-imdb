Ignorance (if possible) of unauthorized, gratuitous marijuana smoking (which appears to be mandatory in Australian Government-funded films) casting this film gives reasonably credible performance. It's as far as it goes. The rest is just terrible. The conspiracy is overwhelmed by "wow" symbols to look good on the film but it does not go anywhere. A rough example is a huge peach float, which apparently went from the city show and donated local canning. It was just too tempting to make the most of what is perhaps free but still insignificant! The peach has a clear, inexplicable washing in one step, but that's where it ends. Similarly, the conventional road sign "black spot" where Steph's parents were killed should serve as a symbol of escape from her past, but her escape on what? It was a pretty good situation where she was, especially with regard to her visual affection and endless, loving patience and care for her understanding young female guardian. Guinness's prize for the brown melodrama, however, is the characterization of Alan. Alan successfully strives for the noble role of a union manager, but the "rat" of his coworkers by becoming a superior for bad multi-national - sighing! hiss! As a superior, Alan performs the dirty dirty work of the boss. Performing redundancy until the surprise is surprising that the entire plant is closed and Alan himself is a pathetic unemployed failure. No clones-free zones here, buddy! Not only that, but Alan will also lose seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you will meet. If you think the story is melodramatic and didactic, do not ask for details. What is the meaning of a shaving cream on Sedu's seductive leg? Why does not a hotel where a couple love, eventually a twig that somebody gained an illegal entry into one of his most beautiful bedrooms and among other pandemonics the leaves are regularly polluted - very spectacular on one occasion. Diminishing this movie in one word: Avoid, avoid, avoid.
