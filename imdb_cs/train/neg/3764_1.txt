This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen and maybe the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible, and they seemed too hard to play their roles like dorks, hard boys, fools, all they knew, etc. And the big leg was terrible. It seemed to be a computer created picture from the days of Atari and Intellivision. At one point near the end of the film as an army of sasquats they chased the remaining survivors, one was shot and as it runs it looked like a poor version of the donkey kong himself! And a man is hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it is just a terrible animation. Another thing that was unpleasant was the music. Way way too much music (classic score or whatever you say) throughout the movie. It never ended. Yeah yeah, the movie is also boring. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend that you take your 3 dollars or whatever you charge for renting this movie and spend it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. PREVIOUS!
