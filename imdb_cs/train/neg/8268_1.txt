This movie is terrible. Everything in it was done earlier. There is nothing original. I can not stand when the writers did not come up with their own land. A girl makes a wish for her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, sounds like a movie in the 1980s called Big. What Jennifer Garner is doing is even more annoying. She does not act as if she was 13, but she just acts as if she was stupid. Since then you can guess the whole conspiracy. She gets a good job and just happens to work with her girlfriend, with whom she was 13. Wow, how awesome! But no ... her friend is wrong, she turned to her and tried to get her job. But, of course, she will eventually win when she comes up with a "great" idea. <br /> <br /> The movie I saw a thousand times before is also a dance scene. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
