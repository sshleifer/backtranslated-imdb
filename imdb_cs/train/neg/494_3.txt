An easily controlled, helpless comedy that allegedly spoofs the "classic" 50th years of "foreign invasion" of movies, but really is no better than them, except of purely technical separation (good make-up effects). And any spoof that is worse than his target is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Flint Man" is worse than almost no James Bond movie). After two hours of listening to the voices of strangers, you will beg for some peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
