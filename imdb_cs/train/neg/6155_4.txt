A strange mix of the traditional-80-year, intelligent, Chevy Chase-type, "Every-ten-lines-you-get-a-funny-one" farce and ill black comedy. Slightly fun in places but absolutely tasteless. There is a skiing sequence that includes de facto looking back-projections from "His Majesty's Secret Service". (**)
