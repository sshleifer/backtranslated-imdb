It is in 1978 and of course there are too many black players in the team! Fans will be disturbed and will surely be full of 75,000 seats, just less happy to have so many black players on the pitch! This is trackable for Super Bowl. It's not much more, but it's really a surprising cast of talented actors who appear (for time), probably most notably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, every kind of charity brought by Selleck on the screen is quickly cast by "actors" like Dick Butkus. It's a stupid story about stakes in super sites. PJ Jackson is entrusted with "New York" (to read the mafia) for the game ending in their favor, in this case $ 10,000,000. PJ is pretty innocent and seems to have a loose grasp by buying a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, unimpaired by Lainie, takes over. For some time the mystery of murder is not known with certainty, but it is clearly revealed in the final murder that Lainie is a new antagonist. It's a bad movie, but it's observable. The game is decent and shooting is fine. At least there was no silly typical 70th autocratic (they have their place right here). Just keep your mind open about past stereotypes and cocaine and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
