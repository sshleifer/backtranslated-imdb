This film reflects the nature of the study of perversion. Some reviewers have been forcefully pretending that, given that perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically deep; In fact, given the abundant material, it is surprisingly tedious and shallow, without motivation. Why is the main character the way it is? You do not know the script. For better treatment of the same theme (and more fun movie) try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.
