I was so excited when I found out that it was available! I could not wait to see it. What a loss of energy! It's a bit like a rare CD your favorite band found at the back of the rack in your local music store. As a hard core fan, you were convinced that this is a valuable discovery. But once you heard it, it was clear why these dogs never managed to make a real album. This DVD is recommended only for "consistors" who must have everything Lynch did. "The six mature men" is somewhat visually interesting, but short and repetitive. Lynch's later work is missing The "Grandmother" is simply immature work. It's tiring and looks like a student movie. But it was the 1970s ... It's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his paintings and sounds. "Alpahabet" is forgotten (not really, I do not remember that!) "Amputee" is useless. "Cowboy and the French" is just stupid. Lumiere is the only one in the group. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story comparable to his best work. I had to watch this several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying DVDs.
