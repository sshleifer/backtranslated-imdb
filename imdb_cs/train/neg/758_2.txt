This show is smelly. For parents, they usually want their children to watch something good. This is usually educational, fun and clear. Is it educational? No. Doodlebops are singing and that's all. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to learn anything. <br /> <br /> It's funny? No. Doodlebops instead say something that is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it. It's clear? It's so clear, it's painful. As far as color is concerned, everything is extremely clear, so it's good. But there was nothing in the world of Doodlebop. That's why they're always happy. the child in trouble becomes depressed because she has never been exposed to being sad. The exhibition is also extremely cheesy. Each syllable is said to be the highest level of exaggeration and very skinny. It's exaggerated. <br /> <br /> It's fun for kids, but when you reach the age of 2, you do not want your children to see. They will never know how to grow up.
