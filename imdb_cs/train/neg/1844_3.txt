Personally, I think this show looks quite cheap. Some actors are terrible. They do it and they look fake. I can always say how it will be in the first 10 minutes or less to watch because it will make it so transparent. Nor is it well written. I like to look at it to laugh at it. You know you say, "Is it so bad that it's good?" Well, this announcement is valid for this show. I also like to look only if I'm right when I think it's over. So far, I've always been right. It's like a little game I play. It's nice when you get bored and you feel like laughing.
