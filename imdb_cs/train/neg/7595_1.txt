"Ask Dust" was interesting from a trailer and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not so compelling to be considered a drama, and it was not strange to be a comedy. It seemed to be practically little and without a fun effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get into a better situation, we and my wife went out and found myself stuck in such nonsense. It was simply not interesting, moving, entertaining or artistic. It looks as if it's written, produced and controlled by the dean of the college; even worse, it was such a shameful loss of otherwise exceptionally talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
