Jared Diamond mentioned the first episode that other people in the world did not have animals to domesticate, but Europeans did it and that is why we are able to produce steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But in the third episode he says that when the Europeans in South Africa got too far to the north, they found the inhabitants of Zulu and other tribes that had cattle and planted crops. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements, if they have the key things that the author claims are needed for success? Diamond also claims that smallpox bacteria (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zul * without one victim *, then I think you have to conclude that the bacteria are irrelevant. With or without small embryos, we would succeed. It is to be said that the Malaria stopped the Europeans from colonizing the north and killing "thousands" of Europeans without touching the Africans. (I would like to know real numbers, but he did not say.) Then at the end he says that today Malaria kills thousands of Africans and therefore can not catch up with us. So what is it, Jared? Has malaria helped Africans by stopping or hurting Eurpeans? And how did Europe get right despite massive wounds in our history? <br /> <br /> He seems to be too eager to say that the reasons why the Europeans succeeded were stupid. At times when evidence threatens to flood his wild theories, he reluctantly admits that perhaps Europeans were successful because they worked for her. It is sad to observe this obvious neo-Marxist contingency reality to try to prove its meaning.
