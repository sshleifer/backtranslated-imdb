Radar Men from the Moon are pretty typical of the series of 1950s. Special effects are relatively cheap, lunar rovers are, of course, crowded with jewels from the Second World War with plywood and the like. The act is just that. It inspires the imagination of the children I believe it is focused on. According to today's standards, it is boring, cheap and bad. The first 9 episodes of natural disasters are also a huge number of records.
