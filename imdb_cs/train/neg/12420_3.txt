Here it just is not enough. Several funny points, but not enough. I was very disappointed because I like silly movies. I expected it to be a hidden gem. IT WAS NOT. It was a hidden turd. All the time I watched, I thought, "Geez, I could do better, and I'm crazy." Do not believe it with some good reviews. I was poured in them. I did not think at any time. Perhaps it was funny or top-notch in 1987, but man, it fell today. This movie had a promise, it just did not happen. Maybe if they overwrite it several times. I can not beat actor. They were not the best, but they did not have much to do with what they could do. This movie failed due to written text. SORELY disappointed.
