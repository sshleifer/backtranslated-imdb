I just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit I was a little surprised that it was even on. There were so many hooves, dirty news and bad edits that the old episode of Sesame Street would be better to watch. The game was fine, but please, you can really feel the feel of "Straight to Video". Cast / Crew made this film a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait ten minutes before the end to hear it. Trust me, you would not even tell the difference.
