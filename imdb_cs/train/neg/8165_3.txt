It's a creepy story. It's a story of cannibalism. It's a story of revenge. It's a very bad film with a lot of violence. I suppose it's going to be cheap in line with every movie slasher you've ever seen. He has a usual, rare place, prey to the campers, and heads to the wilderness. Sure, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's so boring. Bad editing and all the work. There are children of ghosts who sound as if they were talking to a wastebasket. I'm not sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the cap of the seeds play. It also has a rough scene where you eat a piece of meat that is actually what's left of your wife. One of my friends once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous, sick violence. I'm afraid this is just another step in our annoying evolution. Three of them are no dexterity, no tongue in the face, only a sad waste of time. Lots of blood; little plot.
