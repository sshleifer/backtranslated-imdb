Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) decides that this Christmas will not be lonely. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also unpleasant and guilty that they are spectacular. Drew returns to the home where he grew up and offers the family that lives there, Valco, $ 250,000 to become his "family" over the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but is so greedy to accept Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little information on this subject, but she learns that she likes Drew around ... not exactly the same mood with her daughter, Christina Applegate, but it also has room for change . Drew's girlfriend Missy (Jennifer Morrison) watches Drew and wants her people to meet her family. Great fun stays as a happy Noel becomes a fun dysfunctional nightmare. Other cast members include Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comic, though weird.
