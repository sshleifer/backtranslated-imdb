May the saints protect us because this film will not help. Someone with access needs an email Mel Gibson and tells him that we need faithful Beowulf production. Something that actually has something to do with the epic poem that is the basis for all modern Western literature. A recent (since 2000) Beowulf version makes curiosity two things. First, why is the interest in the story so great? Secondly, why are all the creators wasting money money on this bullshit. The only reason he has two of them is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed 1. <br /> What's even worse, some people will watch this and get a bad idea about the poem . How can the industry where Peter Jackson acquires literary conversion to the film so well can get so badly. I mean, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. And please, horns on helmets? Save me. This is offensive. <br /> <br />
