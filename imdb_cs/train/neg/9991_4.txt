First of all, I'm not here to make this movie a dog. I find it very pleasant despite the poor quality of production. The acts here are as hideous as when a monster chases, although the monster is quite well done ... impressively well done. In fact, he looks like a species-mundane alien on a vacation that landed in the Himalayas, and while Dad missed ... on the occasion of the call of nature, Spot relaxed and simply did not have time to chase him. That is, or he is Caucasian Recipient's brother. I did not want to decide. It seems to have been shot somewhere in the snow, yes, but probably Canada somewhere else than in China. Trees and views tell me Canada, and it's fine that the set area never shows the look or feel of the cold that one could expect in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi Channel movie so we can forgive the lack of space. Additionally, it seems, as we have realized, Sci-Fi directors do not go often because they are not aware that commercial aircraft fly over weather conditions like what is mentioned here, and the resulting crash would not actually happen. But as I said, it's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we have to forgive a few things. The film is sometimes graphic and rotates between "Alive" about Donner Party, "Predator" about the alien in the woods and about every bad wushu movie where they fly on the wire. Yeti may jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... do you remember? "Go longer!" Yeti also missed a teddy bear. He was looking high and low, but he does not seem to be able to make a corpse. Poor Yeti! You can not help him, but you're sorry. He survived and developed for thousands of years just to be subject to the loss of teddy bears. He missed his bear. Or maybe he wants to, but this idea is BANISHED! Can you hear me? He seems to be an unconstrained man. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> And that's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's super Yeti! But then it's normal - Yeti? I do not know, but it has a certain quality of Michael Meyers, which is absolutely troubling. And she has this wonderful way to clean the fur. FABulous Dahlink! It is immaculately white at a time when it should not be. It's a super superstar ... super Yeti. <br /> <br /> All in all? It was a lot of fun to watch, it has some great killing and some honest elements of plot. Despite the terribly gravely style of production, it's really quite fun. Can not I think if they plan another? <br /> <br /> It is fitting on the M4TV scale at a ratio of 6.0 / 10. <br /> <br /> It rated 4.4 / 10 on a film scale from ... <br /> <br /> Attachment:.
