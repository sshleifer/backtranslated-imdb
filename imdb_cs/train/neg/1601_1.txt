Stereotypical slasher hopping is far short of supposed fun. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact, the rest is totally useless. The jokes are full and each punch line is well telegraphed. Silly lining comes from a fast pace and almost every one of them falls like blooming grapes. Music numbers only contribute to boredom that fits and stays throughout the movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely inside the walls of the abandoned high school. Avoid it and look for one of Lampoon's "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
