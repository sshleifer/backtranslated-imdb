I could never stand by watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I had problems when the best scene in this movie was represented by Scott Baio (a skateboarding hitting scene!). Jodie Foster in her first "adult" role will change her usual professional performance, but that's not the justification for this tedious mess. Two hours of my life that I will never come back! No remarkable figures, incredible story, dubious editing, and terrible cinematography, but the worst of all, I could not care less. The story of teens from California in the 1970s, when children live poorly and all of their parents are idiots. Do not waste time watching this ugly justification for the film.
