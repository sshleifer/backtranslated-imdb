This film forever impressed me. I looked at it as a freshman in high school, and at night I was home alone. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed because the actor was a huge fan of "Brady Bunch". I also thought that Chuck Connor's role is terrible and evil. However, this film has been acting to me as a volunteer at a female state prison that performs biblical studies and church services and is trying to change the lives of women one by one. What fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie. None of my friends looked at it, and my family is powerless even today when I'm discussing this movie because they have not seen it.
