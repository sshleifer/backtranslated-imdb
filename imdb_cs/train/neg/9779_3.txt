A neutral, foolish, unqualified "war painting," which was largely shown by the attributes of the magnificent Evie Meyer - is not in itself a bad idea - but that should be embarrassing for anyone who has joined him. A funny "script", a performance that should not be a musical competition for elementary schools, a failed "action" scene, confused by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen - who apparently is not quite sure whether he is doing comedy, philosophical treatise on the accident of war or about the witch T & A (by the early 1960s, standards), it's Eva Meyer's beautiful body - and all the atmosphere of insecurity and incompetence. It's worth seeing to watch Eva Meyer, but that's almost it.
