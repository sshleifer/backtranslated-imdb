Why review good movies when you can read "Trancery II?" Ooh, this movie is such a lame. I can just imagine the cast and crew around LA with my camcorder and get stuck in the stupid, terrible makeup of the poor, long-suffering Tim Thomerson. The stars' families are actually turning to cathouses, probably because Full Moon can not afford "real" extra. Lame effects, lame kits and scenario so complicated that it would take days if all nodes were separated - it must be the classic Trancery! And yet ... and yet ... it drives it. Note that this is the same as I say about "Transaction IV." I say this because it's true. What can beat the old guy watching in the trench to get a zombie, then crackle with jokes such as: "Do not be afraid of ladies, they are biodegradable"? Well, a lot of things could be better, but it's still a good thing. The only important reservation is Megan Ward, who really fucks the joint. She's a poor opponent in the character of Helen Hunt - they're both young bits of eye candy, and it would be much more effective if it was something a bit like. Well, you can not have everything. At least the wonderful drawing device "Long Second Watch" is back in place, and we have more Hapshins, the least convincing athlete in the history of the cinema (oh, wait for a moment - my opponent in the form of David Ogden Steirsa in the "Creator"). I have not seen it recently, but it seems I remember Martine Beswick running twice during the last battle. The horror behind the futile continuity! One of the many peaks of this fine film.
