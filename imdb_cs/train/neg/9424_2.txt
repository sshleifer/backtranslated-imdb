It was not pleasant to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal job (boring!) So his half-son can go to the film school but his half-son decides instead to do a humiliating documentary about a man. The documentarist should direct the camera and simply shoot, do not manipulate and comment using hidden captions. The bitterness and grudge of the filmmaker against his stepfather is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be that Frank seems to be stupid and poor, instead he meets the most human of the three people. <br /> <br /> A basically frayed campaign that dresses like something much smarter and leaner than it really is. I was left with an intense dislike for filmmakers.
