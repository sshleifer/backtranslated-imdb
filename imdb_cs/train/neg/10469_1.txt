Yes, I admit that I was crying during this movie. It was such an incredible disappointment that I could not help, but she cried. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First, with the Million dollar man (ex-professional wrestler) on their program, and now it. Omega code follows the stream of sketches of religiously oriented films. It was quite fun, but at the same time it was worrying that it was so biblically inaccurate. The film tracks what is known as the "biblical code" rather than the actual biblical script. This film is very badly made; from his writing to directing him to his horrible acting. It's depressing that people really make the effort into this movie. It looked more like a late night movie someone watched on a US channel or directly into a domestic video, rather than a theatrically released film. I strongly recommend that you do not watch this movie, even if your life depends on it.
