I've seen every episode of this split. I thought the first season was a decent effort, given the expectation that Gray's Anatomy would be so successful. So I keep looking. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, chemistry, and especially the drama of its predecessor, Gray's Anatomy. Relationships seem to be conceived, and acting is so-so. The script lacks intelligence and comedic hints in GA. There are shows that formula, but they do not feel formic and invented, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is not just interesting.
