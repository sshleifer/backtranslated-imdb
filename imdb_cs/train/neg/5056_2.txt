*** SPOILERS *** We'll start with a "good" movie - the real work of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is terrible (it's not supported by horror script). The worst offender is the villain, Buntao, the head of the Asian criminal syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laughed at my head as she expressed her "fury" about having lost a lot of money; horrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line of "hostile takeover" (the rest of the title of this film) was delivered just as badly as possible. There are no other main characters, but in this film, no other actor / actress likes. We're on the conspiracy. That should say everything you need to know: In the original Rage and Honor, Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the inner city. Now is C.I.A. agent (or it was some other government agency - I'm sorry, but this movie was so bad I do not even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. the application process was like. Interviewer: What past work experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Well; you are accepted! I give it only "2" due to some decent acting and a nice conspiracy plot at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), a secret villain, will be caught).
