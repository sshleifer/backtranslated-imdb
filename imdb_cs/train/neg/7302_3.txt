The first five minutes of this film showed the potential. Then it came directly from something dear to some illegitimate comedy. Best of all, I could not stop thinking about Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the mere fact that I was learning how to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that you are just about to stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew will cease at some point. The thing that amazes me most is that she earned $ 22 million in the box and cost only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations on the Lion Gate because he could pull this out.
