What is the load of garbage .. I can not even describe how horrible this movie was. The rating he has here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you enjoyed the first gingerbread. The first one was well-written, well-directed, well done ... great movie with a fantastic aesthetic atmosphere. The second was "alrite" - decent as a separate movie, but apparently not to the first level ... The third is the insult of the series, the season. I think movies: 10, 6, 1. That's bad. Oh, yes, it's really in the past, sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all confused with some long-lived native American mythology. Nurses have no real story, procedure, or even a clear relationship ... They try to survive and be together with each other. It's as deep as it happens. <br /> <br /> He was betting the girls agreed to be in this pile after reading the script. <br /> <br /> And one more thing, the action was terrible-people regularly appear from nowhere as girls turn and there's a complicated candle-lit arrangement with a mystical native American woman who just sits there and is going to go speech. The kits were horrible, they could not get away from the fact that it was all set in a set, which did not really help. Also there was permanent snow outside the camp, but not a trace inside (.. set on). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped he would be at least as good as the other.
