I was also wrapped up. I also fell on horrible packs and a DVD wrapper that claims "to please the fans, because each copy was pulled out of shelves." Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it was not really what it was worth - no fears and very limited gore. The end was very lean and did not reach the impact he should have. I really do not know how this happened to "Video Nasty", as it is very tame. The story stretches, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... do not fulfill the promise. The DVD bonus feature ("interview") is very special because the director seems to be very discontinuous and not all of them there. The lead actress speaks as if she appeared in Shakespeare's production. It's a great laugh.
