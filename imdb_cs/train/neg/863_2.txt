I just realized that when I look at the horror of the Euro, especially the cult movies Jess Franco, you can not expect it to make sense. However, Franco crossed the deck with this film; and despite the unrealistic atmosphere and reputation of the film as one of the best directors - Succubus is unfortunately a terrible movie. I have to admit that I saw an American cutting version that runs for about 76 minutes; but if it was not just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with the woman who is bothered; practice S & M and talk about garbage and it's really boring. There is no gore and sex is boring and most of the run is boring and despite the fact that it's a short film; I had a problem with having done it to the end. I have to say that the places look good and Franco did a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements will end. Jess Franco is certainly a talented director who created some classic brooms - but it seems he was the one who made money and generally I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's most interesting films.
