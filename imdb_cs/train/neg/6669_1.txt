I saw this movie in my cinematographic class. I'm glad I did not see it. I came into that with an open mind and was even a little excited. I really liked Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood and the rest of the cast was interesting. I never connected with this movie. Acting was great, cinematography was interesting, but the story, or rather the lack, was a problem. There was no central theme in the movie. Was it a romantic relationship between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it western? Something, but not. I'm all for dizziness in movies, I recently saw "Brick" and he loved it, but the place where this movie went is just too far out. It was so strange, and if I did not have to sit around the movie, I would leave. The script was not terrible, but it was all. At the time this movie ended, I just left it terribly confused and wished it to be over sooner. This movie was just something that did not radiate, I see more unpredictable movies like "Fight Club," but I did not care about the characters at all.
