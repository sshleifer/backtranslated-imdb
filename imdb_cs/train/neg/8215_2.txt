In fact, I felt bad about actors in this matter. Undoubtedly, a drama classroom could do a better job or at least work. The actors had to think it would be their big chance to work in the movie, it certainly was not. In addition to horrific acting, the stories were boring and mostly predictable. The remote did not even make sense. For the wrong cause it has the best assumption in the stack. I believe that I support low-budget films and give new filmmakers the right, but this is a waste of time and an insult to the audience. I watched it just for some of the good comments I posted here. They must be planted by people who have a relationship with the film. You can fool people to watch it, but you can not crazy about them to like what they saw. I gave her 2 place 1 because at least Boxer's story was trying to be a warming heart. Surely it failed, but he tried. I'm throwing 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Take the favor and skip this dribble. I wish I had.
