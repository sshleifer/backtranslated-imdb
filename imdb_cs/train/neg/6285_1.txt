Horror film ?? really ???? I can not believe how bad this movie was, what is the point of this film? the movie is about 1h and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes is just a lady walks around with that silly glance at her face after suffering an accident .... much talks at all, not much work at all .. i have to say tho, the last 20 minuets it has a bit of small action .. and he was still stupid ....... and the end oh oh God, I do not know where to start, it also ends up with this stupid look on the lazy face lol .. do not make me wrong I love Lena Headey, I think she is a great actress but I do not know what happened to her to do this movie .. do not waste your time watching because this movie does not have a story, it has no acting ... and it does not make sense ... not to mention how slow this movie goes and it's like watching him forever.
