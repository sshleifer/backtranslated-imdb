It is an anti-Serbian propaganda film designed for television. "Muslims are good, Orthodox Christians Serbs are BAD." <br /> <br /> This is the message. <br /> <br /> The use of "entertainment" to translate a promotional message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This movie is strong. </ br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know better. Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovich and his Chetnik, 500 downed American airmen from the Germans in the Second World War. Churchill chose to betray Milhalovich and put the British behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed, and as a result, after the end of the war, Yugoslavia was served to Communist Titus. <br /> <br /> And the US ally, Milhalovic, has been media since then. the film is part of a promotional campaign against Serbs by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG), which culminated in a Kosovo "war" in which Serbia bombed NATO for ICG's untrue assertion of "mass graves" in Kosovo filled with "victims" of ugly Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves and Albanians (Muslims) did not have any business in Serbian Kosovo is the fact that most media do not print. I chose the movie he was watching because the description of one sentence on the cover of the video looked interesting. Imagine that I was disgusted when I found out that I was cheated to hire another branch of a propaganda machine targeting Serbia. Instead, from this propaganda, somebody should shoot a film about Clinton's reluctance to speak with the congress and with the American people about his complicity in supplying weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I will not hold my breath, waiting for such a movie.
