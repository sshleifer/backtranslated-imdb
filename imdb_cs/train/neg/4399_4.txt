"Tapeheads," an unusually fun spoof of music videos, could be a perfect comedy short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortless to swing this senseless chaos. They play two long-haired security guards in Los Angeles, who set up their own Video Aces and make funny videos for groups, parties, and a star of a deadly bed. It is a bad thing that movie makers had to invent a complicated side fence that would prevent the running of time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his followers, who does much, apart from the relief of the primary force of the film, to send a musical culture of the late 1980s). Yet Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals: nerdy but free, incredible streets without hips or poser, these boys are on the same walnut wave and they never go down. These are real things in comedic comedies. * 1/2 from ****
