There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast, but unfortunately it does not help with the main drawbacks of the film. I never understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use accents that are not theirs, when it is obvious to all who can not convince them. Fiennes simply can not do the Irish, and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russia. When the voice is wrong, no matter how good the acting, the character will never be convincing. As a major problem ... conspiracy ... was there one? I think it's a story, but it was so full of holes that I could not wait for the movie to end ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and watch this movie!
