Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. A rather good film of a werewolf, which I admit to having started slowly, but gained momentum on the way to achieving a fairly good result when the anchor turned into a cute werewolf just to be shot on the camera. Yes, it did for a fun horror movie to be sure ... well forget about it all because this movie has nothing to do with this movie. Surely, they invented the anchor woman is the same, and that her brother or something wants to find out why and why things went down like they are, but they're coming out of a small cozy escape from the first movie in Transylvania or somewhere here where they have to fight evil magical werewolves or something. I'm often interested in what Christopher Lee is doing in this movie, but I've read trivia where he says he's never been in the Werewolf movie before, but before reading the role, read the script. Maybe you could get to the "American Werewolf in London" what could be. That was after all in London. Hell, the werewolves do not seem to be in this movie except for a somewhat bizarre and long-lasting sexual scene. In fact, it was the most memorable death for me in this movie when one girl started talking loudly and started bleeding.
