Dear Richard, I know we all loved you to improve home with Tim Allen. But seriously, do not you have anything to do except the Air Bud Budding sequel? I wanted to think that Tim could actually give you a role or even become his personal assistant. I know it looks ironic, but the pay benefits are much better. Everybody would see you around Tim and immediately think of the "Time Tool". You'd be more likely to play with Bob. Instead, you will appear for 10 minutes with the Golden Retriever and you are smiling. I know there was not much scripting, but you joined it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you one. But seriously, this film does nothing for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, fake-talking puppies are deeper than the real view of dog athletes. Origin was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, you know more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
