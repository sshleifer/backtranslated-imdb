Isabel Allende is a magical, lyrical novel about three generations of the aristocratic South American family being vandalized. The terrible oaf of the film that resulted - largely due to the magnificent engagement of Anglo actors, totally incapable of taking away the elusive Latin mellifluousness of the character Allende and the prolific Scandinavian directorial hand - was so inconvenient in my own skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make sure I missed something vital that would change my mind. To my disappointment I missed nothing. None of the members of Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close, and Vanessa Redgrave could get rid of the trap for him by Bill August. Everyone looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if making the least effort, expecting them to be unaware of the beautiful times. (Yes, the film was artificially directed within one centimeter of his life.) Curious that the designer was allowed to gag the KFC products prominently in a scene that appeared in about 1970 - before KFC was born. At that time it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even the justification of what Kentucky Fried Chicken does on Earth in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast-food chains have not arrived in South America until the early 1980s. The House of Ghosts was supposed to be a film event in 1993. Because she was so deeply rooted and slavishly faithful to her vague idea of ​​what the novel represents, Miramax had to be marketed as an art film. As a result, it was neither an event nor an art. And for that, Isabel Allende should push the charges of rape.
