This movie was probably the biggest flight I've ever experienced in filming movies based on IMDb reviews. Overall, I simply found it to be a second-rate movie. Leslie Cheung is certainly an anti-hero, and Ma Wu is able to handle his character with cheerful skills. On the other hand, make-up Ma Wu (facial hair) is so obviously fake that I just could not take him seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed in Halloween, supplemented by $ 4.95 per beard. The special effects were so-so, although the "undead" in the cellar were quite good. The tree language looked like something from the bad film of the 1950s, though the POV shots from the point of view of language were more similar to those of Sam Raimi in the recent Evil Dead trilogy. Pyrotechnics was a horn, and the last battle is almost as boring as you can get. (In fact, it most reminded me of the episode "Lost in Space," where Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and ...). It was not original and was told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no tension and no conspiracy. In fact you know as soon as you are introduced to characters who are good, who is wrong and who survives. I just returned this film to Netflix and then I sat down on Write a review. The first thing I did was check the production date. Yes, he says 1987 ... not 1967 that I thought it might be. And this largely summarizes: Production values ​​and FX are typical for the 1960s. The story and the story seem much older, as Hollywood really produced interesting and demanding movies in the 1960s. <br /> <br />
