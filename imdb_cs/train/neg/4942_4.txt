Every new autumn show deserves at least my "3 bets and you are out". I give the comedy a chance to make me laugh, that is, three complete episodes. After episode 1, I actually said to the television: "Canceled tomorrow." It was bad. Now I've been watching the first four episodes of "Cavemen," and I do not even have to make a grin. It is not tittle, pain, chortle, in fact no face movement at all. I will continue to be punished by watching every future episode, because I am convinced that there is something clearly missing in this show. I just do not "get" it, but I believe that the comedy on the mainstream television network in the prime-time, just has to be funny; but no laughs from me. There is no way ABC would make the least fun comedy of all time at 20:00. I know there must be an inner joke that just is not with my brain. I read each of the previous comments, "I get" a social aspect, but WHERE IS JOKE ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week until I have a lightbulb moment and I will bury my head in the screaming "Eureka".
