This movie had so much potential. Everyone who watched the story of Jeffrey knows that there is so much detail in this movie overlooked, it's ridiculous. Too much time and effort was devoted to the film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where was character development? The origins of every villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where does teenage teenage movies begin to kill and abuse small animals? Instead, we are releasing a dizzying array of flashes that try to explain the origin of the killer, but they can not deal with Dahmer's main point of development. The reason why this country was so interested in this story was the details - how he put the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he had taken to prove it; his cannibalism and the desire for the body etc. I could go on, but the sum, too much backwardness in the film, focused on his sexuality and the lack of gore - the good thing you would expect if the title of the film is "Dahmer".
