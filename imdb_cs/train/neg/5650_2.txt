William Shatner in small doses is acceptable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a slight irritation and in that slightly funny, it was considered appropriate to expand his role and exaggerate it. Just like in the original Star Trek series. I think I never understand American humor, which often goes "over the top" to get a message. I'm voting with my feet. I'm not looking at the show anymore, which is a shame because the rest of the cast was good. It is a shame that Shatner's exaggerated role also influences James Spader's performance. But most demonstrate the way society goes, I think. I do not want to travel the same way. Honest
