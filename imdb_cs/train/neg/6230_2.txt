I was a little interested in this movie as a sad cannibal movie. I was very disappointed. it was the same kind of disappointment, I felt I was looking at "Friday 13: jason manhattan". so many potential losses! <br /> <br /> The introductory scene is a good one. then it stops. rich breasts and immense 80s can not help this movie. The only things that go near this island of cannibal monks are piranha! I'm not asking for a "holibus cannibal" at the level of gore, but I was looking for a cheap super exploiting gore. I had nothing of it. <br /> <br /> I found some parts of the battle scenes somewhat interesting, hence two stars. I do not think it's really worth watching. I could see that it points to a party where nobody cares about what's going on, and you just want something in the background. but I would not say to anyone, "Oh, dude, you see this movie." it is neither good nor bad enough to require much attention.
