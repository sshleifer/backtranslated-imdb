"Town Called Bastard", British and Spanish co-productions, was made on the heels of Clint Eastwood's success in the Italian "Man With No Name" trilogy. The template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors whose career was largely bankrupt and undermining their voices. This film is no exception except that they also used some British actors. <br /> <br /> It's hard to sum up the conspiracy, but here it goes. The story opens with insurgents or whatever, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, who attacks the church and kills everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward to the subject of the city a few years later, where the character of Shaw masquerades as a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not think about righteousness with a pistol. <br /> <br /> Put the mourning widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) into the mix, looking for her husband's killer. Add to that the fact that he is walking around in a cage that lies dead like a coffin, for God knows why. After the Mayor is murdered by his henchman La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is attacked by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (I'm sorry but the name is missing me). The colonel takes over the city and begins to execute city residents for a short time to force them to reveal the identity of the leader. Although they opened the film side by side, it is hard to tell from the dialogue that the Landau and Shaw characters are familiar with each other. The blind man (Fernando Rey) claims to be able to identify the rebel leader by touching his face. It does so and .............................................. < br /> <br /> I'm sure directors regret this movie. It's just terrible and it deserves my dreaded "1" rating. Shaw spends most of the movie fixing his trademark when he looks at someone who is useful. Even Landau can not save this film. Beautiful Mrs. Stevens is totally useless here. When I just made Peckinpah's "Ballad of Cable Battalions" the previous year, I found it strange to appear in this mess of the movie. Savalas made several of these images ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" came to mind) during the period before Kojak. Michael Craig is also somewhere in it as a character called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these 'Western', even though he appeared to play a villain in two French Connection films. Al Lettieri would also appear with the role in "The Godfather" (1972) and continued in other unforgettable roles before his premature death in 1975. In all justice, the version I watched ran only 88 minutes rather than longer operating times of 95 or 97 minutes mentioned on IMDb, but I do not see where it would be another 7 or 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> Avoid this.
