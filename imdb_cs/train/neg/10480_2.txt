It has a great name, but this and you will not have more than it for your money, in fact the first 30-40mins of the movie you can find some funny but the story goes from one side to another with no specific reason and I simply can not understand what going until the action is gone. And yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call her an actor, but I do not think that a way that could be called nothing but overwhelming! .... period. A small child playing as his son has no sense of acting at all, and I believe it was just a favor he did or something like that because he had no idea what he was doing. casting they thought that by throwing the comedians they could do, but they did not! and sometimes tasty cheap humor is so bad, I do not buy it. But let's hope it's as bad as it gets. If you want people to accept these DVDs for good public taste, they will have to offer some food that might work. <br /> <br /> Maka
