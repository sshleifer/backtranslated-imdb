When I saw this film around 1979, it became the first movie I ever left in the middle. There is nothing worse than a comedy that simply lacks fun, and it is always missing me (although I can not talk about the last 25 minutes of the movie). None of the sketches was original. While I like humorous humor where appropriate, these skits are unnecessarily vulgar. What was even more irritating was that the film was advertised as "the first Robin Williams movie," which used its new glory in the television series "Mork and Mindy." But his role turned out to be so tiny that you could not even see him on the screen.
