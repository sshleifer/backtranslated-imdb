God, I'm so bad of those bulls coming from America and saying "Cartoons"! Because the anime has become popular, US animators produce cartoons with five-year-lazy ass style drawing (Kappa Mikey) or some nice Japanese animation. (Usually classic characters are mixed) No wonder the anime beats the American cartoon! <br /> <br /> He will not even try! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about yesterday night; I live in the UK and when I found out that this show was first released in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was so up to date with current shows.
