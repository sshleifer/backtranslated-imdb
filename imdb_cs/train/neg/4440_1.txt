Let me be clear. I've been using IMDb for years. But today I went through the registration process on the spot so I could give the film the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them bad, a few scary. Nevertheless, I have never seen such a contrast of exaggeration and incompetence, with intense intentions and failure. Mira Sorvino is terribly busy as a princess, but she is absolutely incredible as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always a fun character, but the dialogue in the movie is much worse than the insipid French game that is the source (Marivaux has never reached Hollywood and we should hold it). For example, Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, apparently exposed to chemicals from a beaker into a beaker and shouting the names of well-known scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is even stronger. For this, they should receive the "Clair Danes" joint prize, which would be awarded in the fair world for the free anachronistic and inconspicuous re-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as a brother of the nineties (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> In addition to brutal plotting and dialogue, he is trying to put artistic tropes into shooting. For example, there are times when several viewers have disappeared from the perspective of the action, sitting in chairs and looking at the main characters. The director wants us to realize that he has adapted the game. I get it. But it does not even happen until the movie. At that moment, when he looks at the people sitting on the chairs for a moment and then disappearing, he is spooky and disturbing. They're like some creepy crowd of zombies, who appear over the fog, and they are filled with fear. When you see the terrible horror and the song that ends this movie, you'll want to explode your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for gross injustice that you poison your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
