There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews from people who have never done IMDb review before or since. Because of the very low average of the film to other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit it, I thought the concept was a little cute and I was pleased to see that the actresses that played Eve and Harmony on Angel worked but did not last long, known. <br /> <br /> Behavior: The leadership seemed sufficiently competent, but everyone else? It's terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> Do you really think people will laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye candy: OK. in this movie were really beautiful women. Not just the three main female figures, but across the whole area. It was as if the producers were hoping the sceneries would keep viewers so scattered that they would not notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they did not succeed. <br /> <br /> In the right hands it could have been a cute but funny classical camp. It was not even close.
