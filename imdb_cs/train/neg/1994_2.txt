This film, originally released on Christmas 1940, was long lost. The very bad copy reappeared and formed into a CD, now for sale. Do not buy it! The film is ridiculously terrible. Casting is bad, the script is horrible, and direction is scary. Picture of Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the pinnacle. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie was deliberately lost.
