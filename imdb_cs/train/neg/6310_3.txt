I watched this picture last night and was a little disappointed. Many "time facts" have been turned off. At the beginning of the film Grandfather made a comment on this grandson and his friends about how they felt when they attacked 9-11. This film was to be held in 1994. One of his grandson's friends was wearing the Eagles jersey Donovan McNabb. It was not even developed. The story line was good, but the facts and timeliness of the timeframe were so far from the base that the film looked raw. My friend is a passionate reader of books and monuments. I rented the movie, hoping it would be good. It does so. The dog was cute. But the way this movie was made, I was glad I paid only four dollars than to rent it, unlike the 50 that would make me watch him in the theater. I hope that someone who reads it understands that I do not mean any dissatisfaction with those who have fought the war, but the facts and the timeframe should be monitored more closely.
