This time we get a psycho-toy maker named "Joe Petto," which makes live, bad toys that kill people. He goes after a family who has a bad luck just living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "Pino" (again, get it?) He lived. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and hopefully the [last]) in this semifinals, this and the previous look like fine-core movies, but without sex and nudity. It's like a low-cost hybrid "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad domestic movies. Probably in 2000 they started making the sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can all hope it will stay ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star from **** <br /> <br />
