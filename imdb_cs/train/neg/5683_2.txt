From the beginning of the movie, I felt like it was a movie about another Jason of the 13th Friday. And that's ... Tell the movie to be interesting. But as time goes by, his insignificant film about a dim, supernatural, silent serial killer. I think he's under the guy without making any sound that nobody saw. After a failed execution, he was supposed to be blind, but he walks and kills people as usual. I'm tired. It's the same for me. <br /> <br /> In other words - unreal. Too many errors and confusing information. A good scene with a tidal woman looked impressive, but only for the first time:} For this and interesting intro 2 stars.
