This film appears to be starting on Wednesday, representing peripheral players as if it were significant and representing the main characters without any substances and paper thin and / or impenetrable backstage. Almost no one has a credible or distinct motivation for their actions in this film. The plot is exhausted and eventually going nowhere, the dialogue is clumsy and sad and the director has little idea how to get the best from his actors. Almost feels it's the first half of this movie, but it never happened. We have been told that a mysterious pyramid has emerged over New York, and that Central Park has inexplicably become an Arctic desert. It seems, however, that it did not seem to cause significant confusion among the population and it is just a minimal matter for the government. We are presented with "evil society" in Eugene, but it is indeed a true predisposition to the settlement of the universe by a few stinking helpers. The whole "double" eugenic-is-bad is hard and never equals. We should take care of the central characters, but we never know about them, so we know why. So much about this world is inadequately developed or not fully developed, based on 1-hour, 40-minute fatal rationalization for rape. In the "groundbreaking" digital animated world created here, all I can say that at about the same time that this film was shot, several other directors did the same, achieving a seamless and more credible result. After spending the time watching this movie, the worst question in my mind was, "So what?"
