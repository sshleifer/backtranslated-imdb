Ah yez, Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another hideous movie. I was particularly interested in scenes immediately after the crash, where, as survivors were desperately looking for matches, at least half a dozen fires burned? without an obvious reason? in different places of the wreck. Fire seemed to be the predominant theme. They searched corpses for lighters and matches, and eventually found a box that set fire every day, apparently 12, but no one ever got the wood. Then, when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies she used for the acceleration? I think these guys were frozen? maybe not. Despite the apparently low temperature, everything that yeti eats blew. Maybe it's just me, but even in a totally unbelievable history (none of the survivors ever heard of the yeti or the sleazy snowman until the very end), if you take care of little things, bigger agreements will become more acceptable. Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? And a revolver, warm enough to hold in his hand, froze and did not fire. Leave the break. Well, at least we have Carla Pope, another excellent Canadian girl. And with a little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. Well, I could add that the rabbit who ate (even though it looks like a chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now, if it was a squirrel (or a rat), it would be a rodent, but it still looked like a chicken. And the writers have missed a real chance for someone to comment: "It tastes like ..."
