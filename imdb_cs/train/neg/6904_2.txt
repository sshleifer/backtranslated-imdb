It seems to me that as a recent graduate of the film school that in these times of New Zealand's film that reaches new heights, it seems to the general public that every new film in New Zealand seems to be great. Zion's wedding proves it's dead. <br /> <br /> It is totally overestimated and not entertaining and far from the "merry" movie, other IMDb users have commented. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, who became a black guy, but in addition to those jokes, the recycled bulls we heard before. <br /> <br /> He wanted to see how the film will deal with the Polynesian representation. It was a complete ball - I know it's a supposed comedy, but I did not feel that the characters had anything new about the Polynesian identity, though it was in the face. I was the most disappointed end of the film and solving the character's relationship - Mikaele was a player who just crazy with white women, comes to turn a little when she got into the town of "Dusky Maiden", has epiphany that maybe should start to find a stable relationship, then refuses her at the last minute and accepts his position as Polynesia Playboy for women palagi. I do not understand why they did it. Overall, it was very disappointed. My whole family was going to see she expected to have a good laugh but ended up being really hot when I paid her for seeing her in the cinema. Jokes are the most deceptive, especially Sephin's girlfriend, APPALLING, and I'd be honest if I had my hands on one of those pirated copies of the movie to save the ticket price for $ 15 /> <br /> I think the only good the thing that came from the film is that it is the second step (after another, of course, a much better film about this) when Polynesian cinematography was born. I hope the Turkish creators of the future learn from Zion's wedding about how not to reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and meaningful. Even if it's done in a comic way.
