It's getting wrong with the three women who behave like a nice young schoolgirl who sits around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and caramel chocolate for what says the best story of man and then worsens - = - spoiler alert = - = what Andie's character it drops for a young organ player who was her student when she was 14 years old (she is the headmaster of the English school, believe it or not) just to destroy it with her feminine - from the "girlfriend" hell. ... and then from there it's essentially an inconsistent clap: she forgives her "girlfriend" and has a loving baby child organ and the three women end up when they start drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws caramel chocolate out on the street in a sharp attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
