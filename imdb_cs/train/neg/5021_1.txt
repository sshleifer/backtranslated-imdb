This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story was boring, the dialogue was unfortunate and the acting sound. I'm not sure if this film was the result of a home movie school project, but it certainly played as one. It's not even particularly successful in his central conceit, trying to appear as the only non-stop taking. Horizontal cameras are a cheap and non-original way to hide the cuts.
