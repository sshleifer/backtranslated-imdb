"A trio of treasure hunters is looking for hidden wealth in Western India." The golden bait causes increasing tension as men approach the treasure. "Manfish" is the name of their boat, not the monster, and the skeleton that gives the muscular captain John Bromfield (as Brannigan) his half of the treasure is very good, the old salt Victor Jory as a professor) provides the second half of the map.First Lon Chaney Jr. (like Swedish) plays the silly and sexy Tessa Prendergast (like Alita) guarding the rum (not so well, of course) Serious problems with editing and continuity exacerbate the picture that would otherwise > Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
