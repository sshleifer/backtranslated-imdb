A terrible film that includes Canadian actors in the D-Sheet, who seems to be so conscious of being on the camera that their performances are too melodramatic and quite forgotten. This movie is poorly written, poorly dressed, and misdirected. It is disparate, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not good. McDowell does a great job with what's given to him, but it's the only film he's doing - he really has a bad story and a script he's working with. It's not enough camp to be funny. I still have to see that Van Pelleske is acting in a credible way, and even sub-figures like Eisen (with his nasal, curly voice) confirm that we are at a lot in Toronto rather than on a boat from Africa. The director did not see that "creature" looks like a jazz dancer in a strange suit? The struggle between blue lightning bolts and Pelle's orange pieces of "magic" (due to the lack of a better word) is, of course, the result of bad actors, without a choreographer, overlaid with completely derived special effects. Was there even a director on a set or editing room for this catastrophic film (not a good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not waste your time with this, you will regret it as I did it. I have nothing more about this wasting celluloid.
