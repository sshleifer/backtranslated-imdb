Like some of the other people who reviewed this film, I was even more nostalgic than ... before I had the misfortune to really watch it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this movie were completely untrustworthy, and Pauline's dangers are now revealed as embarrassing exercises in banal, racist, and plain boring movies. Even the presence of old pros, Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas, can not overcome the horrific scenario, the terrible thematic song and some miserable "special effects". In addition, the stereotypical representation of African and Arab characters contributes to the painful view, especially since it happened at the moment of the civil rights movement. The original psychotronic encyclopedia by Michael Weldon states that Pauline's dangers were originally made for television, but inexplicably ended and gained theatrical release. According to the results, this is a completely credible (and tricky) scenario.
