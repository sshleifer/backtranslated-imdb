Mysterious Mystery Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever shot, and still keeps its affection in the heart, because the poverty of its special effects and the tremendously terrible soundtrack in the first 15 minutes (and be honest, that's all you need to see ) combine to create something that is happily distributed aside. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the "universe" is almost as overlooked as cinematography, as washing liquids, dialogue. Before you have time to find out if it's you who is crazy, the credits roll and the action is fighting for life. And besides the double plastelin giant worm that terrorizes our heroes, you also get an extra double bonus, that the original actors have voices and dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this type of fare is that I've just seen one copy, so the chance that you'll ever see it is very unlikely. Maybe I own my only existing copy. <br /> <br />
