This is an extremely stupid and little-seen film about slavery in West India and the stars of Puddy from the series "Seinfeld"! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this film and is noticeably slimmer. Oliver Reed got a top-rated bill, but he is not in the movie at all. Warburton is playing a white slave and his fun is seen by all the young and horny women of the rich old men who have tried him because they want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays brothel owner and so much nudity in the movie. If he does not like a orgy on a brothel and then his young women who turn to him. Then, of course, at the end the slaves revolt and there is a bloody situation. No real political message like "Burn", but just another fictional plot that could relocate the story. They made incredible follow-ups and Warburton and all the other players came back! I hope he paid a lot of dough, because this first movie is pretty bad. Nudity is still observable, and Warburton's lack of accent sometimes makes it ridiculous. Very bad movie, but I have to admit I want to see the sequel.
