I apologize for Jean because of such a good original movie that will be followed by perhaps the worst film in her career. This movie was terribly shot by the terrible acting work of Goldbeg (Romeo) and no matter what computer name it was. Also, some scenes could be just a little unknown. Really bad movie.
