I am surprised that everyone (even the critics) thinks it's a good movie. It was the most clich√© thriller I've ever seen. We have that "evil guy" who wants to force "good" (or girl in this case) to do something or face the consequences. The "good girl" in this film has to use her senses and skills to beat the "bad guy" and save the day and her loved ones. You use charisma, bravery and even luck to save your day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert will meet a young man named Jackson Rippner (nice name) at the airport. One coincidence leads to another, and soon it seems as though fate has brought these two together. Share drinks, sit side by side, seemingly all the way ... Is there even more special? Could these two be for each other? Does "fate" have a reason for your strange and random encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turned out, unfortunately, yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him assassinate the Director for Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another to challenge his men. Oh, if she does not, then her father is dead. Though we never know the exact reasons why and who really cares about this madness, Jackson is more explaining how it happens and why it is in his best interest to help. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa defeats his evil plan with her senses, and in his process he is amazed at his neck, causing him to go over a chair and hit him with a hockey stick. And before that, he leads him to the wild pursuit at the Miami airport, where he traverses security and steals a car he uses later to run over a man who was ordered to kill his father. <br /> <br /> First I find it strange that a man like Jackson who can get his hands on high tech weapons needs help from a hotel manager. Could not he just drop a bomb into the building? Would it not be more secure for him and his team by leaving some third parties? And why characters like Jackson also explain everything he wants to do to someone who is in danger? Does it not allow them to be more easily stopped by the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors have done the most because of the movie they have been given. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors who look at it. I also think that Jayma Mays (who played "Cynthia") will be someone we'll see more. It's simply bad that everyone was stuck with it. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
