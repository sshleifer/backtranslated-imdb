writing journalists and requested through an eager unscrupulous press officer and a sobbing grandmother was ham and fake. <br /> <br /> I can not blame the actors, but surely someone has to say, "you joke, I can not say this!" <br /> <br /> This episode had a perspective of print and police perspective, while the police look was standard enough, the printing outlook and characterization have been over-exhausted and points of insulting incredible. <br /> <br /> I noticed that it was HBO production, if so, then perhaps the hammer stereotypes are explained in this light <br /> <br /> During the press conference I was totally hampered. she lacked any credibility and did not tell the truth at a distance. 40 minutes to the first episode and still waiting for the tension. <br /> <br /> Skip five Daysthis. Production 2008/9 with these characters is much better and more tense, even if the crime is above the top. This story had unforgivable moments that can only be described as incredibly unbelievable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the press officer to open a press conference without an examining officer present to deal with press issues. <br /> <br /> so incredible it was like an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Then I started looking for a journalist called "Scoop" and for Perry White to appear. I saw the Hunter of 2009 before "five days" arrived in Australia, did not know it was prequel and was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer is walking again. <br /> <br /> The head is terribly horrible.
