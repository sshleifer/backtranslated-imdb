This grainy film has a culture and one of the word-of-mouth features you just had to see. Perhaps it's hard to believe, but in southwest Arkansas, Fouke is a rural community that knows the legend is true. This story is narrated in a documentary style narrated by Vern Stierman and shot in real places that talk to real people. The legend varies with storytelling, but during the late 1960s and most of the 1970s, the Fouke area visited the large animal that traveled along Boggy Creek. A long hem with three fingers and standing over 7 feet tall, this hairy creature regularly caused damage and scared "bejeebers" from most communities. I personally crossed the small Boggy Creek Bridge in 1974 and yes, the hair on the back of her neck rose. Of course, it was about 1 hour in the rain. By the time I arrived in Shreveport, I laughed.
