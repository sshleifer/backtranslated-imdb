Okay, let me say that I did not expect the film with Jerry Springer to be film gold, I just asked to be cinematic ... and that was not the case. It looked like some bad domestic movies. It is mistaken, scripted and filled at the edge with the nakedness of the most unpleasant people I've ever seen. The film "plot" focuses on a low-income family who has decided to go to the "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss many issues between mother, daughter, foster father, and daughter's fianc√©. From there, the film shoots and develops into a unique experience: pornography with white waste. Is there sex sex, interacting sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to get out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disturbing and degrading. African Americans and the working class of America should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased, but he did not threaten his movie star's effort, it was smart, fun and fun) MY GRADE: F + (the daughter was hot)
