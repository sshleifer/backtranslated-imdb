When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was wrong. This movie was just like any other horror film. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many other movies. But the difference with this and other movies is that the story is a very week. They are bad actors and boring music. The photos are fine, but the rest is a complete shit. You do not see this movie "Horror", go and see Ring 2 or another movie that is much more of a story. I hope they stop doing horror films that have the virus and virus spreading and bringing people to the zombies. We've seen enough. The only good thing in the movie is when it's standing on the roof and shooting famous, infected celebrities.
