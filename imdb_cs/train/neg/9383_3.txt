LOVE FAMILY ........ and I think MORE BAD ... This plot is predictable and it's EALLY cheesy, the creativity of the battle and the dance scene for the time being the only reason I did not give the film is one other than that. .. this is def one film that can afford to watch ..... I feel while watching the movie, the thought behind the movie was interesting that type of clich√© .. .. the land bumpkins land in the city blah blah blah, but i think it could be a bit better if it just was not so crude, very poorly portrayed on the screen idea, I think. The plot is somewhat predictable at times, the dance I can say AT TIMES is pretty good, Break dance pulling the battle was good ..... If you just see the movie and watch the dance scene and create your own dialogue it might be 5 .. lol
