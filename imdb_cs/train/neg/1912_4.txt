There is nothing new. All the standard romantic-comedy scenes, even after a taxi sprinting to the airport to leave the woman. The only thing that saves is Alison Eastwood's acting and some smaller characters (flashing and I miss you, Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the couple is in bliss and you will not have to go through the inevitable pain of conspiracy.
