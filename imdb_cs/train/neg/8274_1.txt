This movie had such a potential! Good cast of quality actors B, Jessica Simpson's thigh and ... that's it! I believe some guy in an unnamed marketing department had some idea. Basically, it will make a movie Legally Blond, but it's in New York. This big clear city of chances, strength and money, and where every heartless, strong / money hungry person is. Add to this Jessica Simpson, a small town bimbo, Owen Wilson's brother and for some obvious reason Andy Dick (you just have to ignore this movie). The story goes: <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the girl for NY, the girl follows, the boy cheats, the girl stays in NY with her cousin, gets the job under a false pretense, throws up, is polite to another boy (brother Wilson) day and kiss. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . One reviewer turned to Guantanamo and I definitely agree with him. This movie is a shock. And I know what you're thinking ... at least at some point I'll see that Simpson is naked or too closed. It will not cost you time and YouTube will. You will have a better sexy time! <br /> <br /> Editing movies is fragile, acting is unbearable and why are they using blue screens? <br /> <br /> At the end; it's a kinematic treachery that should be punished to the maximum <br /> <br /> Another question why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of paternal character in almost all of Jessica Simpson and why there are no blacks, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie ?
