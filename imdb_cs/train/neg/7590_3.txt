Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, demanding dialogue, banal plot. The name of prima donna, Camilla, and the often-named flowers of the same name is enough to remind us of the similarities with the novel by Dumas' novel La Dame aux Camelias, the film Camille playing Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor and last but not least Verdi's opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not very valuable young ladies, social partners for one reason or another loved, parted and reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives banal cries and stupid unrealistic dialogue in the opera but why Hayak, Don Sutherland, the beautiful rendition of Los Angeles in the 1930s, the earthquake deus ex machina, which comfortably kills the other woman and all the beauty in this average Turkey where there is not even a beautiful singing?
