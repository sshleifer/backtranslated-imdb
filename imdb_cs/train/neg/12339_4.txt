This comedy has some bearable things in it, surrounded by lots of unfortunate things. Almost every scene about the castle servants and their stupidity is a waste of time. And plotting is so messy that they are wondering if they have a real script ready before they start filming or they just do everything when they go together. (* 1/2)
