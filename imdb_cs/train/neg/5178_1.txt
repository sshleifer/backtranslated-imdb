I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm up the other people on this huge and very bad film of horror. Do not waste time or money on this movie, acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've ever encountered and the script was just terrible. None of that was good, you finally think why I'm looking at these bullshit. The conspiracy had so many holes in it, and they never got rid of it, it was so bad, I do not know how such a terrible movie could be shot. As I said before, I love horror films and I was so kidnapped, it was 18, but you see little blood and no fears or jumps at all. Also, what made me angry was the stupid things in the movie that had no sense of a story, like kissing my brother and sister, why? is all I can say. Just do not bother, there's a lot more great horror movies, just do not waste time, life is too short.
