This step is about as bad as they are. I was, however, forced to put it 2 for scenery. There are many great footsteps to the southwest, including many in Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the US. It is also, from John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact, one scene with Kris and the girl was shot at a site called John Ford.
