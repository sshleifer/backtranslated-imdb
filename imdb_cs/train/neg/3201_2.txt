Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was in Goldeneye okay and quite good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and appeared in various other films. One thing he can not do is to wear the film as a lead, which is in this extremely bad vengeance movie in Malta. Joe's partner is killed, so he kills the assassin's brother and escorts the assassin to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to go to Malta and the killer flees. The rest of the movie sees Joe Don casting the murderer back and forth, Joe Don takes several times in custody, Joe Don tortured the barrier and was interrupted, and so on. The film is pretty bad and you will not feel exactly like the character of Joe Don. You'll be amazed how many times Joe Don gets a hero pulled in one stroke and how incompetent he turns out to be. The crowning part of the film comes when Joe Don chases a murderer in Malta with a murderer in a priest's dress and then gets into the boat and chases them all over Malta. This movie also contains one of the worst closing lines for ending the movie at all.
