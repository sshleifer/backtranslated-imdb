The Germans think that smirking is funny (just as Americans think that murmuring is sexy and that women with English accents are acting). I had to cross my eyes if the screen was again filled with a huge, narrow smirk. One of those "home-office desktop computer hacks" where she killed the bank by tapping a few random keys on her home PC that was only plugged into an electrical outlet. The director obviously loves a relatively large front lady. I can not say that I share his feelings. It's quite fun here when the whole family is sitting in front of a television that is rushing with ads. This review appears to be one row away, so it's here.
