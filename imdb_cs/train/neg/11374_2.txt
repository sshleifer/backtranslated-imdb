I could not concentrate on this film. I was not able to take an intellectual, emotional or aesthetic look. The dialogue was very dense and uninteresting. I could not get in touch with him so I took care of any of the characters and I find it hard to find out what would be good to say about it. I read that I understand, to know some of the unclear aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that as an atheist I probably do not know much finer details of Catholicism but also I have seen many of the films dealing with religious issues that touched me because their themes are still universal for human conditions and they do not matter Does not matter of expertise or beliefs.
