King Maker is a film about a series of real events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and artistic trends are commendable, the film still does not impress the viewer. Especially very poor. Some actors try hard to keep their tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. The story was too stupid and too stupid to be true, and it seemed more like the history of the lesson. The film could not even capture such royal and century-old air and it looked more like a distorted attempt to create an Asian version of Elizabeth. The final word? Costumes and artistic trends give the film fresh air, but the executions were extremely poor and the actors could not even give the natural explosions of emotion. In short, the film looked more like a hullabaloo than a script.
