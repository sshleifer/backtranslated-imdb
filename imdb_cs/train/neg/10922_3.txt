It is worse than the rating given. It's a typical SciFi movie nowadays: bad to terrible acting, a script that's badly written and wrong. From the opening scene where DeMille buries his band to the end, this movie is terrible. In the early stages of the screenplay, Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the film DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) overlooking a guy who buries a box in the sand. Those characters, which were meant to represent the three icons above, were terrible and had to resemble the people who were supposed to be "supposedly" to be. The fact that it is in the desert of civilization is cheerful when someone is injured and everyone screaming for an ambulance. The screenwriter is obviously unaware of the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to shoot a film of such a low quality.
