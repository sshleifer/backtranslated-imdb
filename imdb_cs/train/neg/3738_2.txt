Such a title should be the same. <br /> <br /> This movie combines weapons, explosives and ruthless killing to create one flop of action movie. Let me express my opinion on a number of questions: deal-type answers. <br /> <br /> What happens in the movie? People are dying. <br /> <br /> Is it so? Yes. What is a plot? What's going on? <br /> <br /> What is the point the movie is trying to do? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are the characters? Extremely flawed and opposed to their personalities. Is this movie something good? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras when shooting. If you like constant killing and greed, then look at the movie. If you are accidentally denied such low-level "fun" then "Man Made" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To summarize, the plotline smells, the characters are not worth it, the plot is completely resistable, and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: actors, directors and anyone who helped make this movie are definitely not "Made".
