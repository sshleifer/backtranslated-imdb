Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are simply glorified. Their scenes were probably filmed in about a day. Whatever their motives for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, you should make better use of it. For me, it is a sign of the wrong direction. The fence itself was not that bad. And the acting from most actors was above average. Kuba Gooding Jr. it was terrible. It was so incredible that I almost laughed out of my dramatic scenes. And because it was a serious movie that can not be a good thing. Action scenes were not bad, but they missed such a special punch to make them more interesting. Again, a better direction was needed. As with such a film, there was also bad stimulation. The main character was almost half an hour before it came into action. For action thriller just 90 minutes, which is too slow. The only redemption is Angie Harmon. He's trying to make it work. It's a shame that the director let her hang. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as the director who pulled him out. And for the event coordinator / bit of your caliber, you would expect at least another exciting action scene. Do not waste time with this. Avoid!
