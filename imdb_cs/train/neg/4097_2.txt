The bad news is that it's really terrible. I gave it 2 because sometimes it seems that some of this parody kitchy slapstick look funny. It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker" and progress should be rewarded. Or I drank hard when I watched it and felt generous. Whatever it is, "2" it is. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's pretty fast. He takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II's key themes and fights with scenes, packs them, fools them, makes dialogue, and exhausts the whole mess of an hour of really horrific amateur video. <br /> <br /> You would most likely smoke a lot of something powerful if you enjoyed it. And get this DVD back to the video store in time! You will really hate it if you have to pay a late fee.
