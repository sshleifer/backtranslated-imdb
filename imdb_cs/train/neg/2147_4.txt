The original is a relaxing watch with some really unforgettable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, even if the worst of the DTV continues, is totally lacking in sparkle. The biggest disappointment is the lack of a story. Like Belle's magical world, characters are narrated through a series of vignettes. The magical world, though marginally better, can still cope with the story. Among the vignettes, we see the mice at work, and I personally think that they are the enchanting merits of this film. The first mark is best about how to get used to Cinderella being a princess. That's best because the mice were in their funniest here. The worst of the vignettes when Jaq turns into a man is sometimes cute but lacking in imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasie falls in love, was also cute. The problem was that I could not imagine Anastasie being friendly with Cinderella because I considered her the most powerful of the servants. It was also confused by the rather funny subplot about Lucifer, who fell in love with Pomp. Random music was very nice, but she listened to the songs, it was really inspirational and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired the original melody. <br /> <br /> The characters were the most powerful development here. Cinderella still cared, lost her sincerity and much of her spell from the original, even though she is wearing very nice clothes. The Duke had some really fun moments, but they were not enough to save the film, just like Prudence and the King. As I mentioned, the mice were the redemption of the film's merits because they only contributed to the cuteness of the film. I have to say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the vocal performance was surprisingly good. Overall, a cute, though non-original, sequel that was ruined by songs and a lack of story. 4/10 for mice, voice acting, animations and some pretty dresses. Bethany Cox
