I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Fine cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only make a film by then. I was hoping to return to Hero, but it's a lot, much worse. This movie is why kung fu films have a bad reputation in the first place. No credible characters (even in the cartoon world of kung-fu film, these characters are ridiculous), practically no plot and ridiculous plot stories. This movie is so boring and so frustrating as it reminds you of trying to play the game to trust the child. Every time you think your stupid battle makes some sense, it makes up another ridiculous twist that does not make sense ("Ah ha, you think you got me with my super power and 10,000 ray guns but I ate with plutonium vitamin and teflon, so your razor weapons do not work and I'm invulnerable to your super powers ... click to hit any shop back to infinity PLUS one. ") Children can continue this lighting because they really do not care if someone is listening, because they have fun time. However, for the viewer, especially for an adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a bad gas match. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note for kung fu film maker, (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts, if you are not on PCP, in that case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on the back that has a knife inside it will be more pain and will cause more damage if it is not (c) if you get knocked in the heart by a knife, you die, especially in the old Chinatown where there is no corner of Kaiser Permanente, d) kung fights do not last for hours, while 3 (e) sometimes cost you to explain your characters and their motivation. In any case, go to the hero again, because at least in his little world it is understandable.
