The anxious mouse and lullaby really got me and really had nothing to do with the story ... It's something I'd do in my first year at a movie school. Very sad. In addition, the story seemed to go away for no apparent reason ... there were too many things that had nothing to do with the story, which led me to the fact that the creative team did not know what to do or just that should be shorter ... which would be a blessing, not a crime. As I watched all the episodes until this point last week ... I have to say that this is by far the worst and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this.
