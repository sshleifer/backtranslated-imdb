This film swallowed plain and simple. Okay, so it's basically a girl who rapes, and to get revenge, she gets another guy to rape. The bully is a shower, but it is partly the fault of the girl's victim. I mean, they both get in the mood and start kissing, but when the rapist tries sex with her, she will not let her rape her. And the thing is that the rape scene for a girl is very short, and in fact it does not expose or show anything, but when it comes to rape the rapist, it's a pretty long scene of rape. There's nothing in the story that's worth seeing. 3.2 / 10
