When I saw the story of this movie in the cinema, I thought it was an original concept for the thriller who set it up in the competing world of computing. The entire cast star was another news that this movie would probably be good. But when I did not see it in the first week of release, then it disappeared at week 2, I was afraid there was something missing. I patiently expected it to be a DVD release, then bought it rushing home for a nice evening viewing. The anticipation on the way home was much better than the movie. The beginning of the direction is scary. It does not seem to matter at all and the director is for himself, so he can appear in the movie. I'm not going to hire him in the future. Secondly, the lead role is quite miscast like Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is usually a cool figure in the cruel intentions and the way of the pistol, but in this he has to be the bumpy hero he's trying to slip by while running and having friends, but he just does not look right. Female stars Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani do not have enough but when none of the performances are the best. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in the role that could be done to him, and that's his fiery mood and mysterious ways to drag the film. The ultimate point is that this movie is another movie that fills the trailer with scenes you can not see in the movie, and instead it only appears in the section of the released DVD scenes. It is even more disappointing, because even if some of these scenes are rough, they fill important gaps in history.
