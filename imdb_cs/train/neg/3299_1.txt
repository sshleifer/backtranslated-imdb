It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Actually, I was expecting a bad movie, but I was surprised to believe it or not. The story is traditional, all clich√©s are included. The dialogue is so badly written that you are actually laughing when other actors from half originally trying to actually master the sound. The picture is not very good, the music is so malicious that it really made me angry, the actors did not even try, otherwise the script makes it almost impossible that you could expect more from people who have been playing for 30 years, and so called Action Scenes can really miss the action itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these types of bad films are still coming, who finances this shit? Where is screening? And why are actors appearing on this scene an impossible scenario? There are millions of movies in this genre without any effort to reach the theater, but even what happens to Straight To Video really can look professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive about this except the title that explains it all, I feel steal for 2 hours of my life.
