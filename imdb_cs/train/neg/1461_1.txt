I saw the movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, a man who unfortunately tries to be Hitler. The film lies, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene Hitler hit the guy with his pistol. Hitler never attacked anyone, he would not have fisted with humans, but with the fists of the soldiers. Understand?? The other thing is: It's too obvious that Hitler was evil, he was much smarter than he did in this movie. No German would accept him as a leader because he sees it as evil. So the real Hitler did not show his evil side to the people. Some of you Yankees watched the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? this is a great movie with amazing actors. And his German film. I think this subject of Nazi Germany should not be realized as a film of people who know nothing about Germany. People! Watch Der Untergang: <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It is a great movie about a very sad period for people around the world.
