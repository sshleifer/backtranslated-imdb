The previous comments encouraged me to check it out when it came to TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great but he does not get enough time on the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play well-known but promising characters, but the script leaves them stuck. The film revolves around the ego character of Lee Tracy, who is at best a sovereign, physically and verbally abusive jerk. The reactions of the "public" are ill-thought and unbelievable, so "shenanigans" seems to be a disorder of a bad writer. And it suffers from the credibility that the Lupe Velez figure might fall for him. "Stinging one-liners" mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer because I did not even notice that the attempt was made.
