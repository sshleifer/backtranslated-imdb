I'm a big fan of Mr. Rama Gopal Varie, but I could not believe he shot this movie. I was really disappointed. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag is nowhere near the real Sholaya. It does not leave the viewer a lasting impression. Ram Gopal Varma can not create chemistry between the signs. There is no friendship between Heer (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Paradise). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. Sequence outside of the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanal is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not make this film. Ajay and Sushmita dream tried best but did not use it. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather unnecessary. Mohanlal had done justice, and proved again that acting was about facial expression and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectations. The comedy of a situation that has been adapted from the original shooter has accidentally disintegrated in this film. Ram Gopal Varma was able to work on the script, but because of the controversy surrounding the film he took hold of himself and only for his efforts to do this Aag. But there is no fire.
