I went to this film and expected it to be really terrible. And that was it. I really apologized for star cast - Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before making this film - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were as usual disappointed, but Miranda Richardson could not put on one of the fabulous performances I know and love. Fred's father, who played Trevor Peacock (from the vicar of Dibley's glory, among others), had about one line. The plot was predictable and everywhere, and the humor was ... missing. (However, there was one part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family ... it made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) You do not see this movie if your only other alternative is to have a head-on collision with the train in fact - maybe a train would be better ...)
