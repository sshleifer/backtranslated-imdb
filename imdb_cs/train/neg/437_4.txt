(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie when I heard it was smart and funny. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. The idea of ​​the film would be acceptable: it depicts the way a relationship develops between man and woman, all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What did not want the whole movie was two things. First, the film was so down to earth that it looked as if it were describing the problems that a couple had to solve in a single day - nowadays it has become common and boring. <br /> <br /> Second, the overall mood of production, with dialogues that were barely understandable. <br />
