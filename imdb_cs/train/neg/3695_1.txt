It's not the best of the movies. The director focused on the star of the cast actor rather than giving a good entertainer. The hero can be alone, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But it certainly does not cost a neutral audience. Combat sequences are a complete comedy. Dance moves in song sequences is pathetic. Music is average. This movie was the biggest flop for the actors. In spite of an exaggerated movie, the film was unfortunately disappointed. Do not even think to follow this step, even if you want to kill time. You can look at some artwork instead. A good movie buff can not spend this crap for 2Â½ hours.
