I do not think any player in Hollywood history has lasted as long as David Niven gave most of the weak movies he had to wear because of his incredible charm. He could act for Oskar, but most of the material he did was as light as one layer of two-layered tissue paper. Happy Go Lovely is the case. It's a musical, and for the most part you remember the Vera-Ellen dance. You will remember that they are in Scottish costume because the film is based in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can remember one piece of it, you need to have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> Scatter is light. Vera-Ellen is an American lead in a musical that apparently goes outside the city to Edinburgh. It begins in the church and runs late one day. He will get a lift from the chauffeur of a million congratulatory kings. Everyone now assumes that this is the main thrust of a millionaire. The door opens because they have never opened before. The millionaire is David Niven who goes with him and the various situations that caused the mistake. Cesar Romero has some good moments as a shameful producer of this musical work. Eventually, however, Happy Go Lovely is a light and harmless flute that David Niven has done so much and was so tired.
