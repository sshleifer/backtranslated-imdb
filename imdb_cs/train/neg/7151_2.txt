I'm proud to see all three Fast and Furious movies. The fact that the parcels are somewhat stupid and may be a bit hilarious, but I love them when I chase them for cars and all the beautiful cars and secret midnight races. And I like to see the fourth one. I want to know what's the difference between the three and Redline? Dignified acting, somewhat thoughtful plot, even though they are potboilers and last but not least, directors who have all the clues. All three were made by highly competent directors, all of them taking films in a different direction, equally exciting. The joy seems that the producer chose the twelve women he slept with on the cast couch and made them extra, then he raised his lead from the Hollywood unemployment line.And the script.Yikes.Its the mystery of science theater 3000 bad.This is 70's for TV movie bad . Yeah, the movie had some cool cars, but you really do not notice that many in action, and the action is directed so badly that you can not be excited about persecution, d if cars are not exciting, why go to a movie like this? I'm in the audience with a bunch of teenagers and I can not laugh loudly. I got a dirty look, but it was just a debacle. <br /> <br /> Rent F & F movies. Go to Nascar Race. Go karting and race yourself. No matter what you do, avoid Redline as a bad cheese.
