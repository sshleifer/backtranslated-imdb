This movie is just bad. It's not even very attentive to talk to her. The crazy professor is just annoying. Even the suspension of mistrust that allows invisibility (which I like to do because of good bad movies) and allowing extremely stupid victims in horror film, this film asks even more than that. If you are looking for shower scenes for women's wardrobes and random sex meetings, you get porn if you are looking for a good movie, get something else. If you just want to waste time on an unpleasant bad movie, borrow it.
