This short spoof is on the Elite Millennium Edition DVD "Night of the Living Dead". Good thing, because I would never make a tad of my way to see it. Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In performance, it's another thing. These little moments did not make me laugh at all. I never thought I was going to say it, but "Night of the Dawn of the Dawn of the Dawn of the Bride's Return of Terror Revenge, mutant, alien, body eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D" was a much better parody and not so as chaff or boring. My rating: F
