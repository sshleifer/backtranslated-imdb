This is a kind of movie that looks in gape-jawed, terrified silence, and yet keep watching, fascinated as if watching the wreck wreck slowly. And yet, in the back of your mind, thoughts sparkle: "Who on Earth is lit green this waste?" Some of the previous user comments say things like "A good way to introduce kids to Laurel and Hardy" - insulting children everywhere. The fact that children will need some educational plan to learn how to love a slapstick comedy shows a deep misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others commented on the fidelity of the characterization of the two stars Laurel and Hardy, to which I would answer: So CO? One would think the BOMBS rash based on beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) would teach Hollywood that there are some things that can not be re-created. Laurel and Hardy's films are available on the video: Why bother? As for F. Murraya Abraham, a good actor of the scene and screen ... well, just say he had to have trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not go away from the television if this garbage appears!
