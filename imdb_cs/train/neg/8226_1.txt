Since many horror films are based on the premise that one or more central characters do something stupid during the event, the girls in this film will collect gold, silver and bronze at the Darwin Awards. A baboon with a mental disability would make better choices than if he did, and during that would scream less. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a grainy image, a deliberately amateur camera (my 92 year old grandmother has a better video camera), extremely bad sound and no recognizable plot / narrative, then it's your ideal movie. Also keep in mind that you should enjoy the following: Women for no reason scream, women wailing for no reason. In fact, the reason and logic of this film do not appear too much. For example: "We need to find Stephanie" "Yeah, I can not believe I talked to her like last night," "Did she call you last night?" "Yeah, she wanted to talk about a date when she asked her." "Why did not she tell me?" As with our friend, he is pursued by a serial killer with a shotgun and a series of weapons, but I have a problem not telling her he's dating. <br /> <br /> Well, so the budget is low. This does not mean you should look like it will cost half the budget. "Score" is interesting because all - except for one - track were written and performed by writers / filmmakers. In fact, it seems that the entire budget has been blown off to sample The Duskfall, the death metal band from Sweden. The most worrying of all in the film is the end that leaves us with the possibility of continuing.
