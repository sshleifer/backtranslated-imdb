Okay, I got it. We must be horrified. The idea was set. The girl is doing her father and doing photos of it. Call me over the shock-rock genre, but I'm calling for an explicit specification of an act before I can fall. But do not expect me to look at soft porn and scare you to "do your father" ... I mean, this convention is slightly abused in the adult movie industry, which has already penetrated the "rape and harassment" porno. Horror is not what your mind could make you mad to believe. That's actually in the movie. This is where Miike fails in visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it happens that you choose your own adventure.
