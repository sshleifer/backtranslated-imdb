This movie is terrible. Bad behavior, bad writing, bad music. It's scary. It's not just an incredibly poor representation of role-playing games, but the key elements of the movie are badly done. May God, whom I do not believe, has mercy on the soul of the poor, who have begun and have created this abomination.
