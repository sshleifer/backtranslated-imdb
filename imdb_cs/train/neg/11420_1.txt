St. Elm's fire does not have any impact on life after the university (most of us ordinary people alike). Why was this garbage even made? Who can really join? Who lives like these characters? I'm really sorry that the actors had to deal with such a terrible scenario. In this "film" are some talented young actors who have done a good job elsewhere. It had to be just one whole joke on them on the set. Actually, I found this "movie" that offended my intelligence. The only joy I have gained from this is to hope Sir John Hughes laughed well when he saw a screening of that same year his masterpiece from The Breakfast Club was released. <br /> <br /> The same error I've been watching because you like 80 movies. It really is an offensive genre.
