Because of the American writer of American writers in 1988, they had to shoot this episode in three days. It's a lot of crap, consisting of repeated cuts and glued clips from Season 2 and described by Maurice Hurley as "terrible, terrible." <br /> <br /> Why manufacturers can not just wait to shoot something decent, who knows. I'm guessing that because of the strike the production got out of money and could only release a flash episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to veto this half. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.
