I went to look at it in the hope that some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment. Once I realized I was not going to get it, I watched it as a pretty well filmed movie (when it came to shooting and yeah ... it was). in addition to having a good film quality, since I watched grainy movies all day, there was nothing good about the movie. He killed 42. Why was Tweedle Dee and Dum playing Mudler and Scully, Serisouly, Who can answer that? Who can answer something horrible about this movie. <br /> <br /> I agree with who said it was just one big long inner joke for employees. it seemed to be. Poor Mr. Carroll. I'm so sorry that somebody's done their wonderful stories.
