I saw this movie about 5 years ago and the memory of it still haunts me. I was fully aware of how terrible it was, and so I got so much blame. But like most, I did not believe in all the negativity. As a fan of Sandler, it seemed incomprehensible that one of his films might be so bad. I thought it was just Sandler's hatred. I could not be worse. What we have here is a comedy that does not contain a single second of fun. This is actually quite a success. You think that in a 90-minute comedy, maybe they would come across something that would be fun too. No, it's terrible. It's not "so bad that it's good", it's just bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can just cry. You are patiently waiting for a joke that at least smiled at you, but you never come. Did you see the movie The Ring? Where do people watch a videotape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on a videotape, people would die immediately with their own hands and smile on their faces as they realized that their pain was over, and that would be the first smile since they squeezed the game. > <br /> You might want to watch to see how bad it is and not be able to restrict your curiosity. No. Please no. Trust me, I'll make you a favor. There are two types of people in the world, those who think they are going overboard are the worst movie ever shot and those they have not seen before.
