"Attack of Murder Tomatoes" consists mainly of tiny, poorly assembled shots in the search for a movie. The story has no meaning, and the different characters are inserted and lost from the picture without explanation at all. Watching this silly spoof you get a feeling that has captured so many other comments: it's easy to create a low-quality, low-quality film and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its lasses and a low quality one scene, women swimmers are terrified of tomatoes are floating in their vicinity, how far can a "pause of unbelief" go - even in a parody?). The title track is great. (* 1/2)
