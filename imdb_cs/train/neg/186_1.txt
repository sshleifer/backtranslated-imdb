I did not know whether to laugh or cry about what had become a deceptive history of Canadian history, especially as a result of the mistreatment of the history of the Mounted Police in Yukon. I leave it to Pierre Berton, the historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon and the author of the definitive history of Klondike gold rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899, to express my indignation with this stupid film: <br /> <br / > The American thought of an unbreakable border, suppressed by individual heroes armed with six cannons, continued in the Parish Country, another story about a cowboy from the American West - this time Wyoming - who drove his herd of cattle to the golden land. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real mismatch is the main prerequisite on which the plot turns? that at the time of the golden rush there was only one policeman in the entire Canadian Yukon, and that he could not deal with injustice. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach Yukon border with their cattle, the hut is empty. "Where is the cop? "Brennan asks for a Greek problem, with bugs," somebody said, "It's really hard work, the policeman, patrolling about ten or twenty thousand square miles, sometimes not home for two to three months at a time." The historical truth is that the Yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to the police state that British North America had ever seen The Northwest Attacked Police were placed in the territory long before the Klondike strike in the territory They were running every route to the Yukon and were not bothered by the customs, they made their laws on the site of river navigation and returned the men back if they did not have enough supplies or if they just looked bad In the true Canadian form they set moral laws for the community In Dawson the law of the Lord's days was strictly adhered to: who would be fined to cut off on Sunday and crazy young women were arrested for what the field police called "giving strange performances to the theater", in general, nothing but suggestive dancing on the stage in over-revealing stockings. In such a community, the gun was unthinkable. One notorious bad guy from Tombstone, who tried to pack a gun on his side, was personally disarmed by a young guard who had just driven him out of the lounge for an angry crime to speak too loudly. The evil man left as a lamb, but he protested when the policeman, when he found himself carrying a gun, told him to hand him over. "None of my guy ever took a gun," said the American. "Well, I take it," he said gently, without further resistance. So many revolvers have been confiscated in Dawson for being auctioned by the police for a mere dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the fireplace. In 1898, a great year of parachute was not a serious crime there? let's murder ?? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the US side, which was a lawless city governed by Soapy Smith, a denver trust man, was remarkable. But in Far Country is Dawson seen as a community without any law that smells the character of Smith from Skagway? is he named Gannon in the picture? can be easily controlled. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border confiscated all his equipment and was once again hurled by a police officer). <br /> <br /> {In the film, lonely Mountie says, "Yes, I am a law, I represent the law in Yukon, about fifty thousand square kilometers." <br /> <br /> "So why are not you?" <br /> <br /> <br /> "Because yesterday it was wild, we did not expect you to have thousands of people in it." "Now that you are here, we will protect you." "When?" <br /> <br /> "Dawson will become a place in early May. <br /> <br />" What happens between May and May? "<br /> <br />" Partially. <br /> <br /> "What about the rest of the time? "<br /> <br />" Choose a good man. to act as a marshal? "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> but Stewart plays the role of Loner, who carries the number one, and so another man is elected, and he does it, the others are shot, even Walter Brennan is shot, and Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he has to end all the shooting with his own gunfight, he's staring at the target star and he and those, Gannon, defy each other in the inevitable western climax.With anyone with the later knowledge of the Canadian North, this bald repetition story goes through rational faith. > <br /> Excerpt from Hollywood, Canada Pierre Berton, 1975.
