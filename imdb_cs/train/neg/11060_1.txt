It could have been a morbidly fascinating insight into the life of one of America's most popular serial killers, but unfortunately it does not even work. Strange editing, direction, bad behavior, you name it. This movie is literally about ten minutes of a schedule spread over 100. The only redeemed quality is Bruce Davidson as a father, but it's not enough to save this glowing. A 1 out of 10.
