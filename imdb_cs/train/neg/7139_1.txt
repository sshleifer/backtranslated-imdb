Redline is a knockout of Fast & Furious, without any redeemed qualities. You do not have to have a tangled plot with some twists and surprises, but it NEEDS SOME! This is the equivalent of porn, where the story and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and end of the end. Besides, it's worse because you have no money. Mind-numbingly boring, impossible racing sequences and terrible waste of precious beautiful cars that almost gain negative points for appearing in this movie. Sure, she's hot, but who's desperate for the woman on the screen? I feel that the director sat with a full dialogue and drawing hat and knocked eight balls every time the scenes changed. No serious person who races or knows anything about him would watch this movie and enjoy racing scenes.
