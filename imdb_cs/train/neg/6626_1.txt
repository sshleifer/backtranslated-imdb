I saw the movie and I got into the shit because the movie was stupid and boring. I thought the gopal varma ram would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie was upset and spoiled "sholay". cast and crew was bad. the whole theater was asleep while watching the movie, some people escaped in the middle. amithab bachan acting is poor, I thought this movie would be the biggest hit of the year, but this movie will be the biggest flop of the year, for sure. no one did justice to their work, including Ajay devagan. this movie does not deserve any audience. I bet that this movie will flop. <br /> <br /> "Finally, this movie is listening to"
