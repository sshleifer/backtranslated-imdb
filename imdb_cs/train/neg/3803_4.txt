The film seems disjointed and generally poorly written. The script moves as if it were written by 10 different people and none of them remembered with us. They obviously wanted to take the Miracle on 34th Street (original), but it's so bad that the movie breaks down. This film is only for very young, and even they will see the fact that the person who wrote it knows nothing about baseball. For example: <br /> <br /> ?? When the angels are dying for the last time, the owner does not seem to care about him, nor does he bother with the fact that his manager just got into the fight with his jug? NA MOUND? or that he has evaluated a team play within the television. However, when the team is one game since the victory in the division, he gets bent over the story (coming in 6 years) that the manager gets help from a boy who claims to see real angels. What sounds worse? Loss of violence outside the control manager, whose team lost 15 in a row? Or the winning coach on the brink of a playoff, which acts a bit eccentric and helps to support children? The owner's reaction has no point. And he moved to change the minds of Maggie and her "right from the clich√© of the country" during a press conference. Angels should play in the division in the final weekend series against White Sox, but at the end of the game, the allies still say that the Angels have "won". "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> ) is in the ninth bout worth 156 balls in a low-scoring ball game, typically in low-point games, the number of pitches is much lower than that usually around 80-90 playgrounds. "AL" Angel says at the end "the championship must be won alone "Although he and his angels manipulated and fixed games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on because there are a number of other examples where the story is misspelled. <br / > <br /> For younger children (up to 10 years) this movie may be fun, it's too bad, it could be a classic, it's upset and it's a forgettable mess that will live forever like a UHF / cableSaturday morning washing.
