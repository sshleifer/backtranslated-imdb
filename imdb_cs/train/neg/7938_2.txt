The family, looking for some old road attractions to get into the books in the father's coffeehouse, encounters an old, dilapidated old scene run by an eccentric one-man man. When their family van falls apart after leaving the party, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp, which was a prison area ten years ago. <br /> <br /> In the movie 'A strange scary scam, starting from the beloved' Freaks' (1932) from Toda Browning to the merry Freaked (1993) Alex Winter. These are both classics (or soon they will be with "Freaked"). "Side Sho", however, will never be. And if it ever gets into a classical state. . . Well, it will be a clear clue to the sad state of our genre. From the extremely bad introductory song for a 17-year-old daughter who is apparently older than her natural mother, this movie did not have much to do with it. The scripture was written, but not quite horrible. . . just boring. The direction was bad and the rare freak effects were pretty terrible and unbelievable. It was horror and casting was even worse. Anyone who believes the age of these two adolescents in a camp should not long meet a teenager. There was far from enough gore and violence to cope with the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was a little violence, it was not done well. And I can not forget the final battle scenes that were the worst of the kind I've ever seen in the movie. Overall, it's an easily forgotten and badly made horror movie that deserves to stay alone on the bottom of the dollar. Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
