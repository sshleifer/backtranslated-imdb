what ultimately kills this film is its self-confidence, among other things. here is a short list: 1. unfair behavior. when beatles got in and injected their brand of "unpredictable" behavior / humor, she was greeted as fresh. it was more than forty years ago. to get over it. <br /> <br /> 2. Fake sophistication. an exhaustive base, quasi-sociological political isms are hard trying to do comical work. ask Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> 3rd Postmodern "I'm in this fake world hard and yes, I recognize it in myself" snake eating alone - used as an illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - is such a protector. <br /> <br /> 4. Deceptive, complacent drollness. <br /> <br /> 5. Amateur writing, acting, direction ... ever seen student movies? a sacrifice on my own, the only thing I can say positive about it is that it has at least a feeling of self and heesh, now I'm going to capture a self-reflexive thing she thinks useful, valuable. <br /> <br /> But towards ... what? in the end it only rings like hollow like any other challenging piece - hello, ever saw Woody Allen take bergman, ie: "Interiors" ??? Well, this is a lot more fun.
