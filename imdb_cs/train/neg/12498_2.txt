This film has the core of a really good story. Work by men and women Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is part of heroes and legends. This film radiates a good story with three ends (no match), a few unnecessary and unnecessary bar fight, and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have so many sparks as a dead campfire. The rescue scenes are great - although the generation of computers is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand is working (looking at it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female figures are one-dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and is in the camera for about two minutes in the whole movie. It could be a great movie - and Costner needs it!
