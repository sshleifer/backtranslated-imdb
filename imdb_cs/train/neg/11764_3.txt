I have to say that I really look forward to watching this film and finding a new life in it that would separate it from most boring and exaggerated Mexican films. I have no idea why I relied on Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas, to bring freshness and confidence to our non-existent sector. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I listened to before I saw the movie) sounded differently than others, perhaps because she dared to include new faces (except Demian Bichir, who is always popular with Mexican directors) in her screenplay with modern social behavior, perhaps because the photo I saw in the trailers was a clear and realistic place for theater. The film proved to be a big crowd of crowds and great disappointment. What Serrano really deals with is a very old-fashioned "gender battle", like "all men are the same" and "why are all women ..." blah blah blah. There is nothing new, that it uses so many common land and clich√©s that it ultimately mocks itself without leaving a valuable reflection on the condition of a woman / man. I'm full of the usual crowd in the audience, such as the safe gangs about the cliques I talked about earlier (always work, always) and screaming performances (in this context, it's a good movie) and scream I mean literally. The top-class characters, played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir, Serrano appear to be more hilarious. I totally disagree with Serran, they should not just treat him as puppets for his hour to get ... assured that we got his message and completely destroyed their roles, which were the only solid foundation, the story could stand . Anyway it's still a very fun movie and you'll probably have a good time seeing it (if you accept it being manipulated by it).
