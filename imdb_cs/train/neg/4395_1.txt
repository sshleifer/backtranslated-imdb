December holiday specials, as well as original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy but carefree storyline. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound and feel ... well, "strange" and they should have a decent and appropriate subtext for the holidays in December. So when I saw Legend of Frosty Snowman on TV I got my kids (6 and 8) to tell me this story telling me about the original frosty and passionately related to how much I enjoyed it as a child. When my wife and children chill on the sofa to watch the movie, the expectations were high, but after 10 minutes my children were yawning, and my wife and I gave each other a "look" and raised their eyes. After 35 minutes, my children actually asked to go to bed - I think they are soiled with insensitive language and unnecessary disconnected segments. I was really embarrassed with their (and my) disappointment with this film. Unfortunately, the legend of a snowy snowman is more like a bad episode of relatively strange parents overcome by a worse than a normal episode of Sponge Bob than a classic holiday film. Do not get me wrong ... these shows are fine and I like them just like another guy, but when I look at rather odd parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for average, out of color, zero subtext, emotional episode mind) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We picked some good books and spent the whole evening together. It's a much better choice than an embarrassing bad Legend about a chilly snowman.
