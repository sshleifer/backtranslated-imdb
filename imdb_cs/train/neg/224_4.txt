The worst thing about Crusha is not that it worked badly, or that the story is virtually non-existent, and it's not even so bad that camera work could be better. No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a couple of absolutely brilliant moments that will keep you in the hopes of coming more. <br /> <br /> But in the end it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and cheaper scenes with tearjerking of 40+ women who cry and hug and talk about babies and marriages - then in any case, do not miss. <br /> <br /> I'm not exactly excited about seeing the things listed above in the movie and, as a result, I had a pretty awful time. Several absolutely brilliant jokes can not compensate for the rest. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 4/10. Guilty waste time. <br /> <br />
