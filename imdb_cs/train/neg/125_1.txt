If you just want to avoid making this type of movie in the future. This movie is interesting as an experiment, but it does not tell a story. <br /> <br /> You could feel a virtue when sitting because it touches so many important questions but it does without any recognizable motif. The viewer is gone without new perspectives (if no one comes with a man while his mind is wandering as it will take during this insignificant film). One could spend more time by staring at the window growing tree. <br /> <br />
