I am thinking of the great epic of the American Revolutionary War. It is not. (And it was not Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT, but I turned.) I saw this movie on screening ads for old MGM studios (now Sony) just before they left. The audience had high expectations for this precious period, written by veteran Robert Dillon, director of the acclaimed Hugh Hudson (CHARIOTS OF FIRE Glory), and Al Pacino in the lead. <br /> <br /> Long before people begin to pamper themselves in their places, whispering rumbling comments about the terrible misunderstanding of Pacino - it was an American border of Scottish origin (!) - and Nastassj Kinski, who was to be recently emigrated from England (!!). Then the story started and everything went quickly. <br /> <br /> The motivations were confused, the dialogue was terrible, the events had no historical or political context. What was there that the plot emerged in an absurd accident; the second or third time that the alleged lovers, Pacino and Kinski, came across, became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland made an unheded performance as a British officer / pederast. His accent was all over the map. I think there was no English act available. <br /> <br /> Many people left. Those who stayed tried to suppress the giggle, then scrambled openly. I caught it - I think at least the battle could be good. I was wrong. Hudson has inexplicably decided to shoot them with hand-held cameras, not even Steadicam, a blather that has brought a bad atmosphere of authenticity that destroys the sense of scale. audience few lines ahead: (late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could say he was overwhelmed by the behavior of others. And surely, on his television segment he gave the next day the movie "10" on his notorious "Franklin's scale of 1 to 10," while curiously commenting on puppets who had broken the projection the night before, I did not know the art when they saw it. What is the doubt? After this disaster, Pacino did not play in the film for nearly four years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can not say I warned you.
