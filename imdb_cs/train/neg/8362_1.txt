It's a really bad movie. I have my brain and I can not come up with one positive commentary. The effect is unfortunate. I've seen more credible shows about cable access. The story is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, secret records of the president, and the shark attacking everything that comes close to him should make the worst fun. The night of sharks is not so bad that it's good. The dialogue sounds and sounds as if it were written a few seconds before filming. Plus, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I am surprised that my ears have not begun to bleed from techno-synthesized 80s sounds that somebody really bothered to record. From everything I read, the Italian film industry was dead in 1987. Sharks are like a finishing nail in a coffin.
