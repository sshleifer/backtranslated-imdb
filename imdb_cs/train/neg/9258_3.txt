It's unfortunate that someone has decided to take the best horror films of all time in my book. This bad copy stole a lot of material from the first three films, and even copied how people die and what happens to key characters in the future, basically trying to squeeze three movies into one and fail. He even does not create a scary atmosphere (except for the exceptional exception when impressive choral music brings memories of old movies). The only thing we can be grateful for is that there was no Omen V.
