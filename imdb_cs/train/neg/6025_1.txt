Left Behind is the movie, "We Know What We Know Because We Know It," a film that Christians (and most other naive) need to help them feel like what they "think" and "believe" (not "KNOW" ) right. But at the same time I feel bad for little boys, because it is not a well filmed movie. Does not support any message. I work in a video rental and I know that the only reason people went to see this movie was that they were religious and they thought it was. ANYBODY on this country who thinks they know what's going to happen in the future is bad if I do not think they know they do not know. I had enough time (but only after I had too many) to walk with my nose in the air when he thought films playing with a semi-talented TV actor meant something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you will stay away. I refuse to go into some details about this movie (not because AI did not see it (because I did it), B - it was too shocking so my atheist could handle it (because it was not) or CI really do not have anything to say about it I do not know what I'm doing, it's wrong (because I'm doing it) Sense, (which is the word no one who helped make this movie understand) is that I want the film from my head, I want it to be made of my head, I want to watch from my head ALL I want a message that Kirk puts so proudly and training at the end of the movie from my head I just want all the things that were in my head BEFORE looking at these films something that is directly related to this movie that's raining in my head I'm in the way My quiet anger ends I'm sorry that someone from this world went to the theater to see this movie about what might happen in the future (but not) when they could give that seven dollars Plus to any number of human, animal, or racial so that they will not be able to "believe" in the fact that they are real, they may have to have what it is. LEFT FOR ZERO (except ****)
