This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a "homework" for the film class. It lacks the brand in terms of the "message" it is trying to transmit. Characters are exaggerated, bad, and just like a plot ... and that's totally ridiculous. The cover shot is what I thought it might be a decent movie, the co-actor is nice and that's about it. The Morale of this movie: NEVER READ THE FILM AS COVER! Save time, money and energy and create your own home movie and you'll be a lot better than me. It was painful to watch and frankly I am surprised that someone would have spent money on production and distribution!
