This movie is a dirty and forgotten vehicle by Sean Connery. The performances are usually dirty especially from Capshaw, Fishburne and usually hard Ed Harris. Connery seems to be a miscast like the Harvard Academic. The movie gets worse when it goes on. This is the secret of the third degree, which becomes extremely conceived when it melts. The film tells of an excellent cast. George Plimpton also appears in a minor role by adding some gravity to Connery when discussing the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere boast the third degree of secrecy / thriller that is manipulated to the highest degree. Scripting and routing are very poor. Connery's charisma and presence on the screen are the only virtues of the film. Manipulative, violent and sad. 2/10 Avoid this.
