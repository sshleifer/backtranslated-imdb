SPOILERY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I like it. <br /> <br /> First reason: Boring. As soon as something happens, the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, smokes the weeds, reads magazines, cares for their ill friend, and cuts off the dead body at times. BORING !!!! <br /> <br /> The second reason: There are not many things. Many scenes are devoted to the zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, holding them in a chair, and interrogating them. Who are these men? How do they know about illegal activities on sick carnivores? Why kill one and let another go? There is also that buddy who first thought he also had flesh eating diseases, but he gave his fist over the wall with superhuman strength, which suggests that it is not exactly what we originally thought - he never said! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the clauses clamped and the action did not exist. Also, art packaging is misleading because it will make you believe that this movie will be cool if it's not. I have rented this movie on the basis of some reviews by other people on this website and although I respect the fact that some people could enjoy this movie, I will assure myself from that moment that I have read more than two reviews deep into the movie to avoid renting another movie that I regret to see.
