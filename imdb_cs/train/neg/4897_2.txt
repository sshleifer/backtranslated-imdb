This film is a final disappointment for me in Tsai Ming-Liang. It reflects the laziness of each frame. So I will not even analyze it thoroughly. But some notes: <br /> <br /> 1. If drought is a prerequisite, why do we see urban landscapes with flowering green trees? I wonder if that meant something in the metaphorical context of the movie (in which the thirst points to the desire for intimacy and melon to trivial substitution, sex). Or it's just a matter of filthy filming of the movie without doing damn about cohesion. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not know what happened to the porn actress, why she's unconscious or probably dead. Does the question seem unimportant if the report of the highest alienation was successfully delivered (but bombastic), but in retrospect its inert body proved to be a cheap dramaturgical trick, an excuse? as well as free and exploitative as the activity it uses. <br /> <br /> 3. In this film, there is nothing to say that Antonioni did not express himself more than 40 years ago? and without the unnecessary humiliation of his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (recycled from the "Hole" hole) felt like the idea of ​​artistic counterposition of a secondary teacher, performed at the level of a very high school level. If that was the point, the point was soaked.
