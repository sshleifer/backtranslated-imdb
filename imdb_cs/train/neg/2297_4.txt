I briefly turned on the 700 club, and I only agree with some of the statements - I am one of the many believers most Christians consider to be a liberal majority of Christians and Conservatives. I vote for my mind, and usually it is not the opposite. or dem. - I do not believe that 700 clubs tell people what to believe, but that it represents many older Christians who grew up in a very conservative environment. I think many people will misunderstand what is called the 700 club. he pushed me to hear the name he calls in every direction. I think 700 club people really love Jesus, but they are so busy trying to conservatively choose people to forget to show love to certain people and to promote peace as Jesus. Please, do not judge Jesus on the basis of ignorant individuals who believe in Him, and also be ignorant of our comments to them. Why are people so strong to each other?
