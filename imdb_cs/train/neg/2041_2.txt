Okay, I'll start with good points. The film was only 86 minutes long and some were so bad that it was funny. Now for low points. My first warning sign came up with the current "warning" of the movie. When it started, this "warning" was displayed: "The film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images, because unlike ordinary beliefs that are killed, it is neither fun, nor romantic." I had to save 86 minutes and then I turned it off. The first words of the film were, "I'm in the glue factory." He was a guy who spoke on the phone and he talked about home care as a glue. I do not know why. So the film's foundation is that a child is obsessed with Zodiac Killer and begins to imitate him. The budget of this film was at least $ 50 and had to use the cheapest cameras they found. The game was worse than me when I read directly from the script. It looks like they're doing. The script was horrible and the big "twist" was that the guy who wrote the biography on Zodiac Killer was actually Zodiac Killer. Of course, they tried to show it gently, but in the first 10 minutes it clearly showed it. Without any other painful plot details, some terrible peaks appeared. He's trying to make the Zombie Killer look like an "army of one," because soldiers are really just assassins. Then they tried to try "Satanic worship" by showing some boys in a black hood at the meeting. The big "computer hacker" was able to get this child's address when someone gave him the child's name and phone number. For some reason, he had to go to the FBI to turn around. I'm not sure why he simply did not search the phonebook or did not use whitepages.com. There was also a random 9/11 hint without reason. I also learned that no matter where you are shot, blood will come out in your mouth for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> So if you like really bad acting, sub-par scoring, bad camera work and obvious conspiracy, you'll love Zombie Killer!
