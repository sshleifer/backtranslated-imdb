Warning: Avoid this super-horrible movie ... if you've been watching SOOOOOOOOO disappointed. Pam and Denise are now grandmothers what they do? I try to be so hard to be young innocent and sexy, it just does not work ALL. Pam and Denise are so horrible in this movie. <br /> <br /> Plus the script is totally cruel, I can not believe anyone can come up with such miserable ideas. With the development of the film industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as in the last century. I bet the movie audiences of the last century also hate. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it. I think I've been looking at White Cat since 2004, it's much better that ... I'm not doing a mistake at the moment. I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
