The veterinarian decides to take the waterfall amok and everyone who has taken the trip is excluded (including women). Released for theaters just before "A Star Is Born," which has changed its career, this action-dramatic mishmash, played by Kris Kristofferson, is wild, helpless and hopeless. Filmed in Simi Valley, CA, the results are truly inexplicable, with the redneck clich√© and the ruthless violence that makes up most of George Armitage's script. Armitage gathered for his film the most curious 70s, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and a little Loni Anderson; but the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson, who is rough and rough all the time. It deserves points that I think are a totally unsatisfactory drive in the thriller, but the bad vibrations (and the ridiculous peak) cover the whole project as a nasty stain. * 1/2 from ****
