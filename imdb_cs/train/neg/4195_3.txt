Because it's people, it's hard to understand why this movie should be so confused and boring. Writer David Ward wrote two years later the stunning "The Sting" movie, Jane Fonda just won the Klute Academy Award, and Donald Sutherland has done excellent work in films such as Klute, "Start the Revolution Without Me" and "Kelly's Heroes." Plotwise, the film is a horror story, with a small gang of humble miserlies planning big robberies. At the same time, the film wants to be a hip satire, a series of comedic sketches of the kind that NBC's "Saturday Night" TV show would do two years later. The bad result is that the story makes comedy pieces as embarrassing and forced and detached comedy pieces to destroy any kind of tension that may have heist. It's quite literally a movie that sticks to itself, just as the cars in buses in the demolition of the scene fall into one another. The only real interest in me was to watch Jane Fonda. Her caf√© "Iris Caine" is to be in the "Klute" light by the heart of her dramatic crazy character, Bree Daniels. Still, one does not believe her for a moment. Jane Fonda always pretends to be a prostitute we are watching. It is a terrible performance that her performance at Klut was amazing. It would be good if teachers were working together to lead two films to show how the same actress in the same kind of role could be great or poor. This suggests actors are just as good as their writers and directors.
