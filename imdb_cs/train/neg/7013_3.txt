Unfortunately, this film, 54, was a pathetic attempt at the real story of "Studio 54". The only thing that was good on the picture was "Mike Myers", which was a joy to watch. "Neve Cambpell," though her role was little, was unfortunate. As a result, this film lacked a good performance from actors except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt at a good screenplay.
