Immediately after renting and watching this film a few years ago, we and our friend decided to define an absolute zero in the film scale. There was nothing on the film that could be done worse than it was. Until today, we are still evaluating films, even those very bad, better than Lonely Lady. I have long seen an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the scripts, among others, "The Last Summer" and "The Crazy Homewoman Diary," and said she was asked to write the Harold Robbins script book "The Lonely Lady." She said she'd sent the treatment and was rejected because she did not think she understood the troubles of a female screenwriter in Hollywood. Then she said, "I think somebody else wrote." The interview was filmed before the film was released. She died in 1981 and bet that the first thing she did when she arrived in heaven was personally thanks to God for saving her from being involved in the result.
