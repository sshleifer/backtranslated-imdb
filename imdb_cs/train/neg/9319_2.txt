I do not know what you're talking about for the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends, we could not stop crying. That's one of the funniest moments I've ever seen. This note about porn is so true, though hahahaha. Yeah, this movie is actually worse, but it brought tears to my eyes because of fake characters, bad dialogue and acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras that photographed the film? It looks like one of those movies from my driver. class. The details seem to be coming out of a dramatic show in high school. The music sounded like the original Nintendo system. The only thing that even came to scare me about this movie was that the killer had a clown that was not exhausted by fat and licking the clowns? hahaha, if you ever look at it, but you have to look for actor's verbal mistakes like pressing words and some of their facial expressions. hahahaha died. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
