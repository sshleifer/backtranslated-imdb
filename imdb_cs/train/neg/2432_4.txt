I do not have much to say about this. In the first ten minutes you can quite tilt. There is nothing wrong with this movie, very little action action action. There was a chance to explore character emotions occasionally. Whether the action movie is the right genre, I'm still indecisive. Sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without paying attention, because it had only a few twists and a straightforward plot. I was probably guilty, so with my second watch or with unlimited attention it might be better. 4/10 (but best of my 4 out of 10)
