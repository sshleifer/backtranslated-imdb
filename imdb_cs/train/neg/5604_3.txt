I've heard about this movie for many years and finally I've been able to see it. The huge killing of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 eventually caused a cheerleading camp to be closed. Rapidly ahead of 1982, Bambi, a former student, opens him with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, he murders the murderer until there is only one. It is when we find out who did it and why. Also in the movie Tom Smothers makes a terrible accent like Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens is doing his Pee-Wee Herman schtick. The overall drawing is not very well developed and quite fragile, but there are several fun scenes, namely House of Bad Pies and strip poker scene. Termination looks as if it were common, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Overall, good for about ten or fifteen minutes, the rest can only pass quickly. Maybe catch him on TV, but he's not worth buying.
