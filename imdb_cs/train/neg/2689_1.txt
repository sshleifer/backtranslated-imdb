Now I'm not a film critic, but I really hated "September 11". This movie was generally bad. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárrita's segment, which was as effective and direct as possible about the subject, short films were the most boring and, at worst, offensive. The worst in his mind was the demanding segment of Youssef Chahin, in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers with American soldiers, even so far as to suggest that suicide bombers are fighting for a greater cause. The segment was totally out of the question and with Chahin's seeming lack of any decency, loss of time, and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a film with their views on the tragedy was good on paper but in practice it was tasteless.
