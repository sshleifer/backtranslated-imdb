Numerous story of singer Kid (the prince) who becomes a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonie (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his father (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. I saw it in the theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince but I like three great songs from this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry". The concert scenes in this movie are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is a LARGE part of the film. The story is blatantly obvious and has been done many times - and much better. Subplots are to be pretty, poorly processed. The love triangle between Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually offended. For the story, his wife is beating his father, but the scenes are so badly mastered (in acting and direction) that I could not believe it. The script is terrible - miserable dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. Here's the misogyny here - Kid's mother is beaten; The kid hits Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia tape and goes upless to swim in the dirty river. Also, Williams and Prince's figure treats women in a terrible way all the time. Acting is the place where this movie really failed. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is (perhaps) the worst actor I've ever seen. His empty face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad that I could not believe it. This movie appears only during concert scenes, but in reality it is not much. "Dramatic" scenes are so badly solved and manipulated to make the movie look good. He just had to make a concert film. I give it 2 - just for music.
