Have you ever wondered what would happen if there were some characters in Beverly Hills 90210 in Thai prison? If so, it's your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be fine, but the story was badly executed. A conspiracy plot, a bad dialogue, and unresolved issues are emerging. This gentle film did not gain the right to be as mysterious as it would end. Potential spoiler and absurdly absurd conspiracy - full moment full of tension when a hotel employee discovers girls, has no place there and is about to dig it. (This moment is hostile to play with the same festivity and seriousness as the moment they are arrested on the shooting range). Later, the same employee of the hotel suddenly appeared - and Bangkok is a big city, thinking I was there - and testifying against the girls as if a few free Mai Tais sued 40 years in prison. Come on. Lend the next day in paradise.
