As a poker enthusiast, I was looking forward to seeing this movie - especially as Scotty Nyugen had in it. Essentially, Scotty Nyugens's short spots in this film are all about him. <Br /> <br /> <br /> The characters are unbeatable and annoying, the soundtrack is terrible and the plot, well, there is not one. <br /> <br /> I honestly got my headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was bored. In fact, it's like Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I would not lose $ 16 when I bought it from Ebay. Take it off - avoid 7 2 offsuit !!! Catastrophic. :(
