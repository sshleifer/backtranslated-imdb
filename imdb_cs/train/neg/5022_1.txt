Oh, the expensive movie was bad for various reasons. I expected to see a very low score for this movie and was a little surprised to see everything. SORRY, but it's a joke to make a lot of people appreciate it! Once you get across one shot / black and white movie trick, which was a nice idea, the movie stretches, even at runtime just 66 minutes. Credits at the beginning were so unpleasant! In the van the boys suffer a flat tire and change the wheel, wow, it was needed in the story! How slow were the boys who chased and actually managed to hurt Campbell? They did not seem to bother to continue pursuing ... sighing ... I'm just glad I got it for free with a special edition Evil Dead!
