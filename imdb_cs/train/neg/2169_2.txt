I usually enjoy early films from Loretty Young: her acting was light and windy, and she certainly knew how to wear clothes. But this is just a defector of this word except for Glenda Farrell. Young is a girl who talks with her writer (Paul Lukas) to become a world championship champion. It's not the most cinematic games and the long, waist-high middle part where their marriage collapses just kills the movie. However, it is interesting. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk begin their top game, a series of quick shots show aircraft, trains, soccer games, even a diver in the middle of the air, freezing in anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of the freeze frame I've seen in American film. They wanted the rest to be the imaginative and entertaining.
