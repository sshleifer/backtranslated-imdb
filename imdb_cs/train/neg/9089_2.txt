The film has only one flaw, unfortunately this defect damages all the credibility of the work. It begins with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. It can not be explained why Israelis exist. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan invaded Israel. This is why Israel "takes up" its country, because these countries have lost in the war they have started. The film also claims that Israel violated the UN by failing to comply with Resolution 242. The problem is, it was rejected immediately after its establishment ..... Palestinians, so it was invalid. Many movies get together well and can really show shots that change the mind, but remember when you look at something, believe nothing of what you hear and just half what you see. All participants in this film are known critics of Israel and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments and removed any possible credibility of their words. <br /> <br /> All participants need a really good history that they teach objectively, not a Palestinian sympathizer.
