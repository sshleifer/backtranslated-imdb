A complete waste of time .... This movie is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not romance ... not even a teenage comedy! The story ... it should be an end ... but it's so disappointing! When the movie comes to an end, I expect the turn to be even better ("Fight Club"), but this turn makes the film even worse ... When I look at a teen comedy and I do not do it too often I expect poor jokes and a lot of naked ... Jokes are too miserable and not nudity ... You only have one ... very good looking I have to admit ... little girl and that's it! And she's completely dressed the whole movie! The effects are bad ... like a series of soaps ... Do not waste your time! There are porns with a better story and playing! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
