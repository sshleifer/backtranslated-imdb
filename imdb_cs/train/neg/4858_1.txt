Why would anyone do this movie in the world? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were pretty stupid, but this is the cake for the worst of the trilogy (Maybe All Time). Todd Sheets is still a director, but he is no longer a screenwriter, which is neither negative nor positive because he is as inappropriate as the writer. Writing is too dependent on the f-word, which is sometimes used between 200 and 300 times in case of nausea. The performance is in the same place as the last two Bloodbath films, so naturally they are some of the worst I've ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look painful. The conspiracy has become too complicated for it to be good, and it was that some government experiment went wrong and made a zombie. It also includes cryogenically frozen mutant zombies and school kids who know how to travel over time, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie it goes into outtakes, which is strange, because the whole movie is the output. Just to see that you're kidding, because if you get into this with a serious mind, maybe you might be killed. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
