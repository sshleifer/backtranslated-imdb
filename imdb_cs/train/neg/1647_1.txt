Especially Zorie Barber (Zeke) can be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a figure to be a sidewalker, the village writer in martial arts and proud of being mysterious, why so exaggerated, overly dramatic, and simply terrible? Did he know about his character before they started filming? Director? Martial arts do not teach discipline? In addition, this film lacks the goal with its funny jokes and seen - already - with raw humor. Hand in the toilet? <i> Trainspotting </ i>. Masturbation? Hmm. <i> Quick Times on Ridgemont High </ i>, <i> American Pie </ i>, the list goes on .. Fabulous Dialogue: In one sequence Eric says "It's Not My Store". "And after 30 seconds Mia says: "Why is it one of your stores?" Bad editing: At least five minutes of film is useless for NYC traffic shots. <hr> It's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters will be close to a group of friends in every world. I can not comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you like low eyebrows, basic bathroom humor and insults, in any case, enjoy yourself. If you want something a little smarter, but on the same lines, look for <i> Boomerang </ i>. If you want a solid co-go-around romantic comedy, go to <i> The Tao Of Steve </ i>. But everyone who thinks it's <Whipped </ i> is a funny and accurate data portrait, well, I can not agree at all.
