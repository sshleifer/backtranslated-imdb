It's a terrible movie, and not one scene has unique true emotions. The characters are unmistakable, of course drawn, predictable, and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish. William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was made, but he plays someone in the early 1940s and seems to be in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and was written to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found at the road was more sexy and had more life than their erotic links. Holden's character - the same age as Clint Eastwood, when he directed this film, (not) coincidentally - is placed with the obvious bouts of 60-year-old pre-hippie cool: bachelor's pads, swinging hi-fi, lunches at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously unstoppable, a shrill scream of old fogies, desperate for the free spirits who saw in the West and Laurel Canyon to find their big Honkin cars sexy. Youth culture has never been so desperate. And I'm shivering when I think Bill Holden was so desperate for his youth that he took this embarrassing role.
