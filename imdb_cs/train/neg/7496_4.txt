It is hard to give the words a hateful hatred for this movie. But I will try: Every other word was exclusive, sexual scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were uncontrollable, and stereotypes were above norm, if not offensive to Italian Americans. <br /> <br /> I do not say that acting was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. al, works well. But ... almost every character in the movie I scorned. Not from the Remains of Fireworks I liked every figure on the screen.
