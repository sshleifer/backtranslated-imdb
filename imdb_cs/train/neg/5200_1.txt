This film is very poor. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of tension, but you would not be able to leap from the chair. It starts slowly with building tension. This is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although at some points or moments I have to say that it was a little funny when people were shot and walked down. They should do something like Scary Movie, then it could be a better movie. Because I watched only a piece of the film by skipping the scenes and getting into the boredom through the movie. I have to say that I felt sleepy watching this movie, so I can say that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time even thinking about doing something with this movie except leaving where it is already. Somewhere very dusty ..
