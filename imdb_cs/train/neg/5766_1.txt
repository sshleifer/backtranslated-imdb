This was meant to be the flagship of the open source community, something that would stand up and shout at the world's media to notice because we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our capabilities in producing great work with open source tools. After the basic version of the download (I'm dying by a fan on the phone modem), I finally got here, I hit the first hit. Media Player, Mplayer Classic and winamp did not open me on my xp box and then Totem, xine & kaffeine could not open on my server. Mplayer managed to run smoothly. It will be hard to spread the word about if normal users can not even open it ... Movie. Beautiful soundtrack, great lighting, perfect camera work and flawless structuring. Everything looked real. And then the two main characters moved ... and spoke ... And the film died for me. Everything but the synchronization of the lips and the real animation of the two main characters (except Proog on the dance scene) looked fluid and totally alive. The two main characters were animated so badly that I sometimes wondered if there are currently some games with cut scenes that would mean less realism than this. Every frame in the movie is fantastic .. like a frame, and that's great if the actors do not move. I'm so glad I did not recommend it to anyone. I would destroy my reputation. Oh, and the ultimate fantasy had a more cohesive and invented plot. <br /> <br /> This movie would have won 10 stars if it was not for the tragedy that sits directly on the screen.
