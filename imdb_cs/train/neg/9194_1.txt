Okay, first of all I'm a huge zombie fan. I loved all the Romer films and thoroughly enjoyed Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard every single critic who was on this movie, I'm still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and although it may not be a particularly great movie, I liked it if not because it was just a fun zombie that fired them with a half-conspicuous plot. This is a clean bun. A horrible dialogue, a half-plot of land, and a game scene were inserted into the movie. Who in the right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term "loose") I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he is in a godsome horror film and he could as well do the best of it. Everyone else acts like Shakespeare. And I could add very badly. Basically, this is the only reason anyone should see this immortality if you are a.) They are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick, or b.) You like to play MST3K, a home game. Check with friends and be prepared for lots of unintentional laughter. <br /> <br />
