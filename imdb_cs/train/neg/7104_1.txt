Producers of this film offer funeral expenses to anyone who dies while watching this movie. They could offer intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this glowing. The young couple returns to the house where a woman, who looks like a woman from a couple, lived. Extremely boring and very predictable. Finally, I did not care about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
