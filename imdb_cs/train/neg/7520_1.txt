This film proves that you can not judge the movie with amazing art on the DVD cover. It also shows that you should learn more about the movie before you buy it (or get it for someone at Christmas). The beginning of this movie really looks somewhat promising. Well, when you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack brings a high school book full of witch magic that leaves in their year-old spooky house (where the film takes place). Then there is some drunk, combat and fine porn core. Then the action of the film eventually takes place after more than one hour. Overall, Hallow's end was predictable, insurmountable and resembled fine porn. This movie is probably best seen with a group of friends who have nothing better because it's a good movie you can talk to. And for the first time, it's really fun to make predictions about the order of people who die.
