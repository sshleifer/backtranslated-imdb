do not look at this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda look at this document and see the facts and the truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ Documentary series The Death of Yugoslavia five episodes) is a carefully crafted and investigated description of the widespread mass bloodshed that marked the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and continued almost the first half of the 1990s. It contains a huge amount of newspaper records and interviews with stakeholders, both "Yugoslav" and others. The only real "improvement" that could be achieved on this amazing success would be to include later developments in the Balkans since the program was implemented. It really did in the late 1990s for repeating the BBC television, but adding some more recent events would help complete this remarkably detailed and extensive piece of work. Perhaps maybe another whole episode is justified? The very short title of this document was even more desirable by possibly leaving the term "Yugoslavia" now called the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very late and formal declaration of what happened years ago. /> <br /> There is no fiction as in "Yugoslavia: Avoiding War (1999)"
