On the back burner for years (so it was reported), this television gathering of two of the most popular characters in the history of the sitcom began badly - and from there it went straight down the hill. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper), meet in New York City after a long estrangement and catch up with each other. What a new concept! But it is sad that they are not talking about anything that would be good to talk (let alone film) that happened to each of them in the years to come. So the script consists of throwing one old storytelling device after another (mostly with older women in the workplace), lacking the special charm and sophistication that made the original show the winner. Support for casting is immediately forgotten, humor does not exist, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once left is gone. Moore reportedly halted this project for years and waited for the "right script" before committing himself. If she were the one she considered to be "right," what was the country that she had refused? It's not the age of the personalities who are doing it (time inevitably marching), but the almost complete lack of imagination associated with the obvious ignorance of the elements that made the series. It was once intended as a pilot, but of course it did not bring any interest among potential sponsors. Or in this case among potential audiences. Fast and gracefully forgotten, the film is a travesty and insult to classics.
