Adapting games to cinema is often a bad idea because they are two different media. Do you think it's a great idea to make ZULU into the theater game? Imagine where there are two spectacular cloaks in the tent. "Blimey There's Thousands Out There" Big Movie and Bad Scene Play To make the theater a great cinema, you need two basic things 1) Fine cast that creates chemistry on the screen <br /> <br / > 2) great dialogue <br /> <br /> Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles. The story revolves around a hit-man who plays Palminterri's burglary into a house to kill his wife played Cher with most of the action running inside the house. I could not really take those two characters seriously, though it might have been a scenario mistake that can not decide whether she's trying to be serious or funny. Since the story is very static, it is extremely important for the dialogue to come through, and again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay, it is more than anything else to bother when much of the conversation turns around sexual acts. if you want to see a great translation of scenic playback converted to a silver screen, do FAITHFUL miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN
