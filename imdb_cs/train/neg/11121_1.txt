I really do not understand how anyone can leave this disgusting movie more than one star ... How can you like such a slow motion movie, where are all the scenes that concern animal abuse real? I do not even want to imagine the enormous pain that the innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those dreadful moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "man" would they torture like that without reason or just for money? I'm telling you that the director is either mentally retarded or just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. He really deserves to cut his hands and burn. It contains a variety of terrible barbaric scenes that can cause shock especially for sensitive people and children: the real frog is covered with live, the fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, the dog is defeated, the birds are watered in the water ... This film is more than grapes; it must be the worst and most retarded film ever made, along with another, called "Cannibal Holocaust" or the like. We will never watch or buy any movie driven by this heartless creature. No one should waste time watching it, especially when there are plenty of great movies where there are all wild animal scenes. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, few people liked it - which is natural because it is the worst movie ever - and so it was not successful. I hope this will cause the slow-motion director to realize that such unwarranted barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence against animals REAL NEVER will not praise and that he will devote himself to all the scenes of animal abuse in all of these films. I really believe everyone accepts, but what they give! There will be a day when all slow down and cruel people will feel the same pain they once caused others. But this is probably my only "negative" review. I usually do not comment on the movie if I do not like it, but this time I just could not close it. I had to tell the truth, because animal abuse must stop!
