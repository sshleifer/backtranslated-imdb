It is a very old and cheaply made film - typical of the low-floor B-Western in many respects. Gary Cooper has not yet been a star, and this film is very much like John Wayne's early films, which have taken place in studies of "poverty." With both actors, their well-known style and persona were still not fully created. This Gary Cooper incarnation does not look exactly like Cooper just a few years later (he speaks faster in this early film, among others). However, unlike the average B-movie era, there are at least some interesting elements that make the movie unique (if not good). If you ever wanted to see a woman who has been devoted to Errol Flynn for seven years, it's your chance. Lili Damita plays as an interest in female love, and it is a very, very strange casting choice because she has a heavy accent (it was French) and she was not so close to being a "movie star pretty". By the way, she was also married to director Michael Curtis. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and strangest aspect of the movie is the seemingly gay subplot - something like the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN since the 1930s (and we thought it was a new idea). The character of Gary Cooper was brought up by two men who hate women and do everything they can through a lot of the film to keep Cooper without women. This misogyn itself does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many footnotes in the film that suggest that the filmmakers really tried to portray them as a gay couple. Specifically, to the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot with an arrow and stops when he dies long enough to fly into the body of his fallen friend and then falls - with his arms around him. It was a pretty nervous affair and I think this makes this boring movie really fascinating today! As for Cooper and the plot, the film is a little disappointing and very skip-able. If you are not curious about Damit or homosexual subtitles, do yourself a favor and find a better west.
