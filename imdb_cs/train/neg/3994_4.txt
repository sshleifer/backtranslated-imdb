I'm a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I'm a bit less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> This has been said I should have a love of 1408. *** POSSIBLE SPOILS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I went eagerly. I was disappointed. That's not the guilt of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson have very small roles because the premise of the film brings Cusack in the "guy in the closed room" scenario. This was not a BAD movie, but I can not call him good either. It was a crazy disorder that had "ouch, it's just bad", combined with moments "ouch, that's just painful" and moments "oh, now it's just unfortunate" with very little connection between them. Eislin's father appears once, and it's not obvious that he finds himself in the rest of Mika's personal life as he tries to survive in the room. <br /> <br /> The previous commentator described Olin / Enslin's argument as very attentive and I very much agree. Besides, besides some clever musical stimuli (the room almost playfully tortures Enslin a little, and gives him one chance to get out in front of the ante ... where he gives it an hourly countdown and the title line from carpenters "We have just begun." ), most of them "pop out when you least expect it!" The type of horror that was fun when I was fourteen and surrounded by my age buddies catches each other in the summer while Jason spent Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the film was "inducing him to survive some of his most painful experiences" of mind, with "animating scary images" of clich√© cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I was expecting better from this Stephen King movie, who joined him as well as actors, which I mentioned above. They have never discovered the origin of evil. We never see the evil being defeated, although we can assume that it may have been defeated. And the end was just ugly "what?" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for it to get on the cable. I do not want it to pay for the matinee, but I feel a bit short because I paid for the opening price.
