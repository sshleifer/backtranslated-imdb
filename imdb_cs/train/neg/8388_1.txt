This heart story of hope comes. I hope you will never have to endure something so terrible. * cough * Razzie cena * cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it was inoperative, predictable and sad. While watching, I felt I was in a psychological experiment to find out how low the film standards can get before people complain. When I asked for the money at the end of the film, I was informed because I was watching the whole thing, "I'm not entitled to reimbursement." The Assistant Director told me that several people complained and had already been compensated. <br /> <br /> The film's summary is very basic. A small thief stole a diamond and poses as a kid to escape the police. Under this clever contour, however, there is a repertoire of original, fresh and merry sketches. Or. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: Would you like to see people get into the pot? Do you like funny jokes? Would you like to see crumbs that pose as babies endangered by the thermometer in the rectum? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think kids say goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa? If you answered "yes" to any of the above, then this movie is definitely for you. Though it was billed in some places as "the worst film of the decade", there are probably a movie or 2 that are worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this movie two stars because we all know that reviews with only one star would mean bias from the reviewer and then the review would not take seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is meant for a less intelligent audience and I can not recommend it to anyone with good conscience. Save money for something fun. <br /> <br /> Respect
