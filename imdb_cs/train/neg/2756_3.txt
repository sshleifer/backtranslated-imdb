{rant start} I did not want to believe them at first, but I think that's what people are saying when they say the South Korean cinema has climbed and can even go down. After the surprisingly entertaining and moving monster movie "Gwoemul" (2006), which has really succeeded in creating a sharp satire from the B-movie genre, the subsequent Korean blockbusters have become increasingly generic, even though their budgets (mostly spent on special effects ) became more and more fantastic. Do South Korean filmmakers really want to exhaust all the goodwill of the audience and the investors their industry has built since the 1999 Shiri / Swiri explosion by creating a number of big budget media films such as Mainland China? The only reason I could make a movie is to suppress investors in financing the most detailed and authentic digital dragon animation I've seen in Korean and East Asian style to date, for the final scenes. Now that they introduced the dragon at the beginning and gave it more personality and purpose, as in Dragonheart in 1996, the film could still have a few redeemed qualities, except that it has a lot of digitally animated kites. Remember "Dungeons and Dragons" in 2000? No one has learned that the trick is not how much special effects you use, but how well do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends that they can use because they have just killed many international interests about the legends of the Korean dragons in the way they shot it. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I agree with all the negative reviews that have gone before, thinking about how Koreans feel that their folk anthem "Arirang" is playing at the very end. As a creature, I would give him at least 5 stars out of 10 if these were special effects or action sequences but I saw many video games with better camera and scripting (few dragons).
