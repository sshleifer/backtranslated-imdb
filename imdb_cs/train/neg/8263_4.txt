"Mojo" is the story of the fifties of London, a world of star rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. "Mojo" uses the technique of shooting the 1950s, which is often reflected in films that emphasize physical differences with our own time, but also represents a very exaggerated dialogue (considering how speech was represented in films created during this period); I have no idea if people actually talked like that out of movies, but no films that are being made and used today are using such a stylized language. It is as if the permanent discourse of screenwriters from 1950 served a common abbreviation for the past, which, as a result, appears to be a very distant country; and therefore emphasizes concrete, rather than universal, stories. "Mojo" represents a strong performance from Ian Map and annoyed by Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, who is still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting 'career; but feels like a period, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom. Rather boring, actually.
