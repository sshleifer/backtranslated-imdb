I read Thornton Wilder last year at the eighth year. I was also forced to listen to this faint translation on the screen. Let me tell you, it's not a great game, it's easily overcome, but one deserves a much better shot. It was really missing, the landscape - sincere to God - it looked as if it had been made of cardboard by a group of three. As if it did not get worse, the quality of the sound is miserable ... it's this buzz-dampening "buzz" whenever the actor talks ... and I could not help but notice that chemistry between George and Emily does not exist. The actors all look very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white color, which would be fine, but it further reduces its cheese. In any case, I think that if you are going to see this movie that I really do not, do not take your hopes to high. The game, as stunning as it is, is probably better.
