"Show me your shoes!" it's not funny and definitely not on a channel showing cartoons if you understand where I come from. I do not want my girls at the age of 6 and 7 to think like this or to hear. I think it's sad that Nick has been pushing this bullshit, and that's what we have, silly little kids behave like stupid adults. I know it's humorous, but we think we're there with little innocent girls in K and 1st class who can not wait to see it. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters will not follow. I'd like to block Nick, but at this point I do not have a heart, but if Nick keeps pushing that bull, I'll have to.
