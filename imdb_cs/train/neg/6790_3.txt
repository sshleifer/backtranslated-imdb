Ohh brutality, ohhhhh dying breed, ohhhh feeling of loss, ohhhh prejudices! Is Jeez, when are all the whimsical revisionists who stop analyzing Western residents because they yell aloud? S ** t happens. If it offends your socially developed feel, then return to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. Boring, boring and very tiring celluloid loss - especially in the light of the presence of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or interesting here if you are not obsessed with the aged teeth of the 19th century. It can be a little better without a constantly turning away Mexican bad-toothed guy. Memorial of silly ultracolucor creep sensitivity 60/70. It is virtually impossible to sit the whole movie. I think I'd rather have my eyes open for the Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10 - all dead in hell.
