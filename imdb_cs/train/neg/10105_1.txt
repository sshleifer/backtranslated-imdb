Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was boring. I looked into my comic box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. He says the filmmaker has some kind of cult in the description. It's funny to warn me not to watch this movie. I could use this advice. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Nation is like Troll 2 in that it's totally wrong. It has little (if at all, depending on your point of view) it is related to zombies and is running in one city. This film revolves around a curvy policeman who behaves the worst (he has to try to suck) while arresting women for trivial bulls and then killing them. Yeah, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this movie defective in thinking it's a zombie, but it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. Serious killers are enjoying killing, living for it, and they take off with them. The man knocks on the women and injects them with some poison. He does not even have sex with a corpse or divorce him. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the five women she kills has Voodoo protection for her, and for no apparent reason all five of them return to life and go out to kill the guy. They were all buried or thrown into the ocean, but you would not know that they would buy a clean clean garment that everyone wears. Women then behave very badly and revenge. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This movie was bullshit in every category. Crappy acting, dirty writing, crappier sets, and scary make-up effects. Women do not look like zombies unless you really expect a dark makeup around the eyes, which is de facto a definition of what the zombies are doing. They can all talk, act, think, and act completely humanly. Gore is weak compared to many PG-13 movies and nudity is not too short. You will see how breasts first appear ... Then exactly the same breasts later! Go find out. Guess only one actress was willing to go up on this trite. The police stations are so poorly built that you can see where the walls of the warehouse, which of course shoot, stopped painting. You can see the pipes, bad lighting and overly sparse settings, and even if you are not blind, you can see that the director failed. Steer clear, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
