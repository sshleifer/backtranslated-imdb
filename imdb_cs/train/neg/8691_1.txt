If it's ZERO, I'll do this movie. Today was the second time I tried to follow her, and I still could not overcome it. I can not believe that the multiple stars that others give can only assume they either know actors or they are supporters of the publicists! The effects are ubiquitous, the screenplay is blah, the baby playing Nichole shows zero emotions, even if it is threatened. The "South" accent from the actress playing Amber's mother is funny - I'm from Georgia and my friends from Texas - believe me we're talking NOBODY like this! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
