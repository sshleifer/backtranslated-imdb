I admit it looks like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in the comedy Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Check out the movie and find out. <br /> <br /> In fact, Martin, lead, is badly busy. He does not do the great thicket he knows from films like "The Jerk," but instead plays some of the characters that do not work. Hawn, of which no one can play, is terrible. Cleese is the only, even a bit funny member. <br /> <br /> It's pretty stupid at first. I can not say how much of this could be changed, but the characters seem to lack the smartest sense of common sense. Going through New York, doing nothing right, and unfortunate, not funny. Not only is the whole idea totally unbelievable, it seems to give a message that people who do not live in New York are not too light, which is repeated throughout the movie. to see it, it will rent again the original "odd couple".
