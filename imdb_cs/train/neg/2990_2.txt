Ohhh man! Now I'm talking about it! As for bad / elusive horror movements, this movie was really in its class. The real gem! <br /> <br /> First, the movie was not originally in English. That's fine, because the dubbing of the voice was really exceptional! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialogue (and there are plenty of others to come from)? "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty for my blood!" And what a drama! Here is a play to recapitulate the interaction between the military and the scientists? Scene 1? Scientist: "Can not you do it? It will be a disaster!" - Military officer: "It's just science fiction" (he then continues to cause a complete disaster, as the scientist predicted). Scene 2? Scientist: "If you do, many people will die!" - Military Officer: "You do not know what you're talking about." (doing it and many people dying). Scene 3? Scientist: "Do not kill it all!" - Military officer: "That's nonsense" (he then goes to kill all) Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you get an idea). <br /> <br /> If it was not enough? there were several scenes that really excelled as instant classics! In one scene, the army has literally 10 boys who show the weapons of two unarmed men. The leader shouts: "Go ahead!" and all 10 soldiers, one by one, release your weapons and fist with two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. No attention to detail was omitted! This movie even had a hip / upbeat '80 keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood! <br /> <br /> And believe me? I realize that this review could contain some spoilers, but in this epic there are so many benefactors that I really scratched. The film of this caliber comes only once every ten years! Great movie watching experience! Masterpiece! Wow!
