1. hodnoceno 12/24/2009 ?? 4 of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): An emotional christmas flute that does not really get enough specific to explain how the real story will happen in this de facto incident of a man who is wrongly imprisoned and trying to get a job for his family to make them Christmas. The three children in the family then escaped from home on their way to Washington DC to gain US President Herbert Hoover. This trek provides a couple of stories, such as their positive encounter with the hobo and puppeteer, making the story something like Disney "Animals on the Run" movie and is not quite suited here. Finally, there is no detail on how the President helped the family, and in my opinion it is different for the film. The film eventually brings tears, but it will take too long. The film should not be the original television film (according to IMDb), but does it have obvious losses that look like this? so I'm not sure if their information is accurate. Overall, this is a simple film (which could be more complicated) with a cheerful Christmas story, but playfully and without much content.
