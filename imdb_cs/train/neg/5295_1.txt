A teenager who seems to have everything suicidal. He leaves the family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) and asks many questions ... and blame. <br /> <br /> Good idea, badly treated. It began before 1988 - mostly in television films and extra-curricular schools. In addition to some talent and dialogue (hence the PG-13 rating), it did not bring anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve's attempts at playing were really painful. He is good NOW, but not in 1988. In addition, his figure was dressed like slob and always looked so dirty that it was hard to get sympathy. That the film is sideline. I saw every scene and every "surprise" was telegraphed. Basically, I could not wait for this thing to get. I have a vague memory of seeing her in the theater in 1988 and hating her (it blasted BADLY). It still looks miserable almost 20 years later. The subject is worth it, but in countless other movies it was better (with better effect). "Ordinary people" come to mind. You can skip this option.
