So a common horror story about a luxurious building in Brooklyn that hides the gates to hell. It reminds Polanski of "The Tenant" (released the year before "The Sentinel"), but is too far away from the film of a Polish filmmaker in any possible sense. "The tenant" was so worrying, while "Sentinel" was not at all. What's more surprising in this film is the cast: it's full of great names of American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors are eating (I think). <br /> <br /> Verdict: hardly fun. <br /> <br /> * My number: 4/10
