Stereotyped, derived, non-original and boring Western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and rightly so; both have superficial roles and features that are mentioned mainly in the dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world the way it used to be," and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to the man who locked him and had to pay the debt." Moreover, Heston is so old that he has difficulty riding, and Coburn is average and hard, but not like a cold-blooded killer like some petty villains. It seems that the creators could not come up with an original idea of ​​how to distinguish this film a bit. (* 1/2)
