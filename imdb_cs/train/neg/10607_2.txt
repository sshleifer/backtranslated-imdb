Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his career by doing the Universal Soldier. But the movie saved him? I think he's going to hell when he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute we see the inside of the object where the bad guy of the movie is seen. Scary, yeah? But not as frightening as acting (details are as follows). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a black girl (remembering the name ... it does not really matter) trying to escape from some muscles. Of course they are new universal soldiers. More flies, less brain (as well as film). After some time, Van Damme struggles with Goldberg, but then the "mission" was interrupted. It was just a test (Is this film a test of our nerves?). It turned out that Van Damme is working for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (Who saw the first film think it was the most logical thing Van den Dammes could do). But it is a continuation. A "story" must come. Oh, I forgot. My daughter. Very important for the "story". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, the supercomputer will hear a conversation about turning it off and ending the project. The cube, of course, gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill them all. Van Damme escapes from the building, but the computer sends several soldiers who hunt him (Van Damme wants to be a soldier - because it's the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters who was always a stupid punch for deafness before he came to the fore. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the movie. After some "story" Van Damme tries to save his daughter (his wife - the reporter in the first film). It's a final performance where Van Damme is fighting Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please check it yourself, it's too fun to say). <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So do not look at it. But if so, keep your six!
