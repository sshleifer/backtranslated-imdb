I'm just going to talk about my possible messy comments. In this movie there are enough accumulated fence elements that are basically corrupt in advance. This film derives a few ideas from the Southern classic "Kill and Mockingbird". I suppose maybe TKOM got his ideas from some source ... anyway, when you watch it, you say, "Oh yeah, that's ripoff." I think the really fun thing about these McMovies is once you find out the story of the plot is to find out if they will stick with the original or try to spin around. This is not a lot of twists.
