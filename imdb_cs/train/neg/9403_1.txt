This movie should not be classified as a cinema. Though he is now more than 10 years old, he should never get the money and he's a jerk on the Australian film industry, which now produces such brilliant films as "The Dish" Actors can not act, music is .. be blunt, not music, storyline is totally non-existent, and it's an effort to sit. You are not watching this movie. It's a complete waste of time.
