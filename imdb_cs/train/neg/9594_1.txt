I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just got through this movie and the only thing that made me feel was that I had some power not to stop it. a fairly decent number of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fighting I've ever seen in the movie. Most sword struggles involve the ruthless swing of the swords back and forth and hope that the opponent does not do the same. I've seen a lot of student films with better action and stronger land. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with bad action and practically no signs of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film has no action and shows the development of relationships with the princess and farmboy / terrorist and his disturbed sister. The film has several parts of the fence and none of them really match it to be anything else. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may be that I was watching the oak, which was pretty bad. The entire cast mumbled all their lines, so it was hard to see what was going on. But I got a general idea. (They knew exactly what was said that the movie would not save me) <br /> <br /> If you heard that it was a futuristic action / ninja, then you heard the wrong way. That's what I thought when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let it happen to you. Say it well.
