Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this film because he felt fake, and the characters were not strong enough to carry such a weak attempt at horror. The basic idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not able to excite, really scare me or shock me - there was one part in the whole movie that I thought was scary, but it was not exhausted. I got to the end of the film as Kate's character seemed to be softening and eventually a little more realistic, the character of Jeremy Sheffield was not really needed for this film, and I think the director / writer got away with countless characters and if he left it on the basic characters that would embody Kate's solo effort, it might work - Jeremy's acting was the least wood, and I felt uncomfortable watching the wrong chemistry on the screen - or lack. Such a pity. Disappointing.
