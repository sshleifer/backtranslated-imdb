We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway movie game. Music is just terrible. No unforgettable song in the movie - have you heard any hits from this movie? You will not, because there are none. Some musical figures last until I got up in the toilet and got some pop corn and it was still up when I came back! If the good songs were good - but suck. Tempo is a slow, terrible character development. The leadership was praised for her singing, but it sounded like she was screaming every song - it was almost impossible to stand. This film will NEVER offer to anyone other than hardcore Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the most rated movie I've ever seen. A complete passport of time and money. This film is nothing but Danny Glover, who was not well shot and whose character was not well developed. Find the video and you will agree - this movie was an expensive, overproduced, polished dog.
