I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for demanding audiences) in twenty minutes because it was average and boring enough to make a yawn, not to mention that I soon approached tears for $ 3.99 I lost in Blockbuster. The effect of Joanna Pacula and her dreadfully more accentuated accent are terrible enough for one to be able to teeth. I knew two hours would be too long for her two hours. Both Breuer and Nietzsche play very few talents for notable actors. While we're on the subject of talent, it looks like Breuer's Survival Assistant has been dragged out of the local acting company. She obviously did not learn it. In fact, it's really terrible. All public scenes looked good, with accessories that went mechanically on Sunday best. Turning off this movie was much more satisfying than turning it on. Do not rent this terrible movie. You'll apologize for spending your money.
