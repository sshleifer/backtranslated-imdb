This movie was terrible. I swear they did not even write a script that just robbed the whole movie. Ice-T was unpleasant like hell. Photh SPOILERS more like reasons to not look at it Sitting and breakfast for 20 minutes. he could have long gone. The country was heavy that it would be almost impossible to watch him with dogs. And when the ICE-T is on this hill and uses the Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN as its sniper rifle (and then cuts a tree with eight shells, it will take 1000 rounds to cut the tree.) Shotguns and handguns are considered inaccurate for 100 yards. And they even saw the reflection. What did light reflect? I did not see scope for this thing. Also, when he was shot in the intestine and went on, it was slow to bleed there. Plus the end where a guy or a cigarette is produced in the boys' head. He did not fire him and kill him. The missile would still kill to kill Ice T but destroy the barrel.
