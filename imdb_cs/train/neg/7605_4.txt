I think the "Gunslinger" was not as painful as most of the films that show "Mystery Science Theater 3000", but the westerns are just not Fort Roger Corman. Exposure to Rose Hood (Beverly Garland), who becomes the sheriff in the Old West after her husband's sheriff was murdered and had to fight the bad, is quite predictable. John Ireland is a new pink that secretly works for the cuddly Allison Hayes (yes, a 50-foot woman). Briefly, Corman's co-star Dick Miller is also a mailman (Miller's star in Joe Dante). I want to say that you will probably want to watch the version of "MST3K" really enjoy this movie. They were great.
