Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a scribbler and she is missing something in her life. She entered the Miss France contest against her friend Andre (Georges Charlia) and wins. She is a Miss Europe title and leaves her friend. He wins again but returns home to Andre because he has asked her. After returning back to her life, she becomes common again, so one night she writes a note and lets her live the glory that awaits her like Miss Europe. Andre watches her ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent movie with a piano track all the way. It also speeds up, so everything seems fast. The restricted dialogue was later added and is very fake. The cast is okay because it is a silent film. The best part of the movie comes at the end, but the story takes too long. After watching it, I'm not quite sure what a great interest in Louise Brooks's looks is - she has a terrible hairstyle that makes her face look fat. I do not need to watch again.
