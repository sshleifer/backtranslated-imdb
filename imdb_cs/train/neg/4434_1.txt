I was following this movie, and I thought it looked like a beautiful, gorgeous historical piece. What I got was a piece of clean waste. This movie was mute in most places, it was almost everywhere, and it was horrible in every place. Mira Sorvino shows the queen playing a young male scholar was at best depressed. Ben Kingsley was supposed to be deprived of knighthood for having considered this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely hold Petunia Dursley; at least Harry Potter movies are more fun than the thing they call acting in the movie. Cinematography looks like a college boy graduated from a 101 in Cinema and unluckyly failed. Almost every scene in the movie is cut to some effect; the end result of course is the easiest bit of editing I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost like Agis; so bad he had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling will make the most of her effort when waiting for a poor lady. Finally, I really want Blockbuster Video to provide compensation. I'm so glad I did not spend ten dollars and watched this fiasco in the theater. If they play the 18th-century Marivaux game, I'm thinking about how many people have worked best during their work. If I was there, they could not hear the snore game. Thanks God for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can go through dull or terrible scenes. I think it means I only followed the beginning and the end!
