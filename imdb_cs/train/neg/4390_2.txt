The TV guide described the story of the ROCKED ROCKER as follows: "The experiment on broken hands is bad," so I thought it would be a shoulder that has its own mind as seen in BEAST WITH FIVE Fingers or Hands or someone who receives a transplant shoulders as part of the body. Both rooms are tested and tested, or more tired and tested, so I was curious about how the producers would approach the story. I really thought shooting a movie like PI was used to use black-and-white photography at the beginning of the film, but the crew seemed to get tired after 20 seconds and decided to do a horrible comedy like "EVIL DEAD". I have very little to say except that I did not like EVIL DEAD films and I did not like GERMAN WALLS and I find it really unfair that such films use an absurd amount of rubber when the third world shouts for condoms
