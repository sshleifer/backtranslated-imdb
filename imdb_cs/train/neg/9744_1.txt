This is one of the worst things ever came out of England, so it says a lot there. The tension, when we need to find out if Lembach stays, is amazing. Upward, she sees a nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table to print her underwear after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This film also has several views of London, although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a traffic accident that gets your heart rate back to just below normal. There is also a watch that teleports away, and the fear of a woman not getting her watch back is paralleled with the horror "Sixth Sense" only much more boring and the British. Add a fight between the British police and dr. Rat, which does not do any good, plus electrifying many people plus a cat and you have yourself ... a British movie. The version of MST3K is pretty good, though none of them best.
