UPA films are surprisingly rated for IMDb, even though the quality of animation is beyond the light of years behind Looney Toons, Disney and MGM. Unfortunately, due to the growing cost of creating nice cartoons with high frame and beautiful background, the UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the 1950s and 1960s. After all, the movies were dirty cheap and they received several Oscars to "prove" that cartoons are now the mainstream. As a result, miserable animation becomes the norm and this trend has not been abolished until the 1980s. UPA film is one of the first films. Characters are very simple to draw (whether they were simpler and use stick patterns) and backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawings with different colors were added very slowly (often with a sponge and rarely completely filled with objects). <br /> <br /> When it comes to the story, it's a Jive story with a strong jazz-style attitude. Some will love it, others will find it, very loud. It's a traditional story of "Frankie and Johnny," and because of shooting and all, it's probably not a great movie for kids. Damn it, because of animation and jazz, it's not a really good movie for me! Some will read my review and no doubt I think I'm a handle (which I am to some extent). But I love animated movies and a bit of this minimalist style UPA is a very, very long way and you can not really consider them a great artwork - just very, very quickly cartoon cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch some classic cartoons or something - something else!
