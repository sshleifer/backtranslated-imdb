Only total waste. I'm a huge fan of the Cusak, that's the only reason I've been watching this movie, but the only reason I can see their presence was the repeat in the full and deeper quality of their precise roles in Grosse Point Blanc. In addition, the role of the film as a political satire is unfortunately aggravated, for it is too obvious that even the deadliest are there to serve any purpose. To post it as a satirical satire would simply be offensive to chimpanzees. The imitation is obviously the highest form of flattery, but as if it was nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as to meet (watch your fool) the Spartans in terms of political satire, let themselves be left alone and let it fall apart the unknown they deserve.
