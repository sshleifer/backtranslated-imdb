If you are not twelve, this movie really is not worth it. It's probably a low-budget movie with B actors and a genre as a fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that is not good. I knew it would be bad to borrow. I like laughing at bad movies. I did not know how bad. It's tolerable until after 2 o'clock, then it really starts to burn. Fighting styles move between normal struggles that follow the laws of physics and the fight against wires. There is no real explanation for transitions. It has a conspiracy, but again, of course, it's a kid's movie. There seem to be explicit moral lessons of that day that are being transmitted, like Sesame Street or something. It's tolerable. But much better if you are, give, nine.
