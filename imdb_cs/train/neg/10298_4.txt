Lynne Ramsey makes arrests of images, and Samantha Morton can make a gesture with gesture. So what troubles them to find out that their talents are useless on this consummate, demanding crowd. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can not bring Callar to life. Her attempts are too artistic and sloppy. Repeatedly, her camera persists in the long silent shots of the horrific actress, as if Morton's ruined look could add character. We are in the empty warhol hell of self-indulgence: for a movie that has a few minutes to save mistakes crawling on the floor, maybe you think it could get to get rid of your protagonist. But how does she do if she rarely talks? Without the inner monologue of the novel, no cellulose Morvern Callar is nobody. No wonder Ramsey Morton is often undressing. <br /> <br /> This means that the first ten minutes were so impressive, shot and edited that my hopes were rising. Give the film so much: knows how to make promises, if not how to keep it.
