Frank Sinatra was far from ideal for westerners. He was a great actor, From there for eternity, and the Golden Arm Man is proof of it but he did not have the character of a Western hero, you identified him as a city guy. But he was trying to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a failure in the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than a hero in the whole movie. In the genre, where people would definitely expect a sample to be diverted from it, the film must be very good. b) The story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra to do everything he wants just because he is afraid of his brother. Also, when a man shows him a special case that opens on his side to make no weapon, you wonder if it makes him invincible, why did not all the shooters take him? I think this movie should not be downloaded because every movie with Sinatra is worth seeing and despite its shortcomings it is still nice
