I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the previews. Under normal circumstances, I see that it is a good preview and I buy the film completely. Something told me that ... you know it's the first one. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley has destroyed all my future films with this role. In the movie of the second pirate when he came out, I went after him. Everything I saw was Domino Harvey, and I hated her for her. I think it had to do with her hair and had to cut it to Domina. Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or care. I do not know who is in real life or who is in this movie. I did not care about her character, and even Keira, who was partly naked, did not want a movie. The direction was definitely lacking. The script was triten and shallow. The adjustment was terrible. I do not mind a style like bad overuse. There is a place for it. Good examples of cracks, MTV style, color changes (not sure if it's official name) would be Fight Club; just from the top of my head. Even the enemy of the state had somewhat similar editing style in parts. It was used tastefully and was not used as a crutch. I think it's the same man who ran the Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please give me your time back. I understand there are many people who like this movie. I think the idea that you either love this movie completely or you hate it completely is a fair assessment. Honestly, I hate it.
