wow, Naked Brothers Band. What should I say? I think I can say that this show is upset. number one: they have no talent, they probably do not even play the tools. Number 2: They said in the store that they were famous, but nobody ever heard of them before a miserable show appeared. Look, I really hate it so bad, I put it like 4 out of 10, but what upsets me is, as everyone says they have such a great talent and Nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep my ass! talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. wow, I could read what he says on the walls of the bathroom and it would be deeper than that. And they were not famous, their parents were celebrity celebrities and wanted their kids to be too bad to make a bad show. I feel soon to be canceled.
