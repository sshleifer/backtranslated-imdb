The question for you: Family to go to a new house and chase demonic powers. Which movie I'm talking about? Any horror movie you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'll try to tell you that there are lots of teen angst scenes. Does not it help? Well, there are lots of pieces where the characters of the herd are creatures and you see the characters through the creatures of the POV. No more ahead? Okay, is there a dream that involves a lot of blood? It could be any horror film you say. Oh, it could take a couple of weeks, so I'm going to say that I'm talking about the Aussies, many of them appearing in the neighborhood and home and away. Yes, that's true, the film is THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the above exercise is? It's about me when I point out how THIRD CIRCLE does not like a horror movie
