I never even knew that this movie existed until I found an old copy of the VHS hidden deep in my dusty cabinet. The title on the box says "Insect," and the illustrations on the back clearly show that it's just another negligible and ill-produced 80th horror movie. Of course, they can be entertaining, of course, if they do not expect a smart screenplay and until you get irritated by seeing a huge amount of cheese makeup. Almost every important aspect that makes horror movie worth viewing is inadequate in "Blue Monkey"! This plot is ridiculous and highly non-original, acting is painful and there is a total lack of tension. As a result of the popular trend of big-bug films, Blue Monkey deals with a new and unknown type of insect that smoothes out doctors and patients in distant hospitals. Manufacturers could not be more cautious about the true origin of this huge size! All we know is that it is not out of the universe and initially crawled from a tropical plant. Besides, there is absolutely no explanation of where this new type of insects comes from! As I said, do not raise your hopes for a smart scenario. The first half of the movie is fun enough, with some pretty gore and the introduction of several contradictory characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) But the other half (when the whole hospital is quarantined) is terribly boring. It is also coming to an end that "Blue Monkey" starts exaggerating older (and better) movies. As the climax was approaching, they probably also exhausted the budget, because lighting became very poor and the guy in the monstrous suit was not too masked. "Blue Monkey" is worth seeing if you are really bored or really want to see every 1980s a horror movie ever made. B-cinema fans can recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns from Outer Space," "Curtains") in the small and absurd role of Roger, who is in charge of the clinic.
