Just when you thought it was safe to return to the water ... Another computer created a mutant croc on the prowl for the human lunchmeat, to release another of these devices driving mad science. Gereco Biotech has gone crazy with growth hormone research and has accidentally released the baby a crocodile that is developing faster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> in the stereotypical role of a corrupt administrative authority that denies any involvement with a giant beast of its equipment to free innocent people.) Charles Napier is a local sheriff whose city is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter working in a pet shelter. Borlenghi is Longenecker's love interest, a local artist who binds the sculptures (of course, his brother is a crown victim). Of course, this skill will come to power when our heroes create a trap for the crocodile, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. /> <br /> Step alone is never a bit convincing, despite reserve looking for food, special effects low the degree of variety. As for Roger Corman's production of unnecessary dinofuners, I hold Carnosaura. Monster is basically a crocodile standing on the hind legs, often erect when watching potential victims. I felt that Mandylor and filmmakers Crocodile Dundee were spoofing with their crocodile hunter, and this imitation could have fun where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker have quite good chemistry on the screen. As expected, Pacula gets her complicated in a gay fashion.
