If another Hitler ever appeared, it would be partly because of nonsense like this film, which spreads the absurd idea that he is visibly enraged fools from the beginning. Far from watching such a person and choosing to the highest office in the country, reasonable people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would die in a ditch, unknown and unknown. Anyone who reads accounts of Hitler's close associates - such as the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge - will be hit by the fact that people have found a kind, intelligent and generous man. He was also a brilliant speaker, and the fact that his speeches look exaggerated and lead to modern ears, ignores the times in which they have become, when the political speeches have been common pompousness. This exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was not even the central part of the early Nazis - who were primarily anti-Communist - was neither unusual nor unusual for times. It sounds like Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. If you want to identify another person who causes the deaths of tens of millions, you can ignore the rumbling ramps life shown here. Look instead for a charming, charismatic man whose persuasive manifestations inspire the whole nation, and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. "" I was hoping there was a lot here, and I have nothing but a cartoon. The fools who shot this thing committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of the word "Asparagus madness".
