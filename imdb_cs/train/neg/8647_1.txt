Amateur in an extreme situation. The camera is particularly hot - documentary camera operators may not rotate all the time. The script is really unpleasant, and acting is even worse. In addition, the story is discontinuous and meandered - with some distinct logical holes. At one point, the leader wants to get in jail to ride his shoulders with suspected Al-Quad workers and get an interview with Osama. The story was totally unbelievable due to many mistakes. The film director / lead role really portrays the rash, idiot frat boy. The only interesting factor is that the filmmakers actually shot the film. It's really a shame they lost their opportunity to do something interesting. Who financed these bulls?
