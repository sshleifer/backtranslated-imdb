Well, how can you even rate a movie like this movie? Does it even have a film value? It is a film that strives to be as close as possible to making the movie slick as possible. Basically, the whole movie is purely a bunch of boys who torture a young girl. It's not very attractive, and it's not realistic. Obviously, the film tried to be as quick and shocking as possible. The film is, however, too fake to work as expected. Flare and stomping are all soft and fake as well as sounding. They are often just digging into the floor, rather than the girl, of course. Also, the way a girl responds to all the torture is quite tame. I think if it was real, she would have screamed. There is more groaning than shouting in this. <br /> <br /> The movie is probably a low budget and it's an effort to achieve something shocking and realistic, as well as original and provocative, with very limited resources. Do not think that this movie had a big influence, even though it was released at the time of release, although it had to do something good because a total of six sequels were released after that. Fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed with this film, though there are still some fetish people out there who get to kick out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
