This is largely a low budget, made for television, a type of movie to make the success of the original. I'm a fan of b-movies and this could be good if the name "Cube" was not added to it because the director and the original plot were better and this movie just destroyed my taste for the whole series. The characters are poisonous and clich√©, there are problems with continuity and a few rigid production screws. The story has hardly a chance to evolve because of unnecessary dialogue and suffers from it. They more or less use the same horror tricks throughout the movie and because the first was so good, it just turns out to be disappointing. If it were a separate b-movie, I probably would give him four. The value of "1" I gave was almost a statement about how she completely faded in effects and intelligence when compared to the first.
