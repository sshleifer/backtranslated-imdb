The disappointing of the predecessor of the first two films, it is neither the first nor the interest of the other. By focusing on boys who "cover" the cube, it basically brings some sense of tension inside the cube, because we just do not care about the characters inside. Much of the movie is just boring and it's really terrible when it comes to the introduction of glass eyes and green eyes of crazy sea. But then, he's just getting into unintentional gaiety. But the end goes well and returns to the first indirect way. The script is horrible, best acting in the medical profession, and the direction is not clear. Much less tracking.
