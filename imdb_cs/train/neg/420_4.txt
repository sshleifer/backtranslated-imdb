For those who would like to see this movie? I would say: Go! Without narration, it could be a very good movie / document. But music, storytelling and some of the stories that have been made make it very difficult to follow skeptics like me. After several lives, their lives in several seasons show a sense of being the animal soap we are watching. The melodramatic view simply does not cut me, and if the predator finally gets ready for the prey (one exception left), the camera will zoom in or skip to another scene. I ask myself why it will happen if they were to show the reality, why did the scenes that remain a melodramatic fairytale alternate? I think morality is important to the mass of the crowd, because after all: it would be unnecessary to destroy this beautiful planet.
