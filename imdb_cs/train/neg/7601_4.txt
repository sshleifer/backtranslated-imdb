This is a movie that shows that mood, music and texture are not enough to create a good movie. Certainly, the audience is treated in the 1930s with many black scenes in Los Angeles - especially I liked the view of a cart that is approaching the tunnel and the tram raises along the slope - but in a sense, it is a wonderful cinematography of self-defeat because it creates a mood, that "something happens" - and there is nothing. Scenario too insists on some plot, action or trauma - and it does not succeed from time to time. I do not even give (I suppose) the subject of the film, the substantial loss of characters. Leading actors who are too good for their roles did not reveal any repression or misery, and the script did not expose us. Donald Sutherland? That's another story. His character was so well thought out, so perfectly played that I wanted the camera to follow him.
