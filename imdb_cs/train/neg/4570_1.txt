Ridiculous. This film is in fact a vehicle for the Ramtha Education School. If you're wondering who Ramtha is: "Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old spiritual warrior who appeared in Knight's Knight Tacoma Kitchen in 1977. Knight claims to be the Ramtha channel, and Ramtha holds a meeting in which he feigns, (Clark and Gallo 1993) He must have hypnotic powers Seeking self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people adhere to her command to spend hours with her eyes in a cool, muddy maze without a door. "John Wheeler, one of America's finest theoretical physicists, frowned at this film. In the recent past, parapsychologists have criticized for their misuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as the fools. <br /> <br /> There is a great overview of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend that everyone who considers watching this movie should read it at first before contributing to the cults. <br /> <br /> http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here IMDb says that this film will receive a grain of salt. It will take a lot of salt to kill the horses to turn into garbage that thinks about this movie.
