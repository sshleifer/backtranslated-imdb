After the excellent AANKHEN (2002), which was the remake of Gujarati, it comes with WAQT, which looks like a scenic game <br /> <br /> In scenic games we have screaming characters, overlapping the same <br /> <br /> The first half shows , that Amitabh is almost attempting for 40+ Akshay Kumar, who acts too funny like a little nerd. The movie has a good news about how not to harm your son but unfortunately the way Amitabh wants Akki responsible is totally false <br /> <br /> Even his reason why his illness, his runnig from the hospital and melodramatic speech is hiding Akki is a reflection Some emotions touch you but most of them are too high <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is cheerful but too stretches in the other half <br /> <br /> The Vipul Shah direction is too exaggerated even though some scenes are good Music is good Amitabh exaggerated it in the first half but is excellent in emotional scenes Akshay Kumar too does his part well but looks comfortable in some too wee py scenes His chemistry with Bachtan is unrivaled Rajpal is the pinnacle , it makes you laugh without overcoming and only his presence and his stupid behavior and dead humor is a rebellion Boman is good in some comic parts, you are loud in places Priyanka is a heroine doing nothing, it's her last film with Akki yet Shefali is amazing though she looks too young for Bachchan
