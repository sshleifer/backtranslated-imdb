Anyone in the blue looks at me a bit and asks, "What's wrong with SNITCH'D?" I know they have instant hidden entertainment and horror. You see, I was a cinematographer in the movie. Let me explain some points regarding this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally SNITCH'D was called SINGLE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, the day after I wrapped up TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that, like so many independent features of the era, never reached distribution despite the festival's award ... fell victim to fine print SAG famed contract Experimental Functions. But I'm going to turn ... While I was on the run, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster swing at 16mm with a budget for shooting around $ 25,000, he took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed the myth. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> Let's just say "movie school" for many people, including me. SNITCH'D was shot over two weeks in August 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama in high school in the last city (yes, it's a dramatic and English teacher ... consider when watching a movie, or even observing the use of the apostrophe in title), from there placement and cast. /> <br /> In her cast, the only known dramatic looks of the girl in LA Channel 2 Morning News, Vera Jimenez, and the bigger impact of Eva Longoria's debut, who just arrived in Hollywood and wanted it when I got the movie under my belt. I have to say that her professional devotion, focus and attitude "do it" inspired me and was the precursor of her star-coming. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, low light or electricity, several boom du jour operators, and uncorrected offline delivery for duplication. None of this conceals real content that speaks for itself. Anyway, until 2003, the film was sold to distributors (at a net loss, I understand), who inexplicably had no photographs of Eva on the box (at that time she was growing, working name), but who managed to get a clear photo of what looks authentic a Latin gangster to devote the credibility of SNITCH'D. Since Cahill's next passion is an antiquarian book, he seems to confirm that he believes you can actually judge the book on his envelope ... just how much he has raised this DVD on his sleeve. One year later, Eve, now on soap, I met James one day to make a simple short film he created, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any game despite the festival's intent. <br /> <br /> Six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie called JUAREZ, Mexico. Although it has developed this process; my participation was dependent on casting, screenplay, and crew control, and the resulting film really looked promising in daily diaries, for it was ... a cheap, detective story about mass murders in Juarez; although Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has a distribution and just awaits release to coincide with the release of the DVD of two studio shots on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BROADBAND.
