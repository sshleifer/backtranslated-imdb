Okay, so Mr Agram's company (who is involved in some dubious deal with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) produced a terrible mish-mash from Mr Carlo Macek. What is this awful mish-mash I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three completely unrelated Japanese sci-fi animated series (namely Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONS dialogue - firmly believing that the American audience is too stupid to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - a whole lot hard for the violent content, added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, dubbed it using the worst voice actor on this side of playing Hell (singing Reba West was - and still is - unbearable and utter resistance, especially compared to Mrs. Mari Iijima) ... And the result was a series with 85 episodes with hundreds of problems with continuity and holes. <br /> <br /> Of course the mosses were great to look at them (especially those in the "Macross Saga") and parts of the land that remained undamaged were good. But what was good with Robots was not the result of Macek's work or "voice talents" he recruited. It was because of efforts and efforts (unnoticed - why? I was too daring to accuse HG plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who finally got into the wind of real dealings and compared the originals with Robots, wish we were never exposed to Robotech. The originals are much better, naturally and much more. <br /> <br /> But Robotech did something useful: he urged legendary anime maker Leiji Matsumoto to launch a campaign to protect Japanese anime creators of "intellectual property from such unjustified and undesirable reprocessing produced by hopeless people like Carl Macek.
