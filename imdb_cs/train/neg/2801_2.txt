After a quasi-gothic and versatile music video, Cassidy begins to sing with herself. In the perfect world, which would be the one and the final credits would roll. We do not live in this world. Endless band members decide to go to a clown to contact her dead essence. When I say a clown, I mean a real clown. He tells them that they all die through Cassidy's spirit (the spirit has Doru, one of his buddies). We could not worry less because the characters are boring, flawed, and extremely horrible. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly close family name if there ever was) and director Corbin Timbrook (who after The attendant and Tower of blood must know he's still crap for life), this film constantly fights between the incompetence of the film and the viewer's need to stay awake . Lack of blood to calm the gore-hounds, or enough nudity to satisfy the pervas. In fact, this film absolutely does not absolutely recommend anything to anyone. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Amanda Carraway gets up <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
