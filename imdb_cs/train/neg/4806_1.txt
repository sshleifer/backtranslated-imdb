I do not know what these Brady children are with. First of all, Barry Williams boasts publicly having sex with her television sister, Maureen McCormick, then dating her television mama, Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for a lot of porn movie. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets into trouble with driving under the influence of alcohol. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum may have had the same gender on their side. Now Christopher (Peter) Knight is watched by a beautiful young model in her early-20s during his stint on "Surreal Life", which was initially fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very unstable and hostile relationship. The last episode she had imagined for a bunch of naked pictures with another naked girl for a notebook that Christopher gave for her birthday was not a good move on his part. And he handled it in a very mature way, just getting up and letting his head clean. I think he always bowed to her, and now he's finally standing up. And I hate to say it, but I think he abused him verbally. The way she tortured him for the engagement ring and the way he cares about him for every little thing. She also speaks openly about having puppets with other women, and it is obvious that she is still sleeping with women and men, which is not something a man he would realize when he married someone. If he were a man who talked to his wife like that and every day he went outdoors and had sex with other people, they would all collapse for wife to leave him. Why it should be different. What began as a cute little rumor on other reality shows has grown into a major disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like other Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, apparently in need of some therapy because she cry like a kid over so many stupid things. I'm sorry, but Chris has to get rid of him because he's a good man who can not afford to be so humiliated.
