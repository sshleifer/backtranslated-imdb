Oh, it's a movie - I thought I waited too long to get a dog ... I can not believe I was watching the whole thing. I think I was optimistic that it would improve. Carefully incoherent dialogue, pathetic behavior, and utterly unlikely events. Just like Toby's mom hanging at Col's time up and back down into a room with a 24 "ceiling and no chairs, counters, or anything else around her hung-up body that might climb to make herself a girl who played the daughter of the last family, she was the best in the movie, and the first couple's puppy was close ... The basic story has the potential and the good script, and the director could be a really scary film, but this version is unfortunately not a great deal. electricity.
