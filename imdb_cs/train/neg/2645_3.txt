The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete wreck. The script is weak and was presented poorly. The film has no life in life. Eddy and MacDonald would be better if they made a movie concert for their final pairing. There's nothing wrong with their singing, it's all the rest in this turkey that's overcooked.
