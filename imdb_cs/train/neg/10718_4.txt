Come on, Tina Fey, you can do better. Once the movie started, I knew how it would end. Certainly it was fun sometimes. He even laughs loudly funny. But not enough laugh to save this movie. I do not recommend buying it. Most recommend renting, but all. Baby Mama has some fun scenes but is predictable and can not have the desire for a hearty end. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have done this great and doing well. But that's not the best. Baby Mama had great support. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add up to the cast. With another pregnancy film, she has entered the world of cinemas. After the great Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very good when compared. Happiness and Juno are glad, heart and ending, leaving you with a smile on your face. Baby Mama ended unhappily and boringly. Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and it does not try to be. I recommend this, but do not expect him to be completely cheerful. Expect an average comedy that does not give the big emotional ending it's trying to get. I give Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
