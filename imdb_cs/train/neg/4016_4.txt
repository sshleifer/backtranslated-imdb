DVD is published in 2002 DVD Code HRGD002 on the packaging, the disc is not ASIN, VFC 19796, at the inner edge no IFPI code. Probably direct transmission from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is no big point to comment on an adult movie. But this contains a minimal conspiracy and the characters are credible. It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas. I saw it in Pensylvanni back in 1975. As such, it deserves a place in the Encyclopedia of Films. The DVD has no special features and no subtitles and is probably made using a VHS tape as a source
