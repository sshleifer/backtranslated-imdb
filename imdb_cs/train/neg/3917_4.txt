"House of Ghosts" is pretty awful. I live in South America, a country that has suffered a military dictatorship as well as the film it tries to describe, and although everyone knows that movies can be far from reality, this film will attract the audience both unknowingly and stupidly. Things are not as straightforward and linear as they appear here, and of course the political process is much more complex and interesting than the land in "House ...". If you can not show that the screen is more complicated, it is better not to create a movie at all. There are many examples of how serious politics can be taken in the cinema without much in common. In some parts, I felt that Carmen Miranda could appear inside parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you must be not only cautious but also respectful of your public intelligence.
