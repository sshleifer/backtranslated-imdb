Indeed, they spelled it BRAIN in credit, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they did not have a spell check budget. All the production money went to big old cars. Here are at least two Packards. One of them is Darin Cabrio. Nice Yellow Packard Convertible. Film studio scenes show that there was some money spent on costumes and decorations. There were also old cameras, Ciro exteriors, street signs and all that needed to make a visually appealing picture. Badly written and controlled. My DVD says it's running for about 104 minutes. It was about 85 minutes. The end was over without a conclusion. There was a collision, but no conclusion. The movie just broke up against credits. 99 cents for it. I paid 99 cents for it. I could buy three cans of cat food and watched the face of the cat as it aroused more excitement. A few seconds on the Ciro scene when Darren McGavin got the call, it seemed possible. .. this movie would have a surprising twist that would bring an interesting movie. Then she just sat. The young Latin actor, played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya), could have a much larger part in all that's happening here. This cast could be a good movie. I think if they shot Brian's part and used Steven Bauer in his place and changed the script and saved Packard and lost the band and added the sound of Johnny Otis band, then they got something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
