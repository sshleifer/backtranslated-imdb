This bad remake of classical music from 1963 begins quite well, then replaces tension with muddled and unnecessary special effects. For example, in the original, one of the coldest moments, when Nell and Theo were lying side by side in double beds, listened with horror to the sounds outside their room. Nell tells It's to let go of her hand because she hurts her. Nell then looks at Theo, a few meters away, realizing that it is not Theo who holds his hand. In the latest version, Nell lies in bed alone when he suddenly sinks and slides down the floor. Only when the invisible force tells her to stop pulling her we will find out what happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's last words mean - "Is it about a family, is it always about a family"? One redeemed feature is Lilly Taylor's performance, but it can not even save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones again shows that her beautiful exterior is a small depth. In the original, Claire Bloom gently suggested her lesbian beliefs. However, Zeta-Jones must explain this by asking Nell whether he has a friend - or a girlfriend. Surely what is to be sent to the meaningless remakes of the cemetery.
