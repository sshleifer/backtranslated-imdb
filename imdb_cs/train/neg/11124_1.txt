Generally, I do not worry about violence in movies or a huge amount of philosophy, symbolism, or psychology. This is all very good for me and the film brings us a lot. There are beautiful pictures of lake and nature, good character setting, good direction. This movie could be chosen as a good movie. However, it is ruined for two reasons and for both reasons, this film is simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First, there is violence against living creatures against this living creature. It was not film violence, I'm talking about real violence. This violence in itself may be legitimate, if not, and that is reason number two; the message of the film was not just an introspection about the fact that the directors broke the relationship with women. Not that they do not have any real dealings with women (or Men). However, the film was destroyed. <br /> <br /> * The spoiler * Our "heroine" eventually dies, (here is my own hand, if I remember correctly, I saw this movie years ago and that made me angry, now the guy out there with the new movie Witch, definitely she will not watch) and is now more clearly represented as a natural demon, the nature that grows above her, especially her sex. Of course, it is a director who "kills" the heroine of women. Women must die, especially when men are attracted to their sexuality. It seems to be the final conclusion. ** end spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, it might be all right with me if the director kept his mind on himself. But use great images, artistic directions of cruelty to living beings, just say that men can be scared by women and men are cruel to women. It just is not enough. I knew that when I saw this film, I would get good critics of "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and any approach. But for me, this movie is completely destroyed.
