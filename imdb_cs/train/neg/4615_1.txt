I do not have the longest attention, but it's the second film I refused to see all the way, and even bought it on DVD because of the "classic" state. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I waited for a resolution, something to laugh, something that keeps me interested, but this resolution never came. Rather, the script was ridiculously amateur, the film stretched and felt discontinuous, as if someone had made a television series with long features. Academies must be on drugs when they nominate this film to less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> I repeat again. This is the second film I have refused to watch all the way. The first was the Exterminator. I hope it gives you a mark of how bad it is. 1/10
