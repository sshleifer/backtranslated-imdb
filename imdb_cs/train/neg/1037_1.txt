The fact that this bad excuse for demonstrating the amateur clock was featured on Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most independent filmmakers today. <br /> <br /> First, there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. Just pick up a 16 mm camera and show who has a line does not mean a real movie. I think we have to think that we are happy that the director did not pick one's camcorder ... Second, indie movies are about real people. There's nothing real about this movie. None of the characters will find that it is even remotely human. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We apologize, but it's not good writing or good leadership. <br /> <br /> What's left is the robbery of the bad movie that somehow got to Sundance. It's hard to believe it was one of the best movies ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I lost what's left of the Sundance brand.
