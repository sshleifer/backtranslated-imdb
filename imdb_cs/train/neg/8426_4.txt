"Women, they're all washing machines ...!" <br /> <br /> No, it's not a good translation; not at all! It lags behind last year's "tattoo army," the special magic of the little screen of the original TV sitcom is missing, and it is not even missing a big screen ... could you just say that this film is good for Britain, which goes into decline and, even though the * British film industry * is on the decline. And that's hardly a recommendation, is that? To be an example of sad foolishness ... Everything that remains after the subtlety of the original original has been surgically removed, Cliff Owen, Galton and Simpson are: endless, dilapidated musical cues, yawning, from Ron Grainer ... strengthened sentimentality dirty, deeply rooted end ... how far more daring the second Steptoe movie seems to be in comparison) increased seedliness - with the director and writers, seemingly completely detachable - fully usable as "unusual monstrosity" (really at this point) since 1973 " Mutation". On the scene where Harold is suppressed in a rugby club, he's a strangely distorted, distorted tone that I hated and repeated (as suggested by a friend in the mood of a TV series ...), but at least it looks like an original gradient and symbolic for a tension that was born in Britain only in 1972 ... But there is an implied prostitute, like a "golden heart", who becomes a freelance woman - traitor 'pon poor auld' Arold - and out of the cartoon of writing a 'class' element; not to mention surprisingly misguided performances from usually reluctant leadership. Brambell and Corbett collaborate with the script and really do not throw it out of the basic ham. What would be Anthony Aloysius Hancock ...? I just admit that a few moments of work - especially those where G & S play things a little more cautiously and B & C touch the candidates' nerves - and that is not an inconsistent thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But, oh, how pain is I say: it's tedious, boring, both deliberately separate from reality and what made the TV series great and also in full accord with the lazy , 'misogynist' fuck it, it will do ... the actuality of most of what was allowed to go for mainstream film production in Britain at that time.
