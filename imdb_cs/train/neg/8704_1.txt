Generally I like dinosaur movies, but this is a clean bun. No script, no dialogues, no negotiations. And courageous Colonel Rance, who is trying to show he is heavy and so curved, his mouth recalls like a twin brother, the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So it was a complete waste of time (fortunately I did not waste money as I saw the movie on TV). And I really can not understand the 7 people who rated it. My advice if you see this title running out of it!
