Up to this point, Gentle Rain was the film I found the worst in history. It has been replaced by this "argument" from Asia. He has one "star" and it's John Rhys Davies. He is completely different from being a magical, magical flying bad. The rest of these people could not leave the junior high school. There were no cliches in the dialog and special effects were called as often as possible. It is relatively easy to see that somebody in Asia had some money and needed to create a vehicle for some players who wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was a director or a writer who needed a loan. My guess is that every career with this movie in his commission <br /> <br /> Do a great favor and do not look at this movie. A hundred thanksgiving could not consume this turkey. One funny scene was unintentional. The king's brother appears on the scene. King? A handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? Six feet of European. (There was also a bad actor.) There was no justification for that. We waited for not to notice that Brother Jet Li was a poor man Pierce Brosnan in a cheaper denim wig from an old western film from the 1940s.
