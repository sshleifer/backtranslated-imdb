So they encouraged violently and were labeled sick. Well, violence is the best I am afraid of, but unfortunately these characters are not well developed to allow us to understand why they get to their (completely predictable) rampage. This movie really has a terrible script. We never have a chance to meet Robert and his actions at the end are simply pathetic. Even the acting is not much better, the worst of them is the television chef and the school teacher. Direction is clumsy, fast enough to send you to sleep. What is the school movie project in the world? Can you comment on the movie itself? The use of intelligence during the peak murder is ridiculous. These guys obviously think they're intellectuals, but they're hopelessly out of their depths. As the great Jorgos Arvanitis got to the ground to enlighten him, I will never know. And how they got the money to put it in the first place is even more mysterious. Absolutely terrible over understanding.
