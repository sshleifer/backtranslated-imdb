This is a complete Hoax ... The film was clearly shot in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - vehicles are Indian; Writing around the world is used in Hindi in India. Passage is on the typical streets of Jaipur. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. Movie makers in their DVD Bonus are probably doing the risk that their lives are filming in Kabul and around. Almost all their action scenes are shot dead in India. The scene where she sees the group that sings around the fire is so fake that they have not even thought of turning it into a folk song Afghan. They have just recorded the folk song Rajasthani. How do I know this because I traveled this area very much. They are just on a tracked car to get this big problem. I urge the filmmaker to deny it.
