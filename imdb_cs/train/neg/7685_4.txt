The contrasting melodrama, based on the William Gibson story, was produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincent Minnelli! Richard Widmark appears in a later, honest rural nursing camp where his loose wife fights with the self-proclaimed Queen Bee Lillian Gish and Widmark himself gets a scary eye for the newly arrived Lauren Bacall who after the death of her husband and child. Terrified and confused, in a confidential time and place, and with the "David and Lisa" love story hidden in plush marsh. Widmark and Bacall have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. Exactly one hour, most dialogues are about what to do with the curtains hanging in the library (these threads are not used as symbolism, it's more of a herring in mystery!). The image hopes the loggerheads will show that people who come with different people are working in the same profession, and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the circular approach that Minnelli breaks out is neither informative, nor educating or entertaining. ** z ****
