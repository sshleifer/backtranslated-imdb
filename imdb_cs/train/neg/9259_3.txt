"Omen 4: The Awakening" is for the TV sequel to the original film "The Omen". Instead of Satan, who has the body of a little boy, the body has a small girl adopted by rich parents who are bullied in school and who are revenged against those who do wrong. The film seems to be fighting any horror factor, and the many events that happen are simply stupid than scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround him. I did not find this film too thrilling or scary, especially compared to the original.
