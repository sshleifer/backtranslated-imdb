The master game is only a few days away, but things in New Orleans are not as they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems for a freelance killer, life becomes a way of what should be an unforgettable, wonderful time. Can things go wrong and the killer paused before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> Despite what you could read about Superdome for the first time, it's not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing but a story and an idea. Instead, Superdome is another of those miserable series that have been made for Hollywood-based TV films and will never be. A stellar touch will go through this thing and no one really does look good. The best (or the worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role to look generally lost, why he is there. The story is boring, uninteresting and incredible. Donna Mills as a hit man? Yeah, right! It's probably as believable as a matter with a liqueur dipped by David Jansen. The film also lacks some tempo. I'm trying to get all four or five stories into the movie. Record any flow that Superdome could have. Without a sudden run or tension, Superdome will end up being a very bad example of a 70s movie. The lonely emphasis for me was through my voice over the work of late Charlie Jones, an athlete I missed to listen to. An expressive way of overcoming intrigue and excessive hype is the atmosphere in New Orleans pure cheese at its best. <br /> <br /> Like most others who have seen Superdome, I've also done such a favor from the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of KTMA's public episodes, but it's one of the best examples of early exhibitions. So, even though I have just named Superdome 2/10, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating.
