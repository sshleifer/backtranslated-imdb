The TV Guide calls this film a secret. What is a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture that can produce such complex and complex classical music and brilliant mathematics can not produce a single film that rises above the contemptuous shilling level, which is so perfectly represented by this film. It is Bollywood in the best / worst, I honestly can not distinguish. Unnecessarily sweet, cheesy clich√©s at every level, story, situation, dialogue, music and choreography. If you want to say that without meaning, you have to be retarded to enjoy it. I was looking to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were moments when I had to give up because I could not take it anymore. The only redeemed quality of the film is the beautiful beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
