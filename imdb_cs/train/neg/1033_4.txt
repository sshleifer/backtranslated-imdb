I grew up on Scooby Doo where you are, and I still love him. It's one of my favorite movies along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show is good for kids, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the motif melody is acceptable and has some nice animation. But it is somewhat disappointing. Normally I do not mind Scrappy, but when he appears to be the main character, he gets poisoned quickly. Complete with the catchy Puppy Power stage, Scrappy is a little more unpleasant than usual. Also half of the gang is missing after the first year, somehow it did not feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and stories were generally chirped and non-original, they were very few to chase creatures or unlucky. Overall, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a trace, but this show is a disappointment. 4/10 for animation, voice, melody, and the fact that it's nice for kids. Bethany Cox
