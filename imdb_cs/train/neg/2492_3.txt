I think I've seen worse movies, so I give it 3, but it's a fight to remember what they could be! Maybe Xtro (ugly and matte) or perhaps Creep (just boring), but it's an effort to think a little worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's say it's Under the Siege, where the guy who is even poorer is Jean Claude Van Damme. The only redemption was Casper Van Dien - I was always interested in what happened to him on Starship Troopers. Yes, it was Johnny Rico if you really want to know. I'm judging from these pages, he was stuck in a television movie hell .... Casper, be more selective .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I have just turned and there is a half-decent film about the so-called Criminal Law ...... now I'm getting really excited about the last 1.5 hours !!!
