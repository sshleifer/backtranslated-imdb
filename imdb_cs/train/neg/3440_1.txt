never look at this movie ... that's the biggest stack I've ever met all my life. and it says something. acting, storyline and filming were totally terrible, that's the BEST FILM ON THE WORLD !!! it really does not even give you a hit because it cost me 99p from sainsburys and it was only in 2005? hahaha this movie is like an inexperienced college film, you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... though if you really want to watch that you have to watch the "scary shark scene" ... maybe the best actress I've seen in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously it's the biggest waste 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
