What a disappointment ... of course, the best of the ancestors, but the story is weak, the plot is submerged and the final result is just a collection of pieces, poorly realized and strapped together amateur. There are numerous mistakes of continuity which, in sharp contrast to original films and the emergence of Darth Vadera, have been so terribly remarkable that what could be a legendary moment in modern cinematography is now instead a bent goof which will be ridiculed for many years. I will not complain about the unfortunate dialogue because they are the Star Wars ... the original three films had style, cult feelings and cracked stories, and a strange dialogue added magic. The forerunners were shallow attempts to make more money and this lack of love is reflected in the spikes. Clear disappointment.
