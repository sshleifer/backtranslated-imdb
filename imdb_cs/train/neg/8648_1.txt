Well, basically the film is blowing! Blair Witch encounters a bad idea of ​​Sean Penn's fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what it really means "the war on terror". The script looks like it's the eighth grader (no offense for the 8th grade); two main actors convert the whole movie; they used the wrong type of camera and the bad type of movie (not that you did not know anything about it - but it just did not look like the real documents I was watching) and the worst of all that Christian Johnson had a great idea and did it suck. It reminded me that I was trying to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a really bad figure that looked more like a huge turd. I'd rather look at Blair's Witch VIII before sitting down again.
