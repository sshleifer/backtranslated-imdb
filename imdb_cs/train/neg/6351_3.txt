Possible spoilers. Although there was some good acting - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the comedy - it was just not an eye-catching movie. The segues between comedy and tragedy were unpleasant or sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the pad differs in both halves; I was thinking about the way in which the people at Melinda would be the same people, responded differently (more, "He Said, She Said" assumption). However, we have two totally different stories and two completely different women, both of which are played by Radha Mitchell. Two playwrights in the opening scene - comedians and tragedies - are supposed to have the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are just tense. They discuss little, which is that almost everything can be considered a comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but unsatisfactory movie.
