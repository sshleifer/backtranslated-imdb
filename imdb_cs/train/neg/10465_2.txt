I really wish I did not describe this review. I'm a Christian, so I expected to see this movie. It sounded great - a Christian film with some rather famous stars and a conspiracy that seemed interesting (not that I'm going to buy the Biblical code itself - you can say what you want, but believe it all in the Bible). So I'm sitting on the edge of my seat and enjoying the previews when the film pops up and in a few minutes it can ruin my mood. I had to bite my lips to stop commenting on horrible writing and acting when I was in the theater (I would be torn by people who got angry at somewhat clumsy but essentially uplifting scenes and breathed on the crazy and predictable scenes of the Amendle Volume, I'm siiua oriented But when the final loans started to move, they could reflect on me, it was many parts of the movie I liked - some of the most unexpected plot, some effects that were really strange (I do not count on the Vision, you were badly done) and some interesting technical work - it's disappearing, sort of thing, but I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation on the monkey and I leaned in front of the typewriter, I could get a better script and the music was out of cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes raw music in scenes of action and intrigue) I wish I could be like everyone else in a diva as people who came crying and breathing because it was unbelievable - but I'm not someone who can be reassured by a writer who throws a few words over the Biblical Shells and celebrates a Christian stamp. I need a good plot and a trustworthy dialogue before I can enjoy most of the films, and it just did not. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And that's a tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction? It must be somewhere outside ...
