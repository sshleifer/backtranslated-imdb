Painful. Painful is the only word that describes this terrible rendition of such a fun and interesting Shakespeare game. I gave it, but he was terribly disappointed and could not even finish browsing. To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this oppression was Many Ada, I am your and your bored brain. Let your prejudices about young spectators rise without compensation. Please do not bother with this terrible, disgusting excuse for performing Shakespeare's well-known drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a comode near the TV you choose to follow with this bull because of involuntary defecation.
