The film is about a sabotage for losing in a fun park where teens are hunting for hunts. Because there are no rules, they penetrate the building and begin to be killed. Deaths are cheese and they are stupid. But at least it had better effects than sage. I gave her three because Stacy was in it and I loved the film Sabretooth. I thought it was ok but some deaths were out of the screen. There was a silly scene where two teenage kisses and the sabote's head jumps out and the boy leaves his girlfriend for leaving her to have her totally false red courage. Then the sage gets up in the winds and bites children. The end of death with the owner was utterly fake graphics. Even the death was stupid because the statues of the teeth were passing through their mouths and hanging there as if they were supportive, and there was a scene when a goth girl lost her contacts, found it and did not seem to need it. The film is idiotic and a waste of time.
