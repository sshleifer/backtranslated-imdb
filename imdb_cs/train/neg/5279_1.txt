My friends are usually able to deal with many hopeless movies, but this was too poor to even watch them till the end. It was so boring and non-original. Even the "hot" girls who played in this movie could not watch me. Everything was simply predictable and annoying. The effects were sometimes good ..... but several times bad. The most unpleasant figure in the whole movie you just wanted to die of must be your best friends. The more I saw him, the more I wanted to break the screen. (you know what a fat nasty kid I am talking about) The plot was done so many times before I think they should be sued by other film companies. Well, it's a good idea, but this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie can only be watched if you save yourself some abuse from your friends. Or if you have absolutely nothing better.
