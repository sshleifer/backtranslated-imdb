I've read all these reviews about how good this movie is. Jeez, this movie was predictable and quite dull. The performance was mostly below average, especially Mckenna. I have not seen a pathetic attempt to make someone "bad" in the movie. Oh, man, this movie was disappointing. Somewhere I read that it could be a cult classic. I know there are the film's followers, but this movie was just the average piece of the film. The script was lame, for the most part he was actor, this film was lame. > <br /> Oh, pray for that guy who was at Cheers. It looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably a fellow in Office Space, and he was only in this movie about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
