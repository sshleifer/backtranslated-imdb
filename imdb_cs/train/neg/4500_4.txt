This movie is not really horrible. Someone remarked that Mo is a type of American European. But there are those, not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who did not care about the French; and Xavier's character will not rock them. <br /> <br /> Consider its stereotypical French attributes: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynic - very cynical. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, attic appearance, control, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). Great Kitchen Award. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 4). Lukewarm's ethics of work. Control. (Forget about being a wealthy broker because watching him in the movie, he seems to give ten hours of work.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check it out. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Free interpretation of marriage vows. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 7). A big sexual ego that says an American girl owes you sex if you buy a dinner. Make sure Mo is huh or not, there is no reason to fall for this humorous European insidious other than the scenario dictating. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other men reviewers, I enjoyed seeing Karen Allen being a cute, tiny body. I give the film four stars; two of them are for it.
