Well, I tried to delay the fact that I was basically lying to me in the sale of EVP as a real movie. I thought hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still loved Dracula to live with it. Still, I agree, the film is not just good. It's competently created and it is, but it really does not catch you at all. There are a few "jump" moments, and I looked at them and thought "yeah, I did not expect it" without actually jumpin 'at all. Also, resolution does not make sense. If there is a power that is capable of doing what it seems to be, then why the hell does it need to use a proxy? Moreover, the ending description was absurd. They obviously said this as part of "Make the credibility of the film by saying that it's all real" thing, but to work it must be at the beginning. But they can not put it to the beginning, because then they give the conspiracy away ... push it to the end, it just started like a painful thumb.
