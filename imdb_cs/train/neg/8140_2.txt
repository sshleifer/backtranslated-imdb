I saw this movie at a mysterious science theater when it was called "Live at Night". The title is much less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact, it would be more accurately called Batperson. This film is about a doctor who studies bats, I think, because he wants to better treat rabies. This is not entirely clear. It is clear that he and his wife will go through the cave and he will bite him with a bat. Why a scientist must take a tour to study the bats is behind me. He should not be able to go alone. Well after he was bitten, he and his wife are going to a honeymoon where he gets bouts. They go to the worst doctor. The guy stays in the hospital and kills his sister. Eventually, the guy will kill 3-4 people and his wife is standing beside him, and you should be rooted for him instead of a sheriff investigating the murder.
