I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in the sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw it, I listened to the original Broadway record and I really loved it! But when I saw it, I was glad, what the hell ?! This movie is missing a lot of music from the music when it's loud! Who decided to do this ?! <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical he ever did! The film looked more like a Hollywood ensemble than the beautiful Scottish Highlands. Who the hell decided to remove all Meg's songs from the movie ?! <br /> <br /> I am willing to bet that Lerner and Lowe were probably interested in seeing this film: "Who decided to do this in our masterpiece?" They had the right to say that if they were, they were probably crazy by Hollywood turning his great musical into this rather empty film. A song and a wise acting, Mr. Kelly, you've been through a movie that lacks a lot of text. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good movie based on Frederick Lowe's and Alan Jay Lerner's music, this is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
