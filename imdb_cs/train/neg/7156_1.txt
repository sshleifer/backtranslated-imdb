Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, surely after this endurance test of the film. How did I continue without hitting the button for a quick premature rewinding. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is me! Maybe I do not have the assumptions about the movie ... or maybe I will not appreciate that it's a mysterious atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the movie is about such a mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. In addition, all the characters were horrible, and Tom & Jerry's cartoon featured another character. Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing this? why do I look at it like this? It is enough for a man to escape and join a monastery or Alien legion! YAARGH !! Absolutely awful movie in almost every respect. Besides, it's not bad.
