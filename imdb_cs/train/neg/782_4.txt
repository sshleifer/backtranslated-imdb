Apart from the fact that George Lopez is a tough blockbuster, his show is terrible. Nothing of Lopez was fun. I watched his stand and never gave no laugh similarity. His thing appears abominable, and his insult to the white people radiates from every pore of his body. <Br /> <br /> I laugh white people with jokes from many comics and I love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that will not end. <br /> <br /> It feels bad for Hispanics who only have this show they pose. <br /> <br /> The exhibition area is always a cookie cutter with a Hispanic accent. <br /> <br /> Cannon laughs at the deepest comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> This could be why this show is always at 2:00 in play.
