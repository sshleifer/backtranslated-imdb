I caught this movie on science fiction before I went to work. If you have any interest in seeing Dean Cain immerse and avoid being surrounded by flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If it's not the peak of your interest, well, I'm afraid you wish you were surrounded by flames because this movie is pretty bad. Efficacy is first terrible, terrible, terrible. The characters are totally unpleasant and the dialogue is worse than your typical Sci-Fi movie. By the end, I began to remind the film "Hollow Man" (complete with escape through elevator shaft), except for the Dragon, not the naked, invisible man. Unlike other similar films, however, it was not amazingly bad ... it was simply bad.
