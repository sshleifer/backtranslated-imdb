Here is an indie movie that I really wanted, but in the end it could not. The lack of a screenplay (courageously renowned in the main titles) really shows and kills the picture. The story is a senseless mess that is not worth trying to find out. I was quickly bored in 10 minutes, then I suffered for the remaining first 40 minutes - I hope the best - before the chapter drops, stops (mercifully) to get to the end ... even it is not worth extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE apparently tries too hard to be clever, picking up his best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has not yet been, and better. This movie would be much more fun as a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it only feels cushioned and forced. Of course, there's no money in the shorts, so I've completely understood the financial reasons that I suppose I motivated it to be extended for 75 minutes or more. Director Matt Steinauer shows a great promise and I wish him luck.
