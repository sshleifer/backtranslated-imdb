"Iowa" wants to be a "Requiem for Dream" for Midwest Meth, but it hits the hard R "Reefer Madness". <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad and meth is terribly malignant, like addiction and destroying people, families, and communities. But these characters, who are either stupid or ridiculous, and the vacant land can not teach this lesson to anyone. <br /> <br /> While writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on canvas, his partner Diane Foster plays unhappy stupid widespread innocent drug-damaged was already satirized by Susan Sarandon at The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I was really sorry for the totally useless nudity she had received. By the end of the movie, I realized that I think these two were new high school graduates who explained some of their na√Øves because we were bombarded with their school photos, but if they did, they even looked older than people on the OC. While they have a good chemistry on the screen, they are a pale imitation of the "Badlands" -type couple. <br /> <br /> Guests are badly used. Michael T. Weiss, who was so good on the TV series "The Pretender", is totally absurd as a corrupt officer, and his brutal violence is simply crazy because his character largely destroys any social significance for the film. Rosanna Arquette must be even more modest than she was rolling around David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano. John Savage even has an old baby boomer's excuses on my mouth that I'm sweating, but that's worse. Goth chick appears with a strange explanation that she is a stripper from Des Moines. Looks like a mandatory Latin drug dealer - in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the view of the internal use of meths is used entirely live, with absolutely terrible hallucinations. Surely we see them crazy. <br /> <br /> While Iowa sites are used very well (including the fun scene of gas propane propane), the accents and ecclesiastical links are a confusing Southern Baptist. It seems that the weapons are used by law that complies with the law and violates the rights of citizens here more than any drug center in the city center. The songs of the best-known Iraq, bard Greg Brown, are used all over the world, but they are not weird about credit. I hope they were used with permission. I caught it during his commercial run in NYC because I was the last Tribeca Film Festival, where he got a considerable - and unexplainable - sound.
