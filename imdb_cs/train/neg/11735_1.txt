This movie really annoy me because the main characters or all the characters have a south accent. I live in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people do not have a south accent here. This movie is about a guy who does Meth and I do not know a real plot or what the film expects to be around. She has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really offensive so she sees that these people use meth as sugar. I lost my brother so that meth and this film cause me to feel my stomach ache, because it is a charm of the drug. The movie looks great to use the drug, but in the end I was happy when the guy almost crossed the state border. I also know that most women who experience traumatic rape do not want to love a friend or husband for the next day. The film is simply wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I designed a film about drugs.
