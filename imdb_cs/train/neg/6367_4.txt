This film has the look and feel of a student film project. Yeah, there are some interesting (though occasional) adjustments and shots, but the final result was juvenile. The director does not seem to say, "Look at this movie." He seemed to say: "Look at the ME! I am the director!" <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
