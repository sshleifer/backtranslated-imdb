After a long reading about how great this movie is about how Ruiz realized between French critics (especially the Cahiers crowd) when I finally saw him a year ago, I found out that he was quite disappointed (but then I think , expectations were high). This deliberately brain film (made for television and mercifully only an hour long) was filmed in a saturated black and white color, in the form of a conversation between an artist and an out-of-screen narrator when they think through a series of images (which are displayed in the tableaux vivants style) to find out if they have any traces of a hidden political crime. (The terrible movie Kate Beckinsale Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot about in this film, but I think almost no Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
