# 1 Vampires vs. People # 2 Military-Reject Gross Team First Respond to Dangerous, Unknown Vampire Vampires. # 3 Sexy Female Vampire on the "Good Guys" side. <br /> <br /> # 4 Lots of gore and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) large fence devices that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then another story of the device does not have to discourage you ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In the Universe. <br /> <br /> The last one almost got me, but I liked watching. In a pile of terrible horrors directly into the video, a sci-fi channel Halloween Marathon ... this film is a breath of fresh air. He will oppose any other offer of Sci-Fi channels, and even against another film vampire Natassie played in (who still gives Uwe Boll the money?).
