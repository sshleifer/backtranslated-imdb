William Hurt diving scientist ??? US agents conducting investigations abroad? The sickly contaminated man kicked his butt after the fall of 20 feet on his back and ran? The sniper is missing and will not kill Hurt (just wound him), but the second "kill" shot is dead? Waste of time. Comparing it to fall, as other reviewers did, is ridiculous. And by the end of the film, they decide to wear gloves on their hands except for the "evil" agent, and Hurt decides to kill him by handing him a "handshake virus". What? BTW ... when does IMDb require 10 lines of text? Just here blabbering. Does not only match the content of reviews if you need x lines?
