When I loved "Paris, It's T'aime," I was really expecting this movie and I admit that I came up with high expectations, but was largely disappointed for many reasons. Although I did not expect to re-make "Paris" in New York, I expected the same structure. What I liked in Paris was the division of districts. You feel every style of director and story they want to say. 'NY' is not a clear separation of stories, there are characters from different stories in different places in the film, which made me wonder who I was watching and what was going on. The override switch was also obvious, but confusing because there was no flow. Another thing I loved in the movie "Paris" was different love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unusual love, a lonely, medium-long woman longing for love, etc. She explored so many layers of complexity of love among people. "NY" seemed to be just nervous, overcoming sexuality. There were some repayable shorts (the older couple spent together, Julie Christie's short), but overall the movie "NY" did not bring any emotions to me. I did not associate with any of the characters I did with 'Paris'. I remember watching Paris and feeling deep sorrow, loneliness, desire, hope, miracle ... he just had so many souls. For me, no soul was in the movie "NY". Perhaps if I got into this without Paris appearing in Paris as a comparison, this film could bring a more positive response, but as the suicide of taking over "Paris, It's T'aime." I was very disappointed.
