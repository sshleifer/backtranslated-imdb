Tobe Hooper made great movies, so I was sure he could not be a BAD. I have not read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous movie. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes it made me almost CRY for Hooper. I rated this 3/10, because his "horror" in 1990 became very interesting and fun. push. During the movie I thought something like "just can not add more stuff to this movie ..." .. but they did. Some say it's some kind of Firestarter clone, but it's really not. It's based on this idea, but that's all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / divine things, fun gore, simple effects, drama, spooky acting, unbelievable scenarios ... and more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Story: The highest weapon using nuclear power or something that failed, during the process the baby is born for 2 probationers. When my mom sings to her baby after birth, both men and wife burn and it is spontaneous burning. The government is burying the whole thing and letting this child live among other people, and then ... after x years, the child grows up and realizes that he was born for some reason and who can burn things with his brain. Then everything goes unbelievably dirty, nothing really explains anything and ... Well, when the government realizes "Well now it can set fire to work" They take it to a normal hospital where there is some nuclear toxic what they will use on this man PRO They could to kill him, but they can not shoot him! .. and I guess, I think that's enough to say, I promise there are 100 other special things in this movie. Well, if you want to laugh good, watch this. Damn it.
