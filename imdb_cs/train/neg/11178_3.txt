First, I have to admit it's not a good movie. And I would never watch this movie if Pacino was not there. The film is about an odd audience for 24 hours. And he's overworked, dizzying, sick, and sometimes sorrowful. like the character at all. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you can sleep. And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this terrible movie. Just because money or what? > Because I'm a passionate fan of Pacino, I bought this 2002 People I Know. If you have not bought them yet, do not even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
