This film is another example of the East Asian film's curse: two or more separate stories were filmed in one movie. The other evaluators apparently picked up because there are several references to the "first part" and "the second part". How can you have any character development or a deep conspiracy when the characters and the story are performing for so short a time? I enjoyed the first part until it suddenly stopped (there was no ending, it stopped in what seemed to be in the middle of the story) to be replaced by an unpleasant and utterly unbelievable second part that seemed to be focused around the girl moving and clean up a flat in a boy (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai got a decent script you can work with!
