Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who played a small role in classic The Warriors) is the first person to realize that murderous slugs are in his small town. It's not just slugs, but carnivorous killers larger than normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who are still going as fast as a normal slug, which is not scary, but I turn). No one first believes him, but they do it. Oh, yes, they will. Okay, the killers are right over the psychotic labyrinths and right under Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creep. So the absurdity of all this is quite obvious from how to get there. Flick is somewhat fun and the variety is "so bad that it's good". I appreciate that they said they were snails: film unlike slugs: children's game or slugs: other white meat. It's probably not worthy to watch it more than once and immediately forget, except playing a somewhat dark trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is more famous for his previous films "Under People" (which MST3K deserves mockery) and "Peices" (which may be perhaps the most funny bad movie ever made) Eye Candy: Kari Rose Shows T & A <br /> < br /> My rating: D + <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Only theater trailer for this movie
