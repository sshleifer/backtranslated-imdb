This movie is terrible. This is a wastebasket. No crying, no action, hopeless songs. Even though the landscape is great. I always wanted to go to Greece. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with regard to Saif, you expect great performance, but even let people have it. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar, recognized as Bollywood pimp and Singh's voice. In this movie it was sensational. Only for this performance should Filmfare introduce another prize. Cost of toiletries for worst performance. By the way, the trophy should be a toilet seat. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor. First, she is not comparable to her sister Karisma. In acting, in appearance or in body. Now he wants to prove he's outstripping her. Comes into this movie wearing bikinis and tanks and short shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan lets his wife dress like that. But she might have impressed someone who dressed. And if you ask, then consider that every man has an erection watching this movie. He's trying to have Kareen Kapoor in bed naked with a condom. Including me. Personally, I think she dressed like a bitch, but I really liked it. I'm forced to give her 1/10, but I really would give this movie 0/10. An unforgettable movie.
