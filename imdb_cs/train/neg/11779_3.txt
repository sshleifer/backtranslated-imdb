I do not like this movie very much. If you have read the Puzo book or at least you have been watching the first two films (especially the first), you will agree with me. Compared to the Corleone saga, according to Puz's novel, the screenplay of this movie is sometimes even ridiculous. Characters and relationships between them are distorted. The story ends up nowhere, although it seems to be going in some direction during the movie. It is understandable that in the 1990s we should expect other times for Corleone's solo and that we would not find things like they were before. But on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from other films, in contexts where they did not. Why this? It sounds like the badly accomplished sequel that just tries to copy the characteristics of the original movie. What is never to be understood is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined it. The man who drove pieces like the Apocalypse Now and the Godfather must be forgiven almost in everything he does in the cinema until he dies. So Al Pacino, because he's an actor. But Mario Puzo should not write it. As? He has damaged all his previous work. What a pity, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is the 90th story about the crowd and it's great. We can never say the same about what is happening behind the Godfather III.
