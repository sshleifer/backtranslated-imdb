WARNING! You do not even have to watch this movie in any form. This is not a valuable download from the Internet. Every bit of porn has more stuff than this unnecessary piece of celluloid. So-called filmmakers obviously have no idea how to make a movie. They could not say a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to every human being. If you're looking for a fun movie - go look somewhere else. We hope that this Mr. Unterwaldt ("Jr." is a good indicator of his apparent inexperience and intellectual infant) will die slow / painful death and never NEVER make a movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's even a waste of time to ADD this bullshit, so I'm stopping right now and I'm looking at a good movie.
