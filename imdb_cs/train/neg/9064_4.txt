In fact, Marc Blitzstein's off-Broadway adaptation "Threepenny" was not "exhausted" as we generally think. (I have a special interest in "Threepenny", my father was part of the first full production in the US, Ill Illinois Theater Guild made it around the end of World War II .HJitler was so successful in suppressing the game that he had to reconstruct the script and score from the records in two different languages, and a German marker and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not the "translation" - which had the complete assent to Lotte Lenya - was much closer to the original than generally assumed. The problem that his version of most people knows is the MGM cast (recently available on Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur (like Lucy, "big full girl" and I can not see her hands on boks and shoulders being returned to that line - Bea was the main girl in the 1950s, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was deeply censored by Mike Curb, the head of MGM Records - I think 17 (I think it was) "Hell," he just got "damn". (Suddenly, MGM also offered a 2-LP set of games * all *, undoubtedly being heavily censored.)
