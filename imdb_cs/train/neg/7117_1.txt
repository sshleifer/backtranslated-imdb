As the movie begins, the narrator warns us that THE NIGHTLIFE is so terrible that you could die for fear - and if that happens, a free fun is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anyone would die for fear of seeing this movie, but a few could die of boredom. SCULLING SKULL is a kind of movie that makes Ed Wood look good. Very freely based on the famous story of Franz Marion Crawford, SKULL is a rich but nervous woman who married a sinister man whose first wife died in mysterious circumstances. Once installed in the house, she is tortured by a long-haired gardener, a poor portrait, a peacock, and finally a skull that moves around the room, causing her to scream a lot. And her acting, Peggy Webber, shouts rather well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do so is the pinnacle of the movie. The plot is quite transparent, and at least, and while the cast is really fine, the script is horrible and the movie so inconspicuous that you're ready to run screaming alone. It's true that the thing is running for about sixty-eight minutes, but everything feels much longer. Add a really terrible print quality and you are. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are so bad that it's fun to watch. It's true that SCREAMING SKULL has a couple of bastards - but the movie stretches so much that I could not work more than just occasional giggle and when the whole thing over your head comes back from ennui. If Peggy Webber did not scream, it would be a cure for insomnia. Give it a bug. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
