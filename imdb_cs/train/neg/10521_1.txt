This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half long, it feels close to 4. I have never seen the film move so slowly, and so without purpose. This is also a "horror" movie, which takes a lot of time during daylight. My friend and I laughed at the crazy times we were supposed to be afraid of. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries. It can not be such a high demand. <br /> <br /> Supermodel Nicole Petty ought to stick to modeling because, although beautiful, she lost her accent so many times in this film, half the time is British and half of the time is American.
