I read reviews of this movie and decided to make a shot. I'm an open guy after all, and I've done good reviews of some bad moves. When credits ended at the end, I was looking for meaning and something nice. Here goes: "This movie was mercifully short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> Well, well. Sets and visual ideas have been well done, and music has helped lend the mood to the asylum life, but the movie has been painful and watched, and the endless dialogue has taken away from good bits. I did not find myself laughing in this movie, but in the way you laugh at your best friend, who is just a little embarrassed by the big crowd. During the "chicken tank" finale, he decided that the film would stretch and shoot and let the bodies fall where they would fall. I do not know what this movie could save. The game was not bad and it seemed to have a budget, but it simply was not possible to watch it; nor the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should light a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get a full movie experience. Either way, I can not see this movie again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say that "at least I was not in" Dr. Tarr's Dungeon of Torture: "I'm better than those guys."
