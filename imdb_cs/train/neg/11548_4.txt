Jeez, only in the 1970s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this unpredictable hybrid spaghetti west and kung fu flicks developing around treasure hunt. The spice of this crazy co-production between Shaw Brothers and the one-time Italian company includes humorous storytelling, off-the-wall events and some very humble T & A. Other campsites are served by an unpleasant Lee Van Cleef wig, a skinny psychic pistol by Yancey Hobbitt (adoring Julian Ugarte, a man who should have done a much darker European genre production than he did) - funny dialogue, cheerful background music and absolutely ridiculous sound effects accompanying various minor events (especially each leap from Lo Lieh). Though this little bit of action is falling and entering the territory of Turkey, it is great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not expect too much, and you will get a lot of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What is yours?
