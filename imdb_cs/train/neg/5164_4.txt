The basic plot in this movie is not bad. The lady makes it big and returns to her alma mater to be adored. But despite good acting by Robert Young and Eva Arden, the film is a mess. I have the blame for Joan Crawford or the director, or both, because her performance is terrible. Instead of being a real person, she does a great impersonation of the deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares into the universe and has the "empty I am SOOOO Stunned" expression. After a few minutes, it was really annoying to me. Now it's definitely not the only Crawford movie I do not like for my performance because she did more than her share of exaggeration - in movies like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films like BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - definitely better.
