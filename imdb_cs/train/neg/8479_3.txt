Well, when I came to the record for this movie, I really waited for people to have fun. I was surprised that people over the age of 7 liked it. I liked the film ... but only me and my little sister (which is actually only 10) make fun of the whole thing. I'm sorry for Jordan, but the acting was terrible. You know the film is heading to the toilet when the leadership can not act. And she did not even have a good script or plot to redeem them. I also thought the nature of Pamela was very lame ... a stunning boundary. <br /> <br /> I thought there were a couple of good actors, such as Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still not enough for the movie to redeem. Two things about this movie that I just can not get: 1.) That Spencer's guy would fall for her. All right, hey. I looked at the dates and while she was four years older than she, the difference in "Go figure" looked much larger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but she looked like 10 or 12 in GF ... she looked like a baby! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) Is there any way that Kristi Yamaguchi would just come skating for one girl. I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it seemed quite unlikely that Kristi would go to a boarding school that did not even have skolarships, or that the school would employ a skating carriage with such connections. <br /> <br /> It was all told ... it was not the worst film ever known, but it was not very good either DCOM standards that I consider relatively low.
