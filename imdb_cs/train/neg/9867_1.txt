We saw this one, which had won before last season's season, and did not know why they turned them off at the end of the vote, but it was probably possible, at least to make it possible, but the film was a messy mess. Sure, some were fun in black humor, but none of the characters felt like real. There was no person with whom I could join, and I think that's where I did not. Sure, the story is somewhat interesting and very subversive to Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea ... make sure it's no longer exhausted to the vanity point. All suffering feels fake, from lighting, casting, scenarios to terrible visual effects (which is meant to be deliberate, I can say, and so did everyone else laughing at you). Anyway, I hope to do it for DVD sales, at least I would not want a project that many people apparently made a lot of effort to not show up. But it's a way. Boredom.
