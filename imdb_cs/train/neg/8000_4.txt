I already know that critics and some viewers say it is a satire, there are numerous political and social messages, names refer to other names, etc. It may be. I can not realize such things (I do not want to do the same) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in "cinema." Regarding the film itself, it is once again said that the film is smart and dramatically strong. I did not see anything we could not see in monstrous movies except the scene that takes place in the office in the second half. Yes, the scene says something about humanity, but the film does not make it brilliant. The movie is fun (gentle) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw in the film, it's visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not rely for a moment because I waited for a realistic monster because it is not one of the old Gojir films, it was made in 2006, but it was not. It's like you did not believe there was a monster that you can not take care of. If you agree with me, I recommend Cloverfield, which is very realistic. The monster's design is not interesting, but at least planned, it's an effort. Dramatically strong criticism. Some critics talk about it as if it were a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it's more a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean it's dramatically strong. I do not want to compare the Host with other monsters, but I'm trying to say that the Host does not do something that other monsters do not do. By the way, maybe some people call film masterpieces because of their sympathy for Asian cinematography. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's true.
