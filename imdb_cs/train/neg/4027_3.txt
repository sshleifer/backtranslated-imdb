It must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Its lack of finesse and complexity and overall political correction is really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world just is not that, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, the deepest thing about this film is Father Bola's friend. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: shaved-headed tattoo artists are not always bad, in fact they may be better than the average viewfinder (wow, it's like ... philosophy or something). Thank you, Achero. I suggest you the Nobel Prize for Literature.
