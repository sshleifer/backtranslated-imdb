Bela Lugosi is a bad botanist who sends the bark of a poisoned orchid on the wedding day, steals her body in her fake ambulance, and takes him home to help him extract the gland juice to keep Bella's wife forever young. Some actors who play detectives are trying to solve terrible, terrible secrets. Bela Lugosi can handle it carefully, but you can say he needs money. <br /> <br /> This movie is horribly horrible and most actors would be better if they stayed on the waiting tables, but the plot is great ridiculous. Tell someone else what's happening in them and they have a lot of laughter and they need to see the movie. I got a DVD at a 2-pound discount store, which in my opinion is a very accurate award; anyone who would pay more for it would be from their minds.
