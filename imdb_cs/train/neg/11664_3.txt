I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. He moved very slowly and was boring. If it was on TV, it would take about 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the story? The great actor and photographer are working on an erroneous base. If it is freely based on the director's life, why did not he get someone who would see that the font itself is "free". Then he directed it with a snail's pace that could be the source of several people who nodded during the film. Music is rising, but for another film, not this ... maybe a saga opera saga. There were times when dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone because I heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom. Why can not Hollywood make better movies? This one had a nugget of great story, but he was just executed badly.
