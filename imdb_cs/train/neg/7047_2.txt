Note that neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play a major role because you would believe the poster. Their roles are, in fact, tiny. The film is badly drawn between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama without really being interested. In particular, I find it impossible to assemble a lot of compassion with the main protagonist, not to mention his friends with snakes and sexually obsessed fianc√©s. This plot hangs awfully, and after two-thirds I turned this off - which is unusual for me because I like to finish what I'm starting with. Good acting and beautiful surroundings take it from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
