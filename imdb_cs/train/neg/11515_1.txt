and forget about it. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna, rent the "Evidence Points", at least that Willem Defoe is in it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the files are beautiful, you might want to turn off the dialogue. Nothing will miss you. Bruce Greenwood is futile, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a jumper and Madonna is so awful, it's fun. Why did they have to paint the original film in this mess, I will never know; I think they thought it was "bankable." Madonna, as an actress, is definitely not. <br /> <br /> However, if you borrow the original 1979 film, you will enjoy it and the actors can actually act on it. 1/10.
