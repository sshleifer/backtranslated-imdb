This is loosely based on ideas from the 1980s. It is set in a modern day because we see that the base in Afghanistan is destroyed immediately after the start. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the film jumps shark. UAVs are not armed. They could be, but I do not think it was ever tried really. Let's look at the computer that performed this operation called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are familiar with the "hacker" Will Farmer (good in chemistry and electronics, which does not make him a computer hacker) and his love interest, Annie) and Will's first hacking attempt is not only a complete failure of his IP address, and Annie estimated who It was. We also meet Ms. Wills, who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> The need to draw money from a neighboring bank account (Mr. Massude) is not a hack (helped to set up an account), I nod back to the original film, where I oppose Global Thermonuclear War and play The Dead Code. RIPLEY Tracking is NOT running on Willo, but on Massude, so all the evidence she gathered was useless against Will. Exactly why RIPLEY closed Will's machine down is not explained (just playing the online game?) And why she felt the need to shut down the entire electricity throughout the block he lived in. Why the anti-terrorism agency would consider this goal to be viable is extremely controversial. How does RIPLEY activate my cell phone? I think not, it was not connected to the computer and the message would not play if she did not really answer the phone, so there is also bad "hacking" science. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude's home, take him away, and Will gets an envelope that turns out to contain lots of money. Searching for a car license number that has survived Massude is not "hack" because you never see it on your DMV computer. RIPLEY agents who pick Dennis at the airport as he seeks will have no authority to arrest or detain him. Will's mother "did not steal chemicals or biological substances." Even though she had, she had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Act or Not. I do not know why Will feared he would be arrested for any crime in Canada because he is a completely different country with different laws against the United States. <br /> <br /> The computer became dishonest and all the action that was taken against Will, his mother and Dennis was not approved by a government agency. The phreak phone we see Will Will is the first show of any hacker skills in the movie, and we also got to RIPLEY, which seemed too easy for such a powerful system. The "guy" who ran to Annie at the airport and also watched them on the street had nothing to do with RIPLEY and the ridiculous look that RIPLEY could watch his cellphone while the underground was as stupid as the idea that the computer reads his lips. <br /> <br /> Another link to the original film, when Stephen Falken mentioned as a designer of the RIPLEY system, replaced the Joshua project. We found out that the "guy" who came across Annie is Falken (he did not play sadly the original creator) who believed his own death. We also see WOPR as "what will help them" beat RIPLEY and hold the same voice. Falken and WOPR are destroyed too quickly after they were heavily used (the same explosion should kill Will, Annie, and Russian.) It's also unlikely that they would create a stand-alone computer system that has the ability of a nuclear or chemical weapon from which it operates. <br /> <br /> The whole "decontamination" conspiracy and thought are totally unbelievable. These kinds of commands would have to go through the president or chiefs of staff. So another ridiculous and incredible idea. IP hacks against RIPLEY are not made by Will, he just contacts one of his friends who designs and implements the idea. It's ridiculous that Will gets the login data just from growing RIPLEY's Joshua as an ass to RIPLEY (especially after being blown to pieces) is an incredible explosion and cries of a very desperate writer who had no ideas, to finish this movie and do it. /> <br /> There is a terrible good thing where RIPLE Y plays Dead Code and we see a countdown (say 17 minutes), then RIPLEY says: "30-minute decontamination," how stupid when they can not even keep up with their own timer ? RIPLEY's Philadelphia attack is stopped (too easy, in my opinion), and she decides to attack Joshua in her inner circles and redirects the missiles to Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is located. The idea of ​​a nuclear weapon exchange to make RIPLEY aware of what she is doing will not work (she certainly knew if Joshua was initiating her because she had already learned the lesson in the original film) is yet another nodding back to the original film. <br /> <br /> Their cop-out at RIPLEY repeat Joshua's exactly the same words forming the end of the original movie just going to show how many original ideas they could not come up with. <br /> To show your fingers for bad and stolen ideas, men are blamed by Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is a terrible movie and it is best to avoid it.
