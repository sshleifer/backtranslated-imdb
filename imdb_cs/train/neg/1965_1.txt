Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago to expand his horizons and horror. The result is Dead Above Ground, an incredible amount of junk mail. Now I noticed his names in connection with this particular film, which I would bring back, but no, I did not have glasses and that's why I lost it, damn, I really need to bring with me while shopping video. The first question would be why is this a target audience for you? It's almost like a "haunted" kid's movie, but then again they are girls without sticks and some dull and a few bad words have gone out and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with some kind of agricultural equipment. It seems that a man opens a breakfast bed with a curled past, a witch killing children who lived there. Probably something the real estate agency did not mention. Of course, nowadays, there is a little girl ghost who warns the real living little girl who lives there that something bad happens. It does, and there are also two Bubbasi who put the property on the property when the new owner takes over, so they are also revenge. This whole thing has the feeling that Halloween is doing some unsolicited stuff, except of course those things that are not suitable for young children, so it's not only average but also confused. Big boo and irritation to Anchor Bay for that, too, given their usual recordings with fine releases, this is a new low. In the UK, you get the Phantasm Box Set, we get "The Fairy Tooth". He barely looks fair. 1 out of 10 absolute garbage.
