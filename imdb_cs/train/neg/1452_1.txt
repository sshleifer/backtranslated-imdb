From 1919 to 1933, Germany appears to be almost as a post-communist Czech chapter. I'm sorry, it's a Czech chapter and it's funny in 2003. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst historical films in the immediate past. Röhm is head higher than Adolf and looks so damn good, Göring looks like 40 when he's only 23 and "Führer" always looks like 56. And buildings, people, even buildings were sometimes young. Especially in 1919, many houses in Germany were almost new (World War I did not reach the German cities!). No decaying plaster! Then Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons in this building, never. And that may seem like a miracle to all of you: in 1933, the Fire Brigade in Berlin has many vehicles with engines, some even with swivel ladders, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: What was the PLAYMOBIL lock in the final order? For me it was kind of "Adolf's Adventure in the Wonderland"
