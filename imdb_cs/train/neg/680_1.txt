Finally, I caught "Starlight" on TV yesterday, and I can only say. . . Wow! It's hard to know where to start - incredible hockey special effects (look at the laser rays from Willie's eyes!), Horror gaming, cumbersome dialogue, incorrect use of stock records, or exciting trickery that puts the whole production. It is a truly unique experience and we should all be grateful for it. My name is Jonathon Kay for Ed Wood's rightful heir!
