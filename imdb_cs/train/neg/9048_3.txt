Originally broadcast as the ABC movie a week. This concerns two young innocent pupils who are at a railway station in a small southern city. They do not allow phone calls and no one knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, beating, humiliation, and aggravation, which leads to a very disturbing conclusion. The TV version has been (for some time) gloomy. No nudity and beating were quite tedious, but the overall feeling of suffering was one down. The unfinished version is even worse - there is a lot of naked nudity, violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner who is forced to dismiss while the lesbian uses it. FUJ! It's nothing wrong with exploitative films, but this one is just over the edge. You get the feeling that the creators like that these poor women are tortured and aggravated - all of this is pressed in your face as if you were to enjoy it. An endless end is not helpful. I give it 3 because acting is good - but it really makes the movie harder to watch. Bad film. Not recommended.
