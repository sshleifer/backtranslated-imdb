Jean Rollin's artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens, and the search for immortality. Women are beautiful and stunning. Dialogue is unpleasant. It's a ridiculous mess. We'll look at it greatly, but like any form of horror film or thriller just horrible. I'm trying to find out if we're afraid or not. At the same time, is it necessary or not? It's a strange blend of artistic film and horror that never touches, and while his pretty view of it never seems to mean "anything", and in no way spooky, though an occasional shot or sequel creates a frisson moment of its very demanding. Something to leave in the background as a paper living wall for those who like naked women.
