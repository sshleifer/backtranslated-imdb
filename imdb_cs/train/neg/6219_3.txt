When MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was pretty foolish to believe it would be like heart warming as one of Lassie's first films. No. The story was incredible, songs from the Sherman brothers were far below the usual levels, the characters were uninitiated, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY both saw much better days. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <i> I was also interested in what kind of benefit ALICE FAYE would look like because she had been on the screen for so many years, and she always played back in her earlier roles at Fox. Alica was also disappointed with a foolish script and clumsy photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here, nothing interesting even for adults - and apparently no magical gift for anyone. You can omit this option without wanting anything.
