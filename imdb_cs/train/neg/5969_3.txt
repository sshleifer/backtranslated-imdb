*** SPOILER *** Do not read it if you think you are watching the movie, even if it was a waste of time. (By the way: the conspiracy is so predictable that it has no difference if you read it or not) <br /> <br /> If you are wondering if you want to see "Coyote Ugly" or not:! There is also no money for a ticket or VHS / DVD. Typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick," one could say. The fence itself is as shallow as it may be, the ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. A young pretty girl from a small town has become a great success in New York City. Several desperate attempts to give the film any depth fail, such as the "tragic" father's accident, the "difficulty" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (the director) is trying to wake up compassion and the sadness of the audience has no chance to succeed in this attempt due to bad script and fluent acting. In particular, Piper Perabo fails to persuade one of Jersey's fear of singing before singing. The only good (and quite funny thing) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents a small ray of hope for this film. I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. First, "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now ... what happened to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That's a true Bruckheimer thing. If you're looking for a superficial movie with good-looking women, just to have a relaxed evening, you better go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much fun, fun and self-ironic) instead of that move. <br /> <br /> Two inches down (3 of 10).
