I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. He could not even make this movie a pleasant one. The only reason I've watched it up to the end is that I'm teaching video production and I wanted to make sure my students never did anything wrong ... but I think it all, It's like watching a grandmother who flirts with 15-year-old boy ... unbearably painful. If you took a real movie, soaked it in the thinner and then watched it, it would be more fun. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a S-Mart bargie basket, turn it off as if it were a rattlesnake.
