Somehow I ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. It seemed to me that I was looking at a movie from this group of film school students who did not succeed. It plays every Hollywood clich√© that you can imagine, while enjoying the message "corporations are the ultimate evil." Subtlety does not know this movie. As for that, he even manages to provide his own spoilers. The story seems to be the computer's fantasy computer world. The lead figure is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet there is a programming genius and obvious hacker (I mean) amongst many other nerad-fantasy-come-true elements you'll have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I also ought to know it would be a movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... she tends to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> Can not recommend I'm afraid.
