Kombi Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal was previously gold with people like HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went to the movie (in the Indian multiplex) with great hope, especially after smooth promos. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL, this film was a huge disappointment. Just as others commented, the premise of a movie that was already old began to be simple and without any development or layering. After a while, you want the movie to finish, so you can go home (if I were watching at home, it would be much easier to cut down on losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is on average the best and John Abraham should not try to make a comedy again. The comedic aspects of the film were all weekly. I just remember how she's giggling like the whole movie twice. Certainly not the laughing hips that have absorbed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, because his role and character was not given much room for growth, he did not have much influence on the film. Neha Dhupia, which appears only in appearance in the movie, was fun looking at the screen. And some songs are fun. Especially opening and closing songs ADA and KISS ME BABY. Otherwise, you'd better pass this movie.
