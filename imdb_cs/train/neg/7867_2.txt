Okay, I tried and I tried, but I do not have this Guy Maddin yet. Stories from Gimli Hospital have left me cold, the film about the Austrian villagers and the one about Ice Nymph was pretty nice but it's missing in the historical department ... and this bored movie about abortion and hockey is just boring. I'm glad that Maddin has a quiet film award, but I do not like my films for the same reason why I do not like Quentin Tarantin's films: there are empty honors for better and more imaginative films - films that have expanded the artistic form of new soil - and no substance. No amount of jump cuts and tiny camera angles may mask the fact that Maddin is a non-original David Lynch wannabe, although he has one advantage over Tarantine: generally he does not write an embarrassing dialogue because most of his films rely on internal titles. The bottom line is, Maddin Schtick is a clever clever movie for aspirant film majors.
