I can look forward to blame, but that's just bad. And it's not bad that you could enjoy MST3K. It's just unfortunately bad, as if you could not find anything that would please, no matter how much you are trying. I really regret being sorry for 2 hours of precious life. You can watch that no one was asked to act and everyone knew that the film would only bury his career. It seems that Walking Tall has earned enough revenue that someone has decided that they have been able to invest. If this is not the worst movie I've seen, it's so bad that it has crumpled worse movies from my memory.
