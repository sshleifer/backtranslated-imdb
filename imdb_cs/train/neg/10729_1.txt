Let me start by thinking that I am one of the more (most!) Open film audiences ... Movies are my passion and I am very regular at my local place of cult film. I also feel that I need to add that I often ask about movies whenever I get there and I never seem to be able to leave this place without having to discuss a detailed discussion or an exchange of views on what it's going to borrow strange things and that's exactly why this film recommended one of the guys on the cult movie-video-place. He told me that I think I must see it, and because the cover he told me something about being a movie with Jodorowski (one of my favorite) atmosphere, I rented it. The vote I gave here is not really fair because I did not think it was terrible, I just did not know how to evaluate it differently. The question would be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only movie that literally hurt my belly: I actually felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned? Yet I did not want to shut it down, or maybe just could not, because I was enchanted in an ugly way ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, 1, as I said. Just not my cup of tea (or wodka for that matter) ...
