This had to be one of the most divine spooky games and was saved only by two matches. Hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince McMahon vs. Shaun Michaels. The main event between the Prize and the Triple H was total eradication, and to be honest, I almost fell asleep that it was so hopeless, the coffin match was not worthy of Undertaker appearing in it, and the struggle between Boogie Man and Booker T was a joke. If you're really a big fan of WWE and missed the early days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you'll probably love it. But I've found that this Wrestlemania has left a lot to be desired.
