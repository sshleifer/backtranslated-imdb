If you want to know the real story of Wendig, I suggest that you choose a copy of the original story of Algernon Blackwell. This film was not only bad, but nothing to do with the book. I loved the book when I read it as a child (in EMF Freeman's "Campfire Chillers") and was so excited to see the movie come out on it. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there was not too much PC in the movie (Politically Correct). When the book was written, the computer did not exist at all. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you do not waste time or money! If you see it in the video store box, leave it there.
