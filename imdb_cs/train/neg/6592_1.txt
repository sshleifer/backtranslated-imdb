Brief Summary: This film demeans everyone concerned. That means you. <br /> <br /> First, tell me that I am not a purist, and that can be fun for a few minutes. Pretending is not bad. But overall, it's just boring and unbearably fun. Several simple jokes are repeated over and over again. Obviously, these films exist only to expel the last few dollars from the now-known Laurel and Hardy. Producers can not really take their place in the history of the film or their talents. That's what made me the most offended. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked me so I'm also a parent like a failure;)
