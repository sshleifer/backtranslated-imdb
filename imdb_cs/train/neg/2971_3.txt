Batman Mystery Batwoman, one word out of date. <br /> <br /> It seems that the mysterious female vigilante ("Batwoman") encounters Batman's lawn and while Batman tries to fight the tricycle Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne, trying to find out who the Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that might seem bad about it, but there is nothing special about it, and I remarked that it really missed it. <br /> <br /> The phantasm mask had a long, lost love for Bruce. <br /> <br /> Subzero was a major event in Mr Frost's life. <br /> <br /> Even the Batman Beyond movie turns away, the Return of the Joker, kicked deep with the characters. <br /> <br /> But the secret of Batwoman has some smaller subplots, a lot of the formula overcome by an average drift on a cruise. Frankly, this is more about Scooby Doo than the Dark Knight, lacking the strike and bite that the animated series had at its best.
