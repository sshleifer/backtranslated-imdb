Interesting? Hardly. The "scientific evidence" that provides the film is so stupid and lame, it's almost ridiculous (if we did not know what happened at that time). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah. I can not imagine that the Germans (even in that terrible time) would like to love this movie or believe it. Compare it to Triumf des Willens in Riefenstahl. Now it was a movie I was impressed with. It's just stupid rubbish. The "best" part is a scene from M (one of my favorite favorites) where (a Jew, as the announcer reminds us so eloquently) Lorre plays a child - a criminal and a murderer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, it can only do a spoiled mind. Uh-huh. I did not know M was Hitler's favorite movie, was not it? <br /> <br /> No, it's just a STUPID. And for being a naked propaganda genre. 2/10.
