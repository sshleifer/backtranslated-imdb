I can not believe that this film carries a jerk. It was so bad. I was completely disappointed with the art of the box. NEVER HAZARD !! It's not your time, I promise you. I do not know if positive reviews for this movie were a joke or what. I'm so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I really liked, then I lost all faith in humanity. /> And do not even start me with the story compared to the titles or the fact that the whole movie was filmed in all two places or that the police did not even have they are saying that "who cares about police uniforms!" Compared to other movies, uniforms were in place. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans.
