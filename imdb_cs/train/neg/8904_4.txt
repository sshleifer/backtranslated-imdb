I personally liked "The Prophecy" of 1995. Christopher Walken was as great as ever, and although the film was flawless, it was a haunted and highly original Horror / Fantasy film that he enjoyed enormously. This inferior sequel of 1998 is worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. Walken, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors and is once again exceptional in the role of the fallen archangel Gabriel, who plays for the second time. Again, the war between the fallen and faithful angels is brought to the ground. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russell Wong) and the human wife Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could be a decisive factor in the celestial war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Apart from Gabriel, however, "Prophecy II" also contains many terribly annoying characters. The figure of Valerie was unpleasant, and Danayel made me even more upset. However, the biggest pain in the butt was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who would not be in jeopardy. But Walken's performance is not the only redeemable quality of the movie. The whole movie is quite terrible and well shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene is extremely impressive in the beginning and is one of the best moments in one of the films "Prophecy". "Prophecy II" is still the weakest of three "Prophecy" films with Walken. Certainly Christopher Walken, one-man-show, fun, but nothing out of it.
