With one of my favorite James Spader actors, I expected this film to be at least acceptable. It was not. After the first half hour, I watched the rest with the remote control in my hand, so a quick forward was ready. So a bit, so by default, we know what happens in every scene. You could even predict the word dialog for the word. It's one of those movies that make one scratch head and they say, "How did the movie shoot?" In an effort to say something positive, I add that there are some slightly fun special effects. But if you've seen 5 Sci-Fi movies or you've been over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this.
