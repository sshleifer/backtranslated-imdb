The victory of Vargas is just a bad movie. No amount of refusal or dollar advertising promoted publicity with the change of this sad fact. Maybe Peter Sollett saw he had no money to make the film he wanted to do, and he decided to broadcast a bad movie in an easy way that cynically denies the principles of the current "playful film." Maybe he does not know anything better. It's hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is not hard to say is the result. With the exception of a few audiences who intellectualize bad filming in an attempt at pseudo-realism, some enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know I did not. you are kind and submit this movie.
