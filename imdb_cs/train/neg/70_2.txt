This movie never got into theaters in our area, so when it was available on DVD I was one of the first to rent. Once I had to listen to criticism and hand it over. Despite the excellent set of actors, the film was very disappointing. I see now why it was a direct video. <br /> <br /> I thought Bloom, Ledger, and Rush might have some value. Everyone has done a great job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film moved slowly and never dragged me. I did not get a lot of empathy for the characters, and I had to fight the urge to move forward quickly, just to get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you are thinking about renting it for "eye candy" purposes only. It does not even do it.
