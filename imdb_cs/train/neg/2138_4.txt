War, Inc. - Corporations take over the war in the future and use lone assassin Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to perform wet work against competing CEOs. Dark comedy satirizing army and corporation. It has often been difficult to find out what is happening. I still expected things to make sense. For madness there is no reason or method. Cusack is considered a "spiritual successor" of Grosse Point Blank. The war is more or less tapping. We see Cusack again as a murderer who protects the spoiler of the person he is about to kill when he meets him. To be fair, John Cusack looks so trustworthy that he selects half a dozen boys with relative ease. Short fights look good. The rest of the film is not. It is omnipresent, often bordering on bizarre. War Inc is not fun enough to be a parody, and it's too exciting for someone to even think about any movie, which in my opinion could be a heartless way corporations such as the war factions compete and approve, how they affect average citizens. Interesting, but satire simply does not work, because it's not fun and there's no heart in your heart. I think we ought to be damn about how the war is affecting Cusack's character mantle, rather than the millions of lives disturbed by war. John Cusack gives decent performance. His character chugs shots hot sauces and controls the smallest private plane, but quirks are designed to replace character characters. Marisa Tomei behaves like romantic journalists. There is not really a lot of chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries Russian accent and does not make a fool herself. Joan Cusack just screams, whines and wigs. Blech. Ben Kingsley may have to return an Oscar if he does not start performing decent again and again. Compelling. It's not a terrible movie, but in the end you have to ask "War, why is it good?" Absolutely nothing. C-
