"This story is dedicated to women," says the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve began to use the system of free sheets." When "Politics" was filmed, the 19th Amendment, which guarantees women the right to vote, was only ten years old. And the film deals with the political power of women as a voting group. Advocating a ban and turning off speakeasies was a major problem for women at the time. The good-nature of Marie Dressler (like Hattie Burns) becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed to perform speakeasy. He wants the pieces selling alcohol to be closed; and is designed to Mayoral run, after delivering a strong speech on the rally of women. Mrs. Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (like Ivy Higgins) and her stubborn husband Roscoe Ates (like Peter Higgins). Dressler's run for the Mayor of Lake City raises the opposition of men in the city; Dressler orders women to stand on strike, deny them, "everything" in the "salon, bedroom, and bath." <br /> <br /> The movie sounds much better than it turned out. Humor, frankly, is not very good; and includes some unfortunate and slightly offensive situations ("You Look Like Madame Queen" refers to the character of Amosa and Andy). And mixing shots and slapstic should not be mixed this time. Producers could consider the film more dramatic and focused exclusively on Dressler and characters William Bakewell (like Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (like Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7 / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
