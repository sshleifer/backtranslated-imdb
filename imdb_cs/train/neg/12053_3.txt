as always, it is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. The television was telling a bunch of panhandle lies in the early 1990s, and it turned out that everyone looked bad and said that we all earned more than $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day came close to reality. when someone went around where I kept the sign of offering a job and offered me a job, I actually went and took the job if I was physically able.and if I was offered a $ 100,000 ID damn surely invested in apt prepaid for at least 2 years and in the bankers stayed the most, and in the casinos I still had $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games. I have always won and could win decent if I only had a bankroll. Instead I win about $ 1000 a month is all playing in always a minimum purchase due to not wanting to risk losing all. I was just homeless because I did not want to risk spending all my money and I broke it, sometimes I had more than 1000-2000 dollars in my sock as I slept outside. everyone who wants to talk is contacting sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i I admit that I was different from most homeless, though because I never drank a saw or smoked. I'm homeless now, I'm in the house for $ 177 a month and I get SSI and spend most of my time in online poker. mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get my SSI. glad my days are hiding underground in the congress center of the casino at night sleeping, I'm afraid I'm going to hunt for security, they're finally done. if this TV crew chose me, they were much earlier. his shame, how best to choose, who he chooses.
