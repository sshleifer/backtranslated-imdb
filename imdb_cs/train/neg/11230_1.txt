In the sixth grade, every teacher I decided to do would be a great idea to make this film a curriculum throughout the semester. Each class had something to do with this terrible show. We saw it in English and we wrote in the magazines as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics we talked about charts and other sea bulls. In science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so it was not a 100% waste of time). Every day he was tortured every day. Not only that, but they would also expose us to this horror twice a day by looking at us in the study. I saw if it was a new series or something, but it was like '93. I'm still trying to prevent it.
