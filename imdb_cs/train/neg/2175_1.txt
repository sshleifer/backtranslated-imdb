Carlos Mencia continuously, violently, hatefully shouts "B ** ch!" in women it's like shouting "N ** ger!" in black people, except that it is worse. Remember that the word B, unlike the word N, is the only pejorative concept that is associated with violence every day. "B ** ch!" is the last thing women hear before being raped, defeated or murdered. The guy suffers from violent use of the language of violence. She seems to be a gayist who is trying to cover a female craving, so he'll sound like a hetero. And all the Nazi white boys in the audience give fascist greetings while their silly little white and white women wail the hee hee pitch on their side, apparently terrified to protest against this tidal wave of hateful women. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support free speech for them! Come on, Carlos? Do you want women to have the freedom to speak to you crazy, violently and spectacularly as you do, or do you think that "freedom of speech" is only for men to act on ladies?
