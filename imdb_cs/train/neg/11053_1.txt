It's one of the "so bad that's good" movies you've always heard, but you never see! Unlike Troma films that are deliberately bad and campy (and I'm not amused), it's 100% pure serious. However, with elements such as the supposedly super killer robot killer, Solid Dancers on a sour trip, and a magical first friend who calls the flash and transforms himself into a good witch in the East, the fact that it really takes it seriously by pushing it so far over the edge of the bad that is full of circles around back funny. <br /> <br /> A lot of hours.
