* Spoilers and extreme bashing lay in front of us * <br /> <br /> When this show first started, it was tolerable and fun. Pretty Oddparents was a kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had a high score along with Spongebob. But it began to sink for the following bumps that Butch Hartman and his team had hit the show. First toilet humor is not so fun. You can easily laugh at a small child with a smirk, but it is almost the only audience that would laugh at such a clich√© joke. There are also childhood jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing. LOLOLOL !!! I can not stop laughing at such a gay blessing! Help me someone! Of course, this show would not be so bad if it was not for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in the hot desert. But now ... It's a coup of grace WHY this show really sucks the loudest of them ... BEFORE USING YOKES !!! The show constantly pulls the same jokes (most of them are unhappy) and thinks it's the biggest thing ever! Cosmo is usually the guilty one. I hated how they continue to refer to "Super Toilet" (which also has a mixture of humorous humor in it), and Cosmo would be frightened. And who could forget the stupid ram that every damn parent in Dimmsdale used in one episode of an e-mail? Do you know the one in which each parent (regardless of the other parents who say that) would pronounce exactly the same sentence before breaking into his nursery? Yes, it may be the first class of humor for some people, but it's clean with others. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Butch Hartman said something about the end of the show. Thank God! Everyone around my place says it's the most amazing show of Nickelodeon at all. Can not I agree? I think it's just another heap of horse manure that we get to our carts everyday, just worse.
