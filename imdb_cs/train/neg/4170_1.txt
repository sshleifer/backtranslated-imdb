It's just inviolable. If there's a story somewhere, it's so deeply buried under horrific characters and rough camera work that is unbearable. There is a group of vampire hunters who go to do their thing, and the vampires who kill, have someone inside the alien. They call their heads and speak like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine that the blood and gore covered by extraterrestrial puppet socks scream in horror as a cowboy mate writes with cattle prod, well, that's what you get here. These people are loud, uncomfortable, violent, and just extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human people who stand so incredibly pompous in the CGI spacecraft that it is impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton a right-wing extremist. They're friends with some vampires, or something ... who cares about it. Then there's work with the camera. Remember how everyone hated thousands of minutes per minute from the recent Rolleballe remake? People who loved this movie. Here's enough for three really dirty non-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. The thing smells. For comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
