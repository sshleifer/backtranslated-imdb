Some of the worst, least natural acts I've ever seen. Which is perhaps not surprising given the clumsy, poor dialogue on individual notes. Add cheap cost to production and you have a movie that does not even seem to be on TV. One does not expect much of Lifetime, especially one old, but it is almost incoherently bad. Plot-wise, it's a terrible, clich√©-like romance type that Harlequin would also consider underneath. It's possible to guess how the rest of the movie will just watch the opening pair of scenes. Surprised, the only female figure that focuses and the mysterious alien falls in love.
