As a spiritual and not a Christian. I thought he really would hold on to my faith, but what kind of load I see. I thought the film would have big arguments but gained unilateral views from atheists and Jews ??? And who are all such people out of the street talking who do not know the back of their arms from their heads. Where are the theologians, priests and other things from which they could have arguments. Not kidnapped nuts who wrote books and finished studying in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and it is not worth checking out whether the facts are right or wrong or whether or not I should believe it because the antichrist is so. Please think that he came to the conclusion that he did not find God because his own ego and demons got the best of it. No, I will not say the movie was amazing to help atheists read that they felt better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world that you care about, the poor souls who believe in Jesus then attract us with your value, not with your bits of drums.
