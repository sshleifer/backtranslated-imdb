MAY CONTAIN SPOILS ... AND EVERYONE CAN EVERYTHING CAN SPOIL! !! <br /> <br /> Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateurish. This movie is trying to be different from most of Blair Witch movies ... it does not work ... just ends up looking and feeling as if someone had a cheap video camera, van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist is not provided with any real motivation (and looks like a lesbian with performance compared to five girls) and there is no violence we would be talking about ... just the sounds of shouting and crunching. The whole movie takes place inside the van, which means that the decent scene is out of the question. Five girls really do the best with what they have been given, but they all look like quite spooky actresses ... though it's hard to judge with a given material whether they can truly honor ... they spend the whole movie screaming, wailing and lamentation. so much it's half hard to figure out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's really hard to tell who's saying it. This video has itself painted as a violent torture film, but in fact, it's just five girls in the van with a cry in terror ... it literally summarizes the whole movie ..... then we get to the end after what looks like 5 hours screaming all the time, and all five girls are still alive ... with one fingered finger. One inch up (get it ... a finger .... LOL) is for poor actresses who have tried hard and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after doing this terrible movie. Do not judge it with a poster ... you will be very kidnapped.
