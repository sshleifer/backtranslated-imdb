I think it has become a heart and inspired that writing for such hopelessly ordinary Hollywood films like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK will begin their career with a low-budget horror film like this one. Perhaps as the will of the talent that would have Willard Hyuk and Gloria Katze nominated for an Oscar later in their respective career, Messiah of Evil has the potential, but unfortunately he becomes frustrating precisely because he can not get the filmmaking to pull it. <br /> <br /> A young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search of her painter's father, who has vanished for a while, is a prerequisite. It does not take long before the fragmented story leaves all hope and sinks deep into the disparate absurdity - and for awhile it works admirably well until you think maybe you need to get the Messiah of Evil from the Schlozic Trough 70 is an explosion as an artistic mysterious example horror. The incredible non-sequiturs keep climbing as a daughter stumbling on a young couple in a gloomy hotel room who is doing research on local legends about "blood moon", shabby and half crazy alcohol (which plays great Elisha Cook Jr. in the best scene of the movie ), who warns her against her father, only to be found dead in the doghouse "a later blind old lady who owns a local art gallery and who inexplicably removed all her father's paintings from the store and, last but not least, a slow, murderous, squirrel albino. <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> </ span> <br /> </ span> deliberate "," unintentional "and" did not really expect it to come out, but it is enough t good - WRAP SCENE "Get rid of, for example, a double narrative that flows in and out of the image in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-conscious way, one coming from a daughter as she travels from where she searches for her father and the other tells Father's voice when he reads his diary. <br /> <br /> While we are still talking about a "live dead image," Messiah of Evil is different and just one loosely - at least with current prejudices about what the zombie movie should be like. The origins of the living dead here are a 100-year-old curse that the city makes out the mysterious "Dark Stranger," one day came from the forest. Meanwhile, Hyuck finds time for excerpts of mass consumption criticism in the supermarket food scene that precedes DAWN OF THE DEAD for many years (we can already hear the MST3K line: "man is dead, only his capitalist meal remains") and a nice idea, but badly performed similar scene in the cinema. Generally, I think that incredible work in careful, well-measured doses - how absurd to work if it is not hidden in perfectly normal? Hyuck seems to be just blurring around the picture and dangerously covering his hand. For example, when an albino picks up a girl who returns to the city and her squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine that the director winks sensibly at the audience, amused and content with his own puzzles. <br /> <br /> The overall level of film production is also quite low - the half-mark is getting worse and the story is tedious and apparently nowhere, and not particularly fast. Add torn adjustments, average gaming, and Hyuck's general inability to capture the real atmosphere - the empty streets of the coastal city are being criminally abused - and I would send the Messiah under the "missed opportunity," but still grindhouse afficionados finds enough to appreciate - when it is not particularly cruel, ugly or dirty.
