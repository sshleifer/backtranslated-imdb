Avoid all these crap. Bad script, bad direction, bad play, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get an idea? This film is trying to be Western flavored, it is not. Trying to be a hard core of force, it is not. He tries to imagine a new look at the old genre, no. The actors are doing their best there and my heart is going. But with such gruesome material working with it, it's hard to do something. For me, it has all the prospect of a "fresh outta film school that will amaze the world". New film makers often bite more than they can chew or their budget. The best thing they can do is take a few steps back, re-evaluate what's possible and work in a limited budget for the next.
