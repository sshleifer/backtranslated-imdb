You can give JMS and boys a pass on this because they were at the beginning of the series and for a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. Do not get me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I was a powerful sees this movie, I'd order a series. I do not like O'Hara as an actor, costumes are stupid and there are many cliches. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put the fire in a series and it became a wonderful show. If you're a B5 fan and you do not see this movie, look at it. If you are not a fan of B5, you do not ... you do not want to watch the series.
