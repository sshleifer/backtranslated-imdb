Cowboys might be able to destroy your saddle a little. It's definitely not one of John's best movies. Do not get me wrong, with some sort of John Wayne move is always a good place. And this has a fair share. But over the whole picture it moves slowly and just does not meet the aspirations it might be. Bruce Dern is doing a great job again like a villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another light in the movie. Children in the film were average, but they could have been better. It will be a good film for eight to fifteen-year-old filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It will be a good family step to watch with your kids. Just remember that there are a few scenes that you might want to look at before you let the youngsters see it. But most children I know have seen the movie like this. Maybe it's because they see how kids of their age do all adult work.
