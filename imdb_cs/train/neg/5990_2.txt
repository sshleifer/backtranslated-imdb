I have not seen it all yet; Now it's running on the cable and I seem to be in the middle. My main reason why I'm interested is that I'm a fan of Bill Paxton; he's a pretty good actor and he's been developing well in his career. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that when I've never been a fan of the old series, I've liked Thunderbird a bit and the effect of work. Derek Meddings was probably the best in business in the 1960s and 1970s, and his designs for an international rescue boat are amazing. The current team has done a great job of translating their work into a big screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Children are asked to drive them, and while they do a good job, it's hard to stop their mistrust, especially when you have an eight-year-old son of Brains flying T2, a massive multi-traffic transport with all Buick aerodynamics. Wherever you look, you can see the Ford logo. Product placement is up here and it's unpleasant. Ben Kingsley does a good job like The Hood, but he can do it only with a one-dimensional role. If you can take the film for its very slim merit, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just do not look too closely at the machines that drive it. ADDENDUM: I finally saw it all, and it's worse than I thought. The effects are fairly delicate and while the effects are fairly good, the story of the multiple views has been won by the cheesier. Excessive product placement for Ford is unpleasant and children as central characters are growing on my remaining nerves. Just as with avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is tolerable. But not so much. Check out the original show and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And the word of counselor Jon Frakes. Perform a renewal course at the Guild Director. You can do better, old friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Last night. On Telemund. Renowned in Spanish, with sound comedy sounds. And yes, I came in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia on their battle scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be possible that the fake movie would be worse, but that was it. It was embarrassing bad. <br /> <br /> If it was done straight, no rescue children, no jokes in speech, could work. As it is, it is just another beloved child's joy that has been destroyed.
