This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All attendees should be embarrassed. Each. Ice-T is pitiful, the dialogue is totally terrible and Hokie will not begin to describe the performances of each individual actor in this movie. The plot is stealing heavily from Executive decisions, but compared to Air Rage, the executive decision is an Academy Award. I've never been so disappointed watching the movie. Air anger should be burned with ash locked in a vault that has never found daylight. Everyone who saw it should shower and rinse from them a terrible horrible film. The best part of this movie is likely to come from the end when credits grew. It was perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to the law and order, and the rest of the people in this movie should step out prematurely or commit suicide. Either way, they should never try to be in the movie again.
