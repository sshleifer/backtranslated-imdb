This Oscar Petersson film is unique. Its uniqueness does not lie in the story, as many of the five brain works in Hollywood have served us with comparatively unfortunate drawings, but rather a consistent way that complete and utter annoyance in one aspect is associated with the same lust in all other aspects. /> <br /> The dialog is worse than embarrassing. The mixture is rotten and horrible. Bosnian-speaking English with heavy Swedish accents give unmistakable humor. Unshaded flash and camera work are icy in Turkish film. As a surprise for the audience, there are a few completely uninitiated slow sequences where you least expected. To add an insult to injury, the whole thing is cut by someone who has no sense of timing. <br /> <br /> "A bad guy wrestler turns well after listening to a good guy scene" in the church, it's time for Ed Wood to shake off as the worst director of all time; Through Ed Wood - Oscar Petersson Comes!
