When I look at a day at Ohio University, there will always be one event in which I recall pleasant memories. Channel 23 is the OU's local access channel and has played almost everything that has been uploaded until the last few years. It included many DIY films from the Peeps marshmallow guy microwave and then scanning photos from them online, on the Macbeth version to play the 8th graders who apparently just learned how to make squibs. However, the king, in my opinion, that Channel 23 was a Midnight Skater. For the first time I watched it was about 2 am. I had to study. Or sleep. Or watch ordinary TV. But no, that's all for cats. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater and when it was complete, I do not think any of us would believe any of the movies just happened. But surely, it was a few seconds later, and we had to realize that this movie actually existed. I could go on and on about how terrible it is, but it's a terrible lifestyle that's worth living. The conspiracy is disorderly, it is horrible, everything is a mental scar, but God, if anyone is looking at you, it is impossible not to look at it well. It's like when you first hear "Guts" Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear it, you are disgusted and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and desire is for someone else to experience the terrible horror you have just endured. The long story short, Midnight Skater, for all his epic faults, makes for some very late night entertainment. Plus, I desperately want Theme to Midnight Skater. Kudos to the one who wrote it and sang. Sweet god I love that song.
