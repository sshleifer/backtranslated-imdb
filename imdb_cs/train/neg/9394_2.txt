Oh, man, how low the series have dropped like in 1952! This boring thing is exactly the kind of series that upset Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Not only did the heroes escape the pimps by adding scenes that were not there in the previous chapter (and that would probably not be possible - tell me that when baddies were thrown to the plane in episode 7 to 8, they would not see characters jump), but I think, that this series has a world record of serial footage. I think most of this is a serial footage! And not just from other serials (it looks like all the flying sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and scenes from "melted rocks" episodes 2 through 3 come from Captain Marvel's adventures), but on its own! The entire "Moon Trip" sequence (which is probably the shortest, it's 30 seconds long and characters never lose Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Still wondering why MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12?), They had to stop after 9, so they did not have to do the whole thing again!) <br /> <br /> He started out on a science factor. Get ready to see the sunniest Moon ever! And the moons that can not breathe in your world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too talkative and stuntmen (usually the best in serials) are a little and far. From a visual point of view, I'm the only one who thinks Commando Cody is bullet-shaped (or lemon-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous? The Rocketeer's was much colder, no matter how bad the movie was (and man, it was terrible). The tank vehicle is not much better, it looks like kids are doing it for Halloween. The only positive thing I think is that the actor who plays the hero is a cozy place for the usual muscular flock (hey, everybody has the right to be a hero!) But then he is so uncomfortable ... /> <br /> No Year they are not worth the attention because of nostalgia. See instead Captain Marvel. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (BTW, check out the Rememberable quotes section for real women's pounds).
