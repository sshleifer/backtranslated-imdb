This film is bad about a person's life. His business fails and can not imitate his wife despite several attempts. The plot is a complete chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie makes any sense. The story is so wrong that I just could not understand. It's a shame because the sets and costumes are well done and give enough visual insight. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redemption features still can not compensate for a bad plot and a bad narrative story. I'm overwhelmed by the big names who agreed to this film. It's such a loss of their talent. This movie is very bad. Avoid!
