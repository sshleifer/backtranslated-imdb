Warning! Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1.Polictically correct what to a foster house that even has a division of races. <br /> <br /> 2.Insults of intellect viewers with its simplifying lines. 3. Boy Slezy's father is almost directly taken over from Never Ending Story 2. 4. In a world full of crime, nausea, corruption, starvation and other proplus that need to be taken care of, the losing team throws divine intervention. PREVIOUS !!! <br /> <br /> 5.Se knew the angels did not swear ?! Where did heck do it come from? <br /> <br /> 6. Using the team helps the angel cause pain and humiliation to the opponents. Very real angelic! <br /> <br /> 7. The team of angels are helping to call ... you can guess ... ANGELY! Disney in the worst case! <br /> <br /> 8. "He just got his training wings."
