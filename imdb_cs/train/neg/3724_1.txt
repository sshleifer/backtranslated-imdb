I saw this film twice through the Pentecostal Church, which was attended by the Nanaimo BC family in the 1970s. I was wise at the age of 6, my brother 4, and then again when I was 8 my brother 6. This movie scared my brother and I made it as we saw the world with distrust. It was not just the movie, but also the philosophy that attracted so many "Christians" about the "beast's sign" and the exaltation. This film, the Church, and the volatile volatile upbringing lead to serious paranoia towards the future. For many years I have lived under the vaginal influences of the Church and the fear that Christ forgets. I've been 40 years old. He went through years of counseling. I once explained to the psychiatrist this film and the system of faith of the Church and the family. I was associated with a vicious disorder. Actually, I believed it, it was my brother who reminded me that this culture of philosophy actually happened. I am no longer in the future, I have dealt with the fear that the Church brings to its members. I have used this experience to fulfill my goal, I am approaching my entitlement as a psychologist who specializes in childhood trauma.
