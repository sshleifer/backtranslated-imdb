Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the inexplicable. He travels to this small town, where it is said that the witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. His car stops, wipes himself into a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly he turns into a demon and he kills her and the city is wondering who killed this woman ... which I think was a witch, but I'm not quite sure. Ivan is now pursuing her spirit or something, and she must have faith or something to defeat her. I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid stories and minimal effects. Not to mention that it is not just a Christian movie ... but also a foreign one. The vocal actor for Ivan made the film much more comical than terror, because it is so ingrained and whimpering. You will not miss this movie.
