If you are not spoiled by Russian people or boars, this movie is the most comfortable. In fact I slept for about 40 minutes and I had to fight the desire to leave the theater. I wish I had. Loss of a perfectly beautiful Saturday night. Even "Silent Hill" was more creepy. Hell, even the "labyrinth of the Lords" was more scary. I'm still unclear about what was supposed to be scary in this movie. <br /> <br /> First, I'm very unhappy with movies that use "Russian pidgin" as it did in the initial credits. I'm embarrassed because I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all crouched. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably for you) this movie has already escaped my brain and I left it an hour ago. So I have no specifics, just dark visuals that can not get anywhere, and some foolishness - now a dead hope of something happening. Maybe I've seen a totally mutilated version of this movie, because I do not believe it, I got such great reviews here (which is why I've seen it) and ended up completely rid of not only Horror or Suspense, but the overall value of entertainment as well. I give it 2 because I did, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I woke up and did not leave.
