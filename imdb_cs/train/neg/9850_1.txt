I felt the dead dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I've ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought it was Peter Jackson movie of the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are ridiculous. Special effects do not suit the test of time and look terrible. The screenplay promotes this type of television movie, looking at what kind of gaming is at a medium distance. The concept looks as if they were learning from Joey Tribbiani, they have one look and hold. Moreover, I was never confused with the films until I sat down to watch. It's a dream, or no conspiracy is so terrible that frustration will come in minutes. Avoid the plague.
