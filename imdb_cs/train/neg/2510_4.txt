This TV film tells the story of the extrovert Frannie, who suddenly returns to Silk Hope to visit her friends and family, but did not know her mother had died. Her sister runs a family house but plans to sell her and move with her new husband. Frannie strongly opposes this idea and promises to keep family heritage as it is, by getting a job and retaining responsibility. There comes a nice Ruben and they both soon fall in love (just like you), and it's from that moment that I've lost a little interest ... Farrah Fawcett is more than just blond hair and looks like he can portray the character very convincingly when and this is certainly proven here, as well as some of her previous efforts, such as Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary Charlie's Angel. Silk Hope is a type of movie that never comes from your cheap, cheerful TV picture, and you know there's a limit on the budget, but it's not the worst movie ever. Positive aspects exist; just find them.
