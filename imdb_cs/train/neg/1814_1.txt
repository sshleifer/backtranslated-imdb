All these reviewers are in place. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, believe me and that's so much! <br /> <br /> It's not just about "so bad that it's a good" exploiter of a waste of time, but a real, cheerful, movie game. <br /> <br /> CHECK THE CURRENT BRUSH TYPE! <br /> <br /> WET YOURSELF LAUGHING on Thom Christopher's "Magic Tissue" playing! <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER AND ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! on mud sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those 'European co-productions'. No wonder we have so many wars. I swear that some people who participate in the "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" do not actually realize they are appearing in the movie! FACT! Originally, I watched this film on HTV Wales late one night and suffered shaking and sleeping. I had to track a copy after a few weeks to make sure it was really terrible. It is. Worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, which is more ridiculous than John Derek's films, it's really Citizen Kane of Trash.
