I love the book "Jane Eyre" and saw many versions. Everyone has their strong points and their mistakes. However, it was one of the worst things I've seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and definitely looked like an ordinary part, but she had no emotions in her line. I could not imagine what Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane if it was possible. How two such awkward people can fall in love is a secret, but I certainly did not believe it. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. Timothy Dalton (too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) The version is much more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the A / E version in 1997 (which is not all true for the book). <br /> <br /> I'm trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
