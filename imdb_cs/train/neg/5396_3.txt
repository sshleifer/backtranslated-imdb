I read notes that you should not watch this movie if you are looking for a Shakespearean dialogue. This is unfortunately true, because the entire disturbed dialogue that this wonderful game contains has been cut and replaced by songs. I've read this game and I was lucky to see it, it's one of my favorite Shakespearian Comedies, but it seems like this movie has everything I like. The Princess, though she undoubtedly did what she was supposed to do, had no royal relationship, and all the girls apparently lost the skill of their characters-also affected by unreasonable incisions that not only removed the female characters from a sparse dialogue but drew a comment from the context-it was a bit disturbing to hear Princess. "We are wise girls who mock our lovers!" When the mockery did not happen at all. The reports that were filmed throughout the movie also broke the flow and took many great scenes because they displayed information in scenes after them and were in modern phrases. The end is a great game, ruined by a strange concept and bad cuts. Kenneth, I mostly love what you do. What did you think?
