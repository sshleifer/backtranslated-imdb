This film has a lot of problems with him that make him a low-budget project from someone in a movie school. But I have to realize this is all right. Many times in the movie I laughed hysterically. It was so bad that it was comic, making it a fun watch. If you are looking for a low-grade slasher film that would appear in psychological horror and a dash of cheap ridicule, pop up a popcorn bowl, invite some friends and enjoy yourself. I agree with other notes that the sound is very bad. Dialogue is almost impossible to track a lot of time and the soundtrack is a bit there.
