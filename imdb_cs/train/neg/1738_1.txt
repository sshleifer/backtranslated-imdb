This miserable film is a remake of the 1927 film. They should let it stay that way. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks has absolutely no charisma. Cesar Romero is exposed as a real blockbuster, and Bette Grable sings with the chorus - What I Do in Hungarian! A funny plot deals with the image of a woman at the castle in 1561 Rome, who saved the day by killing the conqueror. (Fairbanks) We will now go 300 years later, where Grable, just married Count Romer, is similar to the situation when the invasion of Hungarian soldiers is on a wedding night. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and escapes before the army arrives. He is hiding like a gypsy and is used to staying in the castle when his violin is played by Fairbanks. The end is worse than the whole crazy movie when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - Romero furious Romero canceled marriage. This bad imitation of the film originated in 1948. Like Harry Davenport, a veteran supporting player who is in it, died in 1949; it must have been his last film. What kind of bomb is going on after such a prominent career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel plays co-stars, but he can do little with such bad writing. Costumes look more like those that came out of the Stone Age. I can not understand what Fairbanks is wearing.
