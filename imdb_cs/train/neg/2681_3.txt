A very good story of a movie that would be really interesting, but where the hell is the end of this movie? In fact, what does it mean? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zip scenes so fast you felt you were not part of the movie emotionally, and feeling that they are separated from understanding the story. Casting performance is questionable if not credible. <br /> <br /> I was missing somewhere in the movie? I think we have to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
