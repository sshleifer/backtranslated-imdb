Unpaved / Unbelievable story line, (when I found out where it went, I did not like) bad casting (came ... William Macy as a hit man?) Bad Direction (Have you ever seen Tracey Ullman so bad?) I had to take care of what happened to the unethical, incompetent, carefree figure of John Ritter?) Bad script ... (I really did not look for the formulation script but it was really terrible) The only really good thing in it was a child. Ten lines? Is not it ok if your comment is less than ten lines? Come on ... whose rules are you? Why can not I tell what I have to say for less than 10 rows ??? Is not that random? Why is not less than 10 lines of comments ok?
