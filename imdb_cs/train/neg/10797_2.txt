It was the genie that played Shaq. His name was Kazaam, and he was rich. His rhymes were furious, these lines were bad, some stupid child screaming over my stupid daddy, bad actin, bad casting, bad special effects, what's next? this movie is upset Prolly did not make $ 20 that lives in a boombox, nor does a lamp hurt like spasms like a wet food ... Yeah, you get it, a silly rhyming genie you can not do in a silly movie with a terrible special effect. Oh, and her confusing. I will not continue. Let's say it belongs to the category "so bad, its fun". Watch it once with your friends and get a good laugh. But do not expect anything magnificent.
