I did not like a frosty return and this one. Both films are absurd with badly written characters and bad voices. Voices could have been made, but Frost's return was worst for the snowman they drew. The frosty winter landscape was great and it was also the original dramatic drama. The only good thing about this film was Frosty that the snowman was similar to the classic 60s and a funny line as if talking about things that are not real, and then Frosty walks through the window buzzing, whistles what he does, but everything else wrongly written and wrong animated and I barely got a plot. I saw a DVD cover in the library about two or three years ago and the art looked bad, so I did not catch it until this year because the backs on my back looked a little touchy but I was playing this movie. It was a row of badly artistic characters, just like a DVD, and it was terrible what's going on. I looked at it at night and found it boring to sleep on the whole thing (Wait, I always do when I look at something when I go to sleep) But this movie was boring overall Overall rating: Grade C <br /> <br /> It's like another special bad reflection in a frosty return and this. This is a bad 4th sequel as Home alone 4 and I thought the movie was fine but at home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate it like this. My sister did not look so much, because as she walked into her room to watch for two and a half minutes, she went away like "I hate animation!" I agree with her as well as the third when Frosty returns. Terribly terrible!
