I tried to trace this film just because I collapsed with bad phrases about "teenagers killing and killing men in his house" and the like. I think I first saw parts of this movie when I was about 10 years old when running on the cable. She was quite impressed! It's a kind of movie that kids know they should not watch and switch channels when their parents come. When I saw who was occupied, I could not believe that some of these good actors are in such a terrible movie. Again, if you want to see the men who cheat on their wives are murdered then it's an interesting movie. Also, when I recall, there are pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the silly end of all time, but still ... unforgettable.
