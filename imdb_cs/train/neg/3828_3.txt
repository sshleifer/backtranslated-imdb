In 1976 the western genre was exhausted, and the producers of this film knew it clearly. Still, instead of having the project interpreted and saving us from watching it, they went on and did the same. They obviously need an interesting thread to get the audience to come and see the movie, and they have decided that it will be as violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch, so why should not it work? Of course, The Wild Bunch benefited from an excellent screenplay, but the The Last Hard Men scenario is plain old-fashioned garbage. It's hard to see what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired officer who goes after the expelled side of the convicted guilty man (Coburn). Hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) was kidnapped by condemned and subjected to sexual degradation. This is a bloodthirsty film, in which every time someone dies, the upper detail. It's really a great disappointment, because stellar pairing sounded like amazing prospects. There is no sense of tempo or urgency in the movie. It took an eternity to get it, but when the event finally comes, it is confused with the emphasis on anger. Overall, this may be the worst movie ever made by Heston. I'm sure it's one of the productions that he does not agree with his famous biography.
