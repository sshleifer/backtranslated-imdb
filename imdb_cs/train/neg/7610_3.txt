Generally, I do not like Sydney Pollack's films ("The Firm" are somewhat exceptions) and I've never been a fan of Robert Redford. Still, I thought that "The Three Days of Condor" must be good because of the amount of cognitive comments he received. Though widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye, and Max von Sydow is a handsome, sinister, professional killer, I find the whole thing extremely disappointing. The film undoubtedly radiates a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is destroyed by a confused plot that obviously does not make sense. The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory endings I have ever seen and which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what about the absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I'd rather watch one of Hitchcock's films five times in a row than sit down this waste again.
