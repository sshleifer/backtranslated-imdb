And how many actors can get on their own neurotic, compulsive personality of the New Yorker? In this film, Woody plays Will Ferrell in what is a less graceful personification than Kenneth Branagh's "Celebrity". It is an unpleasantly recurring story: an unprecedented, neurotic man with his wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with the Queen of Shikes, on which she shows all perfection. Everyone lives in the perfect gigantic apartments in the great neighborhoods of Manhattan, all of which are constantly subject to expensive exclusive restaurants, during which all characters combine fascinating anecdotes and discuss mysterious philosophy. There is always a trip to the Hampton during which the infamous main character takes on the sand and physical exertion and possible exposure of the illnesses and then of course tells that the main character feels guilty because of his quest for queen shikes but still watches it sometimes succeeds sometimes failing, etc. This tired pattern, and the proof that Allen is not really a great filmmaker at all. He looks like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20-year-old who is interested in telling the same boring old stories again and again.
