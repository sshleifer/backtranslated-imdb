A defective villain gives the secret service a tip for a secret service in presidential details that plans to kill the president. Baloney. How did he know? The script then deals in detail with a detailed examination of how a secret service works, but who cares about it. Most of this slows the movie. All the followings that follow are the versions of this film from the tedious automobile pursuit of many movies. Then, after the impossible athletics in which our hero overcame all his friends, we have a Toronto City Hall firefight. Canadians are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did they get into it? In the end, everything is processed. But it still makes no sense.
