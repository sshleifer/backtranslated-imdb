Allen goes to the ground (somewhere he hates real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which are the usual successful white middle classes that appear in many movies. <br /> <br /> I usually find something to entertain in Woody Allen's comedy, but he's really flat on his face. Even the seemingly abandoned unicorns have left him. In fact, there is no land (bar pieces and shakes of Shakespeare) - but Allen seems to use a place to allow polar air that makes the matter even more and without a radius. <br /> <br /> It just does not work at any level and it's just a huge drilling. The best thing about this movie is that bad reviews are likely to cause him to wake up and realize that just throwing a slapdash script and delaying your buddies does not mean fun.
