It will be best known for Ferrari, who was crashed when Eddie Griffin is doing commercials. The story of racing and betting is badly made by numbers that seem to have a director who could not see numbers. To a large extent point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it on a paycheck. It's not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be able to watch and end up like some that no movie is worth bothering about, no matter how you look at it. Misogynistic, despite the fact that one of the leaders is a woman, it is a film that was clearly made just for the producer and the director to get close to handsome girls. Do you want proof? There are a lot of long-standing women's cuts almost nothing that serves no other purpose than to get up from people who are too afraid to rent porn or sporty illustrated DVDs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
