Everything you really need to know about this movie comes after the introductory scene when you fall into the lake and get it. Then they begin to roll the title credits: You see "Slugs!" in capital letters, shortly afterwards "movie". WHEW! I was concerned that I was inadvertently tuned to "The Slugs: The Musical" or "Slug: The Game Show". Anyway, from there, the film gets worse about killing. You see one man having cut off his hand because he had a slug in his gardening gauntlet, two men attacked slugs during sex, and a girl who fell on her back in the underground corridor was killed by deadly slugs. It's a pretty silly movie that falls into the "so bad-is-good" category. It's also so badly shot in such a grainy movie that you're shocked when you know it was made in 1988 (my estimate was in 1974). I am very surprised that he has earned as many points as he has, because most people do not give any love here. But if you want a movie that tries to frighten you, but ultimately it's ridiculous, it's one of your best candidates.
