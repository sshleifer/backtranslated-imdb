It is another depressive and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It is very uncompromising and predictable and continues throughout the film. I still waited for it to rise, but unfortunately it never happened. The game is fair, but the script needs a lot of work. And if you're looking for nudity, do not waste your time with these not so hot actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of subtitles, I miss a 1/8 movie. If you have never seen more than five homosexual films or you have recently confronted yourself with being homosexual, you may find this movie interesting, otherwise it is your low budget. It ranks among one of the worst gay films I've ever seen.
