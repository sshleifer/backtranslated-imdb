I did not know that Devry University (or ITT Tech?) In the early nineties added the film to her wonderful repertoire of technical study programs. But this movie had to be the product of a class dancer. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the other side of the DVD. Do not waste time with this movie. Terribly awful terrible. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman has dreams about Boogeyman and his victims from the first film. More than 50% of this film comes from the original film. The rest of the film is the main character who has bad dreams while her therapist encounters narrators. These scenes are shot with a filter so strong that the lights are on. Angela Lansbury should look 25 years old. So, to recapitulate, terribly. Do not search for this movie.
