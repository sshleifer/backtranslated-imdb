When I came to this title, which I remembered alive when I saw it for the first time in 1982, I was hiding over Richard Burton's list of movies. I remember the dialogue from Tatuma O'Neal, which was terribly bad. I remember the character of Richard Burton, who seems so hopeless, and then I remember how his motivation did not show up. In short, I remember "Circle Two," because it was so terribly horrible. This film came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or sloping angles to teenage sexuality. Let's recall the "Blue Lagoon" (and other inconveniences Brooke Shields), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that seemed to be mostly teenagers. As a teenager during this time, I found an obsession with the 70s and 80s sexual excesses that were created for a subconsciously disturbing environment in which everything is expressed. The "Circle of Two" is not enforceable or unnecessarily prurient, like the "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it deals with the question of love between young and old in a courageous, if not unsuccessful, way. But honestly, it's one of those movies you can never see if you did not see it in your first run, because it was so terrible. No one would want these garbals to be publicly distributed on the surface.
