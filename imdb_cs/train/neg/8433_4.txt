Pere is an idiot but knows about it and acts as a result. His life is totally boring and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. She feels completely empty and decides to go drunk. When she returns home, she crashes with the girl who advertises. Although he ignores him, he falls in love and begins to watch her closely. But the beginning of the movie is a little slow and can be boring for most people. However, as the action starts, it's a bit better (not much! Maybe, the best part is 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) that you can see in the middle of the movie, it's not good for erotic but fun and unexpected it's probably the best of the movie, neither the actors nor the directors are good and the results are a boring movie that can be fun for some people.) The whole movie is based on absurd situations (an idiot, as the film says) I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit it's not one of his best movies (maybe his worst!) knows he's doing better.
