Oh, my where to start ... this movie was terrible. Writing was bad, it was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but it certainly did not! I thought it would be good enough because I'm not choosy. I watched several bad horror films. In fact, my goal is to see all the horror movies, no matter how awful they are. At one point in the movie, I commented on "Corn Syrup Blood," and in special characteristics it admits that it was Karo Syrup (a brand of corn syrup ...) The film had all the necessary things for horror film (blood, nudity, crazy killer, silly moves) , but simply was missing nothing that would really be good. A writer should either take some classes or just give up!
