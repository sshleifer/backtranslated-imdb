It's sad that it's not "the best British gore film since it's a hellraiser," although DVD packaging claims it, which convinced me that I bought it. But it is a tribute to the many horrors of old films from the most important Amicus stations. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... is filmed on a mini dv, which although we all know it has more television feel than a movie can do much better. Each scene, setting and shots look as if they were illuminated exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear setting), which only increases the left look of the finished piece. The content of gore is, frankly, ridiculous. From the introductory shots, where we can see that a man is obviously foamed from his head, to the left cheap sinks, creatures, and terrible cg, there was nothing I could ever dream of. <br /> <br /> The game is hideous, from a close comet detective to a bummy dwarf, through Dani Filth, the least convincing horror film I've ever witnessed. Each subtitle is more formidable than the last, and files get worse and worsen when the movie is started. Take a look at "Mental Asylum" - a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad cg character outside and the most bizarre (and not a good) padded cell I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Four attempts to get to the end of the movie without my observation wandering (on, running) away for every opportunity available. In fact, I found out that I was hit at one point while the movie ran. But that's one of Emily Booth's last known performances, which is about one (two, two) things to go. Once it's out of the way, it's all downhill. I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I'd like to believe them, but I'm not likely to do so. on. If you want a good interview with Amicus, avoid it and join the League of Gentlemen Christmas Specials. <br /> <br /> It is currently fighting with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I've ever seen.
