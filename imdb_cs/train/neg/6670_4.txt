This movie really got off to a great start. It had the potential to turn into a true heart, a romantic love story with cinematography that recorded love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be any more than that, and for a moment I was excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for her own needs, another timeless classics, a modern myth perhaps. Why, why, then it slows down by making the main character (Norton) another psycho? Perhaps I miss the point, but do we really need another movie about psychics? Or is this the need in Hollywood to portray a sick human face that suggests more general unfavorability in the film industry? At that moment, I realized that the director had a name; now I left a feeling of indifference. At least, it should be added in the defense of the film that all actors apparently invested in their roles. Also, Evan Rachel Wood is really beautiful to look and good actress with great potential.
