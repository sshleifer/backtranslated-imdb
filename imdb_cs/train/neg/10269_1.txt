this movie is blatant. shameful, I mean terrible. I was more passionate about watching the dry color of my local hardware store in August and also suffering from migraine and heat stroke. acting gradually worsened by "the film" advancing and directors used euphoric drugs as they approached the final scenes. when she was silenced by death, she decided that it would be reasonable to flicker the moon. it was not intelligent. probably, that Stevie did it to catch it. if you decide to play a nail gun while you are under the influence of alcohol and watching this movie, keep in mind that a nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
