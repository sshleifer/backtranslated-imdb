Incredible. Does it get any stupid than this? No chance. Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo were embarrassed by stupidity in this film. If the first part of the series had average dialogs and the other had a bad dialog box, this dialog has a rough dialogue. Amazing. This time, however, the story has also fallen to the level of dialogue. Through playing and dialogue, I liked the first two movies, but "Cube Zero" certainly kills franchise. A completely sad conspiracy is obviously the result of a frustrated left wing pen. Sometimes I wonder if the left ones even realize how antidemocratic and pro-dictatorships are. In this movie, they are probably focusing on the US? democracy. Why do not they apply to Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. in anti-military films? Of course, most of these sites are hardly likely to create such a cube in the near future, but it is next. It is obvious: garbage writers like this really admire these kinds of regimes, whether they realize it or not. I would even go as far as to say that someone who tirelessly attacks US foreign policy all the time has a non-democratic belief in its core. <br /> <br /> Back to the film: Besides being so distant that it is no longer funny, the film has many obvious illogical features. For some reason, for example, two men who supervised the cube did it for a while, not forgetting the pain and sadism that the project brings, even though the first and the other suddenly turned against the system! Everyone who has any idea of ​​human nature at all will see through this idiocy. Or about that shy character, the one-eyed bureaucrat who speaks like he's in a bad comedy Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses ALL of the seriousness and therefore every chance to be exciting: it will actually become a comedy.
