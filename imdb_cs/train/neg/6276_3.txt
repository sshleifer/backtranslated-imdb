BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Not a slasher or a full gore. Lots of broken glass and mirrors in this sharp thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis. Successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) enters a special world because her life seems to be out of control. When visiting Father Jenkins' birthday celebration, guests are amazed when a mirror strikes the floor for no apparent reason. Things are really weird when she's seeing a woman who is a lewd portrait of being on a street in London in a car that's identical to her own. Gina creeps through her being and finds a photo with her father. He leaves and is involved in the head during a collision. Then mysteriously her friend is not the same; being an exact family and friends is not easy to believe for her. Is Gina next to each other? Is it in the parallel world? Her nightmares become more terrible ... is it broken? Kudos, if you can read it ... it will not be easy. The edits could not be stricter. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
