On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (we think, three of us Kamal hardcore fans) have reached a unanimous verdict; VV was solid and because of the film we were really sick on Monday. Not to mention that we swore to stay out of theaters next year. Kamal Kamal is not mad because in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like, "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Scenario, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Cinema has grown from the point of view of photography and editing, but we have hardly improved if it's script, direction, and acting.) While watching VV, these words are very true. <br /> <br /> There are 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br / > 3. Harris Jeyaraj I barely used to use the explexes here, but the fact is that HJ mastered (when you remember "Anniyan", "Ghajini"), with the craving of cacophony, he considers it background music. Next time I have my eyeglass transplant, she will pay for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <span style = "font-weight: bold; <br /> <br /> 5. Short off too far. VV is at best capable of being a short story, not 2 hours plus a "thriller". To use cliches here, such as the Energizer bunny, goes on and on; just in this case you do not want it to. The later part of the film feels like a great resistance. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika Pairing Two ice cubes that have been torn off could cause more sparks than this pairing. There is no reason why you could root them. In fact, every time they gather in the second half of the film, they do a good story. Hate to say, but the 10-minute romance of Kamalini Mukerjhee is doing more than what Kamal and Jothik achieve in this movie plus "Thenali". <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan's accent Kamal has this demanding accent that no one speaks in India or the US; and it's not new either. It has been since the "Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae". It's just nervous. Imagine what confusion can cause when his perception of using this strange accent meets filming on the spot in the US. He did not leave even the Immigration, offered him lots of advice from his men (confused by the TN Cops from Keeranor, Sathoor and others) in Stone Kamanglish ("Here we have a rough police wok"), of course with nausea. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are several directors that you expect to stand up to a certain extent. Gautam disappoints us with some dirty performance in the common sense department. Which DC, in his senses, would fulfill his love interest in the streets to discuss matters such as what he committed himself and his life after him! The scene inside the theater was so bad, to the top; we could hear people who have been loudly attacking us with IQ. "Is he stupid, can not use his siren or lights?" (On the road from Madras, Kamal-Cop-Cop-Jeep chases the boy on a bike just like any ordinary guy!). "Can not just use his weapon?" ("Guy on the bike" starts on foot and for a long time we have a full-fledged camel in a hot pursuit). I do not vote for it later, but I just try to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped, my throat is getting rid of, more women raped and thrown into bushes with unbearable authenticity, I would sit at home and rather watch a "police report" or " Kuttram ". The use of excessive violence should go so long as the story is prolonged and not overcome it! Somewhere along the way, it seems that Gautum is confused about what is spreading (rape, murder) and what is the backing (story)! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double shot of Espresso could not get the headache.
