This film is weak, the box-cover says the toughest gang of East LA and it's really Santa Ana, James Cahill acts as the queen of the closet that takes off all the hard guys in the hard Chlo gang. It's fake, boring, nonsensical and nice, trying to get money back from a video rental site this movie was so bad. It was also a homo-erotic tip that is far from what the video-box announces. James Cahill should act in Gay Porno. James is in every scene, he can not save himself to save his life. The film includes Eve Longoria, which is hot, but James can not even score it !!!!!!!!! I sometimes felt that I was watching Gay Porn and was off with the whole movie. James clearly wants to be with men, but rather than subdue his gay hardcore, takes gang members over and over again. His skills in martial arts are at best minimal. Some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and tear him apart.
