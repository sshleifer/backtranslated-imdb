Vampires vs. Zombie was not the original title. In fact, it was ... <br /> <br /> Nasty lesbian semi-vampires and two zombies who got into the car: Special performances of Bob's Lesbian Gypsies-Witch and Her Dog, Random Woman with Special Powers and Catholic School Girl short skirt Zombie choir. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: No Plot - Only a writer and director will understand the end or something else in this movie. But I really love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Damn, I'm even enjoying lesbians. This film has combined all three with an obscure and confusing (or non-existent) plot, a terrible (I mean a really bad) dialogue and a random STUFF and LID that have nothing to do with (or not ... they did not know what was going on in the world) . Oh, and I must not forget the green oatmeal "Zombies" in latex gloves (yes, movie makers were so cheap they could not even cover their zombie hands in oat flakes and color). Anyway, the result was this extremely crazy movie if you could even call it. <br /> <br /> The end was supposed to make sense? The vampire was really a nurse and the other girl was really a psychic? Where Was Vampire Vs. Zombie? Shit, where the vampires were ... they really could not call any of the girls' vampires. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> Never borrow or buy this movie. If you're really curious ... well, I'll understand. Seriously, even lovers of BAD films will not be able to withstand this. It should be number 1 at the bottom 100.
