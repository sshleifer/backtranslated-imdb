This is just the second time I stopped the video / DVD part through. <br /> <br /> I was willing to give this film the benefit of doubt at first, even though it managed to be as shallow, clich√© and stupid .. And godless, fruitful and demanding. It was like a school after school that drives the strange grade of nine guys who think nobody understands it ... scary and sad, only the most adventurous teenager would think about poetry ... and some singing and ... no, indeed, about the suffering of a poor child ... Enough, especially when it became a miserable, clumsy and insulting orange ripoff watch. And did I sing singing? It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but certainly the one I felt the least forced to sit on. I do not recommend anyone.
