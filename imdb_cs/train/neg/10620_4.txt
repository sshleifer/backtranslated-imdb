Although some exciting (and bold) sequences, the NBTN simply never goes. There are explosive ships, murderous hats, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mysterious / horror scenes, but they are scattered over long periods of pure exposure. Everyone in the movie looks bored. This is a shame because many sequences would be considered bold at the time they were filmed. <br /> <br /> Add "too-right" British characters and you feel like you got into the Sherlock Holmes movie. Finally, cinematography is very common. There are plenty of opportunities for beautiful shots in the country, or intricate shots of someone who is attracted to a huge fire, but the whole thing is unthinkable and boring. Definitely for fans of Lee and Cushing.
