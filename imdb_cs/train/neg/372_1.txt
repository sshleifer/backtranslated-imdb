I've seen this movie long ago, and I have no desire to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Preston water, an unfortunate preteen that always seems to be overlooked by his family and which always seems to be inadequate. All this will change when a bank robber gets past Preston's bicycle and hands him an empty check as a replacement. Preston uses a $ 1 million check to withdraw from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to a bank robber who gave him a check). Preston then buys the house and says he works as a assistant to a mysterious and rich supporter appointed by Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). Then he gets rid of the money. <br /> <br /> It sounds great on paper. On the screen, however, this is one of the easiest films I've ever seen. First of all, it's incredible. I know some parts of the movie were unbelievable, but I drew a line at a twelve-year-old boy who was dating a thirty-year-old woman and charged with the small property of an imaginary man. It was also a shallow film with weak play, a predictable line of plot and characters that are less than unforgettable. The figures were either cheesy, over the top, unpleasant or insufficiently developed. But "Juice" was a funny character. If you are looking for a good movie that you could watch with your family, skip this.
