I can not believe that this film has invested $ 17 million. Extremely bad dealings, tremendous scripting and the effects you could do on your average PC, an incredible plot plot ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced flight attendant an important job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this movie is so hopeless that you come out of feeling as if you were trying to reap over your head full of a cross. He will make this whole movie, preach the choir, and everyone else will laugh at such an absurd waste of money. If the creators of this film really wanted to bring people to Christianity and show what it really meant to believe, they would use the money to help the people who really needed it. Now, some people could learn to really listen to them.
