Meet Peter Houseman, the genetic professor of the rock star at the University of Virginia. When he does not move on the pitch, he blows up his mind and drops his legs in lectures in the classroom. Dr. Houseman works on a serum that allows the body to constantly regenerate cells that allow humans to become immortal. I would like to be immortal if I looked like Christian Bale and got a sweet woman that only the VU can offer. An assortment of old and ugly university professors does not care about the favorite Houseman, and due to insufficient results, he has interrupted his project funding. This causes Peter to be used as a guinea pig for his serum. Much to my astonishment is the side effects and he, to get it, metamorphoses! into something that is embedded in our genetic DNA that has been suppressed "millions of years". He also bed Dr. Mike crushes Sally all day long to meet her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He's an angry little boy. Metamorphosis is not a terrible film, it's just not well made. All the time I watched this, I could not overcome the fact that it was shot in 1989. The appearance and impression of the film is at the latest in the late seventies. It does not help it packed along with 1970s because Metamorphosis is part of 50 freezing classical classic experiences. Basically, there is no difference in the quality of the film. The last five minutes is pure bad film cheese, which actually saved me at least from lower ratings. Pay attention to computer terminology such as "chromosomal anomalies". No wonder Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can not spell! This is worthy of the outlook followed by a trip to the local pub.
