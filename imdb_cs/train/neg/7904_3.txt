Exquisitely looking small boogers that reproduce the foam and reproduce themselves. So far for the horror elements of this film. All the other MUNCII are playing like a really retarded comedy, which is so stupid that you will not be funny after 15 minutes. I can imagine little kids who will ask about these little boogers, but adults will only stay with allegedly "clever" links that convert to on-screen recordings such as Capt recordings. Kirk of STAR TREK, the most famous scene from ET unexpected statement by filmmakers "Let's look at the success of GREMLINS!" and a cardinal cutter by Clint Eastwood who tells us ... And what about his western movies exactly? The last one was totally lost to me ... Oh yes, and the removal of chemical waste in caves seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where they got the idea. Do not say MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie you can sit down on. It's really, really stupid. And if you can hurry a smile while watching, you will probably feel like stupid yourself for doing it after finishing the movie. Good reputation? Yes, but only if there are "stupid", "slow" and "ridiculous" criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and well, uhm, 6/10.
