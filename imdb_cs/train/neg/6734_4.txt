I thought this movie was a great idea he did not do. They seem to have found a way to build tension, but they could not stand out well. In one case, the police are on time to find shelter for kidnappers. Carefully they go from the dentist to the dentist to match the dental record. At the same time the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. Upon completion of construction, the police will arrive at the same time and get freely, which is the least climatic. There are also great narrative scenes that take us "within the mind" of a terrorized husband and wife, which tends to exacerbate tension before adding to it. We are fully aware of their tension and the voice is insulting and depriving the viewer of any chance of personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock shows from time to time, is much more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit the whole movie and get a quick, somewhat insignificant ending. I mean, that ... "ends" in the temple.
