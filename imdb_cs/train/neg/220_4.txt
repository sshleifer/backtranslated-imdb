"The Crush" is nice even though she is trying to be British "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the turn of a young piece trophy, whose character is not very exhausted (think about not seeing so much physical meat from him and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more). <br /> <br /> Surely they do a lot more young men's / older women's shops than was made on the opposite side in one of the "Sabrina" versions (or the movie I do not like) or in that case with Douglas / Zeta -Jones or Dion / Svengali. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell's surroundings like ex pat are otherwise welcomed by famous British dramas and comedies such as Anna Chancellor dancer. <br /> <br /> The plot shrinks towards the target very delicately ex machina. But it was not until the credits appeared in the end that I realized what might really be wrong. As with "Sex and the City", the writer / director is a man, here is Scottish magazine John McKay, and I think he really wanted to make a screenplay about three homosexual men, probably about them in relation to their lovers and at work school principal, policeman and doctor), which would be a better and more interesting film. The working title of this movie was "The Sad F * cker's Club," which was even more obvious with parallels to the Broken Hearts gay club. <br /> <br /> (originally written June 4, 2002)
