To be honest, this film is another of a series of great disappointments ... most of the so-called "Horror Masters" films are scary in terms of their subtle effects and ridiculous stories ... outside of Ron Perlman, everyone else in this film can not act to save their lives ... the sounds sounded like somebody's playing Bop-it under the boom microphone or something like that and looked absolutely unrealistic ... Overall, this movie is about as scary as the home alone ... the only good masters are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night because they know they've destroyed the genre that some of them really understand. .
