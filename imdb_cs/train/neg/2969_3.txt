The story is very trusted and powerful. The technical side of the movie is absolutely fine, even in direct. The main problem is the castings that have changed this film into almost another local and regular clich√© with a large lack of impact and even greater imprecision. Besides the small role of his father, Rafael (played impressively Asi Dayan), all other actors unfortunately were not at their best. The role of an older blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh, but without any intensity as the main role. hence the figure he acted became a moderate and low profile. There were times and episodes that looked more like a test, then a real movie. But after all, it is a good reason to start in the future and make great improvements.
