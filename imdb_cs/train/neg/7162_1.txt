This movie has what a good idea could be, a mummified 2000-year-old witch, and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry. They're going to stay with her Nan and my uncle. Uncle discovered a 2,000 year old witch preserved in peat. It revives her and has the form of Nora. It can not be killed conventionally (more is a shame). But Nora is developing a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is a Gothic horror film that was made cheap. It's a big mess. I have to ask why someone would want to make such a bad movie. I'm tempted to learn witchcraft to disappear. <br /> <br /> SECURE ALL COSTS
