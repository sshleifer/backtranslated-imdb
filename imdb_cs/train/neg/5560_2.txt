It seems right, any movie that Dolph Lundgren is playing is bad! I do not know if it's the fact that a plot full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. There is no spoiler here, it seems to have cast doubt on how it moves and moves in and moves and moves and touches things. In my opinion, it is a wonder that some of these projects will find venture capital that will get into the can and the theater.
