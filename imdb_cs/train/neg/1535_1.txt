I do not think it could be much worse. Assemble bad actors, fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you have? This B-speed is a purposeless excuse for the movie. The first story immediately shows poor video quality, and acting is really pathetic, especially when you bring a 25-year-old posing like a grandmother with a usual grandmother's ears. Besides, the man is fine, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look great!" NO! The Werewolf in this was the best of all three I would say, but his was not impressive yet, because it was all bad costumes. The face of the woman was later decent on Halloween, but not on the werewolf film. The more stories you go through, the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in this one who are completely slow down his ridiculous. The whole "I want to be a werewolf" "How could you do it to me?" It was stupid to say. You asked for it to go! The Werewolf will not even talk about ... his rat! The third one does not make sense ... almost forty-five minutes running, and boring narratives make up this story, and the whole switch thing is still not interesting. Boredom! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... that did not even hear some parts, it was stupid. The effects of the animals were either a rat or a pig that was stupid. Could not use lion sounds? Do not assume good movies use it. Well, i = f you are enjoying B-rates, that's good for you. I have this movie because I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and I'll buy any werewolf film and watch it more than once but it's just me. If you prefer good, do not waste money. Much please!
