it's the only movie I've ever left. bad acting - bad plot - bad casting - bad direction - bad cinematography - if they go wrong, they could not do a better job. I hope they are proud of their turkeys. I am surprised that someone associated with this movie was once again rented in Hollywood. do not waste time!
