I just hope that no classics / old-time historians have seen Cleopatra, or, if they did, they were laughing. The film is terribly inaccurate, more ridiculous than the "Gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical mistakes are formulated and fit well with the story). The most spectacular is Octavius, Caesar's heir, in the Senate before Caesar's murder: at a mature age of 19! In addition, acting is average. Timothy Dalton has more than just a hint of James Bond when he says, "Caesar, Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a ridiculously dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries to become a seductive pharaoh who did not look like he was in real life, but comes out as unbelievable. So this is a warning for all historians - this movie is not a true life!
