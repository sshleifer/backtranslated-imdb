I was a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle first and was so excited to have filmed a movie for one of my favorite A Wrinkle in Time books. But this movie has destroyed the excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg has been described in the book as having sparkling curls and glasses and considered very unbreakable. In the film he has straight hair and no glasses and is a "sporty type" with a deep voice. Madeleine L'Engle did not see anything like that. In fact, Meg was based on the character of Madeleine and depicted how she felt when she was young. This is just one major example of how the book and the film are different. So I would like to say that if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it, but if you're a dedicated Madeleine L'Engle fan and her Wrinkle in Time series, I suggest skip this movie.
