I'm glad he liked it, but I hated this movie. She had a very good idea for the story, but it ended. It was misspelled, misdirected, and misdirected. It had a few interesting plot points, but it was just skipped too fast, the writers had to realize what was going to hold on to these bits, lying about why she was kidnapped, and dusting the debris. Instead, it was "what's going on?" 5 seconds later, they're telling you. This film has no strain and I have been bored from the beginning to the end. I just wanted it to end. Go and hire misery, or the best laid plans, if you want to have a strain or a twist that leads you to the end.
