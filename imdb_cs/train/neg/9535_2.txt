believe it or not, this movie is worse than the number three.it is slower, the acting is worse and the story is very weak. there is not much to say about this movie. Even fight scenes are more dull than number three and I would think it is impossible. This is very slow 90 minutes. Unfortunately, in fact. I stayed, I hope it will be better. If you really want to see this movie, you should try to find a cheap rental it.it is hard to find (for buying it is) and probably for good reason.like number three, this movie has nothing to do with the first two.it is the same only in the title. However, I can best give the best of the best: no warning is 2/10
