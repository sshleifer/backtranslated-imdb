Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can someone tell me where should I laugh? There is no single hint or shadow of an idea. The three main actors are malignant, especially one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily, who do not have a Sicilian accent !!! Do not tell the dracula as Dracula ... just another purpose, based on the worst cabaret tradition, that this "movie" lasts only a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too, too heavy to save. I would put it "0" / 10, but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so I had to overestimate it by one brand.
