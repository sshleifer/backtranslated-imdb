Casting this movie includes some of the better actors from New Zealand, many of those I've seen in wonderful roles, but this film will fill me with deep shame just to be from the same land as they do. Fake American accents are the first clue they are going to do very badly. Further reviews, rather skilfully remarked that a luxury cruise ship is in fact an old ferry that is decorated with a few colorful flags stolen from used cars. Most occupancy seems to come from the (long) Long Island Newland Soybean Shortland Street. It's like sending this picture to a Christmas party at Shortland Street, which is the result of too many gins and perhaps a little Salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" meets "Love Ship", introduced to your local primary school and directed by autistic and you get an idea. If you are an actor, I recommend seeing this film as a study on how to destroy your caregiver.
