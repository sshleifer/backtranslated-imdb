This movie is cheerful, not good. The struggle is terribly wrong, while sometimes trying to shock by breaking some bones, and that happens only two or three times, it is definitely not enough to call it a shock. Shooting means that a hero can walk into an open field of 10 people that shoots him with Uzi, pick up a gun, start firing and not get hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the guy wakes up, loses his memory and starts fighting because that's what he's good at. Five years later, the memories come back, revenge blablabla. <br /> <br /> It is not worth your money, you really do not deserve time if you are drunk and bored.
