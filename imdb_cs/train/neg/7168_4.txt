The writer came up with a fairly decent idea of ​​the story, but many mistakes in plotting so much turned away from the movie, so it almost did not. Basic elements such as character development were at best redrawn. Inconsistencies also caused their ugly heads. Huge mansion in the middle of rural Irish landscape? Characters that just "appear" in the gardens during a stormy night (in very good times, can I add)? Overall, it was not "bad". I rated 4, based primarily on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
