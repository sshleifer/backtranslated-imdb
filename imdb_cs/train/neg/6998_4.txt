Hollywood always had a "religious picture" problem. The strange Cargo does not appear to be an exception. Although he uses talents of excellent cast and produced the highest budget, with appropriately moody photos from Robert Planck, the film fails to score the credibility. Perhaps the reason the film seems to be so realistic that the sudden impression of fantastic elements disrupts the audience's involvement in the action and character fate. It was hard for me to sit down through all the imaginative metaphors, parallels, and biblical references, and it was impossible to accept Ian Hunter's kindly knowledge-like Christ's figure. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was disabled. Few viewers from Boston / Detroit / Providence complained or traveled to other cities because it was clear from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow contributed to the "news report". Everywhere it's on the flop. <br /> <br /> It is special that the movie enjoyed something on the TV. The domestic atmosphere seems to make the allegory of the film more receptive to the audience. However, despite the growing reputation of a strange or unusual film, the conspiracy of this Strange Cargo flows through predictable, strongly moralistic lines that no one will have to guess about how the main characters eventually agree with fate.
