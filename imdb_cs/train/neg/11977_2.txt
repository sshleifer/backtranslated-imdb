Roy Rogers and the company are trying to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town that can boom if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (like "Cookie") dwarfs around. Jane Frazee (like Carol) loses a piece of her bitch on Mrs. Rogers. Foy Willing and Purple Sage stand-in drivers (or, is it a song?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the pioneers' sons. James Finlayson (from Laurel and Hardy) adds to the appearance of the Grand Canyon Trail. The free floorboard provides a winning comedy performance. Mrs. Devine's Hoof kicks his heels. There are also energetic human performances - but the material is not Grand. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
