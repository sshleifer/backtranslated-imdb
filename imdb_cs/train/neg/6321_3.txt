I can not imagine that someone, in a million years, would like to watch this movie. Not because it was one of the worst what has ever been done (it was not), but mainly because it's about 20 years old and oh-so-out of the mainstream. I tried to find out where I had seen an actor before, and it appeared. So, yeah, the child stops playing a small league because he does not like the nukes, it raises the main media attention and the quick Cold War. End. Fantasy, of course, but one so coconut would cause John Lennon to blush. Given that terrorism has replaced communism as -ism that has terrified us from hell, this film really has no relevance, except that at that time it is a (inaccurate) look back. Songs, actor and film craft are similarly undeveloped. The reason I rated it as well as I was because I watched this movie about 50 times when I was 5-6 years old and still have a place in my heart but now I realize it's not a complete cut of mustard . So if the Law of Big Numbers is valid and someone finally decides to take a look at this movie, be aware that there are much better ways to spend time, but much worse. (This time I'm leaving John Q. tirdy.)
