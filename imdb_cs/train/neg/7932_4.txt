Oh dear! What a disappointment. I have been watching the old West on British television for decades, and I did not know it until it showed up yesterday - most of the other Scott Westerns arrive about every few years, and it's usually worth seeing again. <br /> <The rich color and outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments that have already been made. I wanted to turn it off a few times, and in the end I did it in half, something I never did. Scott looked unusually greasy in charming eyes, his two sidekicks were annoying and so was a Mexican bandit boy. And I feel that army uniforms are about 20 years old too modern, not that it would bother the creators of many other West. It may have improved in the second half, but I could not bother to wait and see.
