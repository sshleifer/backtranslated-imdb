First of all, I had doubts when I looked at the DVD box and read that it was probably a lot of teenagers gathering at the lake to find something or something. Every movie that has such a premise has failed poorly, even as a movie slasher, except for the first Friday of the 13th. I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I just thought it was a bit better. No. Usually, I think every movie has something you can take from it. It has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do a favor and find something constructive to do in 80 minutes. Share paper paper or eat dirt.
