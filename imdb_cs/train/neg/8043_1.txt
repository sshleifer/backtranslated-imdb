Usually I have no problem going out of the bad movie, but it was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I was actually sitting down the whole thing, almost praying that he would have one minute of good film time to justify an hour and a half that was useless. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. A beachfront house where a group of friends of a colleague celebrates a holiday, this film suffers from numerous problems that are not worth seeing. First, there are conspicuous holes. Second, very few of the C-list (even can not be dare to call B), actors can act damn, so all scenes that have the potential to hurt unsuccessfully. Thirdly, the film rate is very upset and unpleasant when I look at most of the time for making a tedious building very difficult, which leads to very little surprise for the audience. Fourth, and most importantly, the end is partly counter-climatic because of how it ends (setting / who is a killer) and partly because the dialogue is just cruel. The film is the only film I'll ever say is the worst movie I've ever had a scene and I've seen a lot. So just as a bad joke, you'd have been happier than never heard, next time somebody asks if you want to know the secret you're going to scream, not really when you run in the opposite direction.
