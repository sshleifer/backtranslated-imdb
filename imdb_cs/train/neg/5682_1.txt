This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I like horror films, but it's the worst I've ever seen. I'm a huge gore fan, but most of the deaths in this movie are not shown. Just show us dead bodies and the only fatal scenes that really show up in this movie are terrible. The graphics look so fake. The actors are also terrible. There is no real feeling from any of them. Not only did I waste time watching this movie but I had to submit myself to a real record of the animals that were defeated during its start. If I could rate -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's bullshit. <br /> <br /> Do not look for it.
