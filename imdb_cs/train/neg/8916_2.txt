I chased this DVD when I saw it looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I've read a book about Yalom about a year ago and loved it, actually admiring Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I watched about 30 minutes of this film and I had to shut it down. I'm not sure if I can take much more. On a superficial level, faux accents, as others have commented, simply scatter and irritate and destroy in the worst case. The game is boring if it were to be passionate and comical if it were to be serious. The picture of Lou Salome is simply a flippant, and brilliant Freud comes out just a little more than a schoolboy. I see very little of the spirit of the book so far. I was hoping to recommend this movie to my students. Instead, I will refer to the book. Imagine that.
