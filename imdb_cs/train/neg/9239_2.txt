Heavenly days commit a serious comic faux pas: it's desperate to teach us a civic lesson, and it will not stop until we have passed the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly are on a trip to Washington to see the Senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), you're messing with the senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of your career), getting to know the villain of annoying stereotypical child refugees and meeting with the man on the train who reads Henry Wallace's book. Henry Wallace! A year later he was considered an almost communist dupe, but in 1944 he was A-OK. Add some really horrible musical moments, plenty of flags and a boring subplot about journalists and you have a movie that Philip Wylie must have made ready for the generation of Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Drastically unfun, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.
