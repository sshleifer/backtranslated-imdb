I'm not familiar with the trilogy but came to this film last night on Showtime. The film looked very well done with scenography and cinematography, but the script was carved and wooden. The meeting was quite bad - I thought the two women's fairy tales were usable. You have never really believed anything that supported the actors. It was a stereotype - a biblical reverend without a stomach, an authoritative captain, a soldier with a hothead, etc. I am sorry to have written it immediately as a Canadian without knowing it - Canada's telefilm ended with credits. I know I'm a terrible person. Maybe I forgot something in the beginning, but hostility towards the girls is never explained. Here they are besieged in the fortress of werewolves and men spend time and energy brutalizing two young women without reason. FOCUS people. There are a little more urgent situations outside your walls than whether these girls are like lesbians - that's just my conclusion about the hostility directed against them. If they can aim and fire a gun, you can do well with them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be solved later. I also think it's about the rest of the trilogy, are these girls to be protagonists? One of them murdered an Indian guy at the end who saved one of their lives. I think one is only a victim of her condition, which can not be blamed for her actions, but the other is just a killer who does not deserve her happy ending.
