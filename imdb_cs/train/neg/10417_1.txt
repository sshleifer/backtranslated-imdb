That would be a * great * silent movie. The game is really good, at least in Look Ma, I'm really great acting! how. <br /> <br /> Everything is huge. Each line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY! <br /> <br /> I mostly felt like knocking. Still, like any wreck on the train, I could not take my eyes off. This dialogue could work on the stage, although I doubt it. The screen was overcrowded, random, hackneyed, and almost every other stereotyped negative adjective you could come up with to describe really bad drama. <br /> <br /> If you like your melodrama in huge, bulk batch, you can * enjoy * movie * enjoy. But be prepared to wait. For all melodrama, this thing certainly produces at its own pace. This script had to sound a lot different when the actors who looked at it were reading. It just does not work as soon as they get to show in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB does a great job of us, occasionally when it uses its "scratch computer" controlled by a "weighted score". The star-shaped curse deserves less than 1. <br /> <br /> Character-based character is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pulling the hoops without any credible explanation of their maturation or evolution, it's not a development personality! Your characters must be motivated. The drunkenness of awakening and awakening in the field is * not * the development of personality. This is the story of the plot. <br /> <br /> Be away from this movie. Or at least observe how subdued it is. You may have a little fun of all the hand-waving characters to do. Oh, and the word wise - to prove that it is really an artistic movie, you see James Woods in all his thick male "look-at-me, I'm-figurative-and-literal-representation-the-naked-vulnerability-man" . you were not warned.
