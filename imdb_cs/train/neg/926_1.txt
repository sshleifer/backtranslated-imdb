This film is about Tyrann, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to call Tyrann, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. The tyrann, which we learn about an hour, is also called the Demonicus. This adds the much needed depth to the scenario and casts doubt on our assumptions about identity, psychology, and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The Spirit of Tyrann reached his small list of tasks (killing some people and saying repeated phrases in Latin) by owning a college body. He uses a magical helmet to control the mind that a college boy voluntarily puts on his head, then at several places in the movie, he takes off and returns again. Maria performs oral sex on the poor Sean Williams Scott, and Tyrannus wears a Rollerball glove. The Tyrannus has its own green backlight for no reason, and apparently has been sitting next to the CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries. Amazing misfortune. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. Look at that.
