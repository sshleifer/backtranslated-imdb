I was very disappointed in this film based on the story of Bernard Malamud in 1970. This is basically the story of possible redemption, racial bias, and non-fulfillment of life based on distrust. The black Jewish angel is sent to help the fighting tailor and his critically ill woman. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in an angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) is recovering. The problem is that Morris basically renounces life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. When she believes this, Fanny gets better, but she has doubts and Fanny suffers from it. It would be very nice if there was a translation in the last scene in English when the dying Fanny talks to Morris. Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminsko in the nominated Oscar in 1966, "Shop on the Main Street" is also directing this film. Kam√≠nka is reduced in the movie mainly bed, and her kindness in her speech really does not prove the desperate situation that stands. He still calls Ruthie, their daughter, who did not obey them by marrying the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not realize the look of an angel in her apartment. The scene in the pharmacy is confused, and the scene where Angela's girlfriend meets with Belafonte in her apartment is unforgettable, but all too short. We do not know why Belafonte is in danger, and why he died. Those who viewed this film had to leave theater in depression and despair.
