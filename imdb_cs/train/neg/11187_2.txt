The order of fatal flaws - besides the assassin conspiracy - is that the character simply does not radiate or react. Two examples: The priest who goes through the cemetery late in the night is suddenly attacked by spooky spirits. After fighting them, he keeps on walking when his friend appears. "Something wrong?" His friend asks when he saw the attack. "Just some demonic spirits - nothing I can not deal with." No reaction, no surprise, just like changing the tire. His friend is equally misunderstood ... it must be a standard priestly training ... "" Then did you put a wafer in your mouth, any questions? Ok, you continue, Demon Spirit Attacks ... "] <br /> <br /> Example 2: The priests need an answer for a moment, and only a demon (or something of the kind that now counts) could provide it. "Why do you have to ask a dying person!" So the demon has a random man who hung in front of both priests to ask their question to a nasty, lazy man. "Hey, do not kill him!" Or maybe "it's not nice!" their reactions are much more realistic They never ask to let the man go or stop - in fact they are closest to react that they are slightly annoying They ask their question and go. <br /> <br /> I had to at that moment turn off - my brain has begun to atrophate.
