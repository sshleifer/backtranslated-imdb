The review I read for this movie was quite decent, so I decided to explore it. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about the spirit that is to be avenged against group friends. The story is stupid, mixing two parts of the Ring with one night Prom Night, sprinkling I know what you did last summer, and add the little dashes of a white woman - they are now mixing up to totally absurd. There is nothing new about this conspiracy, and the reassessment of the clich√© that I like so much was not fun at this time either. This movie jumps into the past and past too, and as soon as I realized it, I realized it did not make any sense. The characters move from ant to psycho-killer at the moment. When you talk about the characters, they're all stereotypical favorites - a greedy selfish lawyer, an egocentric actress, a baseball star, a video voyeur, a bitter girl, a ghostly quiet cat, a pretty girl prettier than a nice, black cat ... and I did not care for any of them. Maybe a better filmmaker could make a movie, there were some decent scenes, but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a "videotape" that would not be able to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst Asian horror it offers far, but it's still bad. If you just want to see some scary pictures in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top gaming, or just want to scream "You're stupid!" on the screen of the movie, or just want to have more Asian horror to move your sleeve when someone asks how much you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent plot are looking elsewhere.
