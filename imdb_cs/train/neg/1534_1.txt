From blocked digitized shots on acting that Keanu makes "I'm so wooden, I can be Plank me" Reeves looks like an Oscar winner who bites this movie (the toy is not intended). The best thing is in the eRATicate box in the second segment (which of the three seemed to be the most powerful piece in terms of storyline and twist). I wish I could spend 3.99 pounds, which cost me something different, like erm ... Natural Born Killers: The Directors Cut. If you buy it, you are really disappointed, do a favor and avoid it as a plague. If you're looking for something amateur and with actors who are more than 2x4 wood, go on. However, if you want some quality werewolf action, look somewhere else, such as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: Wolf Wolf Hunt.
