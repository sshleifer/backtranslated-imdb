Words can not begin to describe how this movie is terribly horrible. I wish it was "so bad that it is good," but it is not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad I could not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the pinnacle of the film. The only less charismatic person is director Brett Kelly, who as a true statement of vanity introduced himself as a male leader. Both look like an inbreed, sister and brother. Gal, Sherry Thurig, is a viewfinder. The opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and up and she can act. Although you can say he is holding back. All the actors seemed to be detained, especially the supporting man Mark. In the rainforest, I saw less wood, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly leave his actors actor? Is he really a bad director? Everybody else even summed up the story perfectly - there is not one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly is trying to solve the crime. I know how he felt as he came in, so I felt when I watched his movie. Yes, I was trying to get money from the store. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the director's friends (and if you look for them, you will see that the same friends were the one who gives the film positive marks).
