"Demons III: The Ogre" is not a continuous pre-sequel to "Demons" and "Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic." Demons III: The Ogre is a very stupid, bored, cheap monster. (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are bad quality and stupid writers who are bored by William Shakespeare's viewer or Demon's egg from Spider's Web, or what Huhuhuhuhu makes a dream to a girl) I am very sorry , a very special and very boring movie I bought a special DVD box called "Demons" on 3 different movies "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" do not have closed captions and Subtitles is the price of $ 14.99 from Best Buy in Downey Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are bad quality writers who make a silly movie almost like "Halloween III", Michael Myer does not have a monster, but people wear Halloween, I really love "Demons" and "Demons 2 are better boring stupidity "emons III: The Ogre" is not part of the "Demons" and "Demons 2" are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
