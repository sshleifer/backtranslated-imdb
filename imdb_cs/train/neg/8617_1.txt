When I watched 10 minutes of this film, I was confused when I watched for 30 minutes when my fingers leaned - I just could not believe it: The film is really terrible. In fact, it's so terrible that I had to look at it just to be convinced (!). During this time, I realized that he reminded me of a lot of Danish so-called Comedies from the 60s and 70s. The sample is as follows: Take a very popular comic, make a script that puts this comic in as many grotesque situations, add a lot of jokes (especially one-time) and spice up with a couple of beautiful young girls - the movie, and you are successful! I do not know if this movie was successful, but unlike the Danish tradition that died silently (with some great comedians), there seems to be a market for this kind of film in the US.
