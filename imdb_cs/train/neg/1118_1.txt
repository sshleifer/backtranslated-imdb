I was really horrified by this terrifying movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a scary musical score. Really promising! After ten minutes, you actually start sweating and feel uncomfortable because you're going to start worrying about the worst. This movie has an atmosphere of real nightmare and worse - it all comes out. In an hour and a half I struggle with complete boredom and sleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me. Nuit Noire is a really scary picture - for your eyes, for the ears, for your intelligence and especially for your wallet, because the idea of ​​spending the precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateur home video is the greatest horror of all.
