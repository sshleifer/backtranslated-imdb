I saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight on the preview, and I was upstairs for how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First, the film practically moved its invisible blind spots. There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who, let's say, knows our own white people in love? I know it's not a love Crash of mesquick-tastic inclusiveness, but you can not pretend to have a movie New York with these quite predominant members of society. In addition, you know that the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserves the Oscar with ham, so where is everyone? <br /> <br /> Maybe worse than bizarre and deliberate socio-economic ignorance were down-right offensive chapters (Remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with nice young women on wheelchairs? This film had a number of ways , how to be the worst Bad misconduct, bad writing, bad direction - all covers every possible genre that ever touches rich white people who smoke cigarettes in exclusive restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thanks God, they finally got the powerful halls Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson who joined together for this Jumper meeting.And side note, Uma avoided the bullets Ethan Hawke looks devastated.This of course is one thing in terms of his looks but he added an incredibly spooky horrible feeling of dread on his terribly scripted scene opposite the poor, beautiful Maggie Q. I had a terrible time picking my smallest a favorite scene for the end of the film questionnaire, but it must be Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby bit for a total lack of taste that damages me because I really like these two actors. I do not think I could easily offend myself, but all I could do was mock and look disgusted as a 50-year-old aunt's. <br /> <br /> Narrow second in this incredibly tight competition for horrible things is Shia LaBeouf's tonal deaf showing what it means to a former Disney Channel star to act against Julia Christie. I do not mean the opposite, I'm against. Against that, the only explanation. Now I realize that the early succession with Orlando Bloom is a relative peak. IMPROVE. Keep it in mind when your brain begins to climb your ear soon after the initial credits that seem to be the nod of the first New York Real World. This film is embarrassing, strangely dated, unusual, ineffective, demanding, and ultimately totally divorced from any real idea of ​​New York at all. <br /> <br /> (The special star is for the Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach sequence, because it's really pretty sweet, but it's just one clear place in what feels like hours of unnecessary masturbation.)
