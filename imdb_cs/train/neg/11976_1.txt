This show comes with interesting places as fast as a travel channel. It is billed as a reality, but in reality it is a pure master soap opera. They try to use exotic sites as a front to bring people into a fake competition, and then continue to hook spectators in the style of the competitor's soap opera. He also borrows from the start of the CBS show, Beat The Clock - by inventing situations that his competitors would try and overcome. Then he rewards the winner's money. If they manage to do so with a little bit of interaction between characters, it's even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus the Beat The Clock - the actual performance of this series is to escape reality. <br /> <br /> This show features elements of several types of successful past programs. Real estate television, hardly, but if you have been concentrating on a competitor, a local or a competition, it's your cup of tea. If not, the whole series is, as I say, wet dripping with a sauce. It's another show that's behind the brand of reality, a trend that began in 2000. It's elegant and well-made, so it may take a while. After all, it re-runs on Gilligan Island, Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies and Brady Bunch. It just does not use professional actors. The level of intelligence is about the same.
