This film allegedly concerns non-establishment types (aesthetically and sexually), who apparently can not resist the basic romantic needs. Although some of the outstanding players, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, are also based on a small font that relies heavily on clever dialogue; which is not. Nixon's role has the best line, but it's often coming too fast, which is a time error that the director has to place. Grotesque climax uses every available clich√© that he has spent or not, and perfectly completes this boring attempt at comedy.
