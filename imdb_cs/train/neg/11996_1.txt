I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is in it, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> This film contains six stories. It's a new concept that flew off Hollywood. So it's not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1. Khanini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wanted to be famous and became a friend for journalists to be interested. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and he claims to be her friend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When he shouts, I get upset. Salman Chan can not play comic roles. But in its serious parts it is amazing. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). She gets into the middle age crisis and attracts her to a much younger woman and forgets what she really has in her life; his wife and children. Anil kapoor en Juhi are naturally born actors / actresses. They are great. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) will marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but gets her cold feet and throws out the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (John Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). He gets an accident and suffers from memory loss. Now she does not know she loves her husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a cab driver. She meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman who is in love with an Indian man, but he is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju must bring Staphani to the man, but he falls in love with her. I never liked Govinda's movies. It's very unpleasant, not funny. But in this movie I liked him very much, as he has grown up in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who is only married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). She would want to do something serious with her, but every time her family appears between them. Sohail Khan is not a nice actor, but it's funny! I like his movies. Now there is a problem. All these stories are not interesting. To make one story of six interesting stories, it will not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch each other, but they are not significant to those characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Release that woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more films, this role for him was too small. Salman Khan can not play comic roles, but really serious movies. It is written on his life as an actor. This film is upset and is a waste of the cast of good actors and actresses such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. It's just like having the ability to shoot a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing a lullaby.
