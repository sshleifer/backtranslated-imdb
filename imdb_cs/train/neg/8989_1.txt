There are good things on the film. Music and cinema are great. Alex Wilson is hot and working hard. Ryan Bauer is also hot. The production was very happy to have alienated them because they really give the film the value of production. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many boys in the movie who are not talking are also cute. Why is not an actress playing Amy on credit? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedy performance like Clitarissa Pink. The worst thing about the movie is probably star James Townsend. He can not act. It's also very ugly, it's not nice to watch at all. His arms are like spaghetti. It's nasty. They have no muscle tone at all. No wonder he has to make his own film and plunge into it. Nobody else would have tossed him into anything. James Townsend is not credible as someone who even has a girlfriend because he's gay. They should be conducting someone else as a leader if they wanted what would be best for the movie. Then again, maybe he wants to use this film as a means of starting a career in soft-core porn, certainly not a real deal because he would take some acting lessons. In addition, anyone who does porn is in blacklist on Hollywood. The craziest thing about the movie is probably the flying of Latin with a tanned jacket like Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher does not seem like an actress at all. Overall, this movie is fine porn and is no better than something you would see on Skinemax. I think Alex Wilson, probably the best film, is embarrassed and does not want to connect with him. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else is mentioned, so Alex Wilson is probably a one-time name for the scene. I visited him once more in western Hollywood, and when I mentioned the movie, he just turned around and left. I understand. If I worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and would not even bind with it.
