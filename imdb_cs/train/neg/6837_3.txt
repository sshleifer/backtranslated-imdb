Normally I do not like vengeful movies ... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a bit more than your typical revenge. You see, DI has action, precision, exotic locations (like Hong Kong), amazing weapons, and enough martial arts to satisfy your desire for impressive unarmed combat. Just like all the revenge moves, the villains you'd like to throw out of the top glass top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact does not have any of the sensational crap that choked the action and the elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotypes that challenged "eye for eye" and "death 2". Double Impact fence separation is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a fancy hit team linked to a family friend with money problems, or at least that's what I remembered. Explaining why boys speak French accents is miserable. It was not a watery plot that caused the film to be bad, but the use of clich√©s and movements from other films (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really got worse. However, Double Impact is still observable. But why are these filthy movies like villains (like the greedy British guy who killed Chad and Alex's parents and the deadly lesbian red cat), would you like to hate your creature's thread?
