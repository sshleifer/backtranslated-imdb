Can anyone do good CGI movies next to Pixar? I mean really, the animation looked outdated by the standards of 2006 and even in 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent all of Hugo Jackman's budget. Regardless of their thinking, the story was really getting in. Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed into the toilet. Yeah, I know it seems stereotyped. But then sewerage imitated the ways of London - to a large extent. Throw a promise of jewels (????) and a bad frog and get a pathetic attempt at fun. I would like to say something that I enjoyed. Maybe you're in the movie? Or maybe a happy-sometimes-after-rat relationship. But he did not do anything. She had a talent, but she exploded. D-
