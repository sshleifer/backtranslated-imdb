Very bad. Very bad. As a person who strives to be in, or at least sniff, the dining table of a movie, I find it hard to criticize those who have actually got a movie of some kind. But this movie ... dear. Be aware that Frightworld seeks nothing more than gross exploitation (honest thing in itself) and trying to adapt it to more major standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it's more fun than - let's say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not too much. So I will not try to criticize, let me ask for a splitting of the observation. 1) If the gore is the point of the movie, should not you see it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2) If you have to hire three sound men, make sure that at least one knows how to control the device. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror film your lead maniac must be more creepy than a smurf doll. I know hard but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) In the Buffalo / Rochester area there are a lot of talented cameramen, most of which you can hire really cheap. Get the one who knows how to frame the scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs does not mean it should do it every two seconds. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell the story or set the mood. At least in this type of film shooting should be sold gore gagy. Chain saw, which suddenly appears in the stomach of the figure, is not spooky, it is negligent. Some good things. Not all the action was bad. Jack was pretty good and I love Acid once started fighting. There were some neat pictures, unfortunately they were thrown to the screen without a rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is the name that deserves a better film. I like the moxie from Frightworld. The next time they have a movie underneath the belts, I hope everyone includes an effort better than Colman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.
