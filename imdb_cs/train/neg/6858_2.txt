John W. Huston's wise blood was a more terrible misleading presentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could imagine. From the very terrible performances (and no, "Oh, that was done purposefully, you just can not do it!") The music score that was more suitable for the Rockford Files episode was the film disgusting. At first I saw it without a bad will and in fact I was expecting a pleasant experience. However, the distortion of southern figures, from the meaningful fraudulent formation in the southern direction to the lilting, comedic form their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Until the end that was totally deprived of any kind of sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shone and resonated. Actors who display "southern" police officers can eat hot dogs from the NYC station equally well and quote the godfather. One redeemed actor was a living and dead representative of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who heard the Moats preaching Christ's Church without Christ and seeing dollar signs and business opportunities. The powerful book O'Connor is best known because it is a haunting, religious subtext that shakes seemingly without life with countless "Faith". The film by Mr. Huston is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions because he and most of her fans see if I could be so courageous to say it. While I admit that I can not know exactly what the author wanted to say, I have her work for her and her love for the desire to remain a fan. If I could see Wise Blood as if obviously Mr. Huston had done it, I would throw him in the basket. For Flannery and forgive me, John Huston. Forgetting ... it will take a while.
