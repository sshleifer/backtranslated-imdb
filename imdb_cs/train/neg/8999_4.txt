Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV graduate are all together in a sometime funny sketch movie. But it is very interesting to watch this early in 2005. Twenty years after this film is to make sure how many of their gags have become absolutely true: There is a fake movie trailer that at that time probably was not that smart for something is called "The Pregnant Man" that happened to the foolish Arnold Schwarzenegger "Junior" There is a commercial spoof that probably was not even smart at the time because something representing Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling," which has now met with a popular show titled "Celebrity Boxing" There is a fake movie trailer that probably was not even clever at the time that John Candy poses in a cut-off movie. Take a look at this trailer and look at how it looks like a scrap and a plot in Frank Hellenlotter's Basket Case! And finally, there's an ad for the late late-day documentary about "a dead dream, the only two left ..." The title of the document is ... LAST AWARDS! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies meet!
