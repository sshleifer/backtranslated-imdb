OK - I ADORE this movie ... I will recognize this movie - myself - for being a terrible horror fanatic. I could never watch this movie myself. I've also heard a lot of stories about what effect it had in the original release in theaters, audiences. Unbelievable masterpiece .... Terrible, psychological things scare my pants. Bless your hearts, whoever this wonderful movie will do. I love it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is scary - it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! Not that what's happening in the movie and the idea of ​​the film are not scary enough, but what always got me-was Brendan's wonderful actor. Best horror film EVER. Nothing can ever be scary. Halloween viewing in his evilest.
