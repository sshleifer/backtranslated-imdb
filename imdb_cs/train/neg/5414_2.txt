This film is even a big step down from a typical fare that bounced off Bollywood. The performance was terrible. Even Boman Irani, who always shines, is totally OTT like a villain. The soundtrack is also not memorable. And yet they are trying hard, women's leaders can not be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects, while Fardeen Khan is currently in a similar tariff. But this absurdity is even under his limited ability as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in poorly written clich√©s. It is high time that Indra Kumar hung his overhead hat. I hope he never guides other eyes like this. The future of Hindu films is now in better hands. To summarize, stay away from celluloid waste.
