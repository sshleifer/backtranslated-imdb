This film does NOT NEED NEVER new or useful. After I saw it, they agreed with me and my wife that the studios simply exchanged it and could care less if it was fun. This is a good example of the film "Concept Only" - they have a film concept, and the other details are unimportant, because it is KNOW that it will be based only on the original concept. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Cruella getting out of jail and continuing to release. She already hates puppies, but she has been programmed to adore them-she just could not hurt fleas. It does not take too long after her release and she has returned to her old way. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the movie were supporting characters. Eric Idle as a voice of Waddleswortha Bird has caused me to NAM, and that's TOUGH because I'm a tough Python fan. It was obvious that he did it because they gave him a lot of money (there can be no other reason). Low Cruel Self-Confidence, Tim McInnerny, was funny in the Black Adder show, but here she is totally useless and unfortunate. And it had to make some money to get Gerard Depardieu, but it was totally useless. There were also some other supporting actors, but because of how badly the characters were writing, I try to block them. <br /> <br /> Overall, it would be better to let your kids watch TV than to bother to let them see this disgust.
