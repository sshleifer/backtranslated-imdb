An unexpected, boring and incoherent supernatural "thriller," in which student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is a constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after an accident that claims the life of her boyfriend, Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not start telling you how bad it is ... nothing is ever going to happen and there is never any real value of entertainment. In this particular film I did not like this cast - all of them are unfortunately unconvincing (then again, their roles are not good). Promoting it as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the terrors? There is no sense or tension - there are several good songs, but that's all about it. How did this project gain green light on Earth? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no clear vision or talent that I can feel. The worst of all is that the conclusion really makes the film unnecessary. The alleged "murderous cut" I've been watching is 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
