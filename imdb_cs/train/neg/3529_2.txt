I have heard that this movie was much more stylish than the director of Guy Ritchie's (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had previously run, the problem is that it may be too stylish. In essence, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary confinement and throws a lot of his money in two years. He is ready to take revenge against the casino owner, who is prone to the violence Jake has sent to prison. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In this process, doctors tell Jake that he has three days to live because he is dying for a rare blood disorder, and Macha hits a man on him. Shark sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) require Jake to pay their money and do some special work for them. The film is filled with Jake, who tells about some memories, and in the last three days before getting to the great revelation about Zach and Avi and Mach, I assume that's what it was. Also played by Terence Maynard as Frenchman Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. These are sequences that include a bit of animation, repeat the line twice in different perspectives and change the speed for moments, all of which are irritating in terms of confusion and boredom, making it a silly crime drama. Pretty poor!
