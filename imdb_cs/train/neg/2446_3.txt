Rajkumar Santoshi, without any doubt, directed the biggest movies and the biggest box office hits of Indian cinema. This film falls short of all expectations because this movie stars two great actors Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie, you have to do Magnum Opus. In the later part of the film you can assure that the voice of Amitabh Bachchan was dubbed by another person who was due to his illness. Still the Did'nt film had the right personality development Plus cinematography Was'nt good too and one thing that Bollywood should teach them is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when Applied should be done with a high budget. Script had so many shortcomings, which gives viewers an excuse to participate in his phone calls rather than watching the movie. New Comer shakes his leg well but can not act Well, where the film loses a lot of time is the script and the story is going on in matography. A talented actor like Bhoomika Chawl was unnecessary in the movie just like Sushant Singh. But each director makes a bad film every now and then in his career. <br /> <br /> So watch it only when you are a fan of multi-star movies.
