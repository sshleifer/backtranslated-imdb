The first album "Home Alone" was one of the most amazing films of the 1990s. The other was just as fun with the same stuff and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how they could go on with the same story because Kevin would be 17 years old in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So what does the director decide? It takes the child as unpleasant and worsens it. Is the child 6 years old and the mother leaves him in the house? What kind of burger team is that idiot? I really do not want to get into the details if you want to unfortunately see this movie. But please, I recommend that you stick with it. They are not worth the precious time. Go fold a piece of paper, do a job, balance the pencil on your nose or recover! It's better to look at "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
