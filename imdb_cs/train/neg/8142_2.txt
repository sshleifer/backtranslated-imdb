After the bats do not bite him in the cave, a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man-bat. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, it's just because of rabies or drugs that John is responsible for several scary murders. "The Bat People" by Jerry Jameson is one hell of a horrible movie. The script is lethally boring and there is no gore nor nudity. This pointless piece of crap is so mind-boring boring that you will scratch your head in utter distrust of suffering through it. Even the design of the human-bat creature young Stan Winston is utterly pathetic and unforgettable. Avoid this glowing as a mor 2 out of 10.
