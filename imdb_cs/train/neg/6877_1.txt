I sat down to look at the documentary about Puerto Rico, and I finally watched one about the Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I can not see 50% living in poverty. When I see struggling people, there are usually Haiti, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There's no such thing as spanglish ... you either speak spanish or not ... and from what I've heard ... no. Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK for me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great person for those who want independence, which is 1%. To others he as a place like Usama bin Laden. Puerators who want independence are silly fools. If you want all the dreamers of independent Puerto Rico to prove you, you will see Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, the whole of South and Central America and Mexico. Her work is strange. This document is not about Puerto Rico, this document concerned the Nuyoricans and their struggles. For the person who complained that the lack of Africa was at the show ... it was about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will do a short job. <br /> <br /> Finally ... to all the unconscious white people who think we need green cards to come to the US and want to see how the Prime Minister is managing things, it's not a good document about the Puertorican culture . Tell your children to pay attention to geography and history. <br /> <br /> *** Updating *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc". it was about the Nuyoricans. She said it as if it were how we all feel. He should be called ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunch ... I can not speak Spanish." PLEASE REMAIN THE USE OF PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, OR ANY RELEVANT WORK WITH NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LEVON. God forbids them to play on the island.
