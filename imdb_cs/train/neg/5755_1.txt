I also saw this film on New York's High Falls Film Festival, and I must say that I thought it was complete and terribly boring. Although it was funny in some places, the only real laughter was that there seemed to be real conspiracies that are being talked about and that acting in some places was scary and wooden, especially "The Beautiful Lady," and the voice of the narrator never heard of) much to be desired. JCMac was, as I mentioned, the redemption of the film's features, real action and sand, and (from casting) the only real acting action. I'm sure that with another occupation and stronger reigning overhead it could be a very decent movie. Let's hope this is not sent for a general release, or if you really want a copy, look at the convenient Lidl basket.
