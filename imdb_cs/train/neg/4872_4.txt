Producing a collection of jokes that pretends that "Babe" has never been made; the writers clearly hoped the trick of seeing the animals would be enough to keep the film. It is not. Eddie Murphy resumes herself as a doctor who re-discovers her forgotten childhood gift for understanding the constant and insignificant behavior of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The musical cast is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray), but the screenplay is so insignificant, carefree and depressingly unfortunate, bin slip quite fast.
