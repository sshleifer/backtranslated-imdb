this movie was definitely the worst film I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some bad movies. I did not like the film shot. all the actors are unknown and it looks as if a lot of friends have met and decided to make their own film. but it is absolutely terrible. I've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake, and I just discovered it took a long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it looked like it was not planned before they started filming. the story is too weird. I did not like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. it did not make sense to even shoot this movie. if you're thinking about watching this movie, no. you just spend time.
