The revenge of the Sith begins with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then bored for another hour and fifteen minutes, with the same terrible dialogue and boring machinations that plagued the rest of the series of predecessors. The only thing that improves driving is slow - and I think the slow increase in what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally comes, it's okay. Is not it great. Not good either. But pretty good. This film is extremely overwhelmingly praised because it does not dream of the high sky as a previous sequel. Instead it is just turgid, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, these CGIs are sometimes impressive. Bucky fighters? All are a blurry mess. I think the dark side took Lucas when he started these antecedents and no one noticed. It will make a lot of money, but thank God it's over, this once-honored franchise was bad enough. I saw the show at 12:01 and after that I heard a group of very young children who said it was amazing! But everyone older than eight was torturing the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was boring. I just thought to see Darth Vader's birth would be better. We all said.
