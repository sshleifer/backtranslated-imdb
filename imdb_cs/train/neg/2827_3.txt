The story at the beginning is interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he intentionally threatens two of Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies: Arabs and Germans. To believe that the very Arab men would be free to roam and easily catch Blacks in West Africa, it is equally believable as the Whites slaves of the Roots. It is clear that both shops are run by local residents and include d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's shop with children and sex slaves, according to Amnesty International, Israel is one of the worst offenders. So why just point out the Arabs and then choose the Germans as the only European buyer? It's obvious distortion and hatred for these people by the Jewish director. The actor's performances are above average, especially with Petra Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is as good as ever.
