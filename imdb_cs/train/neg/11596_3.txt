"The Dream Child" from 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated) Nightmare series and at the latest since that time the series has become a total waste. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven's original 1984s and the third part of The Dream Warriors in 1987. The second part was disappointed and boring and was the fourth part in which the terrifying crazy mad Freddy Krueger began to piss off with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry in the series is hardly to recommend, except for (some great) visuals and one creepy scene, a flashback sequence about how Freddy Krueger originated. The rest of the film consists mainly of our crazy joker maniac jacket screaming for stupid unicorns and the old formula of a bunch of adolescent fools who desperately try to avoid pairing because they're waiting for them in their good old Freddy. dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson and many uninteresting bulls such as the super-stupid "terrifying" children's rhyme are added for no other reason than having any justification for doing this unnecessary and boring sequel. .. In short: No originality, just the decay of the old formula and overcrowding of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to a great visual, and I particularly emphasize the difference between the horrible sequel of Freddy's Dead, which is terribly convincing. If you are not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, "The Dream Baby" should be avoided, and though you are, it is more than likely to disappoint.
