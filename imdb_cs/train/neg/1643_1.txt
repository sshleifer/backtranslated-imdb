"Whipped" is one of the worst movies of all time. It's a bad, hateful piece of garbage that forced me to stay in the theater more than any other 2000 movie, maybe even "The Grinch". It is not, as people have said, a visual portrait of modern relationships. This would be a small movie called "High Fidelity". While the film was sincere and compassionate, "Whipped" is hostile, cynical, misanthropic film poison. Avoid that with so many wounds if you do not want to see how a really bad "comedy" can get.
