I'm going out of watching one episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I do not think I'll be watching again. The effects were totally wooden, the conspiracy was completely predictable, which is ultimately unrealistic - I mean, who would believe the $ 30 million judgment for the death of recuperating drug addiction with terminal cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) looked so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - maybe he realized how bad writing is! I'm fully aware that the dramas offered this season are pretty bad, but they will definitely find better writers. There may be outsourcing of scripts to India or China! I bet you will not see this next season!
