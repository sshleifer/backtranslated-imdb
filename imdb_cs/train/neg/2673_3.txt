It is not long enough to be long and not short of short. That thing exists for the sole reason: to have a lesbian trip. There are worse reasons to exist. One sad thing is that it could make a decent feature film. Misty fits comfortably in her clothes and is a very nice girl and when people are so engaged in a character like Lara Croft that they make naked calendars, you know the soft core is set to explode. Unfortunately, it's pretty pathetic. Especially the painfully fake sexual scene between Darian and Misty where you can see her hand is the fingers. Watch this if you just can not get enough Misty or Ruby who makes a nice blonde and has a zee verst jerman accent ever.
