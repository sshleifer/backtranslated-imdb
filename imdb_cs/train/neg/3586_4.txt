The autobiography of the Zoo founder in NYC begins by being very cute and would be a great family film if he stayed there. but we are getting more involved in reality when the gorilla grows up as a wild thing that can not easily be adapted to its "matinee" wishes - it could scare younger children, scenes when Buddy is trying to hurt Gertrude. rather fast resolution at the end. Below the average.
