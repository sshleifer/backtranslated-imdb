This is a pretty outdated movie that aims to show the youth's desire for freedom in some inhuman British school. Oh yes, it's like the army, you learn to listen and do what you asked for. Yes, the young dream of something else but breaks their dreams and locks their optimism at the threshold of life. Great. Basically, it's like you could sum up pretty plans in If ... Nice intentions that do not cause cinematic problems: the result is a declamation film. Do you see how boring I mean? At least the old one helped Kubrick occupy McDowell at Orange, a movie with a real strong social satire and no suicidal sentimentalism.
