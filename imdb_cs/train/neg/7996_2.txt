There is a book titled "How to make a film with every man vs. nature" Clich√© Imaginable "If it is not, the ants will be an excellent source of material for the killer insect chapter, and the ants do not have a single piece of originality that could be found in no time I suppose the most surprising thing about the ants is that they shot the film for 100 minutes Set-up, characters, different sub-charts, death scenes and the way the ants are presented were done before any time? It's amazing that so many of these Rampage Insect films were shot in the 1970s because they are basically the same movie. And can anyone tell me what God is doing Myrna Loy ?, this monkey turd movie? A woman so talented and good as Loy deserves better than Ants as one of her final films.
