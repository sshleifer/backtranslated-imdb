When I look at this movie, it's interesting to see how much the Black Men exclude. The film spends its time and shows how powerless is the most visible Black Man in it (except heroic momentum). For most of the movie, other black men (and dark-haired black women) are in the background film barely visible. The character of Vanessa Williams was strong and compassionate. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some relatively visible and three dimensional support characters that are bright and some white signs of some warmth and dignity. But 99% of black men in this movie are nothing but invisible men. Voice shadows in the background without consequences. Such a terrible defect, but in ordinary media is something unusual.
