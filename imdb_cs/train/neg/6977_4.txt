I read all the stupid reviews and I was amazed by the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can not say I strongly recommended him. The soundtrack of Leonard Cohen is not only overly heavy but excessive. The film looks so authentic, but something has to happen to work, and it does not mean much: a short plot (not a real problem for me), it's not a lot of character development, nothing thematically. It just goes. Cimino's "Heavenly Gate" has some moments of a real miracle, and it's a movie I'd like to watch again. For brilliant memories of the West, HBO "Deadwood" is much better than "McCabe".
