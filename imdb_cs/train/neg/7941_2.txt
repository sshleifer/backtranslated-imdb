As it approached in 2000, the adopted King Kong's daughter went forward and made a tearful announcement that her show had ended. While Miss Winfrey broke up, I laughed and screamed like a wild India from the Old West. So what does Oprah do? takes the famous people and puts them on their show. what famous people? people who suffered (just like her, except that these people lost more than their virginity) suffered from molten faces (true story), missing limbs (true story, see end of paragraph), and misuse of spouses. and somehow they get to the show and tell their story as if we had not heard it before tons and lots of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about losing your shark's shoulder from day one, October 31st, 2003. Do not tell tell me you have no hard feelings.) But the biggest thing that Oprah probably meant was an interview with Michael Jackson in 1993 after he was accused of being childish. unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has already died. but that it is a special performance about Michael's personal life, which many people knew. Oprah's real influence comes from middle-aged women and soccer moms. He seems to think he is sometimes as a personal Jesus. but everything I see in Oprah is a big ghetto that made it big, and she just demonstrates how rich she is. I'm glad that her concerts soon end. we need better TV programs.
