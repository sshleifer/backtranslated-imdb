This is the strangest piece of crap I've ever lost an hour of my life. All I can say is that it's about an hour. More than half of this film is a record from the original "Criminally Insane". At least I was able to see the most exciting of this classical explosion of classics, because for some reason why there is only "Criminally Insane II" in my video ("Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this movie is one of the absolutely worst movies in the home and in the backyard movies you've ever seen. Why is it my video store, not the original? Why do similar things really end up in videoclips? Why did people rent it, and did not move the copy as soon as they saw their horror? Why - AAUGGHH - Why, God, why? If you do not have trouble with annoying fruits that would eat the whole confectioner in an unbearably slow scene, or the fruit would be hanging from the stair railing in an even slower scene or taking care to hurt someone (not ask) several times on the back party or monologue killing brain cells about giving a woman poisoned tea and then complaining that all calls made her own cold tea, retarded eating soup or just want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in the garden: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: Do NOT DRAW this movie. Do not write this movie. If this is possible at all, do not try to walk around the shelves in the video store where a copy of this movie is placed. You can still save yourself, but now it's too late for me. . .
