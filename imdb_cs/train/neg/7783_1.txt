Hey HULU.com plays Elvira late night horror show on his site and this movie is theirs named Monsteroid, a good fun watching Elvira's comments on this movie Crappy .... Have fun with bad movies. In any case, this film is really just a little worthwhile to see how bad is 70 years for creepy footage Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just a bad movie. Avoid it if you do not want to laugh. While you are on HULU, look at other movies that are theirs right now, there are 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good land and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p if you have a decent connection speed.
