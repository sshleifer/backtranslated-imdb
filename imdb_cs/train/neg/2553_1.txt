Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else to say. Kate Jackson had to be desperate. Perhaps she should go back to acting ... the second thought she was a bad actress. Who would put the money to make something so bad. I love movies against Christ, and I usually laugh and weird, but this is just a Bad Bad Bad. Playing stars were worse than what you found on soap operas. Special effects if you can tell them where they laugh. I would not be surprised if you played scenes in slow motion if you saw the tubes that the blood shot out. After 30 minutes, we had to shut down the disk. These so-called Original Films should be destroyed, all the discs and tapes destroyed, and all the people associated with the filming of the film must pay the money to the people who rented the film. Then these people would never be allowed to act, direct or shoot any thing, but own home movies.
