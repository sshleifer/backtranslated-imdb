These are not the best slasher movies ever, but what it is is fun. The task is lame, but killing is not too bad. I have to be honest, if you do not watch the bands shown in this movie, you will not find this movie as fun as those who do it. I knew someone who saw this movie and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film, but you have to understand that it was done in your leisure time on a tour, between playing moshing kids and drinking with friends behind the scenes. ... this is not done seriously. It's gonna take the cheese for it's the best punk and with over 100 killings, most of which are ultra horror, it's a fun movie that has friends to watch, drink and be fun!
