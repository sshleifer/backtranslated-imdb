I've seen this movie twice. I can not believe Pintilie did such a fantastic movie. I'm also a film and theater director, and I know what I'm talking about. It is no longer Romania, but I see that events take place in the same period from September 11th. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty pictures. What most Romanians do not know, this film is for French spectators, not for us. He really believes this is reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I do not know if we can call this movie, perhaps horror :) And we wonder why we have such a picture in Europe. It was a reality, but it is not. A good friend of mine from the British Embassy said: "You have no idea how long the Romanian people of Ceausescu have gone."
