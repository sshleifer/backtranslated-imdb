Flora is not really a movie. It's a movie that likes movies. It does not include Richard Gere, who did a great performance, but when only one of the actors really gives his personalities and the rest of the cast is just acting ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​negotiation is to hide the fact that you are acting. What the hell is Claire Dains doing in this ?! She is the best actress for this character. In 99.9% of the movie it looked extremely out of place, of all! The only thing she did was a stupid question, like, "Do you really think that?" And he makes silly faces. I was embarrassed by her actor, seriously, and I just like it ... It's a romantic type of movie, I do not know who chose it among all the actresses ... LOL and saw Avril Lavigne ?! this really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling that you'll be throwing, this movie will do the work for you !!! I wish I could vote -5 ..
