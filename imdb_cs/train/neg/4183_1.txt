If it was not for "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, this film B would not cost one sector of your Tivo disk! In what low rent, back store was the supposed space port of the film? "Continuity of people!" It's a basic principle in making real movies! At night the alleged space port and the day (night and day at the space station?) Of the warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing I would praise for this movie is the wardrobe department. to keep Natassie constantly in those tight shapes of clothing! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the clothes they had apparently spent some time, every day shooting! Sci-Fi Channel would be better to show SpaceBalls! At least, there would be some real humor if you were watching something so incredible. Michael Ironside, please ask your agent the fastest! You're so much better about the actor, you're even connected with him.
