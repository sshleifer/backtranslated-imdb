I was never sure where it was going. These people seem interested in what's happening on some mountain. They are investigating, have a narrow escape, are leaving, returning, leaving, threatening each other, going to night-time, attacking witches with consistent cabinets, etc. The guy looks like he likes a girl, but leaves her unprotected numerous times. She gets, gets her back, leaves her again. You will get it. It seems that the whole thing gets to a certain extent a victim, but I'm not sure or turning people into a witch, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless, and it's not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of darkness is not uncommon. This is caused by age or overuse of night filters.
