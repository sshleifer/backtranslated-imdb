In this film, he is not the only sympathetic figure. Is he a lawyer who plays Kenneth Branagh that we should pull? Well, we'll see - we learn that he's a lawyer's lawyer who criminals for technical reasons. He treats his coworkers as cattle, involves them in their personal crisis (in the process, gets one of them killed), threatens the safety of their children, threatens a new friend of their ex-wife, tries hard to put police and school administrators into operation - all for what? Because he thought of his little head! I was really pulling my father and his gangs to beat the lawyer's emptying and drown him in the swamp ... it would be a much more satisfactory end.
