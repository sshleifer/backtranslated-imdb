Something that has to be mistaken for somewhere when the director perceived this conspiracy. The film, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the most popular movies in the cinema, can not provide all aspects of film making. Best artists would also not be able to pick up debugging, which simply shows that the film itself was a serious mistake. Edits are bad. Direction is crap. Efficiency is out of this world (omg)! Characters that should look awful to people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. I would not want to watch the movie even if someone paid me the ticket costs or even gave me a free burger with him.
