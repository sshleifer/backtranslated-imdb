I agree with everything Calamine says! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for girls to get better roles. I would like them to succeed very much because they grew up as very inspiring couples and I would like to see them as people, actresses in their careers as well as in their personal lives. So the producers give the girls the chance to develop something that pulls a little away from touching, moving them to a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many aspects. This movie, which is commented on, is not too bad, but as I have seen in my films, their films remain the same as in a typical plot and typography. When it's good for an audience of younger generation in Rome but adults who were children when twins are children they want to watch the twins in their successes and that's why I think adults would like to see that they are making movies of different kinds, as the sixth sense, the hour, the chocolate, the kind of film - not to say that they have only serious movies for them, humorous too, but rather to see them in the different roles played in their newer films this and New York Minutes.
