Macy, Ullman, and Sutherland were as usual. Ritter was also not bad. Its name was as nice as usual. It could have been a good movie. The bad was scary. It was absolutely predictable, tedious and boring. From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was distributed as a child's color by routine numbers. The figures were stock pieces of carved cardboard. It was nothing new or interesting what could be said, and it totally prevailed over playing, which was a shame. Finally, too bad, the screenwriter was not the victim. Especially with "premature" lines from the child that were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Again, only acting prevents a much lower score.
