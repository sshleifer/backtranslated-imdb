Four years after filming his directorial debut with "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us what really wanted to be one of the boys from Hollywood. "Roadie" is a frat-boy fracas complete with pitchfights, horny harpies, Art Carney in a programmed wheelchair ... and a Meat Loaf at the steering wheel. Meat Loaf (played by Travis W. Redfish!) It is actually a charming presence on the screen, and maybe in a smaller role (in a better film), it can be really stupid, but the script of Zalman King is full of stereotypical humor and helplessness. dirty. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie are all appearing - and everyone looks embarrassed. They should, "Roadie" is the wrong way. NO STARS from ****
