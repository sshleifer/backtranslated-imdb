As I did last year, I could not have the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because it was vaguely interested. Or rather, from all the wells contained in the theater, it probably was not the most difficult in the Top 10. Many lecturers, on the contrary, were in this most desirable 10th place. I did not know that the whole thing was done by a car (although I knew it was written), but it was really terrible to see these allegedly good actors not able to put expression, turn away from the cue and find simple words (Natalie Portman if not the director, is gone). The night of imagination of Boring Speeches was long and lengthy, Beyonce Knowles was telling some good songs, and very few dignified speech acceptance and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Moderator Award. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank my mother, my father, my lawyers and my pedicurist for helping me write this review, that everyone believes in me and I would like to emphasize that I have high metabolism and of course I am a month starving. I do not wanna cry ... thanks.
