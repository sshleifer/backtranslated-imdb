- A newly married couple moves into the house of a former husband's wife. It's not long before a new woman starts to feel like someone does not want her in the house. He sees the skulls all over the house. But when the husband is investigating, he can not find anything. Is anyone attempting to return her to the asylum facility she was recently released? Or is it the spirit of a dead woman trying to get a new woman out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watched The Screaming Skull without MST3K crew assistance. And it will most likely be the last time I look at it. Can you say boring? I do not usually speak boring - I speak when the grass grows boring. There are large sections of the movie where nothing happens. The screen might be empty and I would get so much fun. Those characters are spinning on and on with the most monotonous conversations you can imagine. Screaming skull would probably be marketed as a sleep aid. Most of them supply lines of conviction that is usually reserved for elementary school. I did not look at it, but I was shocked to find out that someone who had joined this movie sometimes appeared in the film prize. Nor will I go into the script with which the actors are given to work. Let's just say that the characters are given by some of the most idiotic lines ever written in the movie. <br /> <br /> - You were warned! Either avoid this at all costs or at least look for the MST3K version.
