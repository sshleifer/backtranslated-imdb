It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It's running a bit slow, but it ends when an angry De Vil is upset. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult film is a talking bird who thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a man (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It's a comedy that the film needed more. See it in matinee so you do not have to pay full price or wait until it appears on Disney.
