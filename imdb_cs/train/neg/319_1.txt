My friend bought this film for 1 pound and even then he was significantly overpriced. In spite of great names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton, and incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was as fun as when you were making chisels and banging it directly into your ears. He uses the tired bases of the barrel comedy techniques - ripping the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience and seemingly useless montages of "hot girls". Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to become a successful comic to make women successful. When the ship comedian - innocently named "Dickie" because of his unsurpassed success with the opposite sex - assumes that he is lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's locked in the bathroom, probably sick of the sea. Maybe from his mouth he was just throwing the worst film of all time.
