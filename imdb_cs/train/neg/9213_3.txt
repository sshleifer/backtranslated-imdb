I recorded this film on a small screening screen, held by the members of my club. We were warned that it would be "silly stupidity" of the games and this film was more than delivered. Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who re-begins his career after a "rest" semester. What we, the spectator, find out how the film progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to playing the role of "Maze and Monsters," a game he reunited after the group had accepted him into the campaign. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous on many, many levels. One scene is a "candlelight" group, which is probably the best way I can describe it. While I'm sure it should be somehow "culture," as most players know, it's terribly inaccurate. Most role sessions happen in well-lit rooms, usually through some chee-tohs and a can of soda. Although acting, though not an Oscar caliber, is not terribly horrible. This is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks, and Bosom Buddies and the Bachelor Party were a year or two over the horizon. Support for cast, although not very memorable, still brings decent performances. In particular, the bad thing is that it was a movie made for television that shows "the danger of the game". Check out if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
