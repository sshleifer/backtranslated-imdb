I apologize to all fans, but it's a futile film. The effects are bad, even wooden, that prematurely aggravates the rescue factor and does not work exactly. I think it should have been twisted at the end, but it ended up crazy mumbles. What the hell? The guy who killed everyone was one of the hunters? Try it again. <br /> <br /> It's barely original and it's not particularly good like a straight slasher. And that says something. I think anyone who wrote the script, and who would think of this concept, should be mercilessly fired and deported. <br /> <br /> This movie. If someone gives you a party, throw the disc out of the window and paste a good horror movie, like The Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
