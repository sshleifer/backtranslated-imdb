OK I caught this movie halfway, but I have to say it's all you say. and a group of books, even though he proved he could act if he wanted to! (a part where someone has a heart attack, acting as a bastion of bad film, both in terms of acting, scripting, and general credibility). It seems to be an obvious benefit for human transport, but although it is not the best film at all, it is at least original and has actors whose delivery did not resemble what has become a serious and yet hopeless GCSE student trying to get a mark. Not as human transport as a bit of a crash!
