I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with all the great creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great series for this time and it would be a great action / adventure film if the writers could find out where to go. I expected it to be stupid, but I do not expect to focus on such a low age group. Just like in the Strate in Space, it could be both visually amazing and exciting. She had to concentrate on more actions / adventure and the goal of the original series ... rescue people in trouble. Instead, he focused on Alan saving his day instead of his young brothers as well. original). The escape was Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not like the characters in the original, but I was grateful for the film. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed Thunderbirds for high-tech than stories, and even it was not time enough for me. I'd love to see lots of great gadgets. But then I'm just a little kid ...;)
