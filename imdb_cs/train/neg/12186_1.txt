This remake of the original film from 1962 has some very good works that praise him and some subtle performances of some fine actors - Scorsese will eventually decide for the most complicated conspiracy plot and the embarrassing shakespearean demise he had me when I watch my watch. DeNiro is a great actor who is doing everything he does in his work, but he needs direction to focus his talents, and this is inadequate in the last five minutes. the movie is. Gregory Peck is a portrait to fix them, but nothing more, while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with so many lines of this. Nick Nolte turns out to be better than Lorenzo's Oil but is not in the same form as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has some great links, while Juliette Lewis again proves that talent sometimes skips the generation. Some good points? Initial Credits (!), First Look at Cody's Back When He Makes Drops in Prison, The Scene Where Cody Is Attacked by Baseball Bats, Good Sam Bowden into Full Panic, Cody's Peaceful but Disturbing Presence. <br /> <br /> Worst? "Cleaning woman - but not really !!!" part. A tight hand on the underside of a car at a hundred kilometers high. (Is there no speed in the USA?) "He's dead - but not really !!!" partS and the above-mentioned minor end. <br /> <br /> I could watch the original again, but I've been trying to watch the remake four years since she saw it.
