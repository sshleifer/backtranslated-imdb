I'd leave the film in half unless I was with the people who liked it. The film is based on real events, but it is so over a peak that did not even feel at all. I have some psychological background, I go with a lot of psychotherapists and I know really crazy people, so it's not like I think there are no such people. But in the film the only characters that looked like human beings were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an interesting turn-very sexy with a bad sense of fun). There were several fun moments, but the overall tone of the film was gloomy, bizarre and uncomfortable. What a waste of excellent cast! When I watched them go through their turns, I felt I was looking at the acting class. This was brought home during credits when a couple of people turned out to be sitting there, billing and talking. These moments were more fun than the previous 2 hours.
