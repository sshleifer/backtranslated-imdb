I just saw this movie on a local TV station (TV8 is "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio) I never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. I know no thesaurus that may even come close to helping me to describe how this movie is really bad. The script is terrible. The acting actress, in addition to one of two exceptions, is useless because there is nothing in this material that would deserve any real effort. It looks like a lot of little ideas, remnants of different writing that where it is wiped into a blender. It's not just funny. Parody is at best tense. Some links are almost obsolete (even at the time of their release). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than something on Saturday night, on MAD television, or even on In Living, which is going away in the worst days. is a great example of how to NEVER shoot a movie. Whatever you do, DO NOT use CENT. <br /> <br /> Adam
