It's a terrible movie. Girls are pretty but not very good. A conspiracy with a cowboy to engage an Indian girl would be interesting if sex did not happen. Well, it might be interesting, but not because it is so bad and only partially acted. I can only imagine how it looks from a close-up on a big-screen dance, probably more ridiculous than on television. (Without mentioning the legless fight between the two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing on their chest, they never said it in the old west) It is a film that requires a liberal use of rapid forward. /> <br /> I love schlock movies, but that's ridiculous. There is a reason why I do not go for such films and they are not very good, the conspiracy is based on the breasts. The original nudie cuties, as they are called, were originally nudist films or films that did not touch, but as the adult industry began to develop, filmmakers either tried to be smart or tried to use something else to sit on their ass. Only a very few people were smart, leaving only hackers with limited talents. Comedies often come out best with humor that comes close to the first level, childish, but inoffensive fun. Something that could rarely be said of any other genre that dresses like a boredom. Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces, but it is not a Western or a sex movie. > <br /> I need it not to move. <br /> <br /> Interestingly probably, nobody, the rapist and murderer in the movie played Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family, who was arrested for murdering a teacher shortly after filming. <br /> <br /> These things seem to destroy some human lives.
