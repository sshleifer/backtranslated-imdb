If you want to watch a good film about how women can fight against sexual violence then this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social commentary about a woman who was a victim and fought back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on his striker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to vigilance. In essence, the court system will be abolished. The film "The accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the court system and wins. What does "descent" mean to tell victims of the attack that they should resort to violence? Is the victim no better than the accused? No!!!
