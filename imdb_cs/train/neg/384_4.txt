I do not know a lot of fidelity to AIDS conspiracy theories, but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. In the first years of the AIDS epidemic, suffering and paranoia of terrified and dying people often caused such dark fantasies. This is especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demigod in San Francisco. The city, famous for its beauty, seldom appeared more unfortunate than in this film. The feeling of darkness and decay penetrates every scene. While acting and plot can not be said to be well-done, films have a unique cultural context and oppressively dark moods, at least partially storing the film from being a complete loss. In fact, I found the most interesting show that I was Irrit Levi as a gruesome and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police detective. It is interesting, though not necessarily convincing. Main features: The use of Turandot is a perfect motif, and the movie is a great silent artistic artist Ron Athey.
