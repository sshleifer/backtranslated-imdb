This film is considered a classic of sentiment, not the quality of film making. It moves from unlikely to unbelievable, from unrealistic to absurd. An incredible plot is revolving around the attempt by two British soldiers and Hindus to save a third soldier who was captured by the insurgent Indians. In the later scene, we see a full regiment with a drum and bagpipes marching into a backup. In the British Army, the sergeant does not try to rescue, and if you get around, he will not try to do just one other soldier and an Indian servant when he is at hand full of a regiment. Indian insurgents are so incredible that it's ridiculous ... there are hundreds, but they can not hold their prisoners or kill two rescuers, of course not. At one point, we can see that British soldiers are defending stone blocks down from battlements on insurgents who are scattered across the mountainside ... one had to have the brain to think it would cause some damage. After Cary Grant, when the rescued prisoner is shot, lies on the floor and looks at the water boy ... barely the action of someone who was shot in the back. Water boy bravely blows a whistle (coming from nowhere) to make an alarm ... it does by standing high up on the wall to see and shoot the bad boys, and when he keeps trying to sound more notes when he is repetitive shooting and interrupted calls fall apart into a lot of stuff ... instead of blowing while hiding behind the cover as if someone with half the brain did it. This scene was earnestly parodied in comic sketches. If they wanted to make a comedy Buster Keaton, they should hire Keaton to do it better.
