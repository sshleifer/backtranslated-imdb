Well, that was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> <br /> It is my second favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'. /> <br /> Let's start with good. Teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being a great lover of animals I was, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. But then everything is bad and believe me there is a lot. Does it make sense, so the animals were kidnapped and impregnated? whaaa ??? the dialogue was also quite terrible. There were about one or two quotes. <br /> <br /> And worst of all, when almost all animals died, it was very uncomfortable for me. Finally ... what's the point? they all died. We learned nothing, we were not entertained, and I could not find Sophie's death sad ... very frustrating. shame because Season 2 worked so well.
