I bought this DVD for $ 1 on Walmart. After I saw it, I could go back to the store and try to get the money back! The only reason why I shot movie 2 and not 1 is that the story has several novel stories, though it never really increases to the level of interest. This film has all the honors that it is made for a theater market - ultra low budget, amateur work and liberal sex (for the film of the early 1960s). In fact, I wonder if maybe the only reason the movie was made was to make a quick wallet And because someone knew some strippers they could use as an extras. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to move his girlfriend's interrupted head to an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are strippers or models - the only real purpose in the movie is to wrinkle when they remove most of their clothes. However, they keep too much on making a movie even worth watching for naughty pieces and the film is not terrible enough to deserve observation from bad movie enthusiasts.
