God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here), but what really? The whole thing behind "Natural Born Killers" appears to be a "smart" view of how media can become a complete waste, but unfortunately the film turns into rubbish. Please, Mr. Stone, next time, if you want to criticize the fascism of television shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same thing with your movie! Michael Haneke has said quite cleverly about this film that he condemns media fascism in fascist cinematographic ways. How is it true ... Just forgot to tell us about the massive headaches you get after getting into this overdose of bullshit!
