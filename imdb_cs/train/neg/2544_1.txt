Gung Ho was a good idea, however it is much to ask American spectators to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this film, the main character, Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), goes to Japan to persuade the Japanese automobile company to come to America and help his dying Pennsylvania city. Two things come to you. First, why would a Japanese company come to America to do cars when they do, and so good? Second, can anyone understand that American companies of all types go to third world countries to produce their products to escape US labor costs? It is supposed that the world's number one filmmaker would go to one of his "best competitors (except Germany) and leave the plants unrealistic." Keaton was still in his comedy mode this time, but he gives credible performance as he did he could go from comedy to drama in a few seconds and still do not feel embarrassed but director Ron Howard can not keep it a television movie that ends up being because he has to give an unlikely story to a happy end of politics and problems of Japanese and American relationships that are not interested Gung Ho has happy days, and Laverne and Shirley feel like the producers of both TV shows shot the film and then produced a TV version of the movie that gives the movie a "light feel." The Japanese manager likes American laborers and feels he and other Japanese people can learn from the Americans he probably does not like the Americans, he does not think much about it. I would have preferred all the Japanese characters like Saito, figures that they excluded from Japan. It would be more interesting.
