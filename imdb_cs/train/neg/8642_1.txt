I have to say that it is a terrible film because the mere fact that when you see this movie on a guide is listed as a documentary. As I watched, I began to laugh and wonder myself that this man actually expects me to think it's real? So I had to look at it, and now I see it's a movie, but now, because it's not a document, it's now a movie with bad acting. So, either it's bad. Actually, I did not finish it. I had to turn it off. I'm a NYC police officer, and I felt that someone was trying to get people to think it was a documentary, with the intention of making money a terrible day for me and for co-workers. So I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
