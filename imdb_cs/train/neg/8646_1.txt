This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was about to get up and go to Tape 4, but I pulled it out. Now I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on, guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide Sanskrit billboards? I thought the main actor (George Calil) was particularly awkward. In addition to the poor and hopeful camera shake, I thought I was using the September 11th events as a reason to make "Larson Lunatic Implodes, Full Screen with You" shameful and disrespectful to the September 11th victims. Larson's wife used a phone call, but Sarah, allegedly one of the terrorist planes on that day, was terrifying. The shake of the camera could not make me feel bad, the cool piece did it.
