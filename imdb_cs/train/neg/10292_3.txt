It has its merits; Morvern Callar is both merit and disappointment. It's so mysterious, so original. Is it her way of dealing with the pain of a lost person who makes her so distant and irrepressible? Or did she call her a revolutionary revolutionary? Personally, I would call it a non-functional one. <br /> <br /> Morvern is completely separated. When she got rid of her boyfriend, without thinking about informing her family or using the money she had given her for a proper funeral, she would go for a trip to Spain. It seems to be without any relative human chaos. The only element that allows viewers to see her human side is her close friend who goes on holiday with her. Although at the end her friend is thrown out and Morvern has nothing to link her to humanity. She could, of course, kill herself. Despite Spain's appearance as bleak and turbulent as the United Kingdom, the film's great shots of the director, light and color made the film visually stunning. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> It's really a shame that the movie has nothing in it that would be interesting. It's just over 90 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. It will make Morvern look interesting to attract attention, but do not lose her just to take care of the characters or the movie.
