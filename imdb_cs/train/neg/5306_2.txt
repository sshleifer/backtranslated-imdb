OK, I'm blessed. I have seen two very strong stage productions, one in New York with the original cast and the other in San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to some of these films, it is almost impregnable. I've spawned the DVD during the last two evenings and I have not yet. Too many foreign dialogues and too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four main performances are quite good, especially. Mrs. Streep. But comparing the stage with the movie is certainly an example of "less is more". Enhancing the game to meet the needs of filmmakers for scenic diversity and specificity was a bad choice. Please, please, go find some scenic production somewhere near you.
