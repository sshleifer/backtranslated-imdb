This film has several key defects. The first and most significant of them is the clear lack of a good conspiracy! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends some obscurity to the observer as if he has lost the precious time of his short life. This means that the film can not interest its audience, instead it encourages the audience to scorn the movie and everything connected with it! In short, it's really very very very very very BAD! Make a favor and chew on a big rubber boot, find it much more interesting and fun than watch the Terminator.
