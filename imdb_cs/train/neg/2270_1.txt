The only thing that lost me from returning after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the weird show usually appearing on a TV show. This is also the main reason why fans of a TV show will not like the movie, but it's not the only reason. This movie has about as much fun as getting a root canal. It approaches deep depths of bad movie shooting and then gets worse. I do not waste time by describing this film in more detail; just tell me that I like the poor people in the camera who have to suffer by watching this c ** p for the first time.
