What an incomprehensible disorder of the movie. Something about a cop who shoots bullets after fire and holds them in a glass jar in the bathroom (and the size of a glass that shot him about fifty times) and a secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason headed to Mexico. Whether they were deliberately sent or really lost, it's never clear. And you never hear another scenario, nor the word "butthorn". Gary Busey tries Mel Gibson's role in "Lethal Weapon," and while Busey is a true actor, the screenplay captures the film's mediocrity. William Smith continues as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Red Dawn" a few years ago. After playing biker hard for most of the 1970s it was a bit nice to see him expand his range to play communist heavy. Unfortunately, he'll probably always be best remembered as a kid that Clint Eastwood has thrashed in "Every Way You Can."
