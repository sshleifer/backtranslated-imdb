80 minutes and it's been twice as long! Short overrun is not short enough. In fact, for the first 50 minutes, it almost consists of a dialogue (more monologue, indeed) of middle-aged women trying to get rid of "men," disappointment, sex, aging and her recent disintegration, to a French teenager meeting in a cafe ship. The tireless monologue goes on to go to the duty-free shop and into the bar where it finally pulls away its self-serving punch. Of course, "The Story" can not end, so she can persuade her to listen to her drone for more when she takes him to his cabin. What little romance, sex or whatever matters, all that this movie has in addition to hot wounds is not enough to justify the cost of renting unless you're one of those who love dramas where nothing happens. Yes, the end is very nicely done, but it's a little reward to get what's changing your living room with virtual narcissistic whine therapy. Of course, some people like it. I could be wrong.
