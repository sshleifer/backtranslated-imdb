In the Lost Son, a private eye looking for a missing person encounters a child prostitution ring. This film includes all the worst stereotypes you can imagine in the worst scenario that exists only in the Hollywood Brain, in print and AG John Asscrap. If you have a chance to see it, you should be better than you lose.
