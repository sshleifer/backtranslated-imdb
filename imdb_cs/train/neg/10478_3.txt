I sincerely consider this film as another evil effort of the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie is a bit funny, but when they move their role in society (men do what women usually do and women do what men usually do) the film falls. To be boring and not fun at all. They leave a lot of things without explanation, and the end of the movie is predictable. I did not like Roberto Angel playing his character and his little thing. I went to the cinema, I hope I see a good job, but I was really disappointed. I'm not answering this movie.
