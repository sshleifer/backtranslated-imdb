The original book was founded in the 1950s, but it will not do for a TV series because most people follow the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the train train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like the 1930s train, so Underground can play in the game too. The hangover story of Jarrov March was weak, but in the 1950s students were beginning to think about the world around them, so I suppose that thinking about the poverty of the holders is very much the same. Everything about Japp having to take care of himself was also weak, but he had to give something to fill his time. It would be a decent half-hour show, or they could make a book and make it a better show. Obviously, this episode is a victim of style over content.
