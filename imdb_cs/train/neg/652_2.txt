I think it was overrated by PG-13 crap! At least the performance of BRITTANY SNOW was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were also good, but some other teens at the ball as leading friends were not so convincing. The killer was so stupid and he looked so stupid. Deaths were stupid, boring and completely irregular. The film was too boring and overrated. It was not exciting at all, I almost fell asleep. His other bad remake of PG-13 is a really horrible IMO movie. The end was so silly and the climax was very nasty and boring. The film is relatively slow. Overall, the only good thing about this bizarre fest is BRITTANY SNOW, I think it gave good performance as well as IDRIS ELBA, but besides it was a terrible movie and a terrible remake. So that's just my opinion. I gave her 2/10.
