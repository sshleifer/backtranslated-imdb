It was recently on live AMC movie classic and I had to laugh. I had great hopes for this adventure that follows "Voyage to the Earth Core" and "Mysterious Island". I was very disappointed not only in the actor's credentials, but in a silly story line that reads a five-year comic. Make sure you saw the wires it holds on the Pterdactyl wings when it grabs the "Ogar" of a half-length pre-married man who is tangled with lost adventurers. The end has opened for the same repeat of the same effects in "People who have forgotten". Do not waste time.
