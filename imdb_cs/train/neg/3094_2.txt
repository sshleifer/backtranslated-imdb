**** MINOR SPOILERS *** As a bad filmmaker I had to see hundreds of bad movies and yet "Hobgoblins" stand from others in their unique way. Classic baddies like "The Creeping Terror," "The Mighty Gorga," and "Manos" are individually wrong from start to finish. "Hobgoblins" on the other hand starts badly and gradually worsens. During my first glance at the infamous rake scene, I thought it was a really bad film. I was blissfully unconscious that I just saw the best the film had to offer. The film has the most massive boredom to celluloid hell during the painlessly stupendous "Club Scum" sequence, which is a continuous chain of one junk after the other. With this one film, director Rick Sloane proves he deserves to be mentioned with Coleman Francis and Bill Reban as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad film be? Watch "Hobgoblins" and you will not know.
