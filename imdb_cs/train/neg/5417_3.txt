Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decadence of Monte Carlo, even though they have fallen to the last franc. To support their rich lifestyle, three use counterfeit services and use notes in casinos and hope to exchange a fake currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, an American ambassador, will arrive in Monaco with his wife Helen, and three will decide to make friends with visitors hoping to have financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to continue on, constantly moving towards Helen, and at the same time disappointed with the chamber chamber that loves Sergius. Eventually, circumstances play a hand against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey the message (with the foolishness of American women and the bad behavior of the aristocrats) rather than telling the story, and the film really can wear a modern audience like me, easily by doing it. Even the acting, which is great in later Evs like Greed and Wedding March, is right here. The film could benefit from improvements at different levels. Rating, 3.
