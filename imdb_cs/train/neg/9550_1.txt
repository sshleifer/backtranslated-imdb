After Highlaner 2 (which I still deny), I thought it was impossible to do a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however this film is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames had at least some hooks that worked. Who wrote this movie did not know anything about computers except how to use a text editor. I doubt that he or she even watched the original movie. The effect is not convincing either. Keep in mind, never look at this movie. I do not care if the channel is stuck on the TV and the TV can not be turned off. THIS FILM LIVES LIFE.
