I hate this movie! Nothing was like a book, and I just think about it. If you look at the movie before reading the book, yeah, it's a good movie. But King's book was amazing and this movie was nothing like that. I think the general meaning may be a bit similar, but most aspects of the film are completely different. End, for example! So the book is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape a few seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this terrible movie version the jack seemed like a stupid delusion ... yeah, there's no maze in the book and there's no reason for it. Another part that upset me is that Jack just kills Mr. Halloran! what the hell is basically the hero of the book and just killing him as if he was not important. Overall, it was simply bad that the movie was so far away.
