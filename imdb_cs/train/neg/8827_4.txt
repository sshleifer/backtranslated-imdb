I love 80th slasher flicks and I remember when "Silent Night / Dead Night" was pulled out of our theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of them on Fear.net. Be more careful about what I expected from these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous according to today's standards, character development was too long, but in all was ridiculous loud fun! <br /> <br /> Scenes where he loses because Santa, aka father, feels his mother and later when the crowd is actually seeing the lights - not the flashlights as in the 1980s, but the real burners! - I really whispered my funny bone. However, the scenes on which they controlled the children around me made me a scary feeling of a different nature. I also like to find out who some of these characters are. It took me a moment to find out that the main character was a nice teddy bear to his brothers.
