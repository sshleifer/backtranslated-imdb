This was marked by potentially large matches that have been truncated. <br /> <br /> The first game was the loss of a legion of destruction, but I think the only way the Demolition could be removed, DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfekt would have to give overtime. Kerry von Erich, Champion I-C, was wrecked here. And this was the third ppv in the row, where it is the perfect bearing. Remember that he never lost the match before. The second game was very good, maybe best at night. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were outstanding, while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF peaks and pinned Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware has continued the tradition of being the first to be on the new heel (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was the precursor of Bret Hart's career when he returned from two to one and almost survived the game. He and DiBiase went into the clinic, so we forgot that DiBiase's boring conflict with Dusty Rhodes was the point of the match. Although Visionary was the first team to survive all its members (and only the second since '87 has four survivors), this game was not squash. It was the longest game at night and Jake repeated his performance in 1988 when he was alone against four men and dominated. I think it could really upset it. These days the match would end in the opposite direction. One of the shortest SS games ever was one of the most surprising. Perhaps the most underestimated wrestler, Tito Santana, was an inspirational fighter at night, he set the battle color and scored Boris Zukhov, Tanak, and even Warlord in the final survival match. It was so weird to see him overwhelming, so he went back to his average career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well, getting rid of Volkoff and Bushwhackers, but that was simply not a surprise. That was it. I think the only survival match was to win Hogan and the Warrior at the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and matches were too short. The decorative debut was cool, but Tito Santana is the reason I remember this.
