In 1959 I saw this film on the way. Until the year of "Howard the Duck" I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen. This film tried to combine all the genera in one; comedy, horror, adolescence, and hot sticks that had to convince "My Mother, Car". Maybe he deserves a second look to see if it's the exact reflection of time.
