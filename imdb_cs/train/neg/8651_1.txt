I watched for the first 15 minutes, and I thought it was a real documentary (with an irritatingly over-dramatic "camera" producer). When I realized it was all right, I thought "why would I want to waste my time tracking this waste?" So I turned it off and came to warn other people. The characters do not work in a credible way. too immature emotions. for a man who traveled all over the world to the war of a torn state, behaved like a child. and I do not believe it was because "his character was so upset about the bombing of the trade." kids "French dark fantasy movie about a guy who kidnapped children and stole their dreams ... I liked it!
