Okay guys, we know why we're watching movies like "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A in the whole location (with much more T than A). But ... should not it be a story that would go with it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I would not have a problem. But since these guys from the "Invisible Man" need a little story, you know you're busy. However, all they can get is how this crazy doctor creates a serum of invisibility and when he breaks it, uses it to spy on naked women, and eventually kills a bunch of teenagers. And if you see how teenagers look prey, you will be grateful. One star for T and A, but for your skin fans is too little. with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, it's Savannah.
