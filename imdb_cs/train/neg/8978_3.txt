If John Waters wrote and directed "House 1000 Corpses" after being repeatedly hit by a head with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "Blood Shed." For the first half hour, it is slightly fun, but then it slides into something insignificant constant shouting, and people do things on genitals with electric cutting knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad in what he does before the camera. Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that most of the audience will not have to forget about it for a long time.
