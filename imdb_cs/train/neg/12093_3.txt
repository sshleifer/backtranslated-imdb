Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. Director "La Pianiste" understands this and gives the viewer the long look of Huppert's face, and it is a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - it records emotions with the least eyebrow lift or smile flashing. Besides, the joy of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession, there is nothing in this movie that I wanted to recommend. (If you like self-mutilation, sado-masochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" might work for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> Buried in all those strange materials is the core of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically, anything - start out as strangers and are molded by strangers in a competitive environment. Do not forget to relive this lesson of life with a cinema trip. <br /> <br />
