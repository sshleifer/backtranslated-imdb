Watching Tom Hanks as a hit for the Irish crowd is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial killer that just does not work. I had a really hard time accepting it. Not that I do not think Tom can not act that I can watch his career from Maze and Monsters, but for some reason it has fallen for me. Perhaps because I am such a fan of the graphic novel and threatens to sound like fanboy (the only form of life is less than a fan is a cockroach) The film as a whole fails for me. The addition of Jude Law and subtraction of everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a big crime movie in Bonnie, and Clyde Mendes took all his heart out of heart and left only bare bones. There are things you like in the movie, however, cinematography is breathtaking when it fills a screen with beautiful pictures. Paul Newman is as good as usual and I really liked it, but Tom as "the Angel of Death" was Sullivan completely flat.
