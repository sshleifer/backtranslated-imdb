After the introduction of four very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION managed to scratch the lower part of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I did not find any Bloodsuckers on this movie. The story is simple. A mysterious number brings several actresses to their castle to rest for a moment. After some sexual sex shenanigans, the girls are kidnapped one by one. Who's the murderer? Who knows? This is more red herring than in the local fish market. <br /> <br /> The tempo is unbearable. The story is silly and the skin scenes are not so amazing. <br /> <br /> Give it this missing.
