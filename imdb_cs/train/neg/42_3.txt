Of the three titles from Jess Franco, who got to the official list of DPP Video Nasty (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), it may be the least deserving of it, because it is a terribly dull jungle that is revived by just a little careless gore , unauthorized scene of rape and lots of nudity. Beautiful blonde woman Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is kidnapped by a gang of unscrupulous kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe who worships the "divine devil" who is hiding in the jungle (a big naked naughty native who likes to eat the heart of the nubil women's victims). $ 6 million in redemption, mercurial mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam veteran pilots on board travel to the island, but they are struggling with problems when bad guys try to double the cross. During the confusion, Laura gets into the jungle, but goes directly into the arms of the islands who offer her to her god. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Franco directs his usual torpedo style and treats this ridiculous effort of his usual terrible trademarks: grumpy gore, dark cinematography, rapid magnification, numerous crotch crotch, focal shots, terrible sound effects and editing ham. The result is a spooky mess that is a real fight to sit down from start to finish (it took me a few meetings to finish it), and even the look of loving Buchfellner in my natural glory is not enough to make me hurry this movie.
