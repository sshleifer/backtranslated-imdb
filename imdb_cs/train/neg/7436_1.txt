This movie is a waste of time and money. For an hour and a half I waited for it to improve and it was never. He moved slowly, the land leaped, it was not frightening or interesting, and there was never anything at all. Credits in the introduction were long and depleted, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and drawn). Many parts of the land did not make sense. Several times during the movie, I thought maybe I was "stuck" because the conspiracy mismatch, but my companion had the same problem and assured me that I was a "zone out" of boredom, but that was really a movie. In fact, I have never previously released the film and I have been actively acquainted with IMDb films for many years. So the fact that I really have time to write something should talk about how bad this movie is and that you should not waste time or money on it.
