Another American Pie movie was stuck in his throat and this is the worst. It does not deserve the name of American Pie. They should stop at "The Wedding". This movie feels like a just stupid pornographic movie titled American Cake. When I watched it, I felt I was looking at another series. It's not like an American cake. It has a different humor and is much rougher and has more sex scenes than other American films American Pie. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. In fact, I do not recommend any American Pie Presents. Just keep a beautiful original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
