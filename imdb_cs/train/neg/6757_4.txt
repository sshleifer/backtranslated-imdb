Special film slasher from producer Charles Band. In the days of the greatest full moon success, Band said he would never do "real murderous movies," because he felt small puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made movies better - people who kill each other are so real and less entertainment. Nice philosophy and the real pity that the group that destroyed the Full Moon studio by means of possible bad business dealings so desperately tried to make the home cinema profit that it started making exactly what Blockbuster liked and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. The team also worked for "Delta Delta Die!" and "Birth Rite" - equally unobtrusive by Full Moon. Debbie Rochon is the hobbyist here as a newcomer to the gang of guys and guys who decide to make a story about a "murderous club." She - of course - everything is going to happen and then the panic meets, because it was not a true story, and the stupid Mrs. Rochon believed it and now they all have to get around to get covered with blood and maybe kill each other or maybe No. The choice is there, and because of this movie it's your ... not recommended, but not bad.
