I saw this film during the Tolkien-Thematic Interim Class during the second year of college. I was unfortunately sitting close to the screen, and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy - everyone laughed but was not in constant sight. Get it out of the way: Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" owes something to Bakshi's film. In the Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, a scene in which Black Riders attack empty beds is almost complete a copy of the scene shot in the shot-off film Bakshi. You could call this plagiarism or tribute, depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities do not end there. I will not do any research to find out what they are, because that would mean I have a little respect for this movie. I'm sure others have outlined similarities - look around. This film is a complete wreck of trains in every sense for the metaphor and many, many people have died in an accident. I decided to say what I recall, more or less chronologically - If I missed something else that offended me, it's because I'm totally overwhelmed, confronted with a lot of failure (and in high places, average). <br /> <br /> * Because of the heavy use of a rotogravure, Gandalf is not a gentle and wise sorcerer, but a wildly crazy death prophet (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the film). <br /> <br /> * Saruman White is sometimes referred to as 'Aruman' during the movie, without explanation. It has purple and red color for some mysterious reason. Sam is just hideous. The portrayal of his friendship with Frod is strangely childish and unsatisfactory. Yes, hobbits are small as children, but they are not children. Merry and Pippin are never introduced - they just appear when changing the scene with an explanation in the sentence. Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry cheerfully as they ride the road. One of the hobbits gets at least twice as much as the back of the hobbit - not seen before - and starts banging in a typical bard fashion fantasy when everyone gets to the la la la. Aragorn seems to be native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (without pants) complete with a huge, square pilgrimage tape. He is probably the worst fencer in the whole movie - he's often turning around before he knocks on the corner. Black Riders look more like leprosy than threatening tools of evil. They are ubiquitous everywhere they walk painfully at a slow pace. That's disturbing, but not terrible. <br /> <br /> * The scene before Black riders attempting to cross Ford Bruinen (in which they look at Frodo, which is on the other side of the horse) continues forever, during which time riders hold their horses vaguely horrible and ... they will not do anything else. The scene was probably designed to illustrate Frod's hallucinations when he suffered his injuries. It turns out to be more productive than anything else. <br /> <br /> * The Gimli Dwarf is as tall as the Legolas Elf. It's DWARF. It's no excuse for that. He also looks like a bastarded David Gnome. It's a rough but accurate description. * Boromir appears to have separated the golden Viking Armored Elmer Fudd from the Bugs Bunny opera episode. Looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarity with Tolkien's Illustration, Balrog will evoke the most vulnerable villain in the whole movie. It looks like someone's wearing a pink bedroom and it's barely higher than Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take the Jackson version every day. <br /> <br /> * Battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters show any level of competence with their weapons. I'm not asking for scenarios that are in Jackson's movie, but they have fun, but they have to fight. * Treebeard appears very briefly, and I was sorry he bothered to show up on Everything. Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Well, now for GOOD parts of the movie. * Some voice actors are pretty good. Aragorn SOUND is not bad, looks like Jolly Green Giant. Galadriel is a little interesting in this view; like Tom Bombadil, seems to be immune to the ring ring strength, and her voice actress is not even terrible. Boromir's death is not as it is in the heart of Jackson's performance of the same scene, but it's still reasonably dramatic (and more true to his death in the book, though I do not believe that Jackson made a shooting mistake as he did). As my professor stressed (among the whispering threats), the orcs (especially Helm's deep, if I'm right) resemble soldiers' military bodies, a political statement that works well if you realize what they are trying to do. <br /> <br /> * While this is not really a positive point about the film, Bakshi can not be accused of most of the failures in this movie, or I was told - the project was on a tight budget and later in his production he lost creative control of some higher people (who I'm sure I did not read books). Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi for it, of this size. I hardly believe he was happy with the end product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not recommend this blasphemous adaptation of the classic Tolkien's trilogy even for laughs if you have not read books and do not have your own visuals of characters, places and events. I'm sure somebody, somewhere, takes a copy of this doubt; if so, keep your mind open and collect what you can from it.
