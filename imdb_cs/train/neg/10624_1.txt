In another good review, loleralacartelort7890 says, "The truth is that Americans use a hidden alumina alloy that is not so well known, and the exact specifications are a secret, and why it's a secret: Well, why would they have them revealed then? in a space race with the Russians, then it would be very silly to find that they have a new technology that could protect the crew from radiation. "That's completely wrong. There is (and was) no "secret" radiation protection in Apollo. The construction and design of the Apollo module has long been publicly available. It uses a light "hat" made of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (with the exception of the windows of course) is covered by a heat shield made of phenolic resin, which is thicker on the bottom that returns backwards. These materials are actually * better * when we stop the type of radiation we have in the universe (charged particles) than lead that is better suited to stop ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma radiation. <br /> <br /> is a problem for the * long-term * space flight due to the risk of major solar eruptions. But it simply was not a serious threat to Apollo astronauts. The command module gave them sufficient protection during their short (about half-hour) pass through the Van Allen strips. Everyone had dosimeters, so we know exactly how much annealing we get: no more than 1.5 rem and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (12 of them landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died from heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa) and motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are in fact quite good statistics for a group of men in their late 70s (Shepard would be 86).
