At least it is not full of absurd violence or fluff. Nor is it too full of thought or smooth acting. This story had some potential, but the director apparently lost the green space. The story is discontinuous and goes out in strange directions without a conclusion. I also do not believe the director spent much time around the golf club. Some of the pictures are absurd. He is not very pilgrim.
