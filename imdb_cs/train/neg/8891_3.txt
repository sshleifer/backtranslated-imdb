The most well-known of all Shakespeare plays, it was really serious. Sweet directions, stagnant studio work, and irregular performance spoil fines. <br /> <br /> In Verona, Capulets and Montagues have committed for many centuries, but a tragedy occurs when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), cappuccino. Bloodshed will soon explode ... Studio studios, especially in daily scenes, severely stagnate the energy of the game. It's a story that deserves its energy to be shot outdoors. Along with that, the costumes are hideous, with too many stockings and laughter. The battle scene looks terrible, with too much pulling and moving around to get involved. Patrick Ryecart is too light to be really effective Romeo. Manages the intensity of the character when it's happening, but its enormous accent and restless, often dim eyes limit the scope. It is very difficult for the audience to refer to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - it captures the naivety of the character, but a little more would be welcome. Role support does not work much better. Joseph O'Connor's brother Laurence is fine, but too many of his best lines have been cut. Mercutio Anthony Andrews belongs to the scene and not to the camera. He is over-nesting and gesticulating, and as a result looks rather ridiculous. Alan Rickman, underestimating his role, has virtually no presence like Tybalt. In later years he developed the edge and intensity to provide some fine screens in some cases, but it is not here. Prince can be a great part with his short performances, but actor Lawrence Naismith can not provide any part of any authority to the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, probably his best role in this series, is based on this dignity. His capsules play well and enjoy watching. Instead, you see one of the other versions of this story.
