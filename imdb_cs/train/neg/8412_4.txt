Yesterday I saw DreamGirls and I was really underlined. Despite everything that is Oscar, it's nothing special. Everyone who was really impressed with this film never bothered to see any true movie classical musicians. In addition to Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a celebrated TV movie of no style or taste. Only a lot of amateurs sing! Now the first half hour was good, but I was irritated as Eddie Murphy's awesome ravishing performance was shortened and interrupted by assembly. These were the best tracks and best performances in the movie. And "ascension to the upper" part of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent look or dynamism. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, constant mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic to be interesting. It was also visually boring and included too many sound-like melodies. Condon did not try to turn any of the melodies into big shows as I expected them to be. Every number in the second half was just one detail after another, when people "sang" to one another. And the way they shot Hudson's big number "love me" was a criminal! Condon just shot her around the stage - no drama at all! God sucked it! And all concerned - all interested - that "singing" can work on stage, but it does not work in movies (see the embarrassing failure of Evita and Phantom). Everything that "I tebeell tebeuuu something Efff-ieeee!" crap should be left on the floor of the editorial room. These are not "songs". <br /> <br /> The film, in addition to Eddie Murphy's amazing performance, was nothing but a celebrated television film. Behind megafunctions behind the film! I wonder how much money was spent on getting the "one who beat" the Oscar? Overall, this film was, except for Eddie, NEVER for Oscar Calibra! (except for Eddie) that I would throw there with Grease 2. BIG disappointment, especially after all (very expense I) hype!
