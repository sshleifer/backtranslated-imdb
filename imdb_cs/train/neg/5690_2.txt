First ... I never considered Uwe Boll Hater because I thought I had never seen one of his films but after seeing this inexpensive apology for a movie called "Seed" (which is the serial killer name of this movie) I'm close to joining the hate club. This movie does not make any sense at all ... the plot is a joke and although Boll is clearly trying to get the attention of shocking people, 90% of this film is simply boring. This movie can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. A hooded killer looks at clips of animals tortured on television. This is a real shot of furry farms and the film opens with a funny reason to "make a statement about humanity" and give the address to Pet. Since this film has no news at all and is the worst part of a violation of sexual violence, you have a reason to hate the movie from the start. <br /> <br /> 2. Electric Death with an excuse that delivers what happens later in this movie printed on the screen so that every retard gets it. <br /> <br /> 3. Policemen watch videos of animals, children and women hungry and decompose in the underground of seeds, have silly nightmares and cry in their whiskey, because Seed is so bad mofo. Although the acting is fine, the movie will submerge each time it attempts to incorporate any emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. A policeman buries Seeds in his house, stupidly and lost in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, barely seeing anything except light sources. Seed is a super killer who's everywhere at once, and all the cops are stupid enough to kill him ... except whoever grabs him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed gets a chair and his electricity is as long as everything else in this "movie" ... does not die and reminds us that he has to be liberated if he survives three electric wounds. Guess what ... they just bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. The seed comes from his grave, kills everyone else and tries to avenge the main cop. 7. A woman gets her head hammered in an endless sequence from one view just for fun and shock values. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed captures the family of policemen, lures him to his house and threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the policeman shoots in his head, considering what Seed wants (it's hard to get into that guy's head because he's not just wearing a mask even in jail, but he's never even giving a word ... the movie has almost no dialogue, so it does not matter). <br /> <br /> 9. Boll is a nihilistic shocking end where Seed blocks a daughter with a dead dad to rot as people we've seen on a video in Sequence 3. That's ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except the stupid story Seed fired as a child. This film is based on a few key scenes and their shock value. I hardly remember a movie that is empty of any emotion, news or entertainment. It's like watching the Underground in August ... it's fine with me, some people will have this helpless tobacco. But what is really hard is the beginning of pseudo-news, and the fact that the film is well-engineered with regard to camera work, effects and even acting is too good for celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> So how Boll gets money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on smart budgets? "Seed" is not just the point of ridiculous, its living proof that the free market is wrong ... happy Uwe that a German taxpayer pays for a lot of this waste to count.
