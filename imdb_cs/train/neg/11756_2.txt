Only children under the age of 12 should be able to see this movie. The rest of us should take a book, MP3 player, or just take a nice nap in order to endure the experience of this event. This can best be summed up as a "blown" television movie that is distributed to theaters. Children will want to see this movie and they will enjoy the movie and have fun.
