If you are after the true story of the Early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - but if you are after a reasonably crafted artistic motif, you find yourself filming. <br /> <br /> This film is such a crucial inaccurate display of Artemisia Gentileschi's life that she almost made me cry. (Enter Artemis inaccuracies in Google and look at some of the facts versus fiction articles.) From a purely technical point of view, the movie was fine: sets, costumes, and especially lighting directly in the lighting helped create an impressive early 17th century experience; although the aforementioned factual inaccuracies made it a little worse. I wonder how director / co-writer Agn√®s Merlet defended his movie at the time? Maybe she refused to portray Artemisia as a victim who would be unhappy because she could face her.
