God this movie was so dull except for the music I really loved, I guess what was the reason why actually to make this movie, please anyone who reads a review does not watch this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can act, but he was really pathetic. In this movie, I really feel ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another nice face without any talent lack what she can not do at all and she did not have any sense in this movie because it was ok for the other girl Radhu but I think it could be better. <br /> <br /> What time to waste. buy great music and watch this movie.
