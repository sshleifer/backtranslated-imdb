I recently bought a DVD and I forgot how much I hated the film version of "A Chorus Line". Every change that director Attenborough made into the story has failed. Since Cassie's relationship is so prominent, the whole set - the prerequisite for music is going out of the window. <br /> <br /> Some musical numbers are speeding up and hurrying. The successful song of the show gets the whole sense that falls apart when it is given to the character of Cassie. <br /> <br /> The whole production is very self-confident. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave her 2 is because some of the big numbers are still able to enjoy it despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.
