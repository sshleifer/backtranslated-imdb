At the beginning of the movie, wonderful photos and scenes of the fox were amazing. But the story was very slow and boring. And then the little girl starts to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the woods and often see foxes. One thing anyone should know is to let the wild animals wild and enjoy them from afar. This film is a terrible example for children who will watch her when she tries to make a wild animal into a pet. I do not know what the story is supposed to be. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the girl wanted to play with the kits. Did not she ever teach her lesson? And there are other scenes featuring predator animals to fox, which only adds to the trauma caused to children to watch this movie. What a disappointment was this film. And what a terrible story he says. The last talk was so stupid until I screamed with my wife on TV! I absolutely hated this movie and I never answer it to anyone!
