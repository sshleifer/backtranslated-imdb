Maybe I've seen too much crime movie or maybe he did not take the right drugs. This was the most cliche sparkling, conspiratorial, conspiratorial - the absurd, just stupid film I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, it seems that it took less time for it to show it together. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like it was directly on the video before it was completed. <br /> <br /> It's a bad break away from the "M" of the classic Fritz Lang movie, where Peter Lorre plays. You would be much better than borrowing instead.
