A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary fights his former employer for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell "Iranians." The low-priced "Silk Stalkings" productions offer decent action shots and a lot of uncompromising "drama" ... lacking logic and really scary dialogue are defining aspects, though the latest twists and shifts of devotion might be a good end to a better film. Burt still has a presence, though it also means you'll notice more when your mouth is insulting half-empty "one-liners".
