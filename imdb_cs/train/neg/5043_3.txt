I'm a huge fan of Ziyi Zhang and I'm going to some movie to see her, which has led me to Purple Butterfly. Just like I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many others who commented on it. It is very mild and also very slow. Because the whole movie seems to have been shot by a hand held camera, significant parts are blurred. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and what is there is not much to say to you. There are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in the room staring at each other without talking. The way the film moves is also very confusing and difficult to trace. Even though I've read a number of reviews before, and generally I knew what the movie was about, I had a hard time understanding what was happening. <br /> <br /> Before that, I knew the movie was not remotely similar to Ziyi Zhang's previous films, but he was looking forward to seeing her in something else, but unfortunately I was finally disappointed. They never smile in this movie, though most of the time have nothing to smile. I could have done it without sex scenes, because they were among the sexes without any obvious feeling among the participants, how you hope to find.
