Even though it was a production produced for television broadcasting, there is no absolute justification for the resulting final product results. This DID film has a budget and a casting department, so if you're going to make a movie about a real life story and actually put a "true story" in the title, should not you make any effort to try to capture some realism? First, this film is absurdly cast. These actors belong to daily television soaps, or to those ridiculous films about the life channel, and not to a real gangster / criminal story. Everything about them, from their point of view to their manners, just yelled the generation of 90th-shopping-alt-rock-listening. What about the screenplay? It describes two words - silly and insulting, and it is so sounding again. I do not think the real Clyde Barrow ever said "I'm out of here." It's as if a couple of New Kids on the Block fans have met and decided that Bonnie and Clyde, who is totally radical and rockish, decides to make it really "kewlova." Well, this label does not even fit on a scale of rock and rock. Everything that can be wrong with any kind of movie is bad here, from shooting and playing to editing and music. Every thing is bad ... and it's upset that the parties responsible for this cruel turkey have the nerves to write the "true story" in the title. It's not really the right story, but even worse, it's not even fun as a soulless popcorn flick, which is accepted according to its own conditions. As I said in my head, it's just horrible for words, you can imagine every level. Believe me, or at your own risk.
