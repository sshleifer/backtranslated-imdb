Again, I took the chance and rented that bag of crap. Worse than horror, there was not even one scene, not even one that was even distant. NO ONE !! Certainly there was some nudity, but all the lesbian events were a bit old. I suppose it was that it was a film-saving pardon? And Dan, what annoying ass! Right from the beginning, I knew I came to it when the good Dan started talking. And should he be intimidating? What a laugh! Overall, this movie is terribly terrible! How the hell are these movies doing? If you want to have a movie with a few excitements, do not borrow it. This movie is as exciting as teletubbies.
