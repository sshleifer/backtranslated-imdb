OK, if you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, it's a really bad movie. I turned around two brothers. Max, younger, has a great addiction to cocaine. Adam, the oldest, is a doctor. This film is supposed to show a drop from reality to the extreme minimums that drugs allow. It is not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens. Most of the film is focused on Max and his ways of farewell. Eventually, Adam can no longer take stress from work and begin to use perscription drugs. This film has almost no climax. He does not get into what cocaine really does, the dull and low-budget scenes, and the oldest brother's acting, Adam, is terrible. I have no idea how this movie managed to pass and receive awards, it's not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true movie of the story of the extreme world of drug leases, if you do not buy "The Basketball Diaries". And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you will like it. Try and see for yourself ...
