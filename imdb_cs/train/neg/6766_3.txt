You've probably heard this phrase when it comes to this movie? "Herbie: Fully charged crap" and yes, it's true. This movie is really scary and totally feeble. It has become the second worst film Lindsey has ever since recruited from the Teenage Queen's Conception. The only good thing about this movie seems like a talented actor, which is far better than the film a million times and is the only selling point of the film. I do not see how such a respected actor, like Matt Dillon, could be part of this movie, did he read the terrible script before he signed up for it? <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this movie is also the basis of how Herbie is unreal and fantastic as extraordinary ability and climbs on the wall and goes faster than the racing car after all but the Beatle. I know it's a kid's movie, but they're with him overboard and it just gets more stupid than fun. Little realism is needed and the story is too predictable. <br /> <br /> The final words: If children are not really 5 -12 years old, I very much doubt everyone can have this nonsensical movie. What a waste of my money. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Stage: F)
