I lost 5.75 to see this dirty movie, so I want to know only a few things: What was the reason the dog was divided into half at the beginning of the film, the disease had nothing to do with being divided in half. What was the task of attracting Karen into the shed, she had already completely infected her room, could only block her where she was safer. > <br /> Why would the hermit run down the woods and ask the aliens to help him if he could only ask his relative, the lady to take him to the hospital? none of the characters bother to go to town to get help when things get worse, are they all really lazy? Although Paul was conceived with a shotgun guy as he watched his wife, Paul could just send Jeff or Berth back to the house to ask for help. the girl she loves is getting worse. Why did Jeff return to the cabin after he left when everyone else got infected? he was such a big blockbuster to go first if he just came home? If the police went into all the trouble to collect children and burn them to the fire, why did Paul go into the river it was not even necessary for the land because the water was already contaminated. Who produces lemonade from the river, bugs in it. Why the two children could not use tap water, it was also contaminated, so the stupid end would still work.
