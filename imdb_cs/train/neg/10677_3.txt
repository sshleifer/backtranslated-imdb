I rented End Game because I never heard of it, but I like political thrillers, so I thought I'd do it. After I did some research on the movie, I found out that it was initially designed for a theatrical release, but instead went on DVD. When I see it, I think it's no wonder. The film is shocking with its indeterminacy. The story and the characters are perfect. I was halfway down, but the end was a curve. I have to say that I did not expect it to be the same, but that is not the reason for his favor. The more predictable end would be more appropriate than the one that is so bad. Perhaps filmmakers saw the film as predictable and decided they were about to twist - even the one that worsened the film. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
