I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was upset by Branagh's performance. Most accounts are a great actor, but he just could not break the southern accent. I mean, it was pitiful. As if he was trying too hard to be Yank. One of the previous reviewers has questioned why US actors have not been cast in this film. I empower this idea. It's amazing when actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing we try too hard for performance to become tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a great director ... Well, I really do not want to shame Branagh for his absolutely terrible accent too. They all deserve to jump around here and there. But it's hard to see something so unpleasant that you'd rather squander the chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap before you sit down over the Gingerbread Man.
