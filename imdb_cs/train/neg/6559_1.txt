My girlfriend chose it; as a South Born and Resurrected African American, I found the film and its assumption totally unreliable. Believing that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would come only from someone completely unknown to the south of the antebelle. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell
