1. Watch 12/7/2002 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley with several other kisses. It seems like the girls get pretty tired and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there in their own way. In this episode of their adventures, trainees in Rome are the "fashion designer" who puts them right in the diary to find out what's going on (I think ..). In addition to typing flirting with boys, there is nothing more than a Roman script until they get involved in the film until they finally find out why they are released, then they are recruited, then fired again and hired again. This is definitely done by people who do not understand the corporate world, and this shows in its interpretation. Perhaps the real world will be their next adventure (if any). Even my children did not seem to care for this boring "adventure." We'll see that they probably have only a few years to adult lawyers. Let's see what happens next.
