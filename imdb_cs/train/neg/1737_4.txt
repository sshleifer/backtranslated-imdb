The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, complemented by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's premature death during production, is the juggling of complexity and stupidity, romance and music, fantasy and costume drama. In the 19th century, a castle in southeastern Europe, the countess falls behind its sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian uprising; she is assisted by her predecessor, whose painted picture is magically revived. Betty Grable, in a long blond wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful and her songs are very nice. Unfortunately, this script (Samson Raphaelson, taken from the operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is full of various ideas that fail - or have fun. The results are good looking but non-absorbent. * 1/2 from ****
