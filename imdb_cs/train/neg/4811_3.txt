I watched the Canadian videotape of this film like "The Witching", which somehow got to New York. The sound was pretty bad, I had to pick it up about 7/8 to hear it, and the soundtrack often stunned the dialogue. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialogues and others were led through echoes. The natural character that still appears has a distorted voice. Some closed captions would really help! A group of witches or Satanists (end credits say the group can not represent any real group!) They have a ritual in which they are naked and cause punishment by pinching the doll. The woman who was aborted and her husband moved to a town called "Lilith," where she was offered work at a toilet factory. Despite the fact that one of the AKA movies from this movie is probably a "toy factory", we never see it and it's only occasionally referenced. <br /> <br /> On her way to Lilith, her husband impatiently asked her questions about what his new boss, Mr. Cato, wanted to know about his religious beliefs. He controls aggressively and causes another car to drive out of the way and blow it up. Upon arrival, the police take a doll that has fallen out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie. It turned out that Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches and that they are the people who caused her abortion, even if she does not realize it. They want her because she has the innate talent for a necromancer she really did not realize. Some pictures in the film have some influence, but overall the film is not too entangled. The movie seems to be a bit of a mess, and that is undoubtedly largely due to its re-editing and adding new records. The original version, according to final credits, was called Nekromance - life for life. The DVD spell enabled us to see both versions on one disc, but the re-release of this movie is probably not a priority.
