as an actor I really like independent movies, but this is at best an amateur. Boys go to Vermont for civil service, but when the plane lands, it's over the palm - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? The pine tree - palm No. A is the same for the wedding service - again a nice palm tree grove. When the boys leave VT, they apparently could not get a ticket to any major airline because the plane being shot is Federal Express. Did they swim themselves in the crate? Come guys a little bit of detail like this indi independent movie from a fully amateur. The Christian brother is far cheerful than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal tattooing tattoos. Two of them should change. <br /> <br /> Smaller characters are ridiculous and overcome something terrible. They need directors to make a homosexual movie, but they pay attention to your places and casting next time
