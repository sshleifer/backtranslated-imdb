I bought this movie on DVD to get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are observable because the film is not in itself. Although there is a conspiracy, the story that may follow, and several actors who can act is nothing else. The film was so dull, I firmly confirmed that she would never look again with Tom, Crow, and Mike. As summarized above, however, it was better than the one in the episode MST3K that preceded it; Mitchell.
