STAR EVALUATION: ***** Work **** just missing a mark *** A little bit between ** Focus on * The Pits <br /> <br /> In this debut film about Beloved Nick and Dog, they are forced to fly to the Moon when old old Wallace ran out of the cheese. Besides being the shortest feature in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the first it shows a bit. Animation of the plasticine is a little nasty and funny, which reminds of Morka's animation of a small man in a box. The craftsmanship that is behind him is admirable, I never really believed Wallace & Gromit (perhaps a little too pure and traditional for some of my generation.) The only thing I really like is The Wrong Trousers (and that's been more when I was younger and less conscious, we say, the most powerful pleasure of life.) I was led to actively seek out this early effort to revive popularity as a result of the incredibly successful film adaptation. <br /> <br /> As technically impressive as the first two things considered!), this lacks the emotional angle to have successors. That being said, it's quite a good fun as a first attempt and definitely set the standard for the next next thing. Two stars, but two good stars. **
