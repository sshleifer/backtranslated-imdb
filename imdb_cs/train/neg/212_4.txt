Getting closer to reality and including more depth than "Breakdance", "Beat Street", Stan Lathana is still quite a boring show. Again, this film is really just a pick for "breakin" madness, but at least we're a bit of fun from a plot that concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all of them growing up in Queens, New York. Everyone has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one DJ, another artist who creates "burners", while Little Bro 'Lee is a hot' hip hop 'dancer. <br /> <br /> Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story and his young cast is also struggling with their characters. That's why almost completely funky music remains and the "fresh" dance saves the day. <br /> <br /> Choreography is once again sharp for club and street scenes, but that alone is not enough to make "Beat Street" at a closer altitude. Unfortunately, the film really falls very late after it showed a glimmer of hope that it might become interesting.
