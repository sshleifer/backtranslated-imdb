I just finished the marathon of this series and it started to be agonizing when I watched it go. From the fictitious development of historical elements to the terrible O'Herliah accent in later episodes, the show just declines. If you are looking for a poor performance of generalized WW2 fluff, then I could recommend season 1 but avoid anything after degenerating in one step from soap opera with ever worse storylines and sensitivities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The old black and white film is by far the best of any form of entertainment called Colditze that is attached to it, and it is not even possible.
