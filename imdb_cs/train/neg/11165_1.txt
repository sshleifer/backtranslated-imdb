I mean, really ... I either suddenly lost a sense of humor or it's really a bad movie. It's silly, ridiculous and just not fun at ALL. Because I saw a preview, I knew it would not be a great movie, I just did not think it would be so bad. What happened to the good old days when you could find some clever fun lines for each movie? When actors did not have to play ridiculous roles in an attempt to be funny? Now we find ourselves in films like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I could not find funny parts! <br /> <br /> Just skip this waste <br /> <br /> PS (Sorry for my English)
