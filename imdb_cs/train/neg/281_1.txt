Crazy, just terrible. It proves my theory of "stellar power". It's supposed to be a great TV because the one who directed the Battlestar Titanica is the same guy who drives this shit schtock schtick for a cat. B O R I N G. <br /> <br /> Find a thousand times more interesting - for example, watch TV without a picture and no sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high b / c in the IMDb.com rating there are no negative results.) <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My Theories of "Star Force" is: the more "star powers" in the show, the weaker the show. (It is an indirect proportionality: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" means better quality, etc. Another way to look at it is "more is less") <br /> <br />
