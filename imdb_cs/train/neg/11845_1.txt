... is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be certain: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst relieves her role as a silent movie star, Marion Davies, as if she thought she was "legally blonde". The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst exaggerated to where you want to get to the screen and slap him. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except that he plays Charlie Chaplin and is around, oh, 125 pounds too heavy for this part? It is hard to believe that this disturbing, uneven wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovic, but then again, he did not make an observable movie, eh? 30 years? Sometimes he just does not come back.
