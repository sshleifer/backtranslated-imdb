I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I came out of this. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit it might have something to do with two middle-aged white women at the back of the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh, no, Jamie knocks on the door! HEE HEE HEE!") But ... it was just so incredibly annoying. There was no camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle ... everything had to be on the face, loud and annoying. The thief was trying to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point it's just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. You've seen too many rows of all the characters, too much you've heard, and too many "hard guys" ... and I really do not mind if there's a bit of originality. In fact, the entire supporting role is quite under suspicion. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx and I think it's really fun and I thought it was fun in this movie ... but it's not quite funny to hold on to everything else. <br /> <br /> This film needed less shooting, less annoying camera shots, more emotions, more feelings and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him 2.
