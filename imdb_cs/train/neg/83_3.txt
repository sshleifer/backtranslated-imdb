Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive, pretty woman who is thrilled by a teenage intelligent daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a small two-man husband Sean (Rick Roberts), both incredibly self-confident and uncomfortable. This was promoted as a rogue family, which was chased by a crazy killer during an inexorable storm. <br /> <br /> The storm does not even happen for the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then there is nothing to send someone to run into the storm. Straking is also not intense until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we spend while listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter, Liv, says I want to just return my daughter next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv is that Zack, a boy of dubious nature, is constantly talking - in fact, Jill returns home and finds them on Liv's bed. The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean either laugh at Jill or criticize her. Sean was not at all appealing - because his face is so freckled that you could play dots. <br /> <br /> The story begins by telling Jill about an extraordinary account on her credit card behind a hotel that she never was, and that she thought that Sean had never been. to the hotel where he meets the owner and manager Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man who judges her. In fact, when he discovers his husband again, Jill calls and turns her off. Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She's upset, she leaves without Sean seeing her, and nothing at all. In fact, he will not even tell Sean when he comes home. That makes no sense to me. Jill gave Richard a business card, so she calls her and she's obviously real estate. It shows an apartment. Then they have a drink and things become cozy among themselves. Richard and Jill get to it, hot and heavy. In fact, it seems a little more aggressive than necessary when Jill suddenly decides to disable. Jill and Sean face a confrontation with his cheating. Sean whines as Jill has refused him since her father died. Obviously, his error is any morality. Eventually Jill confesses his own morale and almost adultery to Sean - and of course that's all her fault with Sean. A small family decides to go on a camping trip - which means more whining and grousing between them, especially from a broken daughter. I was so rooted for the stalker to get all but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
