A cowboy sympathetic to the misfortune of the surrounding Indian tribe is wrongly accused of raping and killing the daughter of the boss, leading to hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This boredom crackpot feature is funny to impossible to defend at any artistic level. Wonderful costumes and the fact that all Indians are apparently white, it looks more like a live cartoon action than a serious production that pretends to print. Handy nudity (the real reason for watching this) is good. Everything else is not. There are certainly better examples of both genres. What's more interesting is that Ramrodder was filmed on the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and does not include one but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who were probably already in a can for murder at the time they hit the Pussycat Theater screens, !
