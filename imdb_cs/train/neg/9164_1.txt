I have to prevent this by saying that I am a huge romantic. That's why I really wanted to like this movie. So I write my thoughts to save you from the disappointment I was looking at. Leap Years tells a story full of fates about Li-Ann, who falls for a decent Jeremy and pledges to meet each jump year. A very romantic premise, based on a big story and cast that does not feel you're watching another Jack Neo Flick. So why is it so bad? First of all, I feel that the creators thought shooting a music video because they chose to replace narrative stories and all true emotions with brown mounts, predictable actions and clich√©s. I'm so upset that I was one of the first in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our mocking moanings at stunning performances spoke tremendously. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that surpassed Forever Fever, the best ever romantic comedy in Singapore, and The Leap Years did not even make it. Some blogs call The Crap Years, which are harsh but ultimately true. Do not waste money or your emotions like me. The film will bring you to love forever.
