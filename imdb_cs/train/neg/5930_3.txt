Hey, if you're going to make a film about Leonardo Cohen, try it with Leonardo Cohen! It is enough for Leonard to make the audience angry, who lets himself think, why they listen to all the other singers (some of them are questionable) speaks about themselves. Puleez ... sound like those who revive the diary at junior age - who cares about you, and what about Leonard? Guess what people, if you "do something" worthy, maybe someone will create a document about you. I found a particularly insulting view of U2 members as if it added credibility to this movie - NOT. Leonard does not need Bono or Edge to talk about his spirituality. It would be nice if the filmmakers created a bit of their spirituality in the film. Gee, what a concept! I'm giving the props to Ruf Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their Cohen melodies - the rest of the performance was boring and some were unbearable. Fans of Cohen, do not say I did not inform you!
