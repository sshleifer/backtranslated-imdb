"ASTONISHING" Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They had to rely on the fact that such apologetic crap was sometimes released. The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease that makes them become cannibals and murder innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin separates all over the film, we also see cut legs, heads, etc. That are as convincing as the set of Halloween Fuzzy Felt. There is a lot of talking people, a little human kitchen and some strange hunter zombie hunters who trapped a sufferer of skin disease in their wardrobe, strapped to a chair before they stabbed them in the head and cut them into bits ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. Since there is no talent at all, and the gore is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the reason for this whole thing? Again when looking at the video box, one who is responsible for it is "an underground cult". Would it be like strange religious cultures where brainwaves make you think of one way when the opposite is true? Because that's the only possible reason why I think someone gets the pleasure of watching this tax write-off. Then, in the same paragraph, he compares with Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA to stop it. Now you're just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of that cult. Will you pay wages? Do you see other family members? They're forced to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director of A.Hitchcock? Say ... it sounds like a special beer Panorama for me. And greet LA criticism when you go back to your colony, right? 0/10
