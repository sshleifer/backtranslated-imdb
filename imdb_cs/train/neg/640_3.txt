Chilly, alienated the adaptation of Rebeka West's book about the captain of the army who returned to memory duty with World War II (now an original idea!). She seems to remember the old flame of Glendy Jackson, but not to the current wife of Julia Christie, which should be enough to let go of some emotional sparks. This extremely well-written violinist joins director Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and teammates of Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but all the burners are at a low level. There are a handful of good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges's stimulation is incredibly slow and the color of the film is disturbing. For a long time on the shelf, this "soldier" is best forgotten. * 1/2 from ****
