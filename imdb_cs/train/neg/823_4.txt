First, it takes about half an hour for Hackman to get out of prison and work. What is a waste of time, we all know that Hackman claims to be working for his masters, why lose almost a third of the film on these sequences. Then Hackman stays at the hotel, and the story of the arc does not go anywhere, simply by showing us that Hackman is under surveillance and everything he says or does is known to masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more unnecessary time showing a meeting with his wife. All this should take at most 10-15 minutes simply as setting for real action, intrigue, and plot. By the time the real action starts, I was so bored that I wanted the movie to end. Hackman is as good as usual and the other actors, but this is a first-mad fool.
