I'm sorry, I miss something? did I leave early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue) stories made me wonder, "It's going to be a classic!" The acting was great, because it's worth the fact that William H Macy is fantastic and he just improves and improves every movie I'm watching. But he never seemed to be joining. I was waiting for the great moment when all the stories intertwine and then suddenly ... the frogs suffer? it was when the writer said, "I'm deep how I can pull all these stories together cleverly ... Oh, that's just gonna be raining jugs." I like smart movies, I like strange movies, but this was just strange and boring. 4/10
