The main complaint of this film is the fact that I can not tell who is who. No racism meant, but these Asians look the same! I can tell the story a bit, but it's as far as it goes. Human identities are no secret if they are a mystery to care for. Instead, I was not on the screen as fast as possible. <br /> <br /> This film is a wide shot and silent without the emotions of the face. Damn it is boring, I not only know these people, but they just sit there. The production is typical of Chinese John Woo, a terrible video with rendered scenes. It looks little better than "Fulltime Killer" Andy Lau (which was a great movie). Do you think that with a reasonable budget they could at least look like the 90s in Hollywood. I did not know the Chinese had these arts.
