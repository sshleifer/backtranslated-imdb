This direct to the video is another nail in Rick Moranis's casual career. Just like Disney's tradition, quality is sacrificed on behalf of fast cash; this is a lazy protector with Moranis, who has accidentally shrunk and a few relatives to be able to repeat all the best scenes from the original film. Immediately dated visual effects and disturbing dialogue are delicious in this ladle, which has done nothing but making pine trees for the days of an "Incredibly diminishing man" when this has happened right. Shocking is the lead of Dean Cundey, a top-rated cameraman, who should keep up the day's work or improve the material next time.
