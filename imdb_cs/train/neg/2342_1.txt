I do not know what would be so great in this movie. Worse yet, why would anyone have to look at this? There is no story at first. It could be said that even without a story the film could be watched because it produces a strong feeling (laughter, plague, fear, ...), but in my opinion it does not do this movie either. <br /> <br /> You are watching the slides for +/- 2 hours. There are even more useful things. <br /> <br /> I think you could say that the movie is an experiment and it is courageous because it lacks everything that is mentioned above. But is it 2 hours of precious time and 7 EUR of your money? For me the answer is: no.
