It was just terrible. I read this book for school, I did the As on all exams and I saw it like this! My teacher forced me to watch him, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 of the Universe, and Hudson Hawk. The thing that caused this movie to be so terrible was a good reason why you wanted to kill yourself. First it was done on Hallmark. Secondly, acting was terrible. Third, it was completely different from the book. It was literally so bad, I asked myself to be excused. Basically, I'd rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch it. Take advice, do not watch this movie. No one would want to watch it. It was awful. GRAPES!
