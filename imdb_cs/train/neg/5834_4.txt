I was looking at the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and House, M.D .. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially careless, similar to Lauriin character House but without the acaric joke Laurie brings to the house. Meanwhile, Tucci's "direct guy", emphatic Dr. Seger, has not developed into a more interesting position, such as Cuddy and Wilson, the boys. India Varma's character Adrienne Holland is too similar to Jennifer Morrison Doctor Cameron to be a co-incidence. Someone in CBS apparently noticed the success of the house, MD and told his staff to have him (her) a similar show, hoping the mimics would be successful. Copying a House show requires the same balance between joke and high-tension, and Tucci and the company just do not meet the challenge. I did not know that the show was canceled until there were a few comments on IMDb, but I'm not surprised.
