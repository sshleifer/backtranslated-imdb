I have no idea what the Shield producers were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The shield is practically impregnable. The alleged performances on the shield are great ... <br /> <br /> The show is so badly connected that you can not even see the performances. For example, editing is cut off from the reaction shots before they have their full impact. I do not know why it's intellectual logic, but it excludes it from showing all the emotional impacts. <br /> <br /> I will shield one point for ambition in his subject, but that's almost all I can give. <br /> <br /> It is a pity to see a number of talented artists lose their gift on something so strangely wrongly shot.
