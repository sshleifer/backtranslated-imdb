Want to see the movie "Gamers" Dead Gentlemen Productions. That's not the movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All good notes here seem to be written (badly masked) by fake third parties. The people who shot this movie seem to be trying to synthesize false interest. This film is not a well-done surgeon. Comparison with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest is insulting. The film is so bad that I can not imagine anyone who is familiar with the subject would find it fun. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the ones that are lampooned in this way, you will have to hate yourself to get it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of its great satirical taboo themes, but because of its constant pathetic banality.
