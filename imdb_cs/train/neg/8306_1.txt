ET obsession with Dannielynn Smith is scorn. Leave the child alone. With all due care, he will most likely grow up with a psychotic, depressed, or worse. Think about Princess Diana and how she longs for privacy. Now the poor little rich girl Ashley Olson wants to be alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became deserted and said, "I want to be alone". How much ET does this little girl do? Does ET have any better reporting? I bet there are a lot of people who really do not care what colors their birthday cake and balloons are. By the way, I never heard that Anna Nichole had never won any of those court cases over will and inheritance. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard, and Little Dannielyn? Can it be an ET?
