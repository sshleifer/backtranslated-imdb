Efforts aside (This is not a review of good intentions, its final product), this film is badly written, overstated and misdirected. The story apparently had the potential, but the story is not in this movie anywhere. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and doubt, just as we all did. You would never know it from this act of acting actress. In fact, it is true for every figure in the movie, but in the case of Barton: each sentence is a speech. Epos above the upper tongue, as if from an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well at one board meeting and I realized it because it does! Every idea he has is incredible in his context and comes up with ideas that sound like experiencing the search for the soul on the spot. For example, seeing an injured man will begin to pontificate the needs of the battlefield and protect soldiers and build white flags, etc. As in the movie, there is no way he could come up with such a detailed, well-thought-out idea in seconds. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film refutes Clar Barton from her struggles. It gets rid of her humanity and in fact reduces everything she has done because the script is written in clich√©. Writer Clary Barton does not know and seems to have based her script on the Encyclopedia Britannica. (yes, they had you then) But hey, pretty Technicolor! (who cares)
