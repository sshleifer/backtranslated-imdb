The direction clearly stated that this film is an idea and the plot is absolutely original .... however, with regard to those who read the "slam dunk" comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <br /> <br /> Another note is Jay Chow himself Do not you know, Kung Fu, it just will not impress anyone if they try to act as it can, many people today see the differences .. Fortunately, the film does not contain much of the KunG battles Fu and many are overwhelmed by stunning and visual effects ... I think Jay's acting is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the movie is much better. The only reason why I think why Jay is the main actor is simply for his popularity. Despite how much I'd like to stop someone watching, and so this "original" movie got to be, it has become one of the world's best movies for this year.
