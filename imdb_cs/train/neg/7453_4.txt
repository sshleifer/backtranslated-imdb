Amazing actors. <br /> <br /> A poor scenario and not a big deal. My main problem was that I simply did not care about any of these people. Not a murderer, not a victim. The setting was quite unusual. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly written, I did not even care when the end came. He got the baby back. Big deal! I wanted to return the money.
