An anemic comedy-drama, an unhappy, seemingly rushed affair representing Cher as a horrified housewife who slowly becomes a friend of a man who was hired to kill her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as a spokesman for a rental gun, edited the scenario from his own game, with horrifying settings and back and back dialing, which quickly accelerates his eye and ear. Throughout the project there is a dark atmosphere, and director Paul Mazursky can not get Cher out of her eternal role (she is undoubtedly). In spite of all the top talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is fraudulent, storyless and characters that rarely come alive. * 1/2 from ****
