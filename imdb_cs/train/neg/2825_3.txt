This week I thought it would be fun to catch up with Corey Haim just when they saw two Lost Boys movies last week. Not that I'm a fan - not by far - but in those films I liked the Coreys in those early teens. So I got ready to play three movies. Unfortunately, I was the first one (she had never seen before) and it was so terrible, I just decided to lock Corey back into his closet and have it cut off again before I get caught up in something else. But I managed to fight this movie first. I had the impression that he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), but he got into his own delusions. Virtually the entire movie wants to be a comedy, and in the end it is hopelessly trying to be a thriller. The only good thing about a "Dream Machine" is a prerequisite: Dead body in Porsche's trunk. Everyone else fails so badly, it's embarrassing. And even for Haim. I can dig him like his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he comes with some form of overhead instructions. This, of course, was not the case with the "Dream Machine". So we have a perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde girl who has no lines in the movie. Perfect murder ... almost? A bastard who falls on his ass like a movie villain, tries to steal his body back from his trunk, never really succeeds, and then thinks at the end of the film he's Michael Myers (minus the white William Shatner's mask) and missing Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Do not think they could do it if they tried. A stupid, unfortunate film with a story that leads nowhere under the direction of a director who can not manage his cast. Great Performance! <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: Who has the idea to smile directly into the camera in the last film of the movie? Your or director? So it's not done.
