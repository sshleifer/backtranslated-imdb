Stefan is an x-con who married Mary five years ago. Their marriage was stable until Stefan came to them and offered him to do courier work. Stefano's job is the supply of heroin from Germany to Sweden, which should be easy. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a Bosnian girl who has been sold to the stripclub owner. Stefan hates what she sees and decides to help Elli out of her misery. Given that Elli's father fled to Sweden during the war, Elli now goes to Sweden with Stephen. To keep up with the past, Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally, in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be much more complicated than Stefan thought. <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to fit into a regular Swedish film because of the fact that it has been much Americanized. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist do it on average, the effects make it a bit too much. Look at it and yugde for yourself. <br /> <br />
