I have been watching this film several times, and I can say that it is a low budget and that it has nothing to do with facts about history. The performance of the actors is very poor, but is the result of limited game play. Everyone who watched this movie probably thinks of Hitler as a crazy silly fool who ran with a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that in those years, much better movies are about Hitler and Germany, and that the rise of evil is far below average. I can recommend the German film Downfall, in which you can see the brilliant performance of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganza as Adolf Hitler.
