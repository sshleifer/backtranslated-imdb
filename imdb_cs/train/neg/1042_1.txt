First write down the napkin script. Who needs more than that? After all, we're not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then get amateur actors. It will be good for the humor of the festival. After all, who needs people who spent years honing their crafts? Then he hires a cameraman who does not know how to light up. You see, if it is well lit, it will not look "real" and the festival will not be popular with people. Who needs professional photography? Then you hire a ten-year-old who never had a camera to be your operator. It will give your film a completely amateur impression that festival screeners will be missing out on "reality" and will guarantee that even if you empty space from real people, critics and a small stream of viewers who over-intellectualize will scream "genius" because they will not believe that it was just an amateur hour. Once you've done that, buy a ticket to Sundance's bad film festival. sad waste.
