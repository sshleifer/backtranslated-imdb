I remember my parents did not understand Saturday nights alive when I was 15. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I approach their age, I still remember and find out that I understand many things that love my children. But that's pathetic. I can not say I did not see Sarah, except for some performances here and there. It was reasonable. I do not see it as strange. But this show is so far below what I expect from it. The IMDb record sounded like a potential. So that's why I started watching the first episode. I turned it half way. Anything else is better than that. Jokes that are designed for five years, introduced to the anticipated adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is shifted to turn you away. I just can not believe anyone really financed this insult to a comedy. Just a good thing I can say is that there are lots of bad jokes that saved another show from such embarrassment.
