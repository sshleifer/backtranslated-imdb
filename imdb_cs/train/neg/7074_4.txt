My God this movie is terribly boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon when I made the film, I was waiting for a romantic drama and some great performance from Gershon. Gershon is as good as ever, but she is not the right actress for this role, she is too good for Rade Serbedzija. Romance between the characters of Gershon and Serbedzi is too unconvincing. And I absolutely hated Serbedzij's character (the organizer of the winners) in the film is not charming. As Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) is out of my mind. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would do a better job in this role but do not have a European look. Anyway, I was so boring that I was filming a movie. If you're looking for a good movie by Gin Gerson, check out Bound, her best movie. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and older men, try some of Harrison Ford or Sean Connery's films. Gina Gershon is undervalued and deserves a better chance than I want her to decide better in the future.
