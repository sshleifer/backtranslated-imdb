I grew up on the theatrical version of "Superman II" ("S2T") and as a child I loved it more than Part I, since not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman criminals, did it start with bang? ? the best transformation of Clark Kent and Superman and rescue scenes. The children were eager to wait for Superman to appear on the screen as in Part I. Now as an adult, I see how powerful they have been with S2T. I've always heard about the story of how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original Director Richard Donner of Part II. (It was a rarity when two separate films were recorded at the same time, now it is common: "Return to the Future" and "Matrix" 2 and 3). Unfortunately, after finally seeing Richard Donner Cut (or "S2RD") I still can not fully recommend it. Gone, it was a great change to the Superman scene, the whole rescue of Paris, as well as the wonderful recapitulation of Part I when opening S2T. In fact, everyone wrote the words: "Earlier on Superman?" in S2RD. The special effects were not great either in Part I or S2T, but S2RD was mostly ridiculous. such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window. I admit that some of the new scenes worked and some of them realized they were leaving, like every scene in a "honeymoon suite." Overall, if you grew up on S2T like me and loved it like a child? not what I'm doing as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD, because it's almost a brand new child experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: the strange amusement kiss from S2T was gone too, with the exact same end as "I." It's not just a lazy, non-original blackmailer, it makes no sense why Clark will come back to this dinner if these events never happened. And will it continue to "avert the time" for each confrontation?
