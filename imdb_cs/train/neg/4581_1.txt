Crazy attempt to use science to justify the new age of religion / philosophy. They both have nothing in common, and much of what is said about quantum physics in this disorder is simply wrong. Examples? Quantum theory supports thoughts in Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. As? Well, in the world of the subatom, you can not predict particle placement at a certain time. You can just give it a chance to be in one place at a time. The observation act seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All this is still accurate. But then he says it means that if you honestly believe you can walk through the wall, you can really do it. This is a complete poppycock. Instead, the theory claims that at our level it is possible to pass through the wall, but it is just a coincidence and has nothing to do with faith. You will also have to continue to enter the wall so that eternity sometimes has the happiest chance to pass through the wall, are against it astronomically against. <br /> <br /> This is one example of how it distorts science. Even more annoying is the story of the unfortunate photographer Marlee Maitlan plays. About half the picture is so confused that it is incomprehensible. Something in common with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-esteem. It may be true, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Plus, string theory is nowadays the latest innovation in physics. Instead of hurling the time with this jump, I suggest you rent Elegant Universe, an amazing series for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and the gravity of Ed Witten and M Theory in just three hour episodes. Quantum mechanics explained them quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
