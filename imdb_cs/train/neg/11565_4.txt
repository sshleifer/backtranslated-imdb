So far after two weeks of "Lonely Beauty" I'm a little disappointed. Some of the acting is good, except that it's just a drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAM is a "covert" coverage of "Thatcher's" years - it's all right as a drama, but I think the award-winning book is getting much better. > I wonder if the BBC ever went on with us and another part of the drama and the years that follow on "Things can only be improved" by completing 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with this promise from the government that is full of sorrow.
