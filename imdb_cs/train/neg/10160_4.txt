Typical Lanza intervention, which had a limited attractiveness for audiences, with a faint story that was set up just to justify Lanza's MGM at that time. As stated by member Lastliberal (above), Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene progress toward her off (and sometimes even) camera. Moreover, his steadfast manners and the constant smell of alcohol in his face during the scenes they led together were intolerable. After filming the second (and last) movie "Toast of New Orleans," Normally silent Grayson rushed into Louie B. Mayer's office and told him that she would never work with Lanza? time. Mayer felt Grayson was more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so Grayson's statement remained. Grayson continued to play in many widely accepted (and much better) musicals with Howard Keil and others. Later in her life when she was asked to compare with Lanz and Keel, she said there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was great and worked a lot more with "real people" in the audience.
