I agree with another reviewer who was pleased that "For The Birds" won Oscar in 2002 for "Best Animated Short", not the sick material that is at best the best and attracts anyone, of course, who does not have faith in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> Animation was good, but a lot of animated shorts. And by the way, I like dark humor, but this was just uncomfortable from the start. As for the story: a guy who walks and is just surrounded by gray (symbolism here) is a television set (which appears every few hundred meters) that is in heaven, hell or purgatory. Every time he puts his gun on his head and shoots after the message. I think it would be fun in two of the three cases.
