First watched 8/26/2001 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Haunted, yet sadistic (meaningful) portrait of a relative Mars De Sade, who carries out the same sadistic acts and looks forward to being his predecessor. This film, Tobe Hooper, does not really work quite different from his similar Freddy Krueger films with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a double role (Marquis De Sade and his relative). It seems to me that he really wants to baptize Christianity, but he eventually loses it, eventually to my disappointment, but leaves an incoherent sense of the film. It could be much worse if excesses were done in sex and violence, but it is trying to keep it minimal, despite some disgusting scenes. My last thought is why Hooper wanted to make this film. Of course, it took to really get into the distribution, and that's why it must be horrifically proclaimed and called Hooper in the title to hope it will make some money for his name and his gore. Obviously, it does not work.
