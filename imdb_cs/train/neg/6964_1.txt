I usually look at the MTV movie and look at the humorous, fun show that brings a unique award (Chewbacca, for example, won a prize for lifelong success). So this year was not different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott was always funny - dumb albums - to me. I laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie films and even enjoyed it in Dude Where's My Car ?. But the MTV films were just horrible. Nothing was cohesive, humorous or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should keep singing and dancing; he certainly can not act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious who the writers are for this show. Last year's performance of Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely fun (only the parody of the Lord of the Rings is worth watching the show), but this year was quite different. Has anyone seen Timberlake's comments on Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're in the movie together but never met, here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just entered their poor dialogue and never mentioned Timberlake's "joke". And Seann was totally useless as a talent without forcing me to smile, and yet I laughed at myself. And what was the reason for Harrison Ford's unicorns? Was anyone for anyone? Perhaps MTV writers have realized that young audiences will know an aging Ford like Han Solo, Indiana Jones or President Air Force One. I'm confused. And will anyone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this boy and how much he thinks he is? That guy looks 30, trying to act again 19 ... go out, show some class (like in your best acting academy) and act your age! I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of Gollum's speech for the best visual performance. This was very creative, very well done and caused the only real laughter of the whole evening.
