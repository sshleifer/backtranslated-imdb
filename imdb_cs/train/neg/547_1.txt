The entire movie name is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race that no one can ever win, but you can certainly reduce the loss without unnecessarily unnecessarily unnecessarily exhausting. This movie was awkward and manipulative, and the K3G looked sincere. This dignity dragged me too far. He was ridiculously stupid in his act and deserves to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it. Stupid, useless, with the absurd performance of OTT by Amitji. The central "conspiracy" is another unpleasant example of gross manipulative propaganda that infects so many "family" BW films. If my father, who raised me and loved dearly, treated me like Bigem Akshay, I would shoot him myself. Not to talk about trivialization of the ultimate illness.
