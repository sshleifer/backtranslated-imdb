I'm a fan of the series and I read all 7 books. I wanted to see it just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who should watch this are those who have read and are curious about this series. It is quite bad and will read you from you. It would not mean it, but Lucy is so ugly that it reduces the movie. Was she the daughter of the directors? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers were jealous in the movie. It had overtaking that would prevent any bob. The film loses so much translation. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein LOTR, or even Harry Potter. One thing they did right! Aslan! very good. Though other human faces with bearded faces (beaver, wolf) look stupid, Aslan was really good because it was not just a human actor. (I think it's like an old horse custume? 2 people inside?) I would also be curious what the kids think about this movie. Maybe they would enjoy it? But as for adults, a certain bet is a habit, even if it is a fan of CS.
