This DVD looks like it's aimed at someone who just puts it and plays in an endless loop in the background. It is arranged as a series of music videos from the Grand Canyon, which are designed for various compositions of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD music is boring and the transmission on DVD looks rather blurry and dull. Too expensive a DVD for what it is.
