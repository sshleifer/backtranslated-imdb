This is a review guide, it should not be confused with The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The Guide is a movie from the late eighties about the capability of a truly silent boy to play video games and walk through the entire opening credits. Wiz is an unnecessary updating of the Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is the guy who joined 100 straws together and had some curly drink. out of the way, let me say this: there really is no reason to see this movie. It's simply a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to lead to Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the smartest sense because it seems that this movie was written over the crack weekend by a team of people never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with a less meaningful style than my grandmother. Perhaps if the writer and the director sat down and actually played together, they realized they were about to shoot full waste and instead went to a vocational school to learn how to install stereos. <br /> <br /> I hope this was enlightening for you. It certainly was not for me. In fact, I think I lost some stories when I watched this movie and wrote about it. The next time you're in the video store and you see that the Wiz, Guide and Guide from Oz all sit on a shelf in a nice little row, give them to all the ladies and play Duck Hunt instead.
