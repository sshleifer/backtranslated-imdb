If you are not an evangelical Christian, then he will become Egyptian and avoid him as a biblical blow. Amazing - why oh why IMDb has the most favorable reviews at the top of the list - it was because of one of the fact that I just lost the end of what started out as a good evening on this grimace. The plot premise began to be so strong - I was filmed and I was interested in the point where the biblical sermon was preached. What waste. <br /> <br /> This movie made me so angry that I first registered IMDb just to complain - at least I hope to save someone else that way. /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act from my side ;-)
