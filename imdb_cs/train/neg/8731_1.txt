lowest possible score is one star? It is a pity. I will really lobby IMDb for the "zero star" option. to make this movie even one star too much. Am I the only one who noticed the microphones hanging over the station's station head? and acting, or should I say there is a lack? seeming talent was not a factor when the Casting Director came to town. my little sister is an elementary school talent show providing a greater range and depth of emotions. and the fake Irish accents were like nails on the chalk board. the only thing that would worsen this movie would be ... oh, wait, no, no, it's as bad as it can be.
