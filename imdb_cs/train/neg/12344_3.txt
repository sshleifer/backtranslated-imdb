A scary comedy, a sketch-like revue that was originally a vehicle of a one-time radio star Jack Pearl, but is now best remembered as an American introduction to The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are billed along with comedy Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his three Stoogas. Although Jimmy Durante (who is completely scared on muted material) and ZaSu Pitts are supported, the only viewers of this film are Stoog-addicts today, and they have not even found much to applaud. Incredibly loud and sharp, it shows how far Hollywood had to go to achieve a degree of sophistication. * 1/2 from ****
