I think the show had a pretty good idea to work with. But the execution was bad. The script is bad and it is wrong. There were many questions that could be better portrayed, such as protesting against homosexual marriage or finding a cemetery. The show can not be properly called a comedy show because it lacks a sad humor. I should say that this show was barely successful when it brought the Muslim community to a certain extent. By then, the second season is worse than the first. I had hope for this show, but I was a little disappointed. I still appreciate CBC for showing such a concept to the audience. Anyway, I wish good luck in the future.
