Okay, well, I rented the movie when I was bed-painted and allowed me to say that the film did not help at all. The film is about a man who buys a car when he goes through the middle age crisis, loves the car more than anything else around him, one day his wife chooses to rent a car. Because I do not want to ruin (not that something is ruined), I let your fantasy read "Zany" (and this word I use lightly) that follow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < the movie was printed. <br /> <br /> Then I could be wrong again ...
