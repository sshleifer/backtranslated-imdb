This movie was so badly written, and I went to sleep for 30 minutes. Jokes in the movie are furious, and although the plot is interesting from some angles, it is too good and at some points ridiculous. If you are 11 years old or older, you will overlook the font in the movie and you will be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger, it is a movie that captures your attention and surprises you with all the stunts (which I can add, are badly done) he was a warrior. Casting in this movie was not very good and the music was very disappointing, because it was like trying to build tension, but that did not answer at all. On the scale of 1-10 (10 is excellent, 1 is horrible), the acting in this movie is 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of film, in some more serious scenes, her acting ridiculous. When she did some of her "fighting" poses, I began to laugh loudly. I think the worst part of this film is definitely directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person that the evil villain has, how her voice becomes dark and evil, I think it was incredibly stupid and how Wendy Teachers Brenda Song) were all her teachers in the school obsessed with the monks, which was quite ridiculous. So it's all, disappointing the movie, but fine if you're 10 or less.
