Investigating reporter Darren McGavin (like Carl Kolchak) is back; this time is after "The Night Strangler". Again, police officers and fellow journalists either do not believe or want to obscure a supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his previous "Night", of course less successful. <br /> <br /> Curtis builds fun supporting cast, including Dark Shadows alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (like Louise Harper) leads a sexy collection of belly dancers. And although I have never seen it, it was Roger Davis as a companion of Mr. McGavin in the early stage, pretending to be a virgin in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
