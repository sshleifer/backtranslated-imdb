The only reason why "Norliss Tapes" deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. In addition to watching Angie Baby in a pre-police woman, there is nothing else to see. <br /> <br /> SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINOR SPOILERS ** David Norliss is trying to write a book about a supernatural person. One day he mysteriously disappears after calling his publisher and suggests he has come across something that has placed him in a deadly danger. The whole series for which this unfortunate pilot was written was obviously intended as a series of obstacles through the Norliss tapes - a collection of sound cassettes that the writer had recorded in the investigation of supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a rich sculptor dies - but not before buying an ancient Egyptian charismatic ring from a local occultist who assures him that the bauble will give him immortality after death. Soon we will find that the ring itself does not allow immortality. Instead, he only recovers the sculptor's corpse and lets him escape from his crypt to run through the city and exhaust the handsome girls of all of his blood. <br /> <br /> Blue faces, yellow eyes, and wailing from ARRHHHHHH, You heard when you last watched Scooby Doo cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. Runaway and through mutual acquaintance, Norliss will be helped to solve the mystery that she brought to her late re-birth of her late husband. So is this guy a vampire? No. This story is not a vampire, despite what you read or heard. The sculptor does not deny the blood of his victims - he collects it. As? I do not know. We only see that he is attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of his offer of immortality. It turned out that the restored sculptor would be allowed to live forever only if he built a statue of a daemon called Sargoth in life, a mixture of clays and human blood. When it is over, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue and use it as a gateway to our world. Final analysis: "Norliss tapes" were not picked up as a series for a very good reason ... it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a miserable, ill-conceived mess. Negotiations and dialogue are not better. This is not even a bidder for the "So bad is good" award. Sometimes bad is just bad. After years of hearing the underground rumblings of great merits "The Norliss Tapes" I was very excited to discover that she was broadcasting on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I did not fall. When I first spoke with this auspices for the first time two days ago, I can only take the applause you've heard from other IMDB reviewers. coming from those who show show based on dark memories and youth nostalgia. Or maybe they are just loyal Dan Curtis fans. Either way, they offered you misleading reviews "The Norliss Tapes." <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
