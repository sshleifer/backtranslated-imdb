Thunderbirds (2004) Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Cast: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2? 1! Thunderbirds GO! <br /> <br /> And so started Thunderbirds, my favorite child. When I heard they were about to shoot a Thunderbirds movie, I was ecstatic. I could not wait to see Thunderbird 2 to save people while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into "you get an idea I just could not wait Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released The critics have shifted but still I was going to go in. After all, while the heart was in the same place, it was all important to me, so I sat down in the theater, the only teenager in the crowd 50? Everybody else was over thirty and less than ten. (the one to be the forerunner) focuses on Alice Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family, who spends days wishing he can save people like the rest of his family but is too young. the chance that The Hood (Ben Kingsley) captures the rest of his family on Thunderbird 5. This means that he has to overcome The Hood followers and save his family at the time of Hood m Can you steal all the money from the Bank of England Trust me, the story sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. Once you get to the movie? What mess we have in our hands. First, the film was designed for children, just like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us drawings that were relatively advanced for children's programming. This, on the other hand, is a silly down plot as she tries to make himself ripoff Spy Kids permission. The ultimate product is a movie that tries to reach out to fans of the Thunderbirds and kids, and is totally missing. Love jokes, cartoon sounds, and stupid antiques, no-one really funny, are all over the film, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wishes he never did. <br /> <br /> He gave a solid performance, given that everyone was giving it. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood and played a great role. My only character complaint is about The Hood hackers, who are reduced to the remnants of the old Looney Tunes cartoons who are bothering, for it's incredibly enough, kids take them easy. The film is that when I was watching the movie, I enjoyed it. But once the lights turned on, I realized that the film was quite bad, that I was $ 8 lighter and that two hours of my time had gone. Wine pleasure? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds is a forgotten mess. Instead of a big "go", I will have to recommend that you keep from this movie. If the rest of the movie could be just like its first ten minutes, it would be an incredible movie worthy of the name of Thunderbirds. But we get a movie that just dies Thunderbird fans (if you want to watch your child's tears split) or it would have an extremely bored turn. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
