This program did not do me, even though I was a fan of this genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there was no scene that would not be dominated by the main character. That made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the program ended. I was hoping to leave my criticism here because I'm not a film critic, but the IMDb guidelines state that you have to put 10 lines of comments. Hudson Hawk reminded me of the way he is the main character in every scene, and I hope the writers of this program could employ some variety to engage in the audience. I have no doubt about the talent of any of the cast and crew, it's just that after watching things like "the wire" I expected great things out of political drama.
