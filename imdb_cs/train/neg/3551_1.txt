This movie is just terrible !!!! Slow action, slow access to the point, and wooden figures that simply should not have been there. The best part was the Iron Maiden show singing in some video in the theater and that's it. the end is worth watching and waiting, but it was! The characters in this movie almost fell asleep. Avoid!
