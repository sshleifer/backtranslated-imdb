Absolutely the worst film Burton, which seems to worsen with every movie he directs. The bad script-filled clich√© is only the first of many inappropriate aspects of this movie. This is the kind of movie where there's always something going on, you'll hear someone scream "he's lost his gun!" or what is it for everyone to know. Carter is really horrible and so is Wahlberg, who can not play it straight and be convincing. Very nice effects and photographs, but poor music in the format of John Williams from Burton's clever Elfman. Heston appears on an absurd scene to drill his most famous phrases from the first film. Very bad results. If anyone else saw "Sleepy Hollow" out there, he probably noticed how I got, the falling quality of Burton's films. I have heard that this particular project is produced by others and that Burton has been brought in as a director, and in that case his judgment should be called into question. But I think he allowed any possible vision he could have previously slipped into his career; Evidence is in movies. In Sleepy Hollow, he could not decide what movie he was doing, whether it was a comedy or a real horror film, and a British figure (Chris Lee, etc.) also made you think it was a monster rally movie scary, as horror fans know). The film could not have succeeded in either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and there was no style developed to enrich everyone together. "The Planet of Ape" is similar, and the result turns off as "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" rather than as a sci-fi. He also got into the routine of many other "big" directors who tried to satisfy the entire audience. Burton if you're out there - pick something up and do it straight, or use some style to put it all together (as in the case of "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you can also retire because people like me who are the fans of your movies, they stop walking.
