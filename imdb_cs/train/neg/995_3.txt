Rosario Dawson plays like a girl who is dating a rape, and then begins to get into the dark until she has a chance of vengeance. While it is clear why Dawson took on the role of her chances to show her actor's chops and create a small independent, certainly not Hollywood film, it is also clear that besides the stunning good looks, Dawson seems to have no place in the role. Forgive me for not finding her. It's not a mistake, so I felt I had no idea where it is. Yes, I know she's on the screen, but despite looking at her in two hours, nothing remains to happen to me. It seems to me that this scenario is different than the end, and that the whole thing that happened on the screen was far from having any sense. People seemed to be more posture than real, and what had happened did not seem to fit together. Forgive me for being unclear, but nothing out of this movie other than the end (which I would like to talk about, but it could not cause it to spoil it) and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing but painting remained with me. What I can say can touch you, maybe it's not, it's time for me not to come back. Only for fans of Rosario Dawson, although warned, there are several real reasons why it is NC17.
