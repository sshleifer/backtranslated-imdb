I saw it for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson, who thought they were cops. They are, but Busey is in the opening scene, then does not appear again until it's like 40 minutes into the movie. Although every scene in which it is, it is amazing. Especially when masked like a blind man. <br /> <br /> What's incredible with this movie is a plot. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who stalking and killing phone operators of sex. At one point, I think it's Busey. But it turned out I was only partially in order. Busey is not a murderer, but he phone and harass women over the phone. Why? I do not know. In no case is he associated with a killer, he just does it for kicks.
