2 stars of possible 10 - and that's too big. <br /> <br /> I thought with James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how he would be missing. I was wrong. I can only wonder what Sam Shepard was at the end of a week when he jumped out of the corner. I have long assumed that Sam S. is a nut species, this film, based on his game, confirms this. This is the kind of artistic b.s. that LOVE actors are diving, giving them the ability to endlessly emulate. However, for the viewer who sits in this senseless basket, it is absolutely NEVER to love this movie. <br /> <br /> You have not seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this game. Pa is crazy, Ma is crazy, his son is crazy and his daughter is, oh yeah, crazy. They also wear a mouth that tells words to make the sailor begin to blush, especially a teenage daughter. In addition to the above, as if it were not enough, the conspiracy-and it's so thin you could read it-has a hole in Alaska's size. She buys me to sell her abandoned farm. As it turned out, it's Pa. Now I'm not entitled to be a real estate expert, but when I last checked, ownership of the joint ownership must be signed by both owners to sell. If the owner owned only one, then the other could not legally sell, so it would be useless for that person. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, so his story does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that nothing else really works. <br /> <br /> The only reason someone might have to watch this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity and I can not imagine why anyone would want.
