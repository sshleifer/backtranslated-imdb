I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved Running Man. So I was obviously excited about someone making a movie. And when the local film showed the movie, I was in heaven. I was ready for fun! The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone shot Arnold Schwarzenegger. I could not simply believe that a man who was famous for movies full of runnin 'and' shootin 'could play much more, as described in the book. I was still convinced it would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? No, no. I soon found out that the only reason he was even occupied was that someone had written the whole story again to fight and shoot him. Yes, it was the standard film Arnold: The hero has become bad, the hero solves the problems by bending his mighty muscles and scaring all away and the hero gets the girl. I was amazed. That's not what the book said at all. I know books can not be displayed on the screen literally, but it has no relationship to the book. Stephen King should openly condemn any relationship to the film and forbid the use of the title The Running Man for this unfortunate film waste. I will not say this often, but this movie was BAD. If I had not been watching at home, I would have to throw tomatoes on the screen. Again: bad. (I notice that I used a lot of people, I did it because I'm sure a lot of people are ashamed of working on it, and I do not want to make them even more embarrassed by being named here)
