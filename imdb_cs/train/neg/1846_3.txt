Well, I'd like to be honest with all the audiences I bought because of Kira's sexual scenes, but unfortunately I did not see them very much. All sex scenes were short and random, along with all the strange and strange experiences like all the other B movies - just do not look like two people who have sex. There is a small piece of fence at the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Who !!! how shocking! Why do not we propose this film at the Oscars Award? I can not imagine how bad a movie would look if it was R-rated (The mine is imported from the UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Put it and release it, so you will not end up being like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
