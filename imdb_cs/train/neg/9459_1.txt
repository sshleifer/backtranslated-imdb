Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines summarize this filthy little film that can only attract idiot kids and their parents into the cinema. and his ... # 1 movie in America! What does this country mean? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese lady who slept in 3 minutes. A dumb plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham came out in 2005, I'll be so happy! (Not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are likely to play two housters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. She will try to persecute Sam-I-Am and the guy who is running away. (I hope it does not destroy the classic book.) Do not waste your time and money by seeing it.
