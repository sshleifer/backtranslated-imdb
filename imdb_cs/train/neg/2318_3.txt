Kid found as a child in garbage and raised at the Martial Arts Academy has talent for sinking baskets. With the help of a man who found him, he enters college and is promoted to a championship when he looks for his real parents. Endlessly better in action comedy pieces is a real mess as a whole. He seems to be seeking a hockey basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is scattered, her focus wanders more than Chihuahua with ADD on a four-time espresso. I still asked, "What am I following?". I looked at it from start to finish and I still do not know what the hell happened. It's a shame because there are some great action scenes, fun jokes and occasional moments, but nothing, none of them will ever meet, I would make a pass.
