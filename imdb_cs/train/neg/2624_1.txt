To say that this film smells would offend skunks. As the other commentator says, this film is offensive to anyone who is at the age of 7 (it's especially, incredibly offensive to gays). It's terrible - and not even in "so bad that it's funny" how - it's just terrible. No, I have to say: KEEP! (sorry skunks). <br /> <br /> From the initial credits to the final titles, it's a little more than 10 seconds of this movie that should open your eyes. "Drawing" is discontinuous, characterization does not exist, acting is above the superstition "look at me I am funny!" schools and so it goes on. The assemblies are clumsily set up (if any) and are badly executed, it's terrible on all fronts - except for music, I can not remember that the music smells (except songs). <br /> To be fair to the creators, they put the cards on the table quite quickly: the opening credits include the title "It also plays Ertha Kitta as Betty's voice" (because as the meteor never appears never say anything, but occasionally sounds a damp sound perhaps they picked up Mr. Kitt's contribution from one of her recordings) and the other line of the film is such: "... and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus." Uranus - "Your Anus" geddit? geddit? Yeah? huh ?? Your Anus? Humor is really so cheap. He talks about strange things about "comedians" at that time, for it was perfectly acceptable for a hero to deliberately shoot people dead on the street, but did not say "sh * t" aloud. I paid for selling this film fifty dollars (about $ 1.00). I feel ripped off.
