If you liked the first two movies, then I'm sorry you will not like it. This is really waste and unnecessary to the video, probably a TV sequel. Still idiot, but good scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of sculptures, Wayne is so stupid to erase his statue and his brother. Then he will relieve his wife and sister-in-law. Now adults have to find a way to get kids out of the house to get them bigger. Quite many repetitions of the other two with only one or two new things, such as a toy car roller coaster, swimming in the pool, etc. Pretty poor!
