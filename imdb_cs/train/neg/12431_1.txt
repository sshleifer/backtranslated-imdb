I would like to say that curiosity has gotten my best. If I only saw a trailer, I could tell you the whole plot of the film; I could save so much unnecessary hour and forty minutes of my life and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster, waiting for it to happen, and that's embarrassment in Hollywood. The film shows a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this child's remote control racing car goes all around, and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothing. Is it not reasonable to assume that remote broadcasting can no longer send signals under these circumstances? Of course, Hollywood did not believe it. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictate the opposite; I doubt the racing car could even reach the street, let alone the house over the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals have. Why is it in all these films, these criminals are rocket scientists until they hit the age of eight? A child should be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in the Matrix. Also the leader gives his real gun and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently failed to distinguish. Even with gloves, you should be able to do it. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there are other senses and sight. Traps are also unrealistic; if any of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But Hollywood intends to "laugh" at the "fun" trap results. I was not laughing; I sighed and rolled my eyes. But I recommend this film to everyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; The movie they've seen will look like Citizen Kane compared to this. Otherwise, skip this option for your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know stars Alex D. Linz in the movie, but did he also write it?
