Aaron Spelling produced this one produced for western television, which is horribly written on a seventy-three-minute film. He plays it as a probable unsuccessful pilot in the series. <br /> <br /> The handsome Clint Walker is American Marshal Dave Harmon, who travels to Yuma, Arizona Territory in time to kill one of the local farmer's bigwig, trail brothers. <br /> <br /> Walker takes his other brother to prison. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican child sleeping in prison. One night, Andres refuses when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother in the street and kill him and join the murder of Walker. Not good for your first twenty-four hours at work. Walker visits the local army's fortress and places commander strings. Bigwig hears about the deaths of his brothers and goes back to the city in time to get his chains. Local indigenous peoples, who have simply turned the army into beef, have also entered the chain. With all of these chains getting to a large extent, Walker still has time to follow the owner of the local hotel. The army guy who was involved in the murder ended up dead, the local livestock trader is involved, the Indians are very reluctant to express themselves, and the culmination is unlikely to be fought because Walker has to prove to the city that the brutish bounty buyer had a boss, someone we were about they suspected it was too useful at all times. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-subplotot involving the death of Walker's family in the hands of army robbers, and I think it would be a force for the series if it was picked up. Instead, the movie ends suddenly and I was waiting for an exciting episode next week's scenes. Because of fading for non-existent breaks, everything is fine and his story jumps into a seizure. Walker is handsome, harsh and has a voice deeper than a well. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you've probably seen in other television films. Much of the action is nice and violence is warm. The first brother killed got shotgun midtorso and fell on it without scratches. I did not expect it to be "Reservoir Dogs," but it's a bad movie that uses them to teach kids about evil weapons! When we talk about children, a Mexican child goes from "cute" to "harassing aneurysm" very quickly. If you do not like Westerns, you will not like "Yuma". If you like westerns, then you will still like "Yuma". I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not rated but contains physical violence and violent weapons. <br /> <br />
