I like small horrors. I do not care if the actors are acting or the monsters look furious. I like this movie, except for a feeling of confused feeling from the beginning of the movie to the end. Look, I do not need a 10-page dissertation or a capital letter to explain my conspiracy. But Dark Floors takes "what's this movie about?" thing to a completely new (annoying) level. What is this movie? It is not horrible or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to end up, feel frustrated and confused, rent this winner.
