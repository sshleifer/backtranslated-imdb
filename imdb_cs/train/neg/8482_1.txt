Some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie, but I have a chance only recently. I had the chance to see something interesting from Kamal Hans that I saw was a lot of angular cameras mixed at high speed. I do not understand what the message is except humiliating Hinduism. I am much more like many types of religion, but I felt that Kamal Hasan is a person of low character to orchestrate this idea. He could make a horror movie than this crap. He tried to complete the Hollywood genre of viruses, and let God have not changed that guy to a mutant, and eventually he is about world domination. This is a very suitable film for film school versus the general public. It's a pity on him that he does not hold his talent. The beginning of the story called for Chaos to borrow his thoughts from the Butterfly effect, then between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism. (Again I hated Hinduism more, but this film has no role and my insult is the same for religion in general, this film intellectual.)
