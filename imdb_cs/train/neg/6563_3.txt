Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up on the South Pole while trying to leave Florida. Where he meets a small penquin that tries to save from eskim. This short attempt and penquin is adorable, but in the end it's a little too light in laughter. Eskimo is not really such a big foil for mistakes, and I've seen a lot better Bugs Bunny cartoons honestly, even other shorts when paired with other unfamiliar opponents. So I can not recommend this with good conscience. However, it is nice to see it in its uncut form. This cartoon is on disk 3 of "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My class: C
