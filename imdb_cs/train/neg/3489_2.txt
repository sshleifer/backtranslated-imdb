It was my first, and probably the last, Angelopoulos movie. I wanted to get into it because it was Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, and it was Theo, which I've heard a lot about. The opening was promising, long shots over the soldiers' jeeps across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The film had big holes and I do not know what to mention first. The main story of the story is revealed to the journalist by an old woman. during a long journey. It's like a 15-minute monologue, killing action and patience of viewers, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, except for this old lady telling the story. All that is supposed to manifest through the action was simply the old lady cameraman. Instantly, the television was approaching the bar. Turns the corner and the winter begins immediately! Probably shot on different days, continuity penetrated. Many narrative problems told him that it was from an absurd to an irrational one that never became a style, so the audience asked questions that never had answers. Poor Mastroianni, due to a role that lacks integrity or spell. On the other hand, like many Greeks or Albanians or people from the Balkans would agree, movies have shown a lot of historical, ethnic or political mistakes just to make the film about "humanity" red as a review. Even more, but no time to lose in a bad film that was not a movie at all, but listeners of a personal touch film and paid state money.
