I am sorry to report that I have seen this film several times. When it bombed at the box office, it was repeated overnight for HBO at night. And I watched it again and again, because television is generally so bad - or it was at that time. I do not look anymore, so it might be wonderful - like Samuel L Jackson says about a bitch: "It could taste like a sweet potato pie, but I will never know because I should not eat a dirty mfer." We'll see. Dudley plays Arthur in the desert, just a few steps behind Moses. It came out right after Life Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration comes from. Few slightly funny pieces are too long until you open your eyes and clean your teeth. There is one scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both dragged and dried and died thirsty. Then they meet like old acquaintances who really do not know very well, they promise to make lunch. It could have been funny. But the scene I remember best is a meeting with Pharaoh, in which Pharaoh is a black street grandfather who made himself in the full king of Tut regalia. He had to read the lines straight, because at some point before the release, they survived their scene with the Hollywood equivalent of the black street linga, which was expressed by Jimmy Walker Wannabe (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or maybe it was Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They've managed to turn them into a really boring scene into a very racist, very unlucky and very long piece of excrement, one of those legendary things that just will not disappear, so many times you try and leave it there for someone else to do it. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WILL GET!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and six packs of Corona. Now that they have converted Poseiden Adventure, this one is probably the highest on the remake list. Perhaps this time they lend a comic writer.
