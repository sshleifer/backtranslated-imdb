This film had so many promises. I was very excited about this film. Ultimately it was the most ridiculous, painful in the worst case. Action styles ran gamut from real, really, flat (angels, wife and daughter) into exaggerated (Casper character). I felt that this dialogue was only an attempt to transmit information to viewers instead of real people who were trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the "error" scene. It is to a great extent an insult to the ability of the audience to think of things. In the defense of this scene, however, he won the greatest laughter of the film. I read that they spent a lot of money traveling to different overseas localities. Pity they did not use it. I did not feel I was taken to exotic places. Whoever could put a Coliseum photographic record in Rome. However, to conclude on a positive note, I thought the files were pretty good. I liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers. In my opinion (and that's all) is that if the SCHMALTZ factor were much lower and the ACTION factor would be greatly increased, this movie would be good.
