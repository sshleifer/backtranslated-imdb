I think bad Laurel and Hardy are better than Laurel and Hardy at all, but only hardly. Sadly, Fox movies are those that get a big DVD release and put people who may not be too familiar with L & H on their WORST things rather than their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is in love with the daughter of the bosses who hate him, and he prefers a smooth guy. It is unbelievable to think that the geniuses at Fox thought that this is what L & H needs in their films. Without their makeup pancakes, the boys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them are the attempts to slip out of the bedroom at night and the rather bizarre scenes when Robert Mitchum, the classic noir evil, is trying to sell Oliver Hardy's "insurance" to Stan. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget it and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
