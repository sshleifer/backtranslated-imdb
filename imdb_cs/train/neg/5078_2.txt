If 1977 "Exorcist II: The Katherine" did not do any kind of favors, it's hard to imagine what extraordinary viewer Richard Burton saw in this incredible exercise without excitement. You saw it all before: Burton plays a writer he discovered at an early age that he has the power to move inanimate objects with the power of his mind (and you think Carrie did not have any influence on Hollywood!). Although adapted from Peter Van Greenaway's novel, "Medusa" plays as recycled goods, although special effects in the final of the cathedral are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise, the cast is extremely weak. Burton is greedy, but tired ... not even telekinesis will save him at this moment. * 1/2 from ****
