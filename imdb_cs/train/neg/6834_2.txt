What the hell of a movie! ... I said I wanted to become an expert on bad movies from all decades, so I decided to start this. It was a good choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and misunderstood masterpiece, but I did not see anything like that in a pastel-colored mess. In the past, I have not seen many bad movies, but I feel like it's called "so bad it's good", probably because it's so unintentionally damn fun! First, there are inaccuracies. There are inaccuracies regarding conspiracy, physical inaccuracies, and psychological inaccuracies. The other are as crazy as the Van Damme ass in the back of the blue spandex. There are extremely sticky lines and I will not even talk about some fun action moves. There is not really bad acting from everyone who cares about this hot disorder, except for one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks absolutely pathetic like Frank, which is a totally stupid nature. And to tell the truth, I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing twins. I managed to achieve a different tone and mood in two roles that were convincing to me. However, the film was mostly bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a big movie studio ... which is now in bankruptcy.
