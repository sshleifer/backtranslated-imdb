It's funny how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because he is scary or because, given that the creative team's collective credentials are worth it, it really deserves it, but because in each category she was nominated for Prizzi's honor. Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston has lost at this point in his career, but I do not buy it. It was only the previous year that he signed the great studio part UNDER THE VOLCANO in Mexico, which is one of the best ever he has ever done. Prizzi's honor, on the other hand, a movie loaded with starry power, good intentions, and a decent script, proved to be a great disappointment. The overall tone and plot of the gangster who fell in love with the hit-man woman resolved the strange crimes that Hollywood captured in a storm in the early 1990s, but the script is too complicated because of itself, motivation is turned off and overall the story seems unclear exactly what it's trying to be: a romantic comedy, a criminal track, a gangster saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (makes Brooklyn's accent that works perfectly for De Niro, but Jack sounds unconvincing) and Kathleen Turner in front roles seem to be in cash- passing through some of them. Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, is better reflected, but her performance is sabotaged by the motivation of her character: she begins to sacrifice her father's contempt, shows herself to support her ex-husband, then becomes a vengeful female who wants her head a plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film are dirty in quality as it was made in the early 1970s and Huston's direction is as unattractive as everything else. The story is a promise and maybe even in the hands of a director who is hungry to learn that it could be transformed into something better, but what's left seems like a movie that nobody really cares about.
