Here's the horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT, where Melinda / Mindy Clarke plays as Candy, a desert inhabitant who pulls bank robbery with Johnny's friend Jason Durr. He ends up in a southern border prison led by a sadistic main bolt (Robert Englund wanted in his sleeve). She and her beloved puddles will end up hiding at the gas station monastery until they are transformed by a new-fallen meteor. Dogs turn into unpleasant dragons queen "females" and Candy develops a very long, talking, killing fork tongue that she can not control. Thugs, searching for stolen prey and other fragmented mosquitoes, add further complications. At first, Clarke is fantastic and does what he wants to be out of this movie. You watch her and you will see someone very entertaining during scenarios, very convincing in horror scenes and very sexy in various wigs and disguises, including eye-popping, skin tight latex clothes ... and wondering how this actress is not a huge star. It's the bad part of this cult attempt that does not fulfill its promise. We blame the Sciamma director / scripter who thinks that a special circumstance alone is enough to keep laughing ... but his vulgar gags, unpleasant support figures and silly dialogue are not a substitute for a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, plenty of lush colors, and the set is strangely suppressed by mud and dusty desert sites. Luckily for Sciam that Clarke is in her movie because she is watching you closely.
