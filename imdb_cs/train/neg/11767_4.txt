I had some hope of it because I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a couple of years back, so I thought it would be a little bang. At first I was very disappointed with the performance of John Hurt here. It looks as if his eyebrows have changed. His performance was not convincing. It was not as good as it could be expected. Tim Roth is fine, as always. Gamma really did not touch the original story I do not think. I think the best part of the movie is over. She had some great action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This is not that long, but sometimes it's a little boring. I remember that some time ago Walmart had this film really cheap and I always wondered why? I know now. I was hoping to blow, but I was not.
