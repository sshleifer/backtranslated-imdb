You do not see this movie. Badly acting and silly gore effects. Full time loss. I was hoping to see a lot of cold murders and hot chickens instead of the director relying on animal killing videos to shock you, the observer. Disgusting. Murders are pretty, basically strangled. One woman who makes worms in her mouth, one puts a rough burgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = broccoli BTK, new "sandwich" killer king of burger ... ha ha. I do not think that this film relied too much on real facts. I mean, the real killer BTK did not carry a rod of horde of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and yeah ... also killed a cow. Go find out.
