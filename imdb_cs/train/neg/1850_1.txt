Director Ron Atkins is frankly crazy. This very low-budget film chronicles several days in the life of one Harry Rush (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a music he receives from his girlfriend Rubberneck's girlfriend doll. He begins to accept orders from a doll to take a massive amount of drugs, rape and killing, not always in that order. What begins as an explosive wall-to-wall movie stays so good, but is very repetitive very quickly. I rely more on the proven crazy. It's hard to forget once. It's a bit like Tom Green sometimes makes a horror movie. My Grade: F Candy Eye: Laurie Farwell gets full naked; Jasmin Putnam shows the goats and the bush <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: John is completely naked repeatedly
