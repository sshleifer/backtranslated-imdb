One day I visited one of my relatives and we got to the theater so we thought we would go and make the movie. What mistake! This movie is terrible in every department. I've never heard of the movie before, and they have not even believed it yet. No wonder it's as much as it gets. It's a comedy, so it says, and that's just funny, it's the ability or the lack of that director to make such a movie. In order to get so close to Christmas, it should be called how to subdue Turkey in almost one and a half hours - or how long it was when I left. At the end of the movie, you feel like you are poisoned by eating on a sick turkey and regret that you have made time for such a dribble. Who knows why such things are done? Some people came out of the theater before the movie ended, and I blame myself for not going much earlier. It really makes me angry that you pay good money to see something decent and everything you perform and see is a bad TV movie that should be shown at 2am, in fact it's such a bad daytime TV should not show. What else to say ... probably not bad enough words, it could be fair.
