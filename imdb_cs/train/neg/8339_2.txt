This movie is moving in circles and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought that ... mmmmm, that might be a cool movie, but it just goes on and on, and finally you do not know what's going on. The lead woman is a good actress and she played her part well, and the psycho friend is scary, but after a bit you really do not care what happens because this movie is just going on. Pity, it really could be a lot better. Yet it would be said that a leading woman and a psycho friend will have a good career ahead of them, but they will remember this movie because they produce them or they are movies that they have ever done.
