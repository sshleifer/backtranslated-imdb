Margret Laurence apparently did not intend to have a novel on the film, let alone a stone angel. Hagar, as a character, was the one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay, who dared, someone?), And ended up almost sacrificing his humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (Stone angel, silver thread, etc.) are constantly a reminder of this old and new struggle and the massacre (so to speak) on the way. <br /> <br /> While the film is a fairly faithful plot of the book (but it's not really a conspiracy story, is it?), I think there was no sense in capturing the spirit of the film. Hagar's resistance (because of the defiance) was not there. Bram could have been much harsher than he had described, and Hagar's father could have been so traditional to play. If the filmmaker insisted on a stronger picture, the film would direct this point directly home. Likewise, why should we see mobile phones, organic products and other upgrades? We try to make a few points to create some points (eg Muslim girlfriends and native people). Hagar et al. they are everything in the book, but politically correct, so why should we see in the movie version. Modernization may be an excuse for low-cost operations, but as an excuse to send subliminal politically correct messages that are absolutely irrelevant to the novel (and film), it seems to be doing blows under the intellect. <br /> <br /> There is also an audience there. It seems we were conditioned to see the bitter old people as cute and dear. Why should you laugh every time Hagar is in your bouts? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh or Hagar. These people are frustrated and are filled with fear and everything we do is laugh them. I do not think Hagar and the other people in her situation would have justice.
