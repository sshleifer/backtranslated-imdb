The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by the screenwriter. Fortunately, the highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best ever volleyball movie (rated less than Side Out and higher than, um, umm). Do not, however, cover this movie. Kill Shot stars appear and Koji star comes as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. I use high-tech gadgets like a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, and Koji is able to help FBI agents track a person who has committed an obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including a short camera by Denise Richards, a homosexual, and extremely ugly and annoying girls, Koji carries this film alone. Every fan of movies, like The Matrix or Hackers, definitely loves Kill Shot.
