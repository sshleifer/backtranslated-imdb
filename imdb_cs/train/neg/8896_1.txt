I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I am 61 years old and watched movies until I remember it. I can truthfully say that the Brigade stands alone and it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local children's club would have created better sets. The figures were so wooden that they were likely to hit a dry rot from the tears of the patrons who were unlucky to watch them. It has to be hoped that the stars of this movie have been hidden enough to protect them from the embarrassment they had to suffer watching this film. Owners of this kind should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film.
