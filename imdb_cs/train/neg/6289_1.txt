This is the most beautiful and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene will become good and two main actors - Corey and Danny are so uncomfortable. Corey is very stupid and naive and should never listen to Danny's false promises. Neve Campbell and the murderer of Urban Legend are the only redemptions in this bad movie. Danny (Dean Paras) looks in her late thirties and a girl trying to sleep - Corey looks like he's still in high school. In Australia, this film is called too smooth; there's nothing smooth about this movie. 1/10 Avoid
