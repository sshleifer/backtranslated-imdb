This film had so much potential - a strong cast, a rather strong idea and a clear budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of these elements was useless. The story went nowhere, the characters were the least hollow, resulting in a very boring, unnecessary loss of film. I hated it. According to the other voices, I am in this minority and must be some kind. But I thought this movie was terrible. I had great hope, but she was very disappointed. Special disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A very rough fixer is a great idea. Jody was convinced and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - nice, but nothing new.
