Spoilers ... if there is such a thing .... . . . . . As a frantic fan of Robin Williams, I felt it was necessary to buy this movie as the first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine any movie that would be angry. Basically, the film makes one bad joke that Uncle Artie told you after dinner and dramatized them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in 30 sec skit. <br /> <br /> I'm a dirty humor, but this humor was not pleasantly vulgar or indeterminate ... it was just a mess of mind. There is no redemption of the quality of this film, except Robin Williams fanatics, like myself, who just have to own every piece of film.
