Come on! Come with Pakistani bashing. Bollywood can not only shoot brilliant films - but it can also seriously affect audience generations. I'm a huge fan of Bollywood, but movies against Pakistan just make me forget to enjoy the scenario, cinema, sequence action - everything. I'm really glad that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon Na that have grown up not only because they have earned their Bollywood Masala quality - but also because they are trying to say: give a chance a chance shows that on both sides there are fools who are not masses.
