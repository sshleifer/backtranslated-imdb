I tried to enjoy this program; I really did. I even bought a pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I could not get into this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) seemed to be in love with themselves for one thing. I admit that there was some clever dialogue at the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I appreciated much of this dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, it was almost like old comedy films of the 30's and 40's with a man and a woman. You have a lot of arguments, accusations, screaming and screaming. Many people obviously love this kind of harassment, but I hate it, so I never got to the wave light. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as an unfortunate affiliate of Agnes was fun. It's bad she had such a short time. Shepherd's eyes were pretty, and I suppose women would just say Willis, but too many arguments between the two turned me away.
