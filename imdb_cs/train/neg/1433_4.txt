Pictures are great and well reflect the landscape of Canada. On the other hand, the story was totally boring; In my eyes, it was a love story in the forest, just as Titanic was a love story on the boat. I did not feel that the gray owl is a great ecologist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this was ... bad.
