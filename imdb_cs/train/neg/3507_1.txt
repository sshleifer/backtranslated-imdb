In this film, Maysles Brothers has reached a low point in interacting with people. Remember that you were using words like "masterpiece" when viewing this movie that these Maysles creeps did not only meet the Hampton, and they finally shot a movie about some eccentric people. No, when they found the two poor people, they had to fund their project (and imagine what people were saying to sell the project). Then she became friends with two extremely vulnerable women. No brain gathering or real consensual participation. These miserable Maysles smiled, kissed their ass, did everything they had to get Beales to cooperate, and then abused them as badly as ever. We would like to think that these scammers had occasional thoughts of remorse and blame. But the film process, with regard to pre-planning, real shooting and subsequent editing, took a lot of time, and their goal had no provisions that would in fact affect Beales as human beings. The exploitation film committed by the poorest people. As time had elapsed, their film reputation was seriously stained by what they did here. Their reputation as a human being is dubious. That's what people remember as. Grotesque cheaters.
