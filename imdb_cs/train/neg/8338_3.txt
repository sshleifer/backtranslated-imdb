This movie is very important because it suggested to me: sometimes you want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to have a syndrome ... sometimes you might want to have Goldfield's syndrome ... so do not you remember this tedious movie .. and you mostly do not remember Adam "superfluos" Sandlera ... sometimes you just wish ... he rented another movie ... <br /> <br /> My voice? 3 of 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke that Adam Sandler's fan does not exist ... I want to hope), save ... Someone who would save? Drew Barrymore. ... maybe.
