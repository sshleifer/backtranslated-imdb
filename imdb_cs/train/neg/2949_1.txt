Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million? Let me give you a choice; you can either (a) crush and empty the toilet, or (b) create a movie based on the assumption of Whoopi Goldberg as a hard walnut futuristic cop that is associated with a rubber dinosaur that uses expressions such as "I did not have a trumpet," and blows raspberries it's funny. That's right, you would have chosen an option that has more merit - rinse the toilet. <br /> <br /> It must be seen. I can not even find words that describe how this movie is bad. It does not even fit into the "so bad - it's good" category. Actually, I have it on TV when I write - and when I watched, I felt I needed to come to IMDb and register my disgust. Since Jurassic Park arose a few years ago, they think the audience would have tolerated a man dressed in a rubber suit? The working group should just walk and damn the consequences. Anyone who touches it will go to hell for this criminal waste of money. I have to stop writing - I'm going to destroy myself.
