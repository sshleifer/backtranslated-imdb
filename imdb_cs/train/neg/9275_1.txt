Omen IV (1991) was bad for T.V. film. Since the 1980s, I think executives have been experimenting with meth (the drug of choice in the 1990s), because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why did they even bother doing this? A t.v. film? What did they think when the idea came to an idea? They even thought for a while that this film would be like. Maybe they thought it could be like a series? We never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should discard some money instead of unloading this "extra" disk. Omen IV is essentially the average American family remake of the first film. Instead of breathing into the punk guy, we get spooky girls that are totally sad for everyone around them. If the family had a stronger parenting skills then there would never be any of the demonic events that appeared in previous films. These parents need to put their legs down and do some real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best to avoid everyone!
