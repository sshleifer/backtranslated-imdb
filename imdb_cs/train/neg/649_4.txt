OK, this movie was made for one reason and one of the reasons just to make money. Producers of course did not care about the killing of classical horror. I knew this movie would suck as soon as pg-13, how many pg-13 slasher movies turned out to be good? This is the question how many women were on the moon? The answer is NIC !! Prom night 1980 was not a top piece, but he definitely deserves to be recognized as a film that remains faithful to his genre and deosnt is trying to be more than that. My problem with Prom Night 2008 is that it deals with a killer and I have 3 big problems with it ..................... <br /> <br /> 1) , as he escapes, was locked up in a psychiatric institute and he escaped air conditioning! WHAT TO SAKRU? why should they have air conditioning in the patient room? Do they want to be comfortable during their stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain that the killer wants all the main victims of family and friends dead to have everything for himself, says he loves her, but in the next minute he tries to kill her, so she wants to kill her, loves her or just rape her? 3) Is the killer too good to get all his skills? He was a teacher, so in this one scene where he killed a friend's main friend while he's basically at the top of his sleep and does not notice, it's all stupid 2 stars out of ten terrible, silly and silly horror attempts
