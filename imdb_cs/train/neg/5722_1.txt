First of all, I'd like to apologize for my bad English. I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore fan, but I liked this movie. Live feed, but SUCKED BIG TIME! I've never seen a gore-movie with a great actor, but hey, who's surprised? The Live Feed game was ... well, no! I saw that some of them commented, because it had to be a school project or something. Okey, but not students in the media or acting school. This wasn 't it! What about the story? A really sad farewell to the Host. What about gore? What about psychopathic torture scenes that should make your courage twisted and leave you cold-sweating? It was the most disappointing in the hole of the movie! Short, fast and without borders. Rather than executions than torture. Okey, where there are blood buckets, but it did not even look like it. Slaughter and violence resembled Braindead rather than a Hostel or one of the Saw films. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I laughed several times in Live Feed, but it was more than a disappointment than a complete fun! <br /> <br /> So instead of going out 80 minutes by watching Live Feed, watch ALL OTHER!
