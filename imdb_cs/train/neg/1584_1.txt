I read common men from the Royal Books as Bachman, and I felt John's and his family's main character. This movie could be much more. Difficulties? It was set during big action movies. I was watching the movie and I had pain during the fight. I did not feel anything for the character and less for its cause. Yes, she had sad scenes (or ridiculous), even though I think the movie did not save me in my eyes. When you read a book, you can feel the climax and fire in the heart of John when he finally avenges. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a small number. Maybe it was not so low if I did not read the book.
