What a shame! This movie could be really decent, but mainly writing is bullshit and the main characters are somewhat shallow and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was a good and historical recreation of decadence from the late 70's was well-worked, but overall this film was a great waste of time. Instead of watching a movie that deals with similar themes and the same timeframe, it's great BOOGIE NIGHTS.
