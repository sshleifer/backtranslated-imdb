The secret is ... this film is blowing. Sorry, he just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff I knew what you did last summer and scream, Beth, played admirably by Dorie Barton, joining a few friends for a spring trip. The group rents a luxury house and tries to enjoy the fun. Then death begins. At first, the other is murdered, then another friend, leading to a sad and trembling culmination with predictable results. One note, Dory Barton is poor Reese Witherspoon - she looks like Reese, she's like Reese, and she could get to Reese in the police force. Maybe it's the way they did it? Anyhoo, decent cinematography, and fairs can not entirely rule out bad dialogue and horrible writing.
