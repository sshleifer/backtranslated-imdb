The sad, sad look is really Munst's revenge. The artists once again appeared (Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to return to the role of Hermann Munter) in this film about a television series about a pair of Grandpa and Herman wax replicas robots "terrorize" the city as a preparation for the mummy stash robbery at the show. With the police on the heels with two older television icons trying to find out who is really criminals to erase their names. We see them dressing like Scarabs (a small peak in the movie), the grandfather turns several times into a bat with a connected wire (one even flies to Transylvania and Herman relies a bit on his frequent miles). the most annoying relative "Phantom" always sings and breaks glass ad nausium! What is most sad is that it is difficult to say: it is that Gywnne (in particular) and Al Lewis look so shameless in every scene and so indifferent to the material. These are hockey robot costumes that have value in school production. Maybe it's a funny script. Sid Caesar is a crazy, predominantly dysfunctional inclination. Or maybe she sees something that has brought me joy and sweet memories like a child who is being treated with the supermodern fashion K-Mart. In any case, the result is certainly a disappointment and stupidity for Munster's standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is adequate in the most empty role (although showing more fission than usual in women's years and experience). K.C. Martell is still friendly Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings, like the aforementioned Phantom, looks and acts and speaks in an absurd way. The movie has a really inexpensive feeling about it for a movie made for television.
