Hi. this is my first review for any movie I've seen. I've been through the problem of telling everyone that it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I feel that the film was nicely made, which I'm sure to understand due to budget constraints. It seemed to me that I was looking at the very bad remake of the film. Which I can agree on, I also saw that it is also very graphic, but I did it as a movie song. The scene in which the hammer gets to the head of a bound victim in a chair is the most disturbing scene I've seen. the scene lasted almost forever, but in reality it was about 5 minutes but still. I want to note that I like some horror films and I'll make a credit if they are good. this director Uwe boll and his group of people got used to the film to think about doing another similar movie. one last note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE USED IN ANIMAL ACCESSORIES WHO ARE RUNNING, ROT AWARDED, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND AS A FIVE MINUTE SCENES OF SOME HAMMER ENTERTAINED, then you will enjoy this movie if you do not, and you love horror, go with a higher budget movie, as he saw. I can not believe people actually do such movies. sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, it's just my opinion on the film.
