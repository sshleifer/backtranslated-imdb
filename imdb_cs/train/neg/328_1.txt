I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler and one day I was looking at choosing one of his DVDs and saw "Going Overboard" and decided to go out and borrow it. So I went out with some mom friends and rented them. We put it and we were shocked when we saw Adam Sandler, who has not yet done puberty, looks like 12 years old when this movie came out. I could not even watch 30 minutes of that bullshit, I did not laugh, laugh, or even smirk in this film, in fact the only time I was grinning when I saw how horrible the film was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the audience in this movie laugh ... and it did not work once. Even though I saw the terrible horrible camera angles and heard the disgusting scenario, I realized why I had never heard of this movie ... because it is nothing more than anything else that had ever been sucked in. This film, in my opinion, was the worst EVER movie ever ... EVER!
