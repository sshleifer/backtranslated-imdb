I am a huge fan of horror and splashing, even enjoying horror films that some people find stupid. I also like gore. The more he will be satisfied if he does. <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews of other people on the web, I was sure that this film would be a small jewel. But to my disappointment it turned out to be one of the most exaggerated films I've ever watched. The effects were horrible, the dialogues were stupid, the conspiracy was unnecessary, the special effects were useless, and the editing was probably done by someone who was dead for the past 2 years. Usually I find out that all these characteristics make a great horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I had 11 EUR to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you really do not like nonsensical gore (such as violent sh * t movies), avoid at all costs!
