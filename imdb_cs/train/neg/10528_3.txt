I chose this song because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, a metasonix modular synthesizer customer (made by someone dear to me). The art of the jacket says "version of 2003". I give her one point for a strong woman, one point for an angry dialogue and a final point for the light blue eyes of meg foster, of which there are plenty of shots. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see David MacCullum accidentally bathing (the pool has a window for viewing plexiglass!) while his lady love was persecuted by a psycho in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were impressive - these are the rich folk houses in L.A and Mendanassos (sp?) where the castle was. I found out that he was wondering how they could keep cleaning with all the dust blowing around. The wind was not rough enough to be believable to me. I still thought the furniture leather had to be ugly ... etc, and I realized that the film must be pretty boring when I look forward to these things when the supposed conspiracy develops. Have I faced the things, why did he set fire, throw away the match, and then throw the fire into the fire? This kind of bad stuff. It was at peace in the best case. Oh, okay. Robert Morely has a little fun with his cheeky figure and a pleasant holiday.
