"Incubus" is a mix of good, a mischievous mystery, a bad (a disconnected script, a confusing resolution, poorly executed scenes), and strange (strong incestuous impulses, John Cassavetes' strangely sleepy and stifling performance - was this character really like to be "wacko"? ). It's not as insulting as it is to be, but not very successful. (* 1/2)
