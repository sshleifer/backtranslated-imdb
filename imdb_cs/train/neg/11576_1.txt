He saw it at the UCSB's reel-loud festival and was * shocked * to have won the Golden Reel Prize. I was not the only one because the audience had mixed reactions on the piece. I thought there were many other better movies, but then I learned that judges are strongly rooted in film theory and other art bulls. While cinematography and editing are on the same footing as many other shorts out there, telling the story is nothing more than your average student piece. It seems that "serious" student films must include one of the following categories: sex, intrapersonal fight, and possible suicide - Nick and Kate say goodbye and include all three. Please be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and that might be my outsider's opinion, but the one of the montecito sounds a little fake. Has anyone else?
