Along with 2 days in the valley, I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. One of the long lines of Tarantino revolts that emerged from Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere of the film creates entertainment for the first five minutes, but filmmakers make an unforgivable mistake that allows unnecessary and grotesque violence to "hip" quotient. You better miss this.
