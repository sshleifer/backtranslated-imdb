I expected the French musical B-Movie. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès were superstars of low-budget French films of that time. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this unbelievable one hour of 30 pure mediocrity. The musical numbers are horrible and the comedy is totally boring and stupid. And songs? What songs? It's just a series of bad numbers, one by one. The only very rare thing on the subject is the nudity of women. At that time it was not known. Some numbers are in fact just to show hot women. This contributes to mediocrity! And try to find young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of French cinema, as a musician, in his first film. Good luck!
