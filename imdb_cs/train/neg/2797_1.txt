I'm a big fan of horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are really "good" bad horrors. But these films NEVER guarantee that they are viewing! I will not spend much time talking about everything that's fine. The script is scary. The effects are terrible. FX will not lift the years. "Set" is an absolute JOKE !! The sad thing is that there may be some real potential in several actor but this vehicle has left them NEVER working with! Just say I saw it as "free" & I felt I was robbed! The time you WASTE watching this would be better spent on cat cooking.
