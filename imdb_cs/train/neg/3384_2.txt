If you should only judge on the basis of the film, the committee that made the A Chorus Line musical and the Broadway audience that led the 15-year war horse were all in heavy narcotics because one unique feeling is NOT that movie. <br /> <br /> What somebody thought Richard Attenborough was the right one for this material totally mystifies me but makes a musical instrument that is almost exclusively about moving just sitting on the screen like a piece of clay. <br /> <br /> You are not satisfied with the original score as originally written, someone has decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song that gave the film a zip. So we are attacked by Oscar nominations (!) "Surprise, Surprise". Surprise, surprise, song smelled and movie does. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
