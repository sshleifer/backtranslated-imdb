Horrible mood of classics. <br /> <br /> It was not written conclusively why Mary would have such sympathy for Bates. Perhaps he will be more stable until jokes begin to play with him, but he will still not help with his actions. (to invite a comparable alien to stay alone with him in his recently launched motel, tell an attractive young girl from past mental problems, knives, etc. ...) This, in addition to his previous findings, should have Mary extremely wary of him, but it's not just about being able to play a "murderous identity" later. Which is itself ridiculous: "So it is a real killer - plus she too - too!" There were too many fancy twists to make a story on the screen when the story did not need to be extended, and it was good to see Perkins again reveals its famous role, but that's the only little pleasure to have. It's certainly not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you do not even intend to get close, you should not worry at all.
