Before I saw this movie, I'd say I loved everything Kathy Bates did. Now it's all - minus-one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should tell him that the "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, neither ignorant nor clich√©. Stereotyped for Randy Quaid. The only redemption is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough actor to bring this messy mess. If you like this country, you can enjoy the countryside. That's the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I'm a serious fan of both independent and strange movies, but that's just terrible.
