I do not think I've ever been so buried in the pure absurdity of the film in my whole life, as if I were going out of it. Nothing in it makes sense. none of them are smart or well thought out. because of the lack of really exciting moments, they repeatedly use this complete trick where you build the music before a character like that opens the door or pulls out the curtain and then it's nothing. it's OK to do once, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things that are defended for no apparent reason, figures, half-formed stories ... the characters were not well developed in all. the end was bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every part of this movie is terrible. and I'm here to warn you.
