it became a cult movie in Chinese students, although I watched it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK. The full arts of giddy claim that the fence is average and unreal; The "spirit" it wants to say is how independent artists resist the commercialization of the music industry and maintain the "purity of the artistic soul" and do not want to sell for dirty money. it is really cruel and superficial; diologues are predominantly pathetic. the deal is wrong. sceenplay is full of artistic pretense. it's a fantastic movie for kids and all this <br /> <br />
