It seems Hollywood is just giving money to anyone with a camera and the ability to talk. This movie was foul bad. Casting was terrible, acting was not visible, and the story was full of holes. Script? who needs a script? I was surprised that the film was not as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be, but I have enough T & A footage to last my life. The film was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell the story. When I was so badly written, I thought the two brothers in the movie were lovers initially. The scenes on the racetrack, along with the main actor in the movie, were still thinking about Herbie: Fully charged. Such a film is what Grindhouse modeled itself after ... only the writers thought they were serious.
