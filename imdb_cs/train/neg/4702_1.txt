I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate almost everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. everybody says nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and they make it big. WHAT TO DO DRUGS ??? !!!?!?!?!?!! nat and alex will end up as a hobos or end up as Jane Hudson of "What Happened to Baby Jane?" I could not get in just 20 minutes from this, just 30 seconds from the show, and I managed to survive for about half an hour "The Battle of Bands". How could someone tell these guys at an audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. days before Nick's premiere, most of Nick's teenage girls (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) have discovered in the commercial influencing of brain dead children how amazing nat and alex wolff are. they did not push me at first and, on the other hand, nat and alex seemed to be either drugs or paying them a lot of money to say it and the sound convincingly because I do not see how anyone could find this show / fun movie. music is terrible. The singing sounds like a sick man dying from a crack. alex is the most unpleasant movie / TV show EVER. not sad, it's annoying, it's really weird and thinks she's hot and knows everything about girls. this guy is lucky if he ever gets laid down. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) do not exist at all! Jesse's character is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin Jesse Draper (they had to have some budget problem). Their father is not the only one married to Polly Draper, but she will not show up at the show, so it seems that Wolff is not a mother. Rosalina also does not exist. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you that Naked Brothers will be in some deep sh ** when their "fans" find out the whole thing is being introduced. 0/10
