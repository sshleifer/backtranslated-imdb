Please, forget it. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I've ever had to watch unhappy. I consider the film to be an insult to my brain, just like my ass, which suffered me both and sat and watched this film. I still have to see what damage to my vision and my ability to complete sentences. What a load of rubbish! And do not let me start acting ... Somebody please help me forget! "Weird science" - come back! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I'm "proud" to give this film the first 1 on IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of films ... Many of them c ** p, but it is it's so bad I do not even believe that. Did somebody come up with an idea and think he's worthy to become a movie? Did someone actually read the script and decided to produce a movie? Did anyone read the script and tried it? Someone saw the movie and decided he would not do it on the shelves to collect the dust for eternity? * These * are the questions I want to answer. It's not a philosophical question about the tree in the forest and well, you know ...
