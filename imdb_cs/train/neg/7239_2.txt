This film is promoted as a smart romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic, and it's definitely not an effective comedy. The bits of a very meaningful but pathetic character, "Tom", oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only saving grace is the competent performances of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we see Paltrow's pleasant face. Overall, you should avoid it!
