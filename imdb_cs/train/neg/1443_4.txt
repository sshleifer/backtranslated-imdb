Begin with this good: Swayze speaks to Zulu several times with his friends, or the tongue between the tribes is heard. This is a great plus, as the US and UK movie audiences think that all people on this planet speak English (only if you are one of them: no, no). "tenenkrommend", as we say in the Netherlands (it makes your fingers tilted - not a good way). I like Swayze, but it's terrible. The muscles in the jaws make overtime, and he frowned the whole movie - someone had to tell him it looked. No Patrick: looks stupid and is a compensation for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) opted for an acting style that does not meet the style of her collaborators. Her acting is very relaxed that this movie could be set in the present day. And it is not. Your dress was a leash, Alison. Best acting came from people from the African continent and Onyulo as Umbopo, which I liked best. Bright, warm and character, its performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> In general: it's mwah-fun on a rainy day. Damage. It could have been better. Sack of the director.
