It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his glory, when X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, was on top of glory. Nine years later, he's almost forgotten, and his attempts to make it on the big screen failed miserably. I can not even explain why he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame has cast him into an eternal role that has great talent to stop him. At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less well-known, and she was really lucky that a movie like "Playing God" did not lead her career to a dead end. Fortunately, she is "Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" around the corner, and her career began when Lara Croft arrived. There is not much information about the movie. It's the only big movie of Andy Wilson, and it must be a reason. Everything is banal, and most of what's going on on the screen is expected in this story of a former doctor who saves the life of the shooter at the bar just to find work for the crowd. The off-screen voice is particularly bad, with a moralist text that kills any shade of cinematic film experience. You will probably not see the movie, but in DVD or TV stores. Try looking for something better.
