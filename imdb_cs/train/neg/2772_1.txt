Warning spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad film, of such an interesting, true story. He had such a promise, but the acting was at best ridiculous. Some files were beautiful and realistic. Others are something of an amusement park. I found out how laughing when I watched what seemed serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I could not. The best part was the battle between friends that ended with the death of the "king." I liked Queens' punishment. And the final shot has become a wonderful picture. There are so many better movies you can watch. I do not recommend it.
