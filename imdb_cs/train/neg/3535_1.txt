Good. Who was that? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Turning your head into the Ecstasy pipeline? There were so many people. Did you do it for courage? Is it a kind of cult? Or did Guy Richie sign himself 788 times under different names? Before I say anything else, I'll say this. Just because you do not understand the movie does not mean it's not great. You may have had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch the movie after you had advice with your wife and then you were not in the mood. Perhaps it is a more fundamental breakthrough - as if you simply did not have the mental ability or the sufficiently developed philosophical sense that could deal with it. BUT. And that's very, very big. The size of the mega XXL elephants - but end up with others. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DO NOT confuse the inconsistency of complexity and please do not confuse this two-hour non-squirter for an interesting movie. Really. Maybe you think you're smart enough. You can even think of yourself as a rather romantic figure: an independent thinker who championed a masterpiece against a choir of a shepherd fool. Please no. You are troubled by yourself. <br /> <br /> The revolver is a waste of time for everyone. If you've been thinking about it for a few minutes, you'll recognize it too. It was a casting loss, a crew loss, a loss of meals, and the loss of precious minutes (you can not get them back, you know) about someone unfortunate that could sit through this unbearable, poor mess. <br /> <br /> "Do not wait," says the voice in the dark. "You just do not understand. Its NON-LINEAR. This means the story does not go to STRAIGHT LINE. This is actually COMPLEX and SUBTLE AUTEUR work. It is a difficult EXISTENTIAL question. And the same - they planned the FIGHT CLUB when it first came out - did not hear </ p> <br /> <br /> I hate to disappoint you, but I'm quite a big fan of Lynch, I rather like Memento, so telling narratives in unconventional way does not necessarily fill up I did not like Revolver for the following reasons: I do not agree with the fact that I think it is a vague and spectacular topic, but with such an insulting superficial way I'm not much of a chess player but Richie's idea of ​​how chess work looks like a premature four-year-old I hate it because characters, without exception, m "Aha!" he asks Richie's apologists. "Guy is cleverly bending his hat on Brecht!" Maybe you're right. I think it's rather probable he can not just write a decent script for a caramel. Comparison of a revolver with a combat club is actually really instructive. Fight Club has a sour tongue, a nihilist dialogue that laughed at you. The revolver has obsolete luck that rejects one-liners that ears bleed. The Battle Club has a great breakthrough that lets you re-evaluate everything that's happened. The revolver has, if I can say, some inconceivable twists that offer no satisfaction, because ... well, they do not make sense. If you still pull the carpet from people, they'll kick you out of the house. And then they lock all doors and windows. And they never left you back. Sometimes. It seems Guy Richie assumes that philosophical means repeating the mantra of small buzz-phrases. They are mostly spoken, but often appear on the screen with an attribute. It's almost pathological. But what makes this film particularly remarkable is the way it can so inexplicably marry so neatly with all the tired gangster clichés in the world. In the end it's so insignificant. Nothing you care about. You do not understand anything. You're going home. <br /> <br /> In fact, I liked a bit: a fugitive killer who has a crisis of confidence. He's great. But I can not recommend you to see the movie just to see it. It's just a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. That's horrible.
