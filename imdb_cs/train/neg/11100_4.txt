He loved the original story, had a very high expectation for the film (especially since Barker had tried to talk about it), eventually seeing and what can I say? It was a MESS! Direction is all over the world, acting was hideous, spectacular visuals, and choreographies were simply empty and totally useless (what's going on with generic musical techniques like fast forward-slow mo nonsense? It was stylish yes, but it's not needed in this movie and has lowered the atmosphere into some silly MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video). While some killers are quite cold and brutal, some are ridiculously ridiculous (the first killing on the Japanese girl was merry, and the death of Tady Raimi was simply stupid). It is stretching all over the place with zero tension and tension, completely disengaged from the original story and then returning to it in the final, which at this moment feels strapped to make it even more. No explanation was given, I mean by knowing what was happening only when I read the story, but for the people who did not have it, it is even more confused because I did not yet know where it was going and what it was trying to do went into a crazy tangle all the time. God, I really wanted to like this movie because I'm a huge fan of Barker's work and he loved the story because he has a huge potential for cracking a movie, damn even I enjoyed some Kitamura movies as fun romps, but this movie just annoyed amateur and stupid from the beginning to the end - I did not care about anyone or anything else, the whole thing was rushed and heavily set up from a real source, quite differently. Because it was horrifying, and Vinnie Jones played great foolishness, but everything else was in place, more than disappointment. Gutted
