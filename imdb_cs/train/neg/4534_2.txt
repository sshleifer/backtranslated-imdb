The book from which this film is based has changed me seriously. But to say that this movie was disappointing is an understatement. Acting, directing, cinematography, and acting were all terrible. I would never recommend this film to anyone. I told countless people about the books, but now she tells them they should definitely not see the movie! I did not expect the story to follow the book exactly, but they left out too many key parts of the book. The film tried, but failed to provide a strong and inspirational message and humiliated only the central theme of prophecy. While I was in a position that did not read the book, I saw Celestine prophecy as a bunch of fraudulent B.S. I'm very disappointed with Redfield that this film has been shown.
