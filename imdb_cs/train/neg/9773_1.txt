When it was released, I thought it was one of the most exciting movies ever shot. However, thanks to Martin Scorces and several other creators who resemble him, worse movies were in-depth, linguistic ... than this ... but it's a pretty brutal assault on someone. Hey, I can take a lot of this, but this was ridiculous. In just the first six minutes I heard half a dozen use of the Lord's name in vain and a myriad of f-words. I wonder how many people left the theater and watched it in 1990? I could not be the only one. <br /> <br /> No wonder some of the major actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach, and Rikki Lake. From this film, Stephen Lang appears to have improved his image, at least playing the divine "Stonewall" Jackson in the "rich and generals." Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst exaggerated person in the movie and a figure who falls in love with transvestite until the end of the film. Depressed, gloomy, semi-responsive, repulsive: these are just some of the adjectives that people used - even some liberal critics - to describe this story, which is even worse in the novel. Of course, some well-known critics, all of the extreme Libs, praised the film. But it was the only one. Most critics have been disgusted, like most of the payable public. It's unbelievable that someone can praise dirt and garbage like this. <br /> <br /> Believe me, there are not good, sympathetic characters in this movie. This is an average, ill film: one of the worst of the "modern times". This means that if you do not like to see child abuse, drug abuse, juvenile prostitutes, farther and farther - two hours straight away from atrocities and just bad people. No, thanks.
