The title above serves to show the film "Gen" to its viewers. Gen is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film begins by leaving his mother for his new job. While driving, we realize that it is not so close because the hospital is in a remote area. Once he enters the garden in the hospital, he will see the patient's body. That's the beginning of the nightmare in the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to poor weather conditions. All communication with the outside world is also cut off. There is no way! In those days they will be more murderous. Now all suspect each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this idea is great. It could have been really scary. Of course there are positive aspects of the film. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when she goes to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. The effects are fine. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and frightening. I think the ultimate shock should spread to the movie. What I'm saying was that it was a good procedure, but instead of showing it like a parody, we should have realized it would come when we see what's going on. The Director had to explain it completely, which in my opinion does not work well. Also, the most dangerous patient in the film should be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure they will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found he was only 21 years old. It made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I'm not going to rate this movie * from *****.
