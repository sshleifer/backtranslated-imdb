Well, I could not get into a conspiracy, but maybe it's me. Unusual camera movements occasionally, however this film has charming vintage quality. The acting is sometimes real and fun with an occasional sequel of persecution involving lavishly dressed ladies, which was nice. The climax is confused and disjointed, but still ... err riveting than Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Stunts are interesting, especially for the 70th las vegas background. At the end there are a couple of disturbing hand-held camera movements that guess me for a while. But I do not think I will have a DVD, so far.
