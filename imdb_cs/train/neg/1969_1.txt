We have just seen this movie and I must say that although some effort was made at first to create a decent film, it was totally terrible - but that was not in the sense of what I am sure. <br /> <br /> It was like a child who controls this insult to intelligence with the belief that all future viewers are crazy or extremely harsh for fun or both ... Thank God for the rapid progress! I can not imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when filming this movie. I mean, you have actors who are trying to be serious, though scarcely, and the script that crying for total overwriting, ... I just can not say. If Harlequin Romance chose to make horror films, it would be good. <br /> <br /> If you find that this movie is funny, I strongly recommend that you seek some guidelines on the purpose of the films. There is a much better tariff. Join the club, read reviews, but avoid bullshit like this.
