Sir, what does it mean? !!!! Here is the warning of your spoiler, even though I do not think it will be really important. You do not see such a piece of waste. <br /> <br /> A group of handpicks are hunting for a group of really stupid people who are hunting for them and trying to kill them. puppets complicate things by letting them live their really silly fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid. You know it must be bad when even Mike and Bots can not save something! And they did not! I know, some of their lines were funny as what to add to the "HIT" and hand comment, but, geez, it was pretty dang sad. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is DO NOT REMEMBER THIS STOCK. NOT YOUR EYEL.
