The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's star ships is playing at a slow pace after Johnny Rico leaves his parents, a (not very attractive) girl he desires, and joins the mobile infantry. Aliens in the show are nothing like the barbarian bugs in the movie, instead they are monsters like monsters that shoot lasers from their mouths. While watching this version, I was always amazed at how fruitful it was. The show mainly concerns the relationships between the recruits and the painful, prolonged views they give each other through their combat armor, 80s synthetic pop sometimes arrives * during * the sparse combat sequences that eventually appeared in the last few episodes. In terms of construction, it owes the Top Gun debtor, it shares a lot in terms of pace and content (and all that it means).
