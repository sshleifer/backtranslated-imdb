Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, it destroys all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds climbed, and then he began to do a terrific scan of Hal Needham. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood to invite hope with the alert Last Action Hero. And here, silent Eddie Murphy will erase memories of trading venues and 48 hours with this "family" adventure film, an incredibly tedious, childish and generally simple horrible blow, in which it is possible to see big big breasts Charlotte Lewis in tight blouse the most appealing aspect of the whole film. The story is purely humorous. This concerns the social worker Murphy, who contacted the mysterious types and said he was the chosen one. I chose it, I heard you asked. His task is to save the Tibetan boy with mystical powers from the race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, acting actor Charles Dance looks embarrassed to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talent. Of all Murphy's films, it's probably the worst. I have read several reviews that suggest that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role in the informal form of the film, and while both points are loosely true, it is not forgiven that the film - though atypical and nonformal - may be an absolute burden on garbage. <br /> <br />
