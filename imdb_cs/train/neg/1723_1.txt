Man, what a scam it turned out to be! Not because it was not good (because I did not expect him) but because I was introduced by a DVD case that ignorantly pretended to be "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure, their names were not found in the startup credits of the film, much less in the rest! As it turns out, the only film that brings these three actors together is equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975)? but what does it have to do with CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anyone's estimation? <br /> <br /> Even though I paid $ 1.50 for rent and I was in the movie monster-film, so I decided to watch the movie no matter what happened and that it happened! In addition to the fact that he had non-anonymous crew and actors, there was unmistakable amateur air from afar, and what I did was laugh at the JAWS concepts and intentionally the resilient antics of the two sad peers - the owners of the joint boats they often quarrel with the shocked local sheriff. Creation itself? plesiosaur, ie semi-dinosaur / half fish? (naturally), but like the GIANT CLAW (1957) I just saw, it seemed like this film maker did not bother, because they did the best, especially during the second half of the movie!
