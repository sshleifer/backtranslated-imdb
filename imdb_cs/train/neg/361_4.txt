After reading the book, I loved this story. While watching the movie, I was disappointed that so many changes had been made. It is understandable that books and films are different, but they were two different stories, only the names and some of the stories of the book remained. Read the book and you will understand the movie better. The book gives you a better character development. These characters are extremely interesting and they make you care about them. The places were really in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters are not included. The TV has a microwave of so many great books and stories, it's a perfect example of it. Entry from the author does not always guarantee a good movie, but can sometimes help.
