This movie was not terrible, but it was not very good. I'm a big fan of Toni Collette I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams, who is a writer and receives a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is great and she does not think the baby wrote it. Toni Collette plays a child guard who does not know if this child really exists or when it does it all. I do not want to destroy the movie, but I say the film is not scary. The game is pretty good and Toni Collett's performance was amazing like Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The film was, in my view, a great disappointment, I would expect it to come to DVD.
