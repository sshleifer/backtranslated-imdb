One thing that interested me about this film (and not so well) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud of being the main historian on Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, most of the real events has been changed or ignored. Another reviewer said that von Trotta had said that for the Linen she had never had a bed on Goebbels bed, but then why did she have any impression that it had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the release of men, such as the catastrophe that was Stalingrad, or the fear of the Nazis that the international press based in Berlin will find a protest. why did the whole story play a second violin for a failing family adventure that's been doing over and over again? Surely something as amazing as it might have its own history! In some places it seemed that the film had two stories that really seemed to have little in common. Overall, this film failed in its goal to draw attention to the little-known act of resistance, which is a shame because it was better that could have had a big impact.
