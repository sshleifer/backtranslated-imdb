The film, starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two acclaimed and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. Independent film sounds even better. The studies will control less content, allowing more actors, writers and director more creativity. But why is this film so insignificant? Ask for dust. This film assumes that we are deeply profound in investing in our attitudes. No one has the right story, so we never know why the characters behave the way they do it. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you have one more left at the end of this movie. I told my friend that I was going to see this movie and that I thought it was terrible. Their question: "Could not Colin Farrell save it?" My answer: "Even Colin Farrell's ass would not save her."
