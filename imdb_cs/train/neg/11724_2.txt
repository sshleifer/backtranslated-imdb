I once used the name of Wesley Snipes as a trail to go forward and watch the new, undistorted film in which it appears. So, for the first time, my Snipes-Film recommendation method failed. Absolutely. I had to come here first to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow his otherwise serious effort to be so useless in the 'Supplier'. <br /> <br /> One of my worst flick fears got to the bitter fetus. I was afraid that shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, "unrecognized" directorial and editing style (first mentioned by Greengrass, the Parisian director Bloody Sunday) could spread to other films. Greengass's uncomfortable style was then brought to tirelessly new heights in the last two films of the Bourne trilogy. My fear has happened. In my opinion, these films are really bad by these motion-causing methods that cause blurry blurring for "action boost". But "Bourne Franchise", as Greengrass so loving calls her cow, apparently convinced the others in Hollywood to try unprofessional fast and big money. Read my lips, those Hollywood types. The action has to be clearly photographed and presented, not only by poor, lazy cinematographic techniques. And "The Supplier" goes so far as to imitate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in tirelessly repeating sound bites in the hope that their teenage (seemingly rated) audience can not feel them. For example, once I hear that the cop likes to yawn again "Yankee-Romeo," I'll just scream. It is likely that it will be good that I will not hear again. I will certainly never see the "Supplier" again. I recommend to those of you who have not yet seen the "Supplier": just be content with the peace that this deficiency brings to your life. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10; I'm tempted to reduce to 1.
