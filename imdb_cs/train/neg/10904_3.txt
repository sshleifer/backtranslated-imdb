I took this film and expected a few laughs, hopefully I enjoyed it too, but I was wrong. This film showed very minimal moments of humor, and pathetic jokes made me horrified that I was chasing him at any time ... Focused on the age group of 10-15 years, this film will surely leave audiences outside these borders who feel very dissatisfied. Not more than 3 votes are highly recommended for anyone who does not want to lose 2 hours of their life.
