How can anyone tell you that this movie is a comedy? If I was not with my finesse, I would fall asleep and ask for a refund. I like Gwen Paltrow, but it was like he was on the wrong set. I love most cats, but I hate that. This is the only moment I've seen so much luck and it's not turned on. These clothes were exaggerated. Nobody talks about it anymore, and I do not think they would. The dance part was terrible. My ex told me later ... "Did you not like her? Did not you think it was sensual?" I just said it to save her feelings. Now I know why we never married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
