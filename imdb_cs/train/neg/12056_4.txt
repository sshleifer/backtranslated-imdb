This film is a good example of how you can sell a movie through media manipulation, which is nothing more than a very unfortunate TV sitcom. In Puerto Rico, the daily newspapers with the widest circulation kept writing about the miracles of this film, almost silencing everyone else. Accidentally, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. The CLARIDAD weekly report is the only diary on the island that analyzed the form and content of the film and pointed out all its shortcomings, clich√©s and bad writing. Just because the movie is part of the audience laughing with easy and obvious jokes, and because it is possible to recognize actor and scenery, it is not an acceptable film.
