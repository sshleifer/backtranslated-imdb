Visually stunning? Definitely. I've seen some of the movies that sometimes resemble. Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow use remarkable cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically well-known, but something completely fresh. The time period seems to be the 1930s or the early 1940s. The film describes the recent attacks on New York City from mechanized army theft generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. The mysterious disappearance of the respective scientific minds is also the same. Who can stop them and save the world? Well, he does not come out of faith to know that it is Captain Sky himself with his horrifying reporter friend who is always hot on the lead, and on the wings is a trusted, intimately competent helper. What Sky captain has in the atmosphere and graphics lacking in storytelling and characterization. The story for this movie is ridiculous. That being said, the film is going for a series-like feeling of the movie series of the past. They had fairly long stories and bad acting - but none of them and I think none of them had the budget and the big names of this movie. Two artists who won Academy Awards and Jude Law could keep the movie over the water, he thought, but Sky Captain is disappearing. In spite of my fantastic dark appearance, I found he wanted the film to end and I could go with my life. I had little interest in the story that caused little interest. I did not care about any glib portraits. Paltrow was terrible. Jolie was a role joke with virtually no substance. The law can not carry on its limited arm the tradition of one-handed. I mean, let's say it is not Will Smith, Mel Gibson or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that he had kept so many promises that had been delivered so little. I was bored ten minutes into the movie - waiting for something that would interest me - and it never was.
