This film is fun enough due to Virginia Madsen's excellent performance and the fact that Lindsey Haun is beautiful. The reason why the movie is so predictable is that we've seen it before. I have never read the book Mother's Gift, but I hope that Britney and Lynne Spears are completely different from this movie. If you do not think you're going to end the movie with what is basically a music video original idea, the whole movie will mean the word plagiarizer.
