I admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and she's been doing the mission to see every movie he's been in (unfortunately, these are horror films Batman and Robin, Avengers) and this. <br /> <br /> It must be considered the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes, it is even lower than The Avengers). everyone seems lost and is inconsistent with conviction. <br /> <br /> Even if you think Uma is a goddess like me, please do not make this movie. you will be hated the following morning for it.
