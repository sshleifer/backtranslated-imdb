Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells are looking for a sunken treasure in the southern Atlantic. Wildlife Treasure Hunters fight against a group of territorial sharks with cute little smirks on hungry faces. Wilde and his merry men must find a way to get out of the menu so they can start digging out the old Spanish galeon full of gold. After the crew engages in a little eternity of pushing, arguing and listening to Wilde's unpleasant health tips, 5 crazy convicts board the ship and complicate things. Now it's a battle about who gets the treasure and who will see what the inside of the stomach looks like. At least Wilde has a shape that carries exactly the same thing he wore "Naked Prey" 10 years earlier and remained in excellent condition. Made from a budget of 75 cents.
