This movie is certainly one of the strangest themes in history - just where Ed Wood enjoys cross-dressing defense in "Glen or Glenda?" Subject: Playing bridge. Set of Park Avenue plays; The Czechs play it. The Russians - who speak very doubtfully "Russian" and have most unconvincing accents when speaking English - play in the restaurant where they work. If one does not care about the bridge - despite a great actress - he probably will not be much interested in this bizarre movie. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are all right. (No - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer - Lukas is unlikely Russian.) But they are all sinking with a script.
