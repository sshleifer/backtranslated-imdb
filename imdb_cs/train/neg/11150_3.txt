I watched the movie myself, in the dark, and was a full moon out there! I did not do it purposefully, it just happened. So all the elements were frightened for me! Well, it was not, in fact, I wanted to shut down the DVD player in just 8 minutes, but I thought I would make it a chance, unfortunately I did. The game was terrible, only with some decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The conspiracy is not original if you are a fan of horror, then it's just what you've seen many times before. Some scenes did not make sense at all and you feel like the director wanted to make a movie longer! Monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. Scenarios (scary) looked as if they were a horror film from the 1980s when there was not enough technology and yet some good movies were created! I was surprised to see the name of the main production company at the start of the movie, I thought they could not put the money into it and make it decent? I could no longer agree with the ratings that the film got, it's also my rating for it, 3 out of 10.
