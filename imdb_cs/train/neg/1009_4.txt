*** THE REVIEW MAY CONTAIN CERTAIN SPOILS *** I will make a short and sweet review. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it was interesting and there were some of the best actors, such as Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be, is not it? Well, it's bad enough. Justin Timberlake starred Pollack, a crazy journalist who has come across a case that can lead to corrupt cops at Edison's police corps. LL Cool J is Deed, a policeman under the force of a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Assault Assault Tactics). He is associated with an "on-the-edge" bad cop named Lazer (Dylan McDermott). On the opening scene, we see that Lazer & Deed pick up some bank robbers, but at night they are driving out a couple of people who make drugs. I do not want to go a long way, but things get worse for people doing drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to a lawsuit involving Deeds & Lazers. It's supposed to be a bad game, and with Ashford, some are being investigated to turn into ugliness. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), who is all within the F.R.A.T. the team joins Ashford to try to bring corrupt policemen to court. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you can say Freeman and Spacey's performance is quite faint. The only person who gives the overall performance is Dylan McDermott. In this movie, this is a very rare case, and it brought me out of the way of the believer. LL Cool J is horrible in this movie. He calls each line the same way and shows almost the same emotions. It was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The film starts with some nice action, but then it stretches its legs over the rest of the movie. The end is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Do not collect your time with this movie. I'm giving it on Ebay this weekend.
