It's nothing new to say: 4 hours of people die again and again in the same hill. Cast was stellar, but unfortunately the product / director / editor / god froze. He had to eat a humble pie (if not for himself, then for the men who died in Kargil), hired one of Bollywood's great directors, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who was not related in any way (and seemed , listening to some bad version of Apocalypse Now for some cheap Indian drug), hired a real professional crew, tossed all the fireworks and told a real story. Unfortunately, he, like the Indian army's bigwigs, made a decision that was terrible and terrible for his audience. We all died again and again. <br /> <br /> Please do not do it again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: Next Indian director decides to celebrate regiment Gurkha, I suggest he hired more than one Nepal to represent the team. Surely there are plenty of Nepalese men working in Mumbai - the last of them was 40,000 to half a million.
