Yes, it could be a good movie. Love biangle (apologizes for a poetic license, but it's not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately, wrongly said. The picture is sometimes weird, sometimes fine, the image looks overcrowded and narrow. Sound requires more attention (usually it does in Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes wrongly selected. The soundtrack is short and does not help to act. About acting ... I'm sorry, but the best actress is lady. Others behave unusually and can not convince the viewer. Efficacy is poetic if it were to be realistic and realistic if it were to be poetic. It is an adult image that the children said. Bother only if he is very curious.
