Eddie Murphy for Best Actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arcin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) goes through this film as a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? That worked ??? <br /> <br /> This movie gets rid of when compared to CHICAGO or just another recent musical piece. <br /> <br /> If it was not for the great singing and performance Jennifer Hudson, I would have it ZERO. <br /> <br /> And I've never seen the game stage so I will not make a typical rap Broadway vs. Hollywood rap.
