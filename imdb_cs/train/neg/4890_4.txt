The movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin), who has a male man he loves ... but he loves sex too! During the movie, she gets several men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a lesbian sequence (tame). This film gave Russe Meyer a map and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed X rated film. It was a big hit when he came out. Unfortunately, that's not good. <br /> <br /> This is well managed and Erica Gavin is great (whatever happened to her) and it was very colorful ... but according to today's standards it is extremely tame. I am surprised that she has a rating of NC-17 - there is no hardcore sex and only boots with no semi-shirts and no male nudity at all. It's also (sadly) pretty boring and adding the policy at the end was confusing (and quite stupid). It is worth seeing what was considered very shocking in 1968. I suppose I saw a cutting version (which has a rating R), but here I heard only a few seconds and it is missing. Meyer's next movie, "Doll Valley," is much better, and it's dated very well. Catch instead.
