Although the beginning of All Quiet suggests on the Western Front, this stupid and superficial version of the war neglects its much better contemporary. This shows the funniest war they have ever fought with the first hour and a half dedicated to romance and good times. When we finally see a battle, it's chilly: An enemy plane flies? Shoot it (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he can shoot. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Do not worry, they like to give up. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
