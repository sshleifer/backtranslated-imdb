This is a classic example of the growing problem with movies. Why is background noise and soundtrack dramatically louder than dialogue? What's the point? This film is not alone. It seems that most movies are doing it now. After two years, I was wondering if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV and there again. THE BASIC LEVEL, which could take place in the city block of actors, will drown the dialogue. It was even more disturbing in this movie because in English, such a woman is still muttering. I was hoping Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, tell me, or you pull the balls out of your mouth." If you watch it on DVD and you even have high school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles. I give it 4 because Reno was so good at Leona. People are pampered about the scenery, but I've seen it on TV and I've lived in the Rocky Mountains for several years, so "Enh".
