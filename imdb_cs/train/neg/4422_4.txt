This is a real bomb. We should believe that Merle Oberon is the secluded daughter of an ambitious politician who must show Tom DeLay from the 1930s that he stands for support as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and their quivering, shaky women and supported only by kind-hearted uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two girls in a blind spot and Gary Cooper happens to happen. Some rodeo shots could revive things, and la "Misfits", but no such luck with this. Gary later meets a formal dinner, chaired by Merle, and although invited to sit down and join the group, he reads a lecture about their snobbering. Where does the sudden eloquent difference between cowboys come from? The worst scene in the movie is a fantastic party that Gary holds in his unfinished house as his absent Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
