Complaints are valid, the biggest problem for me is that this soap opera is too focused on women. I'm fine with these night soap fabrics, like Gray's anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing, because stories that never end up are interesting. However, when the idea is parallel to today's soaps aimed just to get into the handsome men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps and the many ridiculous difficult situations in the so-called Small Hospital, ... or the female counterpart of Baywatch. That was what the men wanted and they had, so if that's what women want, it will be, but the idea that it's high eyebrows (or something the men will follow) is unrealistic.
