I will never forget the joke and the great comedy of ORIGINAL Vacation! Line, Pacing, and Event Timing in this movie are great! This continuation of European holidays is, however, significant. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Griswalds will win the European Holiday at the Game Show. The problem is that many jokes in the movie are slightly less than mild, "ha ha" laughs. For example, an airliner on an aircraft asks Clark: "Do you want your coke in a box?" Clark replied, "No, I do it here." That's really the only line that's fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> European holiday humor is tense. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first film, they tried to repeat the scenario that had been done before, and relied on the ridiculous script that listened to the slap-stick at the end of the picture just to kill time. /> <br /> Even worse is that natural comics such as Randy Quaid as Eddie's cousin and the original children who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie so well will not be found anywhere. Their substitutes are not fun, they can not act and they seem to move most of the time. There are also a couple of gross sexual jokes and comments that are not only fun but have a bad taste. The Griswalds should stay in Wally World. The place that made them legends! Do not join them in this terrible European adventure. Viewers should revisit the original film Holiday instead! You will be glad you did.
