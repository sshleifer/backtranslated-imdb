This film is a massive Yawn that proves that Americans have no joints of farce. Even if it's written for them! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is a funny comedy of mistakes that I would rate 8/10. It is not just a linguistic translation, but some absurd stories of events are skipped altogether, robbing the film of its original clever fractional nature and turning it into a cheap "oops going my go" style of farce.
