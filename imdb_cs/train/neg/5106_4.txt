ALIEN LOVE (This film is known in Britain) is a very strange movie. I do not think it's an esoteric art house in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I think it's TVM with an oath, sex, some really good T & A, a bad screenplay and a very retro feel. You can only imagine that someone like John Hughes is driving this ten years earlier, although of course he would have dropped T & A. Returning to a bad script, one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation, especially Amanda. Why do you pick Connie in the bar? Just to meet a stranger? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and many other films since the mid-eighties have had this type of plot, with most of them more defined and convincing than the ones seen here. The story goes on a poorly defined, unconvincing and illogical way <br /> <br /> It told me that I was looking for ALIEN LOVE observable and not just on T & A on the display. As a science fiction sex comedy, it's much better than FLESH GORDON and GIRL COUNTRY IS EASY
