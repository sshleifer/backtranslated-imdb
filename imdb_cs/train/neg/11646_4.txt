Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of the guys from the past who seem quite forgotten. I never thought his show was so great. This is one-dimensional characterization of the crime boss with very predictable results. If you take car walks and general grooving out there, there is not much development of plot or action. Mafia films I find boring because I have no respect or interest in ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian cinema, consider these boys to be heroes. I saw a movie and I do not remember much in a few days. Lots of shooting, dying innocent people, betrayal, and loyal loyalty. The film is pretty well photographed and the acting is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (due to the voices that just could not come from the bodies) that I almost started looking for Godzilla to approach the bay.
