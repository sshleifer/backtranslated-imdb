Do not rent to rent this movie. It has nothing to do with the flight of death, despite the English title. I can not think of the only good thing she could say about the movie. Weak acting, bad editing, bad direction ... ridiculous "plot" and sound / music was so irritating, it's surprising that this film does not contain a warning label. The only possible way to listen to this film and enjoy it is its historical quality of cheese. They just do not have to make movies so bad anymore.
