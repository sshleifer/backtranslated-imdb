I have always been a great Woody Allen fan and will always be for most of what he has done in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how boring, insignificant, demanding and, above all, horrifically acting the movie. Mental mental masturbation based on inconsistent reasons. And what catastrophic idea to artificially restore to the supposed "Allen Clone Actor," which is inserted into Will Farrell's mouth, and the gestures Allen made at Farrell's place, was 30 years younger. The result was obviously absurd. And not to talk about dialogue ... what was intended to be philosophical considerations turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual thinking without knowing its comical effect. How sad...
