I rented this movie yesterday, and I can barely express my disappointment in the little Laura Ingalls that I got involved in something so badly made. I'm not sure if it was horrible writing or bad overhead, or both, but it leaves the viewer very disappointed by the unnecessary time to watch this flush. It consisted of a weak naive line of the story, a very bad line, and relied solely on a beautiful scenery, and nice people to sell it. Unfortunately it was not enough. It would be better to rent a tape full of static than you would waste time on the bullshit. Lindsey Wagner also played a pretty pathetic part as a rancher owner who seems to be working hard, doing nothing, someone who has ever been near the ranch, knows that of course it was written by a young man from Los Angeles and not someone with great knowledge of the world.
