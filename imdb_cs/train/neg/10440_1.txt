If you are not 10 to 14 years of age (except R), there are very few things. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are funny and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can think of her surroundings but unfortunately it is. Bad fence. Bad action. Poor writing and delivery. Special effects are gloomy. Just as the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, the important individual anchored situations are equally terrible. If you consider the action parts, there are incredible action sequences in some movies that make you cruel and there are some that are running down you. This film contains only the second type. It leaves a small left. I'm so glad I do not pay for it. Despite all the hype, I can read and think, so when I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was a little afraid to go in. Still, like the wreck of a train, we can not just look away. And even without expectation, I set out. Bad. Not even "so bad, it's a good" material. I'm very tolerant of bad movies, but it does "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar Worthy. No, this piece above CGI'd garbage is in the same company as Battlefield Country, Little Man and Gigli. As it is currently rated 7.2 completely mystifies me. Washing brains or stacking a voting system is all I can think of as a response. I could go on, but I just need to say that tonight I witnessed the train wreck. I have to go wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
