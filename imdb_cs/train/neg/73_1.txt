It must be the worst piece of waste I've seen in a moment. Heath Ledger is the heart? He looked deformed. I wish I knew that he and Naomi Watts were real because I had spent the two longest hours of my life and I was wondering what he was seeing. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is the heart? When I look at his bearded beard and deer in the light, I can not say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he could not wait to get out. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the bankers and murderers? It's far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually a fun movie. It was trite, clich√© and boring. We stayed only because we were convinced that it would be better. It was not. <br /> <br /> Last 10-15 minutes or so was inadvertently cheerful. Heath and his band are thrown out of the border hotel, and women and children are dying for their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny to go out of the hotel with armor because we could only think of Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I was still waiting for them to say, "I'll bite you!" We laughed, as did several other curved listeners. When we left, almost everyone was talking about the time lost this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I did not pay the cash to see this disaster (preview) but it was definitely not free. It took me 2 hours of my life to never come back.
