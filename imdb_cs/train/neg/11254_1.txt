"The Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (an amazingly exhausted title) is simply a bad film; he has no heart, no deep thoughts, nothing special. Yes, the background of CGI looks interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an uncomfortable soft focus. In addition, the film uses music in the same way as, say, "Gilligan Island" or Scooby-Doo cartoons - NEVER STOPS. Strangely, just terrible. There are no fresh ideas, just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc, Bits taken from older movies and serials. There is no lock, the movie looks like it exists because it can do it. Save money and time. She did not want to have fun at all.
