Producers made a big mistake when they played Mark Lester, who could not act or sing in the title role. In addition to his very bad "acting," Lester's vocals had to be dubbed by a girl. I do not know why they dropped him off because there were so many boys who could play this role infinitely better and also sing. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, which was supposed to be just 16. The current version of the West End is much better than the movie in all directions. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and is certainly far better than Jack Wild. It was clearly political to give this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the stormy events of 1968.
