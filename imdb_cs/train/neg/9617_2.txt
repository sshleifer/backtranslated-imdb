Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) attended her friend at the lake when her brother fell out of the boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think it's time to stop hitting and congratulating her for something she did not control. Grab a stove and something to chew and go back to the same lake that was in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, the bloody bath has already begun when two friends are crushed several times before coming to the side. This movie has a feeling of high school, where everyone has forgotten their lines and "winged it" ... very badly! The writer Marcos Gabriel played a role as Rachel's friend Leo. Besides Fretwell and Gabriel, there are some pretty deceptive actors and a few characters you want to clean out of knocking before they get offed. Beware of several other players who have the nerves to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one memory day that you would not mind.
