The mood of this movie is pretty good and captures the feeling of 80s with good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script is running a mill except for a few comic moments and it looks strange where I expect it to be okay. Characters are totally more dramatic and incredible and full of right-wing cliches that the screenwriter probably saw watching a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. Check out all the right "art" boxes, but nothing happens and at the end you let yourself think about what it was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
