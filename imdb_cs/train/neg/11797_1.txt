Watching this movie was the biggest time loss and $ 2 for rental in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, it will be the greatest regret of my life. Who even thinks about this movie or funded, deserves to kick between their legs, because that's where they thought when they shot the movie. It's overweight a guy who is hopelessly romantic, and he writes a sharp smudge that tries to go down like poetry. He joins his beloved friend while on the coast. Where to meet girls and such. Only the fat guy does not get a girl. The movements on the skin do not disturb me, I take them for a nominal value. But this film is trying to be more than a skin film. This is a fat boy who seeks love in a girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl who has poetry. He has found out his talent for volleyball, which earns money for his family and affects ladies, but he has his lady as well. Dialogue is super awesome even for movie C. It supports the tone of black stereotypes, no character development, it is a celebrated porn film, without any porn in it. This movie will never shoot.
