Timberlake's performance almost hurt the screen. It was not all bad, I think the role of reporters is bad for him. LL Cool J played a typical rapper role, the heaviest, bad guy. I do not think she smiled smile in the whole movie, even if his girlfriend was designed. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made the entire film. He had some fun scenes that are the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad that he was just "there". <br /> <br /> Overall it's a Dull movie. bad land. many bad or bad roles for actors.
