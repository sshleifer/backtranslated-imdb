It seemed like a lot of people liked the movie, so I feel a little bad when it gives me a bad overview. But after sitting for 96 minutes, I feel like I have to do it. Where is the heck plot in this movie ?! I had to leave it, I waited for the story to unfold and nothing happened. Make sure the end was "somewhat shocking" but did not create. I forgot half the time, so they did not really improve. The effects were so - most of the time it was plausible but most of the time I could see it. So ... without doing anything, I have to say that if you do not like the actor in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could have been wrong, but I simply did not understand why there was so little or too much film. I can not decide which one to be, I say to the judge for myself. I do not even know if borrowing would be a good idea, cost and all ... Fence: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Purpose: 2/10 Total: 3/10 I feel it is really too high, I voted above.
