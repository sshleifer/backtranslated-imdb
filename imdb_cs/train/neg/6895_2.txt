The land is rocky. The act is somewhere south of Castle Jr. High School. Cinematography is not bad, but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I could not decide that it was deliberately a hockey movie or whether people actually thought it was a good movie. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running in a "lawless" modern city, wearing a fast-haul weapon. She has more than her fair share of "cutsey" things. Imagine good boys pulling into an old farm and parking Ford Mustang right in front of the railing. Imagine an office in a hotel that looks at the apparently western (hemisphere) movie sports Japanese soundtrack but with English subtitles. It's all weird, but it can improve when you look at it when you look at the little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western film clich√© that you can think of. There is even a modern version of the girls' hall with a good heart, and in the soundtrack a Jewish harp appears. Really! If someone brings you home on a Saturday movie session, tell them that your DVD player has died.
