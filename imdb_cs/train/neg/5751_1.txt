The film must be filmed in one day, there are scenes where you can see the camera's reflection and its red pointer, even the green light scenery that mixes with the actors !!! The story and the lines are really terrible without even the slightest inspiration (at least as a thriller genre film). Everything he has in connection with Poe in the movie has a shallow and childish approach. The film is full of clich√©s and is not exciting. If you want to watch a fun b-movie for a relaxing evening with friends and then go for enjoying it (just like me), but there's no way to take this movie seriously!
