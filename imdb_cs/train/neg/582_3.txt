A brilliant book with beautiful characterizations and insights into human nature, especially the nature of addictions that still resonate. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate dependence on circles and circles, and the circle around everything, which made the viewer quite unsatisfactory. Why the director did not stop this is out of my mind - but maybe he was too busy trying to earn some good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately revealed actors. Overall, this is a poor adaptation. Your three hours would be better to spend reading (or re-reading) the book.
