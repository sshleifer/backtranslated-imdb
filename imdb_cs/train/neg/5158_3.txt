Sometimes doing something strange and contemporary is not always beneficial to everyone. While I admit that the script and the concept of the film were rather interesting, the realization of these ideas in a similar story simply did not work. This movie was so terribly slow and unnecessary, even Robin Williams could not save this waste. Obviously, Barry Levinson's dream had fallen on his face, but he had to warn the rest of the world.
