This Italian film is basically soap opera with leather. The box says it was labeled as "R", but on the actual tape inside it was said "X." The other makes much more sense, because near the end is a short scene that was shocking. Even in the dark, Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers saw the sex on this guy - and yes, you saw his cock in his mouth. Somewhere I read that this was the first time an "actress on the main stage" did something like that on the screen. Detmers, after several scenes, appears in the nude, but her face was even better than her body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly ... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended, even though Detmers look.
