OK, I really do not have much to say about this movie, other than this: I've seen over 4,000 movies in my life and more than 2,300 of them were horror films. While I have some difficulty in deciding what is best (unlike my favorite one that I can tell you is that it is George A. Romero, "DAWN OF THE DEAD"), I can tell you without a doubt that ZOMBIE BLOODBATH from Todd Sheets is the absolute worst horror film I've ever seen. There is nothing positive about this movie. Acting, dialogue, direction, makeup, music ... Every aspect of this movie is just as far below what is acceptable as it reminds me that it was sometimes even released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a horror or zombie movie fulltist, please be alert to my warnings and do not waste your time on this garbage. It is no pleasure for it to be from this point of view. You will not even have the laughter of utter illusion on the display ... Trust me. Please.
