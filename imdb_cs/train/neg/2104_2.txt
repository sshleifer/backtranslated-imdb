I bought this video on a Walmart trash at $ 1. I think I'm paid !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi created a long string of third-year films for small studios (in this case Monogram - those who produced most of the Bowry Boys films). While the poor majority of these films do not reach the levels of horror that his latest films (Ed Wood's "classic," such as the bride's monster and plan 9 of the universe) have reached, they are poor films that should be avoided by all but the strongest fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old film addict, so I tried it. In addition, some of these smaller films were really good - not exactly this. Lugosi is what else, a crazy scientist who wants to keep his fairly bizarre and violent woman living serum he creates from the young bride. They have never really told why the bride must be, or why it must be a woman, or even what a wife's illness is - so you can see that the plot has never really been destroyed. a really annoying reporter (like Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all the obvious murders in which the bodies were created! So he follows some traces to the Lugosi Gate. Lugosi's house is complete with his crazy wife, assistant, and two strange people who are obviously sons of assistant (an ugly, hideous sexual friend and dwarf). Of course, this merciless reporter has repeatedly fouled the whole movie - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! In the end, the maniacs are all dying - mostly because of their own hands and everything is good. Finally, the reporter and the doctor she's just met decide to get married. And naturally, the reporter's cameraman is disappearing when that happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of faintness in this movie. Or perhaps because he was such a slow and cumbersome movie he just fell asleep!
