Life is really too short for such movies. I knew it was not good when I realized what I had already anticipated - that David Schwimmer would play exactly the same type of person who plays in Friends. this guy can play nothing but a boy, or he will never offer any other parts. I feel like it's a mixture of both. And I have to say that it is extremely hard to love a movie that totally loses the great talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
