Let's go to the pursuit: This movie is softcore pornography sold for the masses under the name of the studio and milking every last penny out of the American pie of oxygen. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole conspiracy (and it should not mean it's a lot of work) serves as a means of showing audiences to more cats and sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are a Tween person and you are too pitiful to buy real pornography, then it's the film for you. Otherwise, the film has nothing to offer. Acting is part par, character development is virtually non-existent, and the story is a nonsensical rhythm of nudity, binge drinking and jokes (none of which are particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go buy real porn if it's what you want to see, and if not, go watch a good movie. The animal house, the children or even the original American cake are all great cinematographic works and all contain heavy drinking and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not how much, it's the way you use it"
