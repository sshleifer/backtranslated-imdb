I hear the rumors about the upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates a Blu-ray Disc". With advances over the past 25 years, from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if franchising can be revived again. I just hope that it will help eliminate the bad taste left in the mouth by the entire Magnavision demonstration fiasco. And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates Betamax VCR" was a great milestone in the history of entertainment. After trying "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates a compact cassette," and a completely sleepy "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates an 8-Track Tape", who would expect such a famous cinema? Right now I cry, I just think about it.
