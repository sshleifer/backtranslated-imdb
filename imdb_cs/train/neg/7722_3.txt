Extremely bad action movie, always played by Wood Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee, trapped in a side role that never seems to gel. The action is in the best of the average, some nudes have fallen and yes, Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> Set-up is the usual renegade who has been forced to break into a new partner in a big case, manufacturers are at least trying to give a pattern of twists that Lundgren makes a policeman with Oriental values ​​and Lee's modern city slicker, but there is a zero character development making it almost comical, the Lundgrens oriental warrior suit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed. The action sequences are numbers, and Lee (who would go on to become an excellent Vranue) never has enough space to show some special martial arts brilliance. But because of his famous parent, he had to be under great damn pressure and was far better than to have to live on his father by making a very different role in The Workah that showed what a unique actor could be if not for his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> If your tough Lundgren fan or fan of the poor 80 stylish action movies (you think Cobra, etc.) then avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
