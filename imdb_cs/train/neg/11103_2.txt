Okay, so I saw the movie, even if it came out last year ... I thought it was a decent film, except for the act that was stupid and terrible ... First, we'll never know anything about your shapes, why did they appear when they did in our world and were really on Earth before we were, or were they just coming out of space? Secondly, the butcher's role to keep order is just as obviously created ... Really how big could be an underground substation? There were just so many creators, so I think instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could only plant some tactical bombs, or maybe clean up you and Nuke would do it. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not see killing people as necessary ... Third, Leon acts like a Superman to jump on the train and fight with Vinnie Jones, who is getting higher and higher. Again, when he is standing in front of a conductor, he does nothing and acts as a watchman and observes all the abominations. I think OK, the conductor had a creepy helper (lol), but if Leon was so courageous, he would go all the way ... I think by first risking his life, then he will not say exactly if he had. He could die like a hero, but he lives like a coward ... this may be the case, but not because you've shown so much fighting before ... Then the cop ... come on! It was a city with a subway, I bet other police officers had to be there, except for this lady, other police stations, it was really a little stupid ... Overall, Vinnie Jones's great acting, an interesting idea of ​​what is not built at all. .. By the way, what are the signs on the chest? Vinnie Jones can not do the rest ...
