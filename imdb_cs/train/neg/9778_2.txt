I'm sure Operation Dames was a favorite when driving all day. There is absolutely nothing you could miss if you were otherwise concerned. And if you need to get into the mood for other activities, you should pick some nice billiards on the screen to get you in the mood. Otherwise, there is not much to Operations Dames. It is set in the Korean War, when the GI platoon along with British Tommy gets too far ahead and has to return to the UN lines. It's pretty bad, but these guys also hit a tangled line of girls USO and their choreographers in the same situation. Do you know what is sad that this film is such, the army and in combat situations. These USO bimbos set women's backstage liberation. In fact, even a hard-working professional soldier who is the sergeant responsible for these men can keep it in his trousers. But it was probably better when I reminded them of what they were doing on arrival. This name is not better, and I do not recognize any of them for any individual effort. Operation Dames is definitely a team flop.
