NEVER in this movie is funny. I thought that the premise that gives the person an early ram libido was interesting and should have some laughter. POORLY! The movie is simply fun. For example, the main character who makes a goat in the warmth in the middle of a farm yard is not funny, bordering on obscenity. They play with this bestiality on one level, and that's just fun. We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character does it with everybody, everywhere, it's always not funny. It's a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, in my opinion, acceptable in this role. So I think he's not a bad actor, but with rotting material it's difficult to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the second half of human romantic guides (counting the number of animals that the main character is interested in as romantic love?), It seems to be the whole thing, it should be the same. It seems to be acting in some vacuum, separate from all other actors in the movie. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie only if you want to get bored of tedious, boring, repetitive material.
