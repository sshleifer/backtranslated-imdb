I saw this video in a friend's house. I'm glad I did not lose the money I bought this purchase. The video cover has a scene from 1975 Capricorn One. The film starts with several clips of rocket explosions, which are mostly unrelated to crew flights. Sibrel's smoke gun is a short video clip for astronauts who are preparing video broadcasts. It adjusts our own voice instead of listening to what the crew has to say. The video ends with a view of the movie Zapruder. His claims about radiation, shielding, stellar photography and others lead me to believe he is extremely unconscious or has some ax to grind against NASA, astronauts or Americans in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
