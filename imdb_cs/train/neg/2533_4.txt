I agree with most, if not with all previous comedians Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi Series is a great study of the character combined with a great fight with the sword and excitement. So far I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 were not released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi, Outlaw, was disappointed. The story line was complicated and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many original Zatoichi lines. At one point, I wondered if I had seen the remake of the previous movie Zatoichi. This film was disappointing because it began to depend on the effects (head of rolling, cut limbs, blood) and less on the nobility of the character Zatoichi. All of the previous films have been successful in action and action and have achieved great results without having to resort to the effects. I hope the remaining films Zatoichi DO NOT HAVE the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film from his studio. I highly recommend all previous films Zatoichi - and I recommend them.
