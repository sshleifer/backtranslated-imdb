"Say Yes" is one of those movies you still hope to improve, but it's never. It's a kind of "psychopath without motives that decides to endanger an innocent couple," which is so loved by filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is clumsy and poorly translated in several places. The game is equally poor, especially from the villain who plays Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by constantly blinking and trying to speak deeply, his character is terrifying when all he really does is make it look a little simple. The act deserves special mention, since it is idiotic over all faith. "Heroes," I do not think it's too strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The "heroine" twice manages to see the villain when it's less than an hour away from her. The villain walks past a police checkpoint (when he's wearing a blood-covered shirt and a bleeding bandage) by showing the cops a burned corpse on the passenger seat of the car they drive. The villain is stamped, jagged and stuck with a fork, but these heavily injured difficulties never seem to be. And do not even start me with that awful end. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> Sang Mi Chu is the only plus point for this movie. Who is very nice, but really nothing but an average actress. Overall, this film is a poorly written, miserable and shocking overhead attempt to copy "The Hitcher" and "Spoorloos," but fails every step due to lack of talent among all involved.
