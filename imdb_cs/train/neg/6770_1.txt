I went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. I insisted that we should go to matinee, not because I was stiff, but just feeling that I had. In the spirit of NASCAR, it is a sponsorship dream. Such flashy advertising almost qualifies as info-mercial if it was not for the so-called Acting. In line with tradition, Herbie continues franchising with his stories about the story, the car is just a "vehicle" (without a pun) for this film. Earlier doses of Herbie (although cheeses) have been produced at more severe times, making it easier for them to digest. Ms. Lohan, the dramatic Queen of Disney, has little acting ability. I was surprised that Mr Keaton and Mr Dillon would be involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was bigger ripoff!
