Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very unpleasant film at all. The film promises Ustinov is released from prison for embezzlement. He persuades Robert Morley to leave to take his identity and start hacking on computers in a very imaginative company controlled by Karel Malden and Bob Newhare, another unusual film director. Morley just sounds like "Marie Antoinette" did in 1938. Perhaps he had to return to this genre. The film is at best ridiculous. It is hard to believe that in the following year Maggie Smith completely changed her way and released a fragmented Oscar performance in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." <br /> <br /> Smith is here to look like a seemingly stupid red head, but the end of the movie is the brain of the dress. Pity the song was not so bad with her.
