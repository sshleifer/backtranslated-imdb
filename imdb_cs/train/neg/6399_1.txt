One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics have changed into pieces for baby brothers. Both were sold in this, worse than Pryor's character. Two: a terrible, too sentimental script that could be used in Harold Lloyd's film, so clich√©. Three: Selection of black actors as toys; the racial subtext of this is intolerable, as never dealt with. There is no message, Pryor's part might play a comedy actor. Four: The boy ... I wish I could come back in time and prevent him from ever participating ... it would mean movies like this one and the Kid Could not have been made ... and my childhood would be free of their strength in mind. So if you want to watch a couple of cool comics diving in a sick, sweet baby, go on. To see them in something good, look at Pryor's old act, and Gleason in something better like a honeymoon.
