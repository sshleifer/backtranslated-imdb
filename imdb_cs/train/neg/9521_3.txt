This movie has been getting a lot of play over the day over the course of the day either on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that people would be interested in comparing it with Leonard DiCaprio / Tom Hanks capers of the same name. The only reason to see them is attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Even though I must say that Matt had been in his teeth for more than a while when he was a college student. If he were a woman, they would have to play it on a high teacher's mother! (Is it just me or is his daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yeah, conspiracy - who cares about it? Typical adolescent highjinx played by adults.
