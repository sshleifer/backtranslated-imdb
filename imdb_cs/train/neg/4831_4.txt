I rented the movie on Netflix after winning all the Oscars to see if it's really that good. Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrait (mostly) group of soldiers rotation in Iraq. The film centers around Will James, a ruthless soldier who will repair his adrenaline rectification to take risks and get rid of bombs. Where this film does not seem to have the layout and direction of the film in my mind. This movie does not have a clear conspiracy, unlike other films like Black Hawk Down. What this movie is trying to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes to the war. Bigelow does a good job of focusing on characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to stretch. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but it's like a 3-hour movie. One scene in the film, which was particularly horrible and destroyed by the creature with perfect credibility, was a sniping scene in the middle of the film. It was both unrealistic and very long. Overall, I thought this movie was OKAY, but the reason I gave it 6th place 7 was because it was a big disappointment for getting the best picture on Oskarach. I felt that this movie could have been much better when he thought Ryan was losing the lost image, but he was much better than the movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down, who won only 2 Oscars. Frankly, I do not know how this has won. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action packs of war, ask Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten for a year or two.
