This is a weak film with a restless history of slices and renown. It does not work at all. First, dramaturgy is fine. Initially, it moves very slowly and then moves quickly and unsatisfactorily to the end. But it is also (and this may have to do with the cuts) a turbulent movement between genres. It starts to be a thriller to be taken in nominal value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the end may be funny, but it's also so dull that I almost felt it offended my intelligence (which is scarce). So the movie tries to be everything, but it does not at all succeed at all. You can also see that in a very unstable character development. You almost have the impression that Connery plays three roles rather than one.
