The worst movie I've seen a long time ago. An interesting first half with a certain pilgrimage dialogue between dubious characters in the late night bar. The film then degenerates into a formless series of visual shock scenes (reading disgust) without redeeming observations or lessons about humanity or anything else. I wanted to leave, but the director was present at this show, and my courtesy prevents me from showing disrespect. Yet time is precious (as the director himself said in his introduction), and I really apologize for the time I lost in the second half of this. <br /> <br /> Saving mercy were the three main characters in the first half of the film, especially female leadership.
