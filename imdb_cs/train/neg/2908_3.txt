Based on one book, Gabriel Marquez, and it may be great literature, this adaptation of the cinema is really upset because it's more like a fight against sleep than enjoying some cinematic experience. The story is about an old couple whose son died and lived a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and where the main character is a faucet that hopefully will one day bring some money to the approaching cock. I have no mood to pour more words on this unnecessary hard work, maybe you can see Salma Hayek but sit 90 minutes before your screen? No Grace .....
