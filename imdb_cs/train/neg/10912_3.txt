I did not like this movie so much. It was not funny, and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely an extremely talented individual, and while his acting was fine, it seemed like he was really bad for him. I think there were some parts that were fine and somewhat funny in a cute form, but that's all about it. The only thing that caught me all the time over the humorous jokes was that there were some pretty good looking women, and I'm not one to watch the film just because of it, but in this case it was the only corner where the the smallest redemption case. Overall, it was a few slots below the average movie! <br /> <br /> Final Quest: <br /> <br /> Theaters: So I'm glad I did not get too much money for it. > <br /> Buy DVD: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rent: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, why not.
