I saw this movie the next day in the movie school class, and before that I did not see Almodovar's movie, but I expected it to be good. Unfortunately it turned out to be an unnecessary film with just a few smiles that mingle with two hours of utter boredom. High heels are just a collection of random scenes that could work in their own separate films but together they do not contribute to any meaningful whole. Or so I thought. The second day my film professor spent the whole class and explained all the hidden details of the film, such as wall painting depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers behind the drag dragos scene, is a commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation developed under a fascist rule. It looks like the whole movie is full of clever little visual tricks and similar links. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. In order to create a good film, you need more than depth and complexity - you still need to give the audience a reason to pay attention, something that would interest the viewer enough to really care about all the gentle tricks. High heels give us strange, hostile characters, but they keep them in predominantly secular situations recycled from other films, and it seems Almodovar does not use them to make any point. What, for example, is the significance of the hitchcock-like surprise character that appears at the end of the film? Why is it there? Just surprise us? There is one fun scene about the news. And that's the only fun moment. The rest of the film is simply nonsensical film links and visual hints that apparently only exist to show us how intelligent Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it's better than making the movie good.
