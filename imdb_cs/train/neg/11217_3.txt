So my wife and I have done it despite several threats from both of us to turn them off. It was the worst part of this film, with very little excitement. Effectiveness was unfortunate until we laughed several times in some worse scenes (for example, Church Lady). The Dead Nurse used supernatural means to connect with her living twin, though she was sending useful information, concentrating on trying to frighten her, which seemed more like a ring. Rather, get involved in the police - which I'm sure the stuff you discovered would have DNA over everyone - instead, they invent a terrible plan to "get" a man who masked the accidental death of his sister. I call it a terrible plan because it will eventually allow her to kill her, which then darkens the film. Poor dialogue, bad behavior, bad ending.
