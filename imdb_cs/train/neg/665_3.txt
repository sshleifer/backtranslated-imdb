In Bridgeport, frightening teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with teenager Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); is witnessing murdering her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for a lifetime. Three years later, traumatized Donna feels better, but he's still under psychological treatment and taking pills. In her dream she will talk with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two pairs of friends at Pacific City. But psychopath Richard escaped from the prison and is housed on the same floor at the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing his friends and staff at the hotel that is on his way. The unforgettable slash "Prom Night" is a collection of clichés with an absolute lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and stupid, with poor acting of Johnathon Schaech as a mad killer. The predictable scenario is amazing because it is possible to predict what happens in the next scenes. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("Death invited to dance")
