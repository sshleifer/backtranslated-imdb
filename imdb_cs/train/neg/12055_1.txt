Do not waste your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the form of cinematography. When every third word is devoted to the wrong language and there is no real plot, just like old actors who still give the same dated performances from the past and have not developed in their careers, they leave a lot of what to say. I was expecting something better than the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The faith that others may have for the Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by garbage like the Maldeamores. An incorrect word at a given moment in a movie can be used to emphasize the view, and it may even be humorous or sad depending on its context (see, for example, Elsa and Fred) but should not penetrate the plot. The film is completely embarrassed and there was nothing ridiculous or even cute about this movie.
