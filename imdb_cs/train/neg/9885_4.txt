He only received the third payout (Arthur Treacher and Virgini Field), but this played the first role of David Niven, and it is a charming fool like the crazy Bertie Wooster, a master of Jeff Weshouse, who is the most determined.

Unfortunately, "B" movie mysterious tropics and forced comedy are growing for a short 57 minutes. The next year (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more out of the mark without Bertie being in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Forced to play.
