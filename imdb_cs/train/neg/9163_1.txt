Leap Years plays several heavy hitters on the local and regional film and television scene. And yet they can not save this movie. She has so many things to do - gaming, too melodramatic, bad scenario, inconsistent direction; and too few things - decent music, good cinematography. This note is primarily intended for anyone who, right after watching this movie, throws all local movies in one basket and says all local movies are bad. Please do not decide the rest based on this movie. This is a television soap mask like a romantic feature film. My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were five minutes into the movie.
