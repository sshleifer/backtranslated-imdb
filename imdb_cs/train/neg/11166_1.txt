I'm sure deep inside Jack Black's niches is the nature of Nacho Libre absolutely cheerful, but it's not. You can tell ol jacks who have a whale for some time hammin to play a decent, slim Mexican monk with us that he will become a wrestler but this film is a complete wreck in almost every department. <br /> <br /> I just sat there through most of the movie thinking, "It's supposed to be funny," and "That's the guy out of tough D right?" The truth is the movie that NEVER will offer. AT ALL! It is a miserable scenario with ragged characters and really naff works and directs. You will be watching the endless moments when you think something about entertainment will surely happen, but you will not. I was boring stupid about 10 minutes, but he would certainly have picked it up. No. About 90 minutes later, I barely managed to calm the aneurysm that was painful. It's like, remember years ago when you see something with your favorite actor, even some of their really morning parrots before they were famous, and you would be really embarrassed that the actor was really in such a burst of poplar. Yeah, that's it. I've already enjoyed some of the previous Jack Black movies, like Shallow Hall, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny, but I'm coming to a man. If you do it again, Jack, I gotta get there and knock on my knees or something. At least I'm serious about it. I know it's a clich√©, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for many reasons ....
