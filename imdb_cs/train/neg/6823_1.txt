I had to trust my instincts: No expectation - no disappointment. Instead, however, I expected a similar masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is not, in my humble opinion, anything but a cheap attempt to raise money for the cultural success of her predecessor, and - artistically - it is unfortunately failing. It seems that a producer collected the remaining Koyaanisqatsi material, hurriedly put it together, placed everything in a slow motion, and got a pop artist under the pseudonym Philip Glass to hurry up the banal music in the background that is constantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi seizes the viewer with clever fast and slow changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of slow-moving worldly pictures (if you see them on a VCR in quick view mode, you'll see what I mean). What was most disappointing to me was the sound of Philip Glass. I could not - and still can not - believe that these New Age advertising sound drones, which could simply be composed in one afternoon at any 14-year-old on Casio computers, came from the same composer who so brilliantly composed emotionally and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi . Overall, it's a big waste of time! My advice: Forget Commercialism! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again!
