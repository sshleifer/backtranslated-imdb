I do not know who wrote this movie, but from the first moment I was irritated. Of all the possible decisions they could make in the mountains, why do they decide which is the most dangerous of all? Why are the criminals behaving stupidly, even if they managed to get a lot of money from the bank and get along with them? Why does the main helicopter do not penetrate the helicopter, do not shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the cat as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I give this film 5 points for a nice action and a great scenery, but because of the illogical behavior of the characters, I can give this movie 1 point ...
