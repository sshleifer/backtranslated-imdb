It's not a whole new story line, but this romantic comedy makes the concept of work. A young man (John Cusack) and a drop of dead beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet by accident and ask if they are designed for each other. Although both are promised to others ... so odd that they still feel that their mental friend is out there. In some places, it's a bit sappy, but viva la love. To be romantic, I almost have to be riveted. My favorite scene is where the Cusack is on the ground and the snow starts to fall. The final is almost too sweet, but it deserves the most. This is not one of the deeper roles of Cusack, but whoever could not beat Beckinsale into hell. Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is extraordinary and entertaining. Watch this with your mental friend.
