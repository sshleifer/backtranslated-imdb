This movie is terrible. CGI is a very cheap gray CGI blob. The crocodile looks like a big gray smudge. The worst thing is that there is no attempt at walking or looking alive. This is mostly a CGI that is placed in scenes and you almost expect to see a hand that moves CGI blurred across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. In addition to the terrible lack of special effects, it is composed of typical low-budget actors who are probably working as waitresses / waitresses at local guests while waiting for their big breaks. Perhaps the most advanced scene in this movie is when one of the villains attempts to sexually attack Kate and the huge crocodile jumps directly from the water to the second floor of the Villains headquarters and across the balcony and pulls the wrong guy Kate instead of collapsing straight down the building Kate crunches), Croc is just flying back at the same angle into the water. No laws of physics apply to this film or special effects. At least between crocodiles is an honor.
