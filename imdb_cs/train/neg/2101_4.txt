Bernard Rapp died last year and was a highly cultured journalist. The cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a huge worldwide movie dictionary), and he had to make a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left have brought tepid shows: "Tiré à Part" (1996), although the stunning performance of Terence Stamp was highly characterized by character portrayal, "Affaire De Goût" (2000) Giraudeau released a perverse performance, "Pas Si Grave" ) was another flight-down and "un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is as captivating as its predecessors. His comedic potential is exhaustively exploited. <br /> <br /> And yet the initial idea can predict an awful, spiritual comedy. Couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who invited their friends, in full motion in a lascivious estate. To play with their guests, they pretend to share each other. And things do not go according to plan, because the announcement of their separation is not surprising. Both lovers begin to think about the validity of their couples. Despite the seductive scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal, Rappovo's undiminished overhead did not have the ability to give the life of the game unexpected consequences. Disruption follows a well-worn pattern with characters that have specific known features and masks that are revealed about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall. The bad editorial will slightly increase the film with this bad Rapp habit to shoot many sequences suddenly. Even honest inputs of actors in the company are debatable. They seem to be bored and present their texts rather than live, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon caught up in deep bankruptcy. It is regrettable to say that Bernard Rapp's films have never met his intentions as "un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence".
