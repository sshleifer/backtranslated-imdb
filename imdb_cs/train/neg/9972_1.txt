THE PROBLEM OF CHILD is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last ten years! This is a bad movie about a wild boys who have taken on two parents, but he gets into trouble later. The young man can drive the grandfather. It can scare people with a bear. It can light a room! It's a bad movie just like BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The sequel is an even worse fate. SET THE CHICKEN RUN. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** I give it.
