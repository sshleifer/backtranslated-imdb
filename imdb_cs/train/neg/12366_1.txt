"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that can become classical characters created by Chuck Jones. "Loony Tunes" have many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others are not much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is stupid and derived from games like "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There was no resemblance to the original characters, and the stories were boring and bad. New designs are ugly and animation is pathetic. This show just does not work. This terrible waste of animation is a complete failure, and it should be nothing but a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
