I saw this movie in a "thumbnail preview" and I must honestly admit that I do not like movies with Meryl Streep so much. This was the worst picture. Half of the theater did not come back after half-time. I could not blame them if it was not a true story, there was absolutely no need for the other half of the picture. Just before the movie goes forward in about ten years, I myself expected the credits to appear.
