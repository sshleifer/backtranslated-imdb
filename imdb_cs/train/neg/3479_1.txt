I went to see this movie in cinemas and I was shocked when I got into the room. It was just me and my girlfriend! It was shouting that this film is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not only because of my surprise the film was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a man who buys a family at Christmas. It is a very predictable story that falls in love with a girl who hates him. His acting is OKish, but it's not very good for the comedic aspect of the film. The land line is bad and comedy almost does not exist. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very entertaining. I hope this review will stop other people wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I went out of the room!
