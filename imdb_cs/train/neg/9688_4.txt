Greenaway's films are smart, erudite, and innovative. Still, his style and grammar come from and remind the audience of films from World War 1 film productions: frame composition, medium shot, static camera. Perhaps it would be good to brush against the mainstream with this style, but it is not new. Perhaps like the other "innovator," TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than he is looking forward to or could be a real innovator. But Greenaway's biggest mistake is that he can not write. His dialogue and even the fence structure is mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most obvious, its humor is ready and logical, so the joke is dead before it is released. The result is a tedium: if it's not funny, it failed: ask the comedian to justify his act if the audience does not answer. Perhaps the director read well, he could have learned something about Freud. Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway manipulated his actors for years to work as clones. He talks about lines with boring, emphatic air like narcissistic adolescents. This film, despite its design and lighting, is simple.
