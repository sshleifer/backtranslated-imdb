This film had the potential to be a decent horror film. The main character was well done and I was sorry for him and there was a decent amount of story. However, everything else is angry. Director Emmanuel is very incompetent in the film. He uses some of the most idiot shots anytime. <br /> <br /> - a couple of random sequences of random shots scattered in the movie. I do not know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic, but he was not. It was stupid. Random trailer shots in which the main character lived, random buildings, random buildings, random cats leaving. WTF? And clouds. Lots of gloomy dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - He really liked this technique that the scene was cut into different shots, rather than just one continuous shot. EX: Guy tries to shine the grass and the camera around him. Instead of a single bump it adjusts like 10 different shots so it's really EDGY! and HIP! a SMART! stupid. Actor acting is terrible, but that's what makes the movie so funny. A scarecrow is a gymnast who turns, turns and turns around. And some of them could have been better. You expect the main smash to have a long, well-built death, but not. Simple corn in your ear. The love interest was hot. Sensual. That's why this movie gets 2.
