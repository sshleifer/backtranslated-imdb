I heard about this movie and I knew it was not good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and interested me. It could be a great, dark black satire in today's morals in the media. Small ideas of any dissatisfaction were good. He's building on something I do not want to miss. But when the so-called show starts, everything becomes unlikely, cheap and quite stupid. Here's where the writer had to add something that people would think. But instead it is packed and provided that people are stupid. The end is so bad I'll do it 1. While the movie starts promising.
