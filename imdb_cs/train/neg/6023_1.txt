It reminds me when I was a reborn believer who will be the minister. I never thought I would be a minister or even a high school graduate, because I was almost positive that I'd suffered in heaven before it ever happened. That was before I found out that Christianity is a lot of garbage. I am now an atheist, and it only proves that "once saved" has always saved "a doctor that Christians tell us that he is not more real than elves. If that was true, why did I leave for many years to a devout reburied believer? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed with this stupid sinful prayer with all my heart. If Christians read their Bible, they found that their god thinks of rape, genocide, abortion and many other atrocities is all right. They might be surprised to find that where there is no mention of "terrible".
