I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could not believe what I see. There are no signs, just a few stereotypes that roam and kill. The scope of character development gave each character a name and a profession, and that is about it. There was no real conspiracy, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes began by themselves, coming from nowhere with a crazy techno track. When I watched this movie, I kept asking, "Where is it going? What's going on?" It was a dramatic dramatic quality with a hard wooden gift as if the readers were reading the cards without understanding their lines. Their trouble conveying the lines was even more evident from the terrible sound. The ADR sounded as if it were recorded in an open room. The actors constantly watched to hit their mark and looked almost robotic in their movements. So these headless machines are driven by a series of unpredictable and confusing scenarios, often without the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. That's what's happening, now it's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. She certainly does not cost nine bucks.
