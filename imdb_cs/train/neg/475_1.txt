One of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit when I watched it. I saw this film in the class of American history and the aim was to see the impetus for the life of a farmer in the West in the late eighties. What we saw was that the pigs were shot and then defeated, human birth, branding. And at the end was the live birth of the calf and let me tell you that the birth itself was not too bad, but the many fluids that came out led most people into my classroom into the bathroom. The story itself was fine. The assumption of the story is the widow and her daughter, and they move west to become the home of this cowboy. They live in the life of suffering and are an interesting fairly accurate view of life in the West in the late eighties. But if you have a choice, you do not see this movie.
