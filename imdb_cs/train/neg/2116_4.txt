Horror photos from the 1930s and 1940s from Poverty Rowe suppress me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but those that are produced at this time have such a scary and shabby look at them - and in the end they just are not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more fun than "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Man of the Sun", but it's not a classic. Bela Lugosi, the long past of his "Dracula," is playing another mad doctor; Unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains the dubious young reporter (Luana Walters), the coffin is much more comfortable than the bed. Blow him. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also on hand, which would delight fans of 30s and 40s.
