I decided to watch this show after seeing endless ads on BBC in the weeks before it started. I watched despite the fact that I do not like the difficult things Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry for your fans, but I think we have this new Emperor's work with this author). I admit that the acting is great, it is beautifully shot and I enjoyed it sensibly - however, I found that the story is extremely thin and after watching all three episodes, I feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. "Explicit" homosexual sex that the media was pampering was done several times on television - several times - so I was afraid. Full marks for production values ​​but low value for story / content I'm afraid.
