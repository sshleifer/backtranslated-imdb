I've always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when Sci-Fi Channel was running this movie, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is Wonder Woman just in the title. the right costumes (he had to reject or ordered major changes) and the plot runs like a crazy man James Bond. There is nothing of what makes a comic hero success, ie superhuman strength or determined will. It's just one long bad dream. I do not think Cathy is just as appealing. It's not time.
