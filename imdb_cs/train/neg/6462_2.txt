This awful movie shows that even some of Gollywood's best can not save a real landfill .. I could spend a lot of time describing everything that was wrong in this effort, but that would take more time, you've lost 91 minutes of watching ... IT . <br /> <br /> Look at this now, after Brand's death, shows how the tragic life of one of our greatest actors has become. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill in additional lines to accept it. I have to fill in another series to accept it. I have to fill the other rows to accept it. <br /> <br /> Do not collect your time with this movie. I need to do something interesting. Goodbye.
