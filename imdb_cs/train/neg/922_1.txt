This movie is exactly what you get when you really cross your skills, it's like someone who has just passed the test and then kicked them into the Grand Prix Formula 1 (I can not say that the Grand Prix USA, how could everyone get away with the ugly tires and you can only win), it is to what extent this film is falling. Now do not give up wrong, I love B-movies, about half of my collection is from B-Movies, but I do not think there's enough letters in the alphabet describing how bad this movie is. The first story (for B-film) is not that bad, it has the potential to create a B-Movie tag, it did not talk about the fifth potential, but the potential nevertheless. But what really allows this movie is acting, I do not believe anything at all, it's like watching QVC, except for QVC lecturers who tend to have a harder tan. I've seen worse movies, but I can not.
