ME EY! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS YOU, I HAVE TO LET THIS FILM! on what drugs you are human! it could be the very worst movie ever! I felt as if I had been a sickly acidic trip all the time, I had to call the therapist to help me cope with the trauma of this epic disaster. From the beginning to the end of the hot rope is the immortal masterpiece of the Satanic cinema. when I thought I was watching this movie with my best Jewish friend and his family, we thought, "Hey, it might be funny, it's probably bad, but still a little funny," as we're bad, we were not ready for it, the movie could be. All my friends, after finishing the film, got into lobotomy, and one of my friends tried to lean against their belts while the other tried to cut their wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I could watch the video from the circle instead, so the pain and suffering would end in just seven short days. For all who want to see this movie, you are not ready! you may think you are a "hard guy" by renting it, but this movie will break you, push you down and urinate on you.
