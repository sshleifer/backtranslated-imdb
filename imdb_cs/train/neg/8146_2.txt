1. Viewed 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty fragile gangster film about Brooklyn's Ore Mountains, who liked to say a lot of four words and killed people. The only thing that was interesting was their attempt to show that the feds are much like a gang. This is the only attempt for a good film. The rest of the film was predictable and cheaply made. The quality of photography on some scenes inside bars and floodplains almost caused you to think that there was a problem with your DVD player due to poor contrast, and some actors were sometimes hard to hear because of the bad sound. Actor acting was a very abundant feature of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with names like Cornie as Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos' and the plot was very similar to these patterns. So, look for a better gangster film before you divide the money for it.
