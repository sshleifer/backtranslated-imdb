I own this movie. Not a choice, I think. I was really boring and the box caught me. So I took it to the old video recorder and spent another hour and a half in crying "why God why?" The story was not as bad as a player I could appreciate. I think that if you find yourself in romantic scenes with super-strange cheese, you will enjoy this movie. "I always thought I was like a Vulcan, you know as Dr. Spock ... unable to love." There are a few good things to say about this movie, it really is terrible. But if you're on a really badly shot movie, it's for you! The real story is much more interesting; <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
