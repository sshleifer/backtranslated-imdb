In spite of its rich production numbers and beautiful costumes, this film is a dream to watch. The murder-mysterious conspiracy is just a vehicle on which music numbers are added, but it often brings the driving to a staggering stop, except that it does not care much. Though it is obvious that there is a lot of money spent on them, numbers are poorly introduced and poorly photographed. It's, of course, a preview code because girls often wear very little clothes and even a song that sings marijuana praise! The performances are all one note, although it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical work, but when Victor McLaglen, as a lieutenant, looks deeper into the hunt for the trail, you might want to throw a towel or at least quickly into the next issue. It is a pity that the patrons who were imprisoned in the cinema at his release, though!
