I do not even know where to start with this. "It's all about the family." This must be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" movie, even though it was not a horror movie, even if it tried !!! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing a token that dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, that man wrote together "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has some talent. Also Lily Taylor should hold indie films. He has no place. Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a pornographic star. There is no room for legitimate action for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen EVER.
