First, the IFC runs the city and the country, and now this. The difference between this sponge and this rose Pink Panther is that the city and the land were observable. It is not. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that they have signed up for it so they can go to someone else in Europe. Belusha is particularly irritating. His scene with Candy (doing the Z-grade Dom DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of a ferocious shepherd and I assume the prisoners in Gitmo will crack like walnuts! The real "crime" (besides being lit green) is a sign of Shepherd: a mousy woman who takes the Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, I have some property right in Arizona that could be of interest to you!
