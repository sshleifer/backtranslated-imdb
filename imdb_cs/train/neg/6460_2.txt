Can anyone tell me where the comedy is? <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian (Thomas Haden Church) looks so poor (with him!) and the whole thing is so dense! <br /> <br /> * Have you tried to create a live comic book that turned out to be a super bloody comic nightmare and was not it funny? Just like the bathroom scene plan; it was so good with his film imagination, but nothing more ... except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??? His relationship with his daughter! * This is actually the kind of job they did just to do it and make some money out of it, but it has become such a crime when this money would have robbed us of those who were deceiving themselves with such low artistic work and entertainment did not have absolutely no fun for everything! <br /> <br /> Well, it would be uglier if it was big production and Brando played in his golden years with the REAL star. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family here. Just keep them! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who found himself admired this movie or -Did not disable-loves it! Then you have to go straight to the therapy before you become more dangerous and you will not hurt someone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly brilliant, but the film is not! And he did not intend to be one here after reading it for sure! But the main major problem is that no one else has ever worked or wanted to be smart or even good at this time! (I'm sorry I'm crying now! Torture is unbelievable!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) hitting (Mira Sorvino) her boots! It was so realistic! Maybe he was looking at her, so he punished himself in such a box! <br /> <br /> * For millions of years: This could be better (or worse!). The script, until the train is heist, was kind and I just imagined it would escape to chase somehow as if it were different (Smokey and bandit) but with (Brando) as a sheriff. In fact, each of these chimeras was a lot merciful than what I was watching! Why did not this Razzie award win this masterpiece? You want me to believe there's a lower movie than a TO? I do not think ! It's a situation when Razzie's superior has to win one of his negligence !! Martin Sheen is also here as a guest star maybe to support his son's failure, but ironically his father was as a failure as his son! and why is it ?! Good! Because I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate, comic movies were not as good as his ambitions! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, NO .. It's a horror! And I just hate horror movies, especially those that have been propagated as comic! <br /> <br /> * A good thing about that? Hmmm! Well, this compared to another movie Marlon Brando (Dr. Moreau Island - 1996) will be near (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know what they are or are just wrong, ugly and very nasty in this movie .. Just pray for your last prayers and go for it. You!
