They were supposed to name this movie ... Blonde women who needed to get their roots in color. Also the main character, geeze, too tight sweaters. Giggling. I thought the man did a good job. I hope that this week we will have a good Christmas movie about 8 stars. Spreading the arrow. She had to laugh. We still have three more on the DVR so we can watch, maybe we'd be lucky. Yeah yeah, that guy I thought fast and kicked when he took the flowers and then went out with his cousin. I told my daughter they were on the way to the cemetery. And how stupid was that two men were watching them? Ghostly.
