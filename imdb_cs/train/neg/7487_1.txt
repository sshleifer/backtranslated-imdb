Unfortunately this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very entertaining, of course using the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, this movie does not use the Neil Simons script, so it's lost again and again. Even an audience I never smiled at. Direction is very slow and tedious, and when the joke is put away, so the joke dies, ie Couple with sex in the park. They announce that it is a lighting ceremony for New York, we all know that the lights are coming and we will be able to see the cute and cracked Goldie & Steve making a little slap stick. The entire movie is like ... the joke is based and devoted. Why are not Goldies hair in the movie. You also notice every detail of Goldie (using very intense soft lenses). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that's when you want to laugh.
