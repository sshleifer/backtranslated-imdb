Mad Magazine can have a lot of crazy people ... but obviously someone had some common sense there when the forces - to be rejected by this celluloid waste ... editing is el crapo, the conspiracy is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only reason why she gets two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice shot on my chest ... I never thought I'd apologize for Ralph Macchio's decision to be on this, ... and I really feel ill for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never appear in this movie ... at least Mr. Leibman had the cajons refused to have his name placed anywhere in the movie ... and he going ahead ... there are in fact a copy of this thing with Mad the beginning of the sequence still on it ... if you can find one, catch it cuz it's probably worth something ... it's the only thing about this movie that's worth anything ... and a note for the people at IMDb.com ... there is no way to spoil this movie somebody ... the creators have spoiled it ...
