Maybe I've seen worse movies than this, but I do not remember when I have it. Or maybe blocked them. Who knows if I want to undergo hypnotherapy, I can remember them, perhaps with the kidnapping of aliens as a child or other trauma. If so, I would like to exchange those memories for those I watch for this film. The film should give me some credit: she created an emotional response. In fact, I started to be angry at the scenes that spoofed other movies and TV shows that this travesty is dirty is an association. I'm afraid I may not be able to watch movies like Dr. Strangelove without this movie going through my main view.
