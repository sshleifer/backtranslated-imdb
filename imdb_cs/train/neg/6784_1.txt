I tried to watch this movie twice and even then quickly move the irritating parts, but it still could not finish. I do not understand how this movie * really * got good reviews. I think those people who give such good reviews just try the sound of the film for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem to be very unrealistic and look like internal work, which makes things humiliating. Movies should get true positive comments to their own pair and not upset! <br /> <br /> Actor reminded of cheese porn movies and not entertainingly. I do not mind having low budget movies with a bad actor if they know how to work with them. <br /> <br /> I found the lead character as irritating. His expressions on his face and humor were unbearably childish. I thought it was deliberate to make the girl's conspiracy look more agreeable and based, but it was even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very unpleasant (his bosses overcome business speech) and unfortunate sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I did not find anything that would redeem this film other than some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt that the rating was misleading. I was interested in her assumption, but everything else frightened me. Of course you will see it if you want, but I just did not want anyone else to get their hopes and waste time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
