I loved the first film "Azumi". I saw Mrs. Ueto in various television shows and I saw my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks. I have to say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Due to the filming and setting in Azumi, they should be able to do a lot better work with this movie, but instead it was slow, fruitful in parts and sprinkled by a very poor, unconvincing and wooden actor. When they bothered to refer to the first film, they did it in a way that was quite loose and weak. "Azumi" is the title of the best of a group of excellent murderers. The "Azumi 2" appears to be a bit diminished and less impressive. This does not mean it was a complete loss. There were several decent fighting scenes and some supernatural characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. These two actually captured the "manga" feeling in their script while the first never quite "got it."
