I felt as if I was watching Fast and Furious, but with different actors and a little different conspiracy. Let me say the cars in the movie are very cool. So if you like fast cars, this movie will probably be fun. I liked Nadja Bjorlin because I saw her from Days of Our Life. She's a really good singer, but it's bad that they sang such bad songs in this movie. I mean songs about the car; not exactly what you would like on the radio. Because it's a Hollywood movie, you have to divide this story a bit, but in real life I do not think any average joe will meet a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a racing car, fix a car engine and be singer. It's just all very stupid. Another side note, anyone who is willing to bet 25 million for a car race is a nut. But it was a bit cold when Natasha stopped short of the finish line and Michael swung. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for the car. So if you like fast cars, I recommend it.
