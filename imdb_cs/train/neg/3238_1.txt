Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore pornographic movies fall into two categories that have the form of a plot (Gee, that's one happy pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's experiment drops firmly into the second category. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, a horror version of hardcore porn. Almost a complete conspiracy that is waiting for a cash shot in less than 43 minutes. Filmed on the video in 1985, he consists of three relatively incomprehensible Japanese boys who tortured one relatively unattractive Japanese girl. Torture moves from banal (slapping 50 times, kicking her one hundred), stupid (binding her to the office chair and turning her around), a factor of fear (a bath of worms and sheep) and finally money. (Well made eye piercings). <br /> <br /> This is no conspiracy, no motive, just the Blair Witch shots and torture. The girl looks bored and, except for screaming, "no one expects the Spanish Inquisition", I was bored stupidly during the office chair scene. He stared deeply at the screen and waited for the money. Just like hardcore porn.
