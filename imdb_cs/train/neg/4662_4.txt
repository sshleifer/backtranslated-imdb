Writers probably had no experience with the army and probably never experienced a historical book, but I still give this cheaply produced war movie a credit for taking a long time to look at the role of black soldiers in the Second World War. <b> <br /> The action is confused and incredible - every episode of the fighting! has better production value, but occupancy is interesting. When he saw the New York Giant Rosie Greer, it was worth the money I paid for it. The artistic direction is fifth - the men wear Korean war uniforms, and it was pretty bad weather at the time the US Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they are showing here, and I do not think the terrain resembled Northern California. The scenario never seeks to know why black military units are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows that some men carry Springfield rifles instead of M-1, which would probably be issued by second-degree soldiers. This idea of ​​the basic story (a racist Southern officer in charge of black units) should at the time be expanded into a large budget production, and it is not too late to try it. You have to take it for what it is, and I admire the creator of this film for trying. I remember seeing it a while ago and I thought it was in Italy, which would make more sense because there were black combat units in 1944.
