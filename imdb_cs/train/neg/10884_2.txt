In fact, these young people were so uncomfortable that I could not wait for them to kill them all, and that includes Clarissu (Joanna Canton) because I considered it the most difficult of the bunch. <br /> <br /> But I knew it would be a mess of the opening minutes when teenager Christine opened fired at priests and nuns with Leslie Gore playing music in the background. There was nowhere to go, but down. Even the prosthetics looked fake, and "blood" looked suspiciously like the Hawaiian punch, though later he took a red day-glance look to match the silly Halloween makeup they were all wearing. I'm sure all GOTHI fools will appreciate this bullsh-t because they will like the band. She certainly did not protest me. Blah ... And even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can not save this stupid horror of teen horror. He still looks hot. I'm glad she'll take care of her because we do not see her much today. <br /> <br /> But it's a step from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) in that he has a rather coherent conspiracy, so I give it too much. This and the little Boston Terrier named Boozer also brings it. I like what Boozer will do to Clariss. It was the only good scene in another silly movie. Lion's Gate Films must have been desperate when they chose this. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
