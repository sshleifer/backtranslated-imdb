This movie was the worst movie experience I've ever had to endure, and worse is the fact that I had to watch it and did not have the chance to stop it because it was for school! It's true that the story was decent ... but I found it terrible! An exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. It was the only peak without her, I doubt I could watch the movie. Every time I hear someone say "villain", it happened to me! I almost attacked the customer the next day because they said "it". I remembered one of the worst hours and half hours of my life! (I'm sorry if someone offended, I just talked)
