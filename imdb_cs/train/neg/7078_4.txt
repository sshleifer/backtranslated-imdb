This movie could be a decent B-movie if 3/4 of the movie was not so focused on sex scenes. I think she's sexually addicted and I'm sure it's a lot more than sex addiction, and it's out of constant sex. Michael Des Barres did a good job when he was thinking about what to do, which was not much. At one moment or another, one would have to laugh because his character was so sorry. Nastassja Kinski was fine in her role as the sex therapist, she could do more and I do not intend to have sex. The person who most excelled in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as a loving and troubled woman. There is something about a beautiful interior and out there that I like very much. It plays this role and when you watch the movie, you start to feel bad. The "diary of sexual habits," though the Oscar material or the modern classic is someone, is fairly informative and does a fair job when it shows you how the demons can take over and destroy what you think in life.
