How can Ozzy Osbourne film still be sucked? I just do not get it. Trick or Treat has succeeded. It's upset and I like it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of the films I have to warn people about. It is a vomit that provokes nasty atrocities that ask for it to be seen, so you can feel much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redeemed factors. The heavy metal film does not seem to capture what heavy metal is or what it represents. This film can produce heavy metal lame and it was in 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. This is quite a performance, however, negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat = so bad you will be angry at yourself for watching him. This simple equation may keep you away from this mindless and ruthless movie.
