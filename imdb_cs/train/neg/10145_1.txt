Steven Seagal appears to be helpful through a terrible film shot almost entirely to camouflage a complete lack of budget and resources. To choose technical drawbacks - the silver F / A-18s and F-14s taken from the carrier for air strikes and miraculously become masked F-16s for a real punch - would give this film more credibility than it deserves. Just say that the most interesting in the movie are credit titles that lose and disappear in the lightweight napkin, which is probably available to all Final Cut Pro users. Putting all his creativity into his own credit gives Michael Keusch the same category as Marcel Mandu.
