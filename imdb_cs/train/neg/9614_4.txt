I would not recommend this if you are not excited about David Copperfield and want to "add the file". There are some good performances (like Uriah Heep) and well-focused moments (like Bitie), but overall it's really fading compared to the BBC version in 1999 and earlier releases. <br /> <br /> There are unexplained changes in the story that really do not serve any great purpose, unless it is impossible (stolen jewels are the case). The American cast was wrongly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is as bad as Betsy Trotwood and her English accent is just a little better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Mikawber; but he too went away and became irritable. He also speaks his line in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes simply absurd. Anthony Andrews is as threatening as Mr. Murdstone, but man almost expects to make a black cloak and link David's mother to the railroad (though it may be partly Dickens fault). <br /> <br /> I have a free newspaper. It helped me through the Sunday afternoon, but at the end I felt more disappointed than enchanted
