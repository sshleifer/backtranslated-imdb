Yes, I rated this movie as one star horrible. Still, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies from now on. It's really so bad that it's good. This is another production by producer K.Gordon Murray (reads: he buys a really cheap / bad Mexican film, he spent zero money by dubbing him to English and putting him in child matin√©es in the mid-sixties.) It's a pity I'm on it he came to life so late because I'm sure some "mood ideas" would be an even better experience. I do not intend to mention what many of the reviewers have already said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, a devil, a mechanical reindeer, and some of the worst child actors I've never seen before. I plan to run this holiday over Kelsey Grammar's "A Christmas Carol". Great holiday in hell. Now, if I can only find "To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I'll have three functions that can not be beat. You have to see this movie. It moves so slowly that I keep you from touching the fast forward buttons - especially on dance routines! This thing is reminiscent of precious blue-flesh-I guess you have to go through a whine to enjoy this experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
