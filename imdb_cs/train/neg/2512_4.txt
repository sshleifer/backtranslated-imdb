Tim Robbins is strangely blissful, who was occupied as a New Jersey garage mechanic in the 1950s, who falls in love with an exciting blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he is on the screen a lot of time, Robbins cancels the inner-work of his intense persona and disappears into the background (it's easy to forget that it's even in the picture!). An embarrassed romantic comedy with a trick that Walter Matthau plays Einstein (who does what he can do with a cartoon character). Otherwise it is sweet and sunny, it is rather sleepy Fred Schepisi, who shows the heart but has no joke or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual friendly self, and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like a nurse and her big brother. ** z ****
