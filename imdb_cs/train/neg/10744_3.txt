In the first was mainly giant rats, but there were wasps and giant chicken. This is only a period of huge rats, giant rats and one really growing little boy. This is about this growing boy and scientist who is trying to help him by accident to create giant killers ... you know how it is. This movie has some killings and moments, but I find it in the same place with the original, I just prefer a variety in my films of giant creatures. Well, that's not true ... Actually, I like the "Ant Empire", maybe I just do not care about a giant rodent. Overall, this is a somewhat unobtrusive film, though it has one rather strange change in events in this single dream sequence, which is really bizarre. I can not recommend this.
