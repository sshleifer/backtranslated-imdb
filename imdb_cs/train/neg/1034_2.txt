After Scooby-Doo's success, where you are, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that destroyed the success of Scooby-Doo forever. They invented a new show with the new name Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo, which made this demonstration a complete failure, probably for both adults and children together. Scrappy was a silly, daring puppy that always seemed ready to beat someone. Scooby and Shaggy were scared of the villains and tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need any small unpleasant puppy puppies. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, he would either kill or never realize he had Scrappy. It was just bad, maybe your kids prefer it!
