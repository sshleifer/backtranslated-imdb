This is a low-budget movie in the "Scream" style. "Maddy" is a new employee in a remarkably unnamed office where she meets and begins her relationship with her coworker, Chris. During a hot spa, Chris and his friends Maddy convince them that he belongs to the "Murder Club," where everyone killed a kicker. When Maddy loses and kills someone really, hojinks follow. The film looks good and there are needs for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few portraits from slightly larger stars than cast), but after counting credits you ask why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching.
