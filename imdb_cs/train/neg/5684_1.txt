poorly managed garbage. average nihilistic sadistic gorefest ... if you are such a type of man who likes ... he sees the shiver. even if you're not that a good movie, it's really a bad story, a story full of hole holes, the director really should just give up and find a real job because he has no talent for him. I see why people do not like uwe boll ... lately, we had several of his films and he is the best of them, which is really sad! The complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to be appropriate for some people, but here's just grids. Horror movies can be full of devastation, they can be miniature artworks, they can only be seen when there is nothing else ... SEED is really really really poor.
