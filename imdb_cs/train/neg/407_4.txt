I love special effects and witnesses to new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most of this movie because it has been broadcast on HBO in recent months. I have to admit that I could have missed a few scenes, but I usually filmed and saw several scenes more than once. But every time I see some of the "Hollow Man," I feel depressed, almost like a "movie noir". I'm not sure why; maybe I do not want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and that's disappointing. But I think it's a witness of how tirelessly the evil is happening. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do not recommend it for teenagers under the age of 14 (maybe 12 if they are mature).
