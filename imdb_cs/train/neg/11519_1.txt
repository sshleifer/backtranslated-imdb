This is the deepest film I've ever seen. What a waste of wonderful cast. This is James Cromwell as an ignorant who plays a deputy. I could go on, but of course I would spend more time on this report than anyone else on the script. The only thing about this movie about us is that we are against them and how to redeem themselves stupidly over this tolerance of a reasonable person. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
