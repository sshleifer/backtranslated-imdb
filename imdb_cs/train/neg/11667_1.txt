This film was a great disappointment in the direction, the intellectual niveau, the conspiracy, and the way he dealt with his subject of painting. It is a slowly moving film set as an episode of summer flying, with a terrible lack of depth. Insufficiently adds his message. </ P> <p> Access to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms like "beauty". According to the filmmakers, "beauty" can only experience the Bob-Ross floral landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying the basic theory of colors (such as elementary school) and a lot of sentiment. Parts of the film are partly criminal, for example in the place where it is mentioned (rather celebrated by table dancing) that people with mental disabilities are unable to have emotions or to show through painting, because their works are by definition worthless "crap" . <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the movie could get such a high score, then a few more people are evaluated, and they have chosen very high or very low grades.
