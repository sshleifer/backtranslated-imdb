It's not as fun and harsh as the DVD box claims. I really love twisted and sad movies, but this is really boring! It's one hour of torn penises flying Baby Dolls and lots of rape! I think the intent with this amateur sleaze was to create movies "That's so bad" - that's good, but it fails. It is bad! Several scenes are fine, but overall it's a mess. If you like amateur splashes like this (Only better) I would recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit 2 and 3.
