With this movie running only 61 minutes and nothing so good on TV, I decided to drive the zombies on DVD to skip to make time. Even when I realized the era from where it came, I was very disappointed. It began with the strangely optimistic quality of the initial score (co-music without) and then the slow moving sequences. God, it occurred to me that the film about the zombies - even from the 1930s - would have some winters (White Zombie, certainly with Bela Lugosi), but it did not. Zero. It was hardly dramatic (except for a few moments when the upper eyes were placed on the film to indicate someone's enchantment). Like the same boring king of the zombies, this film may have an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more.
