It really was supposed to be a star, but there were so many, cliches, predictable interventions, they saw it all before the slasher moved in parallel, that I actually gave it another star for making me laugh ... though it never was a director I'm sure I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I do not often write comments on movies, they have to be either sensational or in this case really bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey, I knew it would be bad because he had a unique nose for picking up the worst movies. (maybe not to post Mr. T, but you do not know what I mean when you're bothering to watch this) if you watch it, make sure you do not pay for it. It could work if they actually put the intended comedy into it, but you'll surely find that special laughter here and there behind the farce of all ...
