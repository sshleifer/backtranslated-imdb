I always wanted to see it because I like noisy horror movies and I was so sure that "The Incredible Melting Man" would be a lot of fun. It really was not. I think the acting was badly fun, the script contained some classic bad lines, and the special effects looked like someone was swaying around the main actor so I should like it. Unfortunately between these peaks is really difficult. I decided to watch the last half of the movie when I signed up. That's how this movie is boring. However, if you love bad movies, you will be looking forward to the dramatic departure of the fat nurse and the star acting of that guy who plays Doctor Ted. In order to be a poor man, he had to deliver an incredibly awkward line with a straight face - like an interview with his wife - to watch IM Mana: "I'll find it with a geiger counter." "Is it radioactive?" "Just a little." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is Dr. So, wandering about trying to find a superstory zombie killer machine armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He's a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan fails when he finds a lot of goose on the tree. "God - it's his ear!" says Dr. Ted the audience. I'm so glad he did it. <br /> <br /> I realize that this movie sounds a bit funny. It would be if it took only 10 minutes, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the incredible Melting Dude simply moves by making a sticky mess when it is supposed to eat more people. I think if you were really stoned, you probably would like him, you just do not have pop-tarts during the movie, because the main actor really reminds one close to the end.
