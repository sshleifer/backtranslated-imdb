The five or so really good Westerns that Mann has created are incomparable in Hollywood. Even John Ford has never done so much of that quality. The special thing about them is how unequal they are. Ford's My Darling Clementine costs about two and a half of each. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero is next to Mann and Stewart Chase. Chase is responsible for the brilliant red river. Chase wrote far off the ground, the bend of the river, and probably another. But none of them are as complete as My Darling Clementine, but then a few films, Western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of five Mann movies has huge differences, or it's six, it sees it. Bend, Far, West Man, Fury, Winchester 73 and Jo, Six, Naked Spur. Each of them has a beautiful scene after a beautiful scene, with fairly significant outages. So does Red River, which is still the only westernmost ever to ever do. So perfection is not all. <br /> <br /> But Far Earth has huge, huge holes. It's mawkish, and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are locked corners. The rest is quite pedestrian, with the exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is the course of one person in cinematography. It's about as good an eye as anyone who ever gets behind the band of moving film. It's almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The far corner of the country has an amazing moment. And as usual comes from Stewart. No one in the history of the film has ever received physical punishment with the authority of this man. It's absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchest, and the Men of Laramie: in Bend he is beaten and hanging the thread so credibly, and with such vicious hatred he looks like somebody exiled from Dachau, being shot out of such violence by a plow with such violence, looks so convincing that he is worried and, of course, when he is drawn by fire in Man, you find that you are looking for signs of burning. What actor. Not to mention the moment he was flogged in Winchester early in the hotel room, like someone who ever did. <br /> <br /> But it was Mann's territory: look at Gary Coopera, who fought with Jack Lord in the West. Painful like any combat scene recorded. Cooper, without being as persuasive as Stewart, is in balance in his looks to be exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, no one except a human has ever shown a human being in extreme areas, just like Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> Look at every western he ever did. It's his real sights, even if they're all dead. But what it is. When they hear their great scenes, they are as good as everyone, including Ford. And its six Wests as a set is the best one ever did, a season. Thanks, Anthony.
