Okay, first, Seagal's voice is nicknamed about 50% of the movie ... Why? Since it seemed that scriptwriting and story had been overwritten because they shot and need to change their dialogue for the continuity of the story because they have multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head, because the obstacles are not just disturbing but they do not make sense. It says, the story is still vacuumed and it does not make any sense. When I finished, I just scratched my head because the movie was so futile and it made no sense at all. Avoid the plague. This movie stopped me watching Seagal directly on video clips as they get worse and worse.
