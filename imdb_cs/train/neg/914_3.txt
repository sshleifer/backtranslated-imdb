(The show in English because Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I have seen this film with extremely low expectations and unfortunately I realize that the film barely lived to them. <br /> <br /> Just like I liked to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, the writers had soon realized in the writing scenario that seven people fall into the water, not original or funny. The story is very thin and jokes are used and predictable, those that are not, it's just boring. Throughout the movie, I smiled three times. The location of Swedish products Findus is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign; "Findus has happened!". <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 may not be seen in the cinema or on the DVD, just wait until it comes out on TV, it will not take too long.
