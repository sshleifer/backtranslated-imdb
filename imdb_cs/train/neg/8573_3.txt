I do not like director Sean Penn, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no core, it is colored with a kind of redneck, an anti-authoritarian addition, which in all honesty damages most of Penn's work, his last work even more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, it seems that the whole batch produces such a fundamentally banal product, apparently in some loyalty to honesty, but eventually is largely celebrated for match matches and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards have created greetings Hell's Angels and they'll make me a long time for the Deliverance Days, which is a great movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more plausible than the ridiculous Eastern promises he made with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The film is dead insignificant and seems to be a practice, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, proves that he can act. And I wanted more about the character of Sandy Dennis. Poor 3 out of 10 for this Indian Runner crap.
