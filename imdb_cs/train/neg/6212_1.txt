It has once been my thought that films require drawings or some other means that make you ever care about the story or anything that's going on. This movie showed me that you do not have to have something like that. <br /> <br /> I could simply summarize it. But IMDb wants me to have multiple lines. It was pretty nice. the strongest. The way the character speaks in the movie thinks it should happen in a few days, but it is not time and I'm sure it will happen in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before you go out. It would be much better to use time. The time you never come back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled out better than this movie.
