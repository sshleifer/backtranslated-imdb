In that case. I have just watched the heavy load of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I was not sure which one I wanted to read first. Then he hit me like a sack: Rodentz. Tell people about Rodentz. This immortality is not threatened and painfully boring to sit down. And they are mutant rats that kill people. Yeah ... a real exciting original. "God's Food" or "Willard" Anyone? They were better than this and it does not say much ... <br /> <br /> ** PLEASANT SPOILER ** Well, here's the story: the Inna scientist and his brave assistant experiment in rats and their lab is in dirty surroundings and a dirty building and dirty assistants are sad and they all become food for crazy rats and almost everyone dies and yes, there is one huge rat that looks miserable but kills it, the end. There, all one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff! I dare to disagree! The second we all realize is a giant rat, we all know it will eventually die! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - hmmm, no. There's nothing good here. <br /> <br /> He did not hurt, he did not help: <br /> <br /> - I ... well. gore was decent. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> - The rats are not as bad as they could be in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - CG rats pathetically cheap. See if your movie has a low budget, maybe you should not rely on CG. A lesson to take on your heart. <br /> <br /> - acting is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> - the characters are out of the question - we have a clich√© and none of them is so good. <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - They've been before - a lot of time. <br /> <br /> - Dirty story, just stupid. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> - A huge rat looks like a fat man in a badly conceived bears costume - it was a bit funny - to get this movie any prize. <br /> <br /> - Renewed, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The way to keep going, guys. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Just terrible. Worse than you can imagine. It's not even ridiculously bad, like "The Scarecrow" (2002) or "The House of the Dead". Now there are the crap movies you can enjoy. Even if they make you stupid. <br /> <br /> Memorial scene: <br /> <br /> - The lame action-movie ends, complete with unruly heroes and explosions. Because he did not feel like the rest of this monstrosity - but he still sucked.
