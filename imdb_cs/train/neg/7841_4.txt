I thoroughly looked forward to being released in 1970 but returned as a typical follow-up. Everything about him - budget, script, plot, casting, and acting - was lower than the original one. Gale Sondergaard like Elk Woman, the eldest of a circle of a yellow hand, does not look like Indian or half of the other "Indians" who played Italians, Mexicans, and Latins with cheap wigs. And the old man who played the boss behaved more like a fat old squaw than the furious leader of the fighters. He even used the bow as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who has done such an excellent job in the original, seems to be moving this time. I do not think he could resist the simple payout he'd gotten for finding out his role as a horse. To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as that Horse is going through a painful cleansing ritual "Find His Vision" and Collect Yellow Hands Against Your Indian Enemies and White Impressionists, but overall, Return is uneven, dull, nasty and predictable - as well as most of the sequels.
