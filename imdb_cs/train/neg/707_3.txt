"All Saints Day?" Where...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Was the feast and theme celebrated by the feast of all saints? <br /> <br /> What is the loss of a wonderful title! There is nothing in the story that has the most distant connection with the "All Saints" holiday. Nor is there anything in the story "The Day of the Souls of All" to which this term refers. Why bother using this title if you never intend to include any story or theme of "Day of the Souls of All" or "Feast of All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Bad bad scripting and amateur writing <br /> <br /> How did they attract such great talent to this clunker? Writing is so amateur - characters who know each other all their lives, go into big long speeches about their lives in the audience's interest. Neither does people talk to us. <br /> <br /> What did the director say? <br /> <br /> The mode is just as bad! Forced and over-intentional style feels amateur. In one scene the character shouts "Take my hands out of me" and nobody touches him! The most misplaced scene is incredibly beyond the combat scene at the beginning of the film. Excessive Gore in a very fake, stupid battle scene <br /> <br /> The most fake battle is so many dead people. It looks like a Saturday night live! You can see the surcharges that are waiting for them to pass through the camera. Everyone plays their death scene as the 4th grade boys - they exaggerate every little twitch and jerk. Blood to the victims of the battle is so excessive and it is being applied in a casual manner, it seems that someone used a ketchup dispenser and just shot straight lines. <br /> <br /> This whole combat scene comes out as a spoof of a really cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to hit a horse and deliver a blow. <br /> <br /> Who would ever behave like this in real life? <br /> <br /> The craziest writing, directing and casting is really the center of the scene: <br /> <br /> A small girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father - who is terribly crippled and literally dripping blood makes his obvious wounds . Even an idiot would know he was dead! Still - very monotonous - repeats again and again "daddy, daddy ..." while looking at someone outside the screen. She added it with about as much credibility and passion as you could expect from a non-actor child who repeated the camera line all day. Even though the poor child had some acting skills, the scene is absolutely incredible. The little girl would not even be in the middle of the battlefield after the battle arc - surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she is standing still! Natural instincts would shout and scare the child, running from bloody bloodshed! <br /> <br /> We are supposed to be horrified or laughing ...?! <br /> <br /> One particularly sneaky detail that gives the SNL satire scene is the father hanging, with a huge hook over the mouth and face. It looks like a fish on a hook! Inadvertently funny details make the whole scene appear fake and stupid. In the imagination of La-La-Land, mothers and daughters are the same age! Another funny detail is that you see the central figure - the girl's mother - at the end of the scene and the next scene that appears 20 or more years later, looks exactly the same! Still young and beautiful, and now she is the same as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost shot the movie right there, because the direction and the writing were obviously terrible - but I tried to pull it off because I wanted to see the setting in Louisiana and I like all the actors. I do not know what these heroes thought when they took on these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? Excessive blood and a badly committed violence opening scene is strangely out of place with a story about the story of the soap opera that follows. It's also a special way to run a movie that seems to be focused on romantic novels for the rest of the time. Strange inconsistency in tone!
