Produced in 1955, COBWEB is a star cast from the silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to Actors Studio by descendants of SUSAN STRASBERG. Based in an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about wondering ... ... a high drama? Medical and patient relationships? Shock therapy? No, the bastard is about who's picking the curtains in the psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm kidding? You will not trust your eyes when you watch this incredible story that has changed into a movie! Progressive Director of Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants all hospital patients to participate in designing, selecting and making the necessary new dredges. McIver's wife played with a marble mouth GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get 2 cents on this monumental task. Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH) is working as well. Direction VINCENT MINELLI, you are a bit wonder if it really happens that she is too involved in detailed details due to her marriage to JUDY GARLAND wart. Talented actors such as LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are forgiven in this hokey story. What did they think?
