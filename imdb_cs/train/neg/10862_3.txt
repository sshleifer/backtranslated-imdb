I watched 8 or 9 Herzog films and none of them had any influence on me. I followed several papers about him. He is obviously an intelligent person, with a great knowledge of movies and passion for their production, but it makes him a good director. Certainly not! Complete anti-talent. Can he create a good document due to the previously mentioned features, but a movie with actors? never! <br /> <br /> He can not drive or write. His scenarios are full of ill-thoughtful situations, and many situations / dialogues in movies are so childish and badly finished that they can not be hidden in any sense as the word "art." In any case. Not to mention the awkward direction, so amateur. Let's say he wants to drive like this and write like a lie like that. <br /> <br /> Just like the scene when Scheitz is arrested and Storszek is hiding in the back of the store. WHO IS KIDDING? He's a cheater; knows what false intellectuals and critics are imagining. He knows what elements he needs to get into the script to get attention and empty praise. Do not forget the rest of the script and the careless direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julia Honey. If Herzog can make a movie like Honey, then I can check my old movies again and try to find talent in them.
