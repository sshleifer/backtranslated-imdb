Werewolf eyes (1999) is a really bad movie. The assumption was really good, but the total execution was terrible. I wanted filmmakers to make time with this project instead of getting into production. Some blind bastards have some new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to the middle old werewolf. Disappointing things begin to become what he has learned when he turns into a heed-looking creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend learns? Who's the weird little troll who's helping him and what's with the female cop? If you really want to find out, look for The Werewolf Eyes! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea for a movie. I just wanted the filmmakers to have a lot of pre-production time before they decided to shoot the film.
