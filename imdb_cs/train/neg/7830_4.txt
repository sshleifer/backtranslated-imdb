Nightmares and Dreamscapes were unlikely and disappointed. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, could offer little on the way to groundbreaking narratives or real horrors, but at least it was well-controlled, exciting and visually interesting, with William Hurt's solid performance and very impressive special effects for the mini-series. However, the second story in the series was just terrible, and not in a good way. The script is bad, which requires that shallow, inconceivable protagonists act illogically to move into plotting, and to make endless play of characters become characters that for the purpose of clumsy, unnecessary interpretation. The effects are exaggerated and unconvincing, and in the first story I felt much more empathy for the cold-blooded killer than for the newlywed girl in the other. The director used a million tricks to try to tell the story horribly, but with amateur acting and acting writing, the end result looks like a film project of the first year, the camera moves on its own and little on the road to plot or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I'm going to let the pain go down. I look forward to the payment of William H. Macy and I hope he will earn a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is too inconsistent to predict in both ways.
