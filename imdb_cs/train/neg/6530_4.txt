** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, a busy B-movie actor during the 1940s and 1950s, heads the expedition to Mars. Before we get to the Red Planet, we will confuse the romantic memory between Mohra and the scientist Norm Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and a look at Les Tremayne as another scientist who wore a beard's wart. Martian exteriors have false backdrops and shades from red to pink - the "Cinemagic" process in advertisements. Great cold monsters include a huge amoeba, three-chamber insect creation, an excessive Venus Fly-Trap, and an unforgettable rat / bat / spider. The whole bizarre adventure resembles surviving Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. ANGRY RED PLANET allegedly has a fair culture and probably picked up most of its followers during the Psychedelic Sixties.
