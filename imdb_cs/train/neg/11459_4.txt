Whale hunters choose a bad whale whale. A group of yahoo whalers exploits a woman and pulls her tail. Whalewoman's friend sees the whole thing, including when the unborn baby is sliding down and jumping on board. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) could say that the big man is really crazy by looking at him as if he said, "Get out of town before the tide." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Boa's beauty, but nothing more. It was the first "released" movie, though her first acting role was "And Once On A Love", which was released in 1981 as "Fantasy" (directed by John Derek) four years before. Today (20 November) is the birth date of Bo Derek. I hope Bo has a great "whale" ..... get it? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
