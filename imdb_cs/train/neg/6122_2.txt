One of the worst remakes of classics in film history - especially from the promises of her tagline, "The Most Beautiful Woman of Our Time in the Most Humorous Adventures of All Time", is not even properly exploited! Although this film has been regularly shown on television in my throat forest since childhood, his acquaintance (because of the terrible, not erotic content, you think) has kept me away - and I just came back because I recently enjoyed Bo Derek's previous film, 10 (1979), and observed many fantasy things during the Christmas season as well. Leading actress / producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous to play a sexually innocent girl (witnessing an unfortunate banana scene) and how she can be expected to be dressed several times, but once these scenes are welcomed, she went 10 years more sensual than here ; Richard Harris is constantly chewing on the landscape as Jane's obsessed paternal explorer, but John Philip Law barely registers himself as his helper, who humblely shows some initial interest in Jane itself; newcomer Miles O'Keeffe has a leading role and only 45 minutes into his movie, he is completely silent except for his famous jodel (which apparently is Johnny Weissmuller apparently lifted!) and he is as incredible as one of the trees that at regular intervals he covers the other half of the film; for recording, he later starred in two movies ATOR (or being-CONAN imitators) for Joe D'Amato and King Arthur-era ensemble, SWORD VALIANT (1984). actor, director John Derek (who also acts as his own cameraman), worked with some good filmmakers (Cecil B. De Mille, William Dieterle and Robert Rossen) and several great (Otto Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel) has clearly learned, because his direction is a great commitment: sometimes horrifying (the testimony of a perfectly terrible Python attack sequence) with the absurd overuse of slow technology and cheese transitions; it was Derek's seventh film as a director (and his second of four with Bo's wife), and eventually he would only get two more. <br /> <br /> The complete failure of the film has to be measured only by the fact that Tarzan's legends were once again solved on the film - in GREYSTOCK: LEGEND TARZANA, THE LORD OF APES (which surprisingly did not even look) - just three years later !! He was named for six Razzie Awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O'Keeffe) and won one for Bo Derek, TARZAN, THE APE MAN was written by Gary Goddard, future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing silver screen (this time animated) heroic character, MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE (1987), which I will also return (yay)! Despite the charming closure of the credit sequence showing that Tarzan and Jane are playing around with the orangutan, and a musical score that is not really a bad, actually, and quite exciting opportunity, all degraded good intentions are defeated by an extremely stupid culmination involving Native Bo painting, the wholly white and deadly distinction of John Derek in the character of Tarzan himself, which makes him insignificant support in his own film title !!
