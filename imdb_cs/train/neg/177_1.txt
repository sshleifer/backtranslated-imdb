If you plan to see this movie, rethink it. I usually do not post my notes about something I've seen on TV, but this was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get the bad taste from my mouth. Criticizing this movie will take longer because there are so many things wrong with it. I simply say please, you will never see this movie. It was a complete waste of time and it would be your waste. Everyone who wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; totally awkward or working for the company that made it. Again I guarantee that you will really regret seeing this movie!
