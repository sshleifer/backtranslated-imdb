Ah, Channel 5 local Mexican t.v. Every morning, at 2:00 am, horror films are filmed from the 1970's to the beginning of 2000. It was "Return to the Ship at the Lake" a movie that was broadcast yesterday. I'm sorry I watched it. The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a regularly popular low budgeter and was good. The problem is that this sequel is terrible or inadvertently entertaining and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in the sense of the word. The film looks like a soap opera at some points because it is an absurd dialogue, cinema and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is to avoid this at all costs. It's a movie that nobody should watch. Not even for average film lovers. <br /> <br /> You were warned.
