On the way to a small town that emerges from the battle track (but suspiciously looking out on the highway), the reporter runs into a strange tractor that agrees to help her direct her goal. The strange man then tells about a pair of creepy stories associated with the area: in the first story, he admits a few plot to kill a woman's husband, but ultimately suffers much worse fate when attacked by zombies; and in the second story, a group of campers has their vacation shortened when the undead whore has the shadow that his grave has to pamper on. Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to shoot a zombie anthology - a nice idea, but with just two stories, he is sadly short. And that's not the only way he can not get this inadequate budget: acting is miserable (with Joe Haggerty, as the story of Ebenezer Jackson, which gives one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); the places are inconspicuous; the script is terrible; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the end ... well, it calls for faith. To be fair, some creative work with the Sykes camera is effective (although the technical technique used as characters passes through the woods is tad and Joe Castro is cheapo gore excited: the ear is bruised, the eyeballs are ripped off, the face is removed, the brains are spotted, and there The Zombie Chronicles is not a walk in the park nor for experienced audiences of the z-grade basket.I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously it has increased my rating to 3 , because I did not get to see the movie with 3D advantage (although I have a vicious suspicion that another dimension would not have so much difference).
