My friends and I hired the movie last night and we were in one of the biggest laughs. The movie is not funny, but it's so ridiculous and lacks any realism. First of all, Phillippe (I forgot what his character is, and I really do not care), uses his standard employee ID to go through all the top security terminals. Not only is it pathetic, it gets to the top when its enormous effort culminates in finding it the so-scary Lego room hosting super computers. It's just funny. The tense mood we can experience is completely spoiled by the children's room. The end, just like everyone else, is very noisy, especially when a bad human attorney appears "on time". Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something you'll remember, you'll see it.
