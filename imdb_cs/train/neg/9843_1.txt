It's just a film by Robert De Niro, who I really hate. It's a silly, horrific film (of course not De Niro). For me Brian De Palma has to make his mafia films as always like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma for two different times, greetings and a wedding party. But I'm sure the Wedding Party was okay (I did not follow Greetings). <br /> <br /> The script is really bad and not working. There is no scene I could ever smile at. The film lost the chance to be a humorous style even a bit in the "Be black baby" scene and I also do not like the scene where the male sex organ appeared. So it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! only the worst. I hate that.
