Bathebo, you are magnificent. <br /> <br /> This is the BEST piece of crap I've seen a long time ago. I just got it on late night TV and it's painful to watch. Really painful. How does that happen? Terrible, terrible, terrible! OOOOOO ..... The toilet rinses again! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! 1992 did not seem far from me, but it looks like it's 1952 when I watch it. I mean its terrible. Please do not waste time swinging! A spooky old black man who tells them not to expose the pool in the yard. Terrifying! Terrifying! How do these things get MADE ???
