Unfortunately, one of the best efforts so far achieved in the field of special effects has been completely insignificant by being placed along a carving, stupid and equally insignificant conspiracy and an inadequate cliché scenario. Hollow Man is a rather useless movie. In fact, everything that was seen here was death - characters, thoughts and actions (especially the elevator shaft!) - the only really interesting feature of the movie is the impressive special effects. It is, however, the same special effect that is done over and over and until the end of the movie that was at the end of death. I hoped before I was watching Hollow Man that the subject of an invisible person, barely original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. It is not so. It's not long before the movie turns into a well-known bloodbath and a mass of unsuccessful histories - a cluster of clichés accumulates so fast that it's almost impressive. In addition, Kevin Bacon is doing a lot of unnecessary work and his accompanying cast is hardly trying best. A good point can be the successful score of Jerry Goldsmith (but no competition for his bigger efforts), interesting use of thermal pictures and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three out of ten, but the effects shifted Hollow's manglass to one glow. <br /> <br /> 4/10
