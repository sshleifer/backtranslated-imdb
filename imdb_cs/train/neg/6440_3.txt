It was one of the worst Wrestlemanies I've ever seen. It just did not happen at all, really. The card wisely, I thought it would be pretty good, but every match seemed inadequate. Chris Benoit vs. MVP One of Better Matches. Benoit carried it. I just did not think the MVP was so great, but Benoit saved this game. <br /> <br /> Khali Wow, these two men do not mix. Or maybe it's Khali and any other person alive. <br /> <br /> Ashley I'm not a fan of a female match. <br /> <br /> New Breed I was excited about this game until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Kennedy Finlay vs. Randy Orton Definitely the worst MITB match so far. It's just spectacular, to many people in the circle at one time. It just did not work out. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley Umaga O.K. it's not overwhelming, but it's not the worst night. <br /> <br /> Undertaker It was the best match at night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I feel that this game deserves to be the last one. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I started to get angry to see the Price win every match though. It's a bit old. Now I must say that this match is the best night, but I'm a huge fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a little bit interested. Batista vs. 'Taker may be better, but I'm interested, so ... I'm sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best match at night and most of the others really came.
