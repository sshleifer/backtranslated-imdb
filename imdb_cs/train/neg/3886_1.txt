Is this a stupid movie? You bet!! I did not find any moment in this movie that was spooky or scary. Silly moments? A lot. Stupid characters? You bet. Bad effects? Everywhere! No data for Fig. 2.9 .the assembly. The result is total body mass. Well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is raw. He's the most beautiful doctor I've ever seen. He has a melting man somewhere in the Ventura district, not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds) and there are no craters anywhere. Besides, he has a rather absent general on his shore, who wants to find Astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, even if Mr. Nelson can tell him nothing. There also some random characters throw in good measure, who hit the melting man. Eventually the movie ends and the monster gets into the wastebasket to become a compass. Finally, it's what you need for a great MST episode.
