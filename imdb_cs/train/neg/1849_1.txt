I was interested in seeing this step when I thought it might be a diamond, but the only thing I found is bad writing, horrifying directions (fire sequences do not flow), although the director may say that's what is walking, looks very uninspiring and immature) editing could be done by anyone who has 2 video recorders and shares were low-budget video. I would say it was not as easy as mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to fix a movie with what the director has, for example, editing, etc. It is obvious, however, that it is simply one thing. This film is devoted to as much effort as a ham sandwich. It could be better, but that would mean more work.
