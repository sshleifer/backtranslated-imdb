When I see that I hate reading long essays and hope to find some point and be disappointed I will first tell everyone that this movie is terrible. Terribly terrible. And not surprisingly for the reasons outlined in the first review. I thought I agreed with him when he saw the movie rank he deserved, but he was sadly rebuked to read what he said. I'm pretty embarrassed that I was on the same side as someone who commented that the movie "definitely lacks handsome women." Let me be the first to say, "Wow, it was definitely a serious in-depth review there. My mind barely understands philosophical considerations about this film." Seriously, but the lack of "pretty-looking women" should not be considered crucial to the film. If you are sufficiently desperate for "pretty women," you should really watch other types of movies that do not necessarily fall into the science fiction category.
