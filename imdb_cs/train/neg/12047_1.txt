I was most passionate about pre-screening this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (before Tolkien). I have to say that was a great deal of distress. It makes it all the joke and turn the thing into one long soap opera. Elements that were a loyal conspiracy were sprinkled in such a random way that the audience laughed many times in the stupid scenario that simply fights in all these battles. It was a great disappointment that a composite figure such as Achilles (which has a strange combination of almost mattifying abilities, utter ruthlessness, and lovers of men) in the original poem, turns to "Fabio on the beach" in the form of Pitta with a good script and more an effort to turn it into the most comprehensive and famous figure of the warrior Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were really decent, trying to use the best of the absurd scenario. In fact, it was a waste of so many talents (Peter O'Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it with LOTR or Gladiator and carry a candle. Lots of things for the ladies who are catching up, but not enough fighting scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I'm not going to recommend someone paying to see this story dragged with dirt, like one of the characters (at least it has the right part).
