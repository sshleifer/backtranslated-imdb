(Murray Brown) is attracted to an isolated country house occupied by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka ) and become involved in their free sex lifestyle, but their hosts will show up as vampires with a complete desire for human blood ... <br /> <br /> from the Lesbian Vampire series initiated by Maverick director Jean Rollin in France and consolidated with success Hammer "Carmilla" in the UK, courageous shooter José Ramon Larrazo imprinted the concept of adult horror much further than the British censors were ready to tolerate in 1974 and his film was reduced by almost three minutes to his original British release. It's not hard to understand why! Using his Gothic theme as an excuse for such nudity, sex and bloodshed, as allowed by the short runtime of the film, Larraz (who wrote the script under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as a simple backdrop for a mild meditation to life, to death and to impulses - sexual and other - which confirm the human condition. Harry Waxman's shooting at the chateau in a picturesque country house in the autumn of 1973 raises an atmosphere of gloomy preoccupation in which the desolate landscape - bleak and beautiful - seems to predict a storm of upcoming horror (Larraz drew a similar trick already in the same year with SYMPTOMS, a low key thriller that culminates in madness of violence during the final role). However, despite his claim, VAMPYRES's thin fence and harsh production values ​​divide the audience from the very beginning, and while these two female protagonists are just as charismatic and attractive as one might wish, male lead (Brown, his main at the time of filming) is pitifully Miscast in a role that should go into some beautiful twentiesomething stud. The necessary thing for fans of cult films, fun curiosities for everyone else, VAMPYRES is the taste gained. Watch out for the quiet era of superstar Bessie Love in a short story at the end of the movie.
