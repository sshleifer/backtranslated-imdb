The exclamation mark in the title is reasonable, though underestimated. This film is not just crying - it crys so much that it shatters the glass. Andrew and Virginia Stone have made wonderful, humorous, moody thrillers that have sought a semi-documentary feeling. Here they fired at real places in New York with a little "acoustic" acoustics that mastered verisimilitude. But the nature of the soundtrack serves only to amplify the Stones' Maladroit dialogue and the mouthwash of the histrion of the tortured butterfly, Inger Stevens. In a performance without modulation, Stevens plays James James Mason's wife (looking and bored); both are held captive by the extortion Rod Steiger (looks bloated and bored) and his slimy cohorts in the plan to blackmail an airline with the deadly bomb Mason unwittingly built to build. Here is another credibility-strait example of a criminal clergyman who was so brilliantly attentive to every detail, yet he slipped so much that he hired a drug-addicted degenerate as a subject. Stones's idea of ​​the tension that causes the nails is to capture the hysterical Stevens himself with the benzenean outrageous rapist Neville Brand, who fills the frame with his sweaty, salty kisser. But working with the camera is so lead-free and the brand so scary (uncharacteristically) that the effect is scarcely furious, much less tense. Stones, a square couple on the heart, do not even have the courage of their own lack of conviction. The film, which ends up with the terrible Steiger, who follows Stevens on the underground train line, is just as clumsy as his hard-going. With Angie Dickinson as Steward's amoral girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
