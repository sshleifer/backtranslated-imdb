... and actually I gave it ZERO on my personal scale 1-10. I have been watching films since 1952 and I have seen over 1000 in the theater (I do not rate movies I see only on TV). This is the only movie I've ever rated ZERO. My wife and I took our four children (then at the age of 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the children thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who alerted me to this page (it was surprising that the film won an overall rating of 4+). Animation of dinosaurs looked amateur at the time (and is even worse in retrospection), acting (especially Sean Young) is terrible and the story line is just stupid. <br /> <br />
