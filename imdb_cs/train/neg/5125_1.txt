As a young pastor, I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The game was not the best. That's excruciating. It is a message that is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will say better, make wonderful catches, stop moving, start pioneers and even playoffs. All this because Jesus waves the terrible weakness of all the Americans with the wound of the variable wound. I laughed loudly as the coach quoted the letter to explain to the kicker why he was missing field targets. But wait, it's not all. You get a brand new car, an increase of $ 6000, and you and your marriage fight with infertility suddenly end up in pregnancy - twice. Then you will win the state championship because God helps the weakening kick of the winning terrain 12 meters far than he has ever kicked - and in the wind, no less - because "God wanted to do it". Then you will win the state championship again next year. None of these good things would happen if he did not intend to follow Jesus, he would have the whole heart. <br /> <br /> Here's what I took from the movie: God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier and fun. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win the game. On which Bible is this story based? I'll bet that St. Stepan wished he knew the keys of such a safe life before being stoned to death. Someone had to shoot this film before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed behind Jesus. Everything would save them a lot of trouble.
