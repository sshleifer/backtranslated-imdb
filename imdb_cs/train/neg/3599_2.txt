Umm .. I was quite surprised that someone is actually giving this film high marks. <br /> <br /> It makes it possible to ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this film simply proves the extent of her "talent". The film plot was weak ... I bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverse peeping tom. If this is a good thing in this movie, I think it's Tommy Chong's daughter, just because he's his daughter ... and then there's a male leader of Soap-Opera-ish who has a decent good look, but ceases to support his dramatic abilities. Why does IMDb require at least 10 rows? How many other ways can you simply say "This movie is upset"?
