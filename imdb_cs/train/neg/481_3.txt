Whenever the film is so short-sighted in its desire to present a specific ending or the notion that it just does not bother the real story, it's unpleasant. These are the types of films in which the end or view is ultimately conceived, and the story is simply tapped. For this reason, we often talk about the story of "jumping over the hoops," as it rotates, trying in vain to move to the natural end in a logical manner. The story in "Comet over Broadway" is not just jumping over hoops, it's three circuses. It's so absurd, so ill-conceived, so unfortunate that if you're susceptible to loud speaking on the screen, you'll have a pretty good shot before it passes. The central theme of this census scenario is a woman who chooses between family and vocation. Because it's all so terribly confused, it will end up offensive to people with any opinion. So, at the end, the story does not make sense, the topic becomes irrelevant and, as often it is a bad scenario, acting does not save anything.
