Well, everything was said about this movie and I hate it when I write reviews where everyone else has already said what to say. But the thing is, I've seen zillions of movies and I've been working on writing reviews of all the movies I've seen. So I have to write something. The game is stupid. It's really stupid, as the anchor report expresses sadness for an air crash. Nipple is a pretty and professional assistant who cares about the child. the three main kills in the movie are so faint that you're wondering how stupid the creators of this movie are. They do not realize that even ripping can be scary. We do not see how Granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant have made me feel that they deserve to die, you just do not agree with them. And uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could be better. We just heard him scream and see nothing!
