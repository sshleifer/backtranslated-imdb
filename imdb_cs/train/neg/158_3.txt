Warning the following Spoilers. Excellent resort recreation in Antarctica, where the real events of the movie took place. Other than that, hideous, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; probably to a large extent Canadian crew and cast. I recently captured the last half of this movie on global television here in Canada. Nothing else than I'm completely horrified, I'm looking at what a flamboyant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda is; and play Susan Sarandon of all the people! I can only assume that the Canadian born director Roger Spottiswood was forced to make the USAF film heroes, in fact, they are real rescuers, including a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
