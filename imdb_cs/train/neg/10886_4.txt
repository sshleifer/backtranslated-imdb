I was just looking at the monastery for the second time. I already enjoyed it, and I thought it would mean a good drunk Friday night, some gore, some style, some humor, and so on. I was grieved to find out I could not do much anymore. Someone seemed to be going to visit the solo epic as the Night of Demons for a modern audience, but lost what made the original prize. I'm not a huge fan of Night of Demons, but I've really kicked some things up. The Convention makes cheese, but not the good. In addition to the main girl (Joanna Canton's Love Performance), Adrienne Barbea's Gothic Girls and Sweet Opportunity, almost all the characters were invariably looking and angry at the absolute low level of sadness and insult. The film is heavily disrupted by the complete lack of unconditional nudity, which means that because of the terrible dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and make it harder to appreciate the good points of the film. Bad nuns are original in design and have lots of good scenes, although they are not scary, surely a little cool, and the film also has a fair amount of neat gore. Finally, when Adrienne Barbeau is on stage, the movie becomes quite fun because all the unpleasant people are dead and their evil nun fears madness. The stylized direction also produces good results occasionally, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. Overall, it was a movie where, for me, the bright good points simply can not compensate for what I hated. Those who are more interested in this movie may like it much more, but it was not a good time for me.
