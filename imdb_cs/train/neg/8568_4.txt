DEAD HUSBANDS is a rather stupid comedy about a lot of husbands who conspired to get away from each other. It's not embarrassing bad like some comedies I could mention, but it never impacts my potential. Imagine how it could be if we had the Farrelly brothers who run Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. Oh, is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Just curious, because the splash phrase at the dr. Elson's "take care of himself and continue talking"
