"Metamoprhis" is the story of a young scientist worshiped at a local school being investigated by financial providers of the school. That made him shortcuts in a typical bad Hollywood melodramatic fashion. My first thought behind this movie is the conclusion. "Not good, but not bad, since the early eighties." Of course, I realized that it was made in 1990, which almost powered him on "4" but decided to keep him on the average "5" that it is. Metamorphis' is done on several occasions as a good film, which is desperately trying to get out. Playing, albeit not stellar, is usually competent. You can even see the occasional shimmer of modest quality. Stimulation is a big issue with video. After thinking that I was watching for ninety minutes, I realized I was only watching for an hour. Special effects are not stellar, but the director seems mostly competent enough to solve this weakness. The leader, a slightly charismatic man who seems to be trying to mix Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mostly of the character of Matt Dillon in 'Wild Things'. Female heroin makes work OK, but it is by no means distinguished. There is the role of "naughty girl" and the actress does what she can do with it, but that does not seem too much. There is a child's actor that the director can not decide whether he is muddy, cheerful or just weird. <br /> <br /> As I said, stimulation is the worst problem with this movie until the final battle with the evil man is done that would cause the July Power Ranger to blush. It is bizarre and inexplicable until the final scene, which is to be dramatic but simply cheerful, saturated with every bad camera trick and exaggeration that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> A decent one-time watch movie Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack. Nothing that brings you back, and nothing to buy yourself.
