Good. Where to start. Let's just say it; to avoid this movie at all costs. It's based on a cartoon series. The movie makes a cartoon like <br /> <br /> as Hamlet. Fulfilled by emasculated actors who are embarrassed to be here, miserable camera work, horrible music and plenty of product placement to never want to visit Yahoo! Again, this movie is actually the bottom part of the barrel. Citing New Yorkers, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett are pouring this way through the gay abandonment of men who have seen a rare type of paycheck in the distance "<br /> <br /> They should pay us some of the millions they have earned for watching. br /> <br /> Amazing.
