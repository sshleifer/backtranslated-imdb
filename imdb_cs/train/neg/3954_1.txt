All the music is playing back memories from the first Boogeyman movie and inexplicably also footage from another Brainwaves movie by Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love. It is framed with some other topical (since the early 1990s) shots that are boring, malfunctioning, and cheaply shot. Not only is the film almost entirely remembered, they repeat the same breakthroughs throughout the film. So you can see the recycled records again and again, as if you did not see it yet. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen a movie so stuffy ... Someone has made the last dollar of these films. Overall ripoff. And talk about padding ... why do I have to write 10 lines about this garbage? If I can say that this is a two-row garbage, it should be enough.
