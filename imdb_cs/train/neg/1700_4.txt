In the movie, I feel that it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than a way to tell a story on the screen. This short of David Lynch tells the story, but not much. I felt it was fun, but too bizarre to be a comedy. It's a good movie, but there really is nothing else. As I said, I'm a huge fan of David Lynch, but I'm frustrated with some of his work because I do not see it at all. This is definitely my favorite thing he has done so far, but I know he still has talent and I'm excited to see what he's going to do for us in the future. If you like Lynch, look at it, but do not be surprised if you do not like it very much.
