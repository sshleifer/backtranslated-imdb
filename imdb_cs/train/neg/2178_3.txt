I would enjoy this movie a bit more than Jason (Herb) Evers constantly guessing about the experiment. Many early reviewers of the Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overcoming. However, as more and more critics saw the movie they saw it as being done. Jason Evers apparently is not Toshiro Mifune, and his overturning is exactly what. Most actors in this classic B were rather good actors, with the exception of Evers and showgirls. If you look at this movie, you will notice that Evers screaming almost every line, that is, until he smokes and inadvertently breathes smoke from his nose. <br /> <br /> Special effects were for the B-type course as such. It seems to me that there is nothing like my fantasies, fantastic good or bad for this film.
