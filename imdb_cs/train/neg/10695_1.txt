... Ok, I read about this movie somewhere on the internet and many criticized how this film is bad and upset. And I could not agree more. Then I saw this movie on DVD, I was thinking about it twice, and then I lost my film ad on TV. Fortunately, I saved my money for these bullshits. I was sacrificed for sleeping for this film and soon it turned out that this film could not satisfy me. So I can not judge how the film was shot, but still ... it's still upset. Regarding those who like this movie, I'm sorry I fired this movie and told about how this movie is upset. I do not know what you think about this movie?
