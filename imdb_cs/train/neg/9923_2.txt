As I write this review in 2008, we are involved in the remake culture. Film studios are obviously destroyed by as many classic films as possible, with thoroughly updated updates, including "King Kong", "Wicked Man" and virtually every movie ever played by Michael Cainea. This frivolous remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, as evidenced by the "do-Do" dough. The completely absurd, colorful version of Bob Clampett's "Porky in Wackyland," "Dough for Do-Do" sucks the life of the original by squeezing the color of Clampett's original shot and adding some chrome new footage under the supervision of Freeland. Freleng was a totally inappropriate director who tried to manipulate Clampett's starting material, though in fact no director could hope to come closer to the insane Clampett foolishness. Inevitably, "Dough for Do-Do" is nothing more than raping a classic with a brand new name. For fans of cartoon movies like me, which is equivalent to the "Casablanca" coloring.
