I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should be the best movie ever. It is not. Monster looks like a villain from the Power Rangers, and has about the same extent of rubber movement. That might be fine if the manufacturers were not as proud of their design as it seems. This means that for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror movie that could benefit from some secrets, the shark gets a lot of time on the screen. He admits that he is usually restless and irregular. I think you should assume it's so scary that the cameraman is coming out. The camera goes to the person to eat, the camera goes into the shark. The camera returns to the person to be eaten, screaming and crazing. Thus. <br /> <br /> Costing is bad, acting is bad and special effects are partial, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely random to allow more people to eat, or something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who shot this movie definitely came up with more explosions = they think better. Characters shoot cars and a massive explosion occurs. They shoot helicopters, a massive explosion occurs. The barrels, the rocks, the trees, OR, all explode, so that in turn a furious shark explodes. When I say that I do not care how crazy a man is, I find it hard to believe anyone would think he would be trying to make a giant half of a shark with sex with a woman to make people of strange sharks the kids a good idea. That's unless the person is a crazy scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that the movie is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its badness is not enough for the long-term interest of the person. It could be good with MST3K with your friends, but if you are going to capture this bad boy, make a favor and change the channel.
