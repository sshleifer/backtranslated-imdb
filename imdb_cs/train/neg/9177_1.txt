The House of the Dead was the worst film I've ever seen, between the pathetic attempts at the 360 ​​"matrix" camera and the sleepy actor I fell asleep. I do not think the director and the set manager could decide whether it is raining or not, because on one side of the boat would rain and not the other. I should rate this movie 1 out of 10, (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Also jumping scenes from the movie into the game was really uncomfortable, making you wondering if they are just preparing for a waste of time. I ask everyone who reads it, DO NOT KNOW. It's not time.
