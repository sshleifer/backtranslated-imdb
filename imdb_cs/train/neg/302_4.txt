I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him. Not that I liked sleeping at all. Spenny destroyed this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend shoot a movie. Anyway it's pretty boring next to the scene with Roger Ebert in it. There are not too many celebrities in this movie, and most of them probably do not say more than one line. Overall, this film was a disappointment. I just wanted to watch if you have a DVD of Kenny vs Spenny with the season 1 (it's free on 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I'm still very excited to look at Papel Chase.
