Honestly, I can not bother to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is just too short. What I'm saying is that Alone In The Dark will manage only three things: 1. You will laugh but for all the wrong reasons. 2. Manages to throw a few unusable land into the air, but all of them fall out. <br /> <br /> 3. This will inherently inherit the classic PC game that is supposedly based on complete failure in all aspects of film making. Dr. Boll, if it really is what you are (I mean the proctology here), what are you doing on Earth in the director's chair?
