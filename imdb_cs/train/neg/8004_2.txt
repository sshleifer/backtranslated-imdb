First, let me say that the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great and CGI is properly done. It's a pity that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS UNDER ******** <br /> <br /> From the opening scene we can to see this movie being anti-American, it would not normally be bothering to make such a stereotype (we British get enough from Hollywood), but here's not gentle enough for Americans to become dead bodies. It goes beyond realism and your left thinks if Yank raped the mothers of the directors. The sad scene was really bad, and part of the movie where it started to go down. <br /> <br /> Here she will introduce the Olympic medalist of Aunt Tet and a drunken uncle who goes to the memorial and begins blaming her father for the death of his daughters, and then strikes him before everyone starts to come back on the floor crying. Hardly realistic binding in times of crisis! The whole viral sideline is ridiculous. If Americans know there is no virus, why spend time, money, and sources of investigation? The US government agent orders the brainwashing of innocent Korean for nothing, so the Americans look bad (or stupid); it was not helped by the fact that this boy was the eye of a cocoon. <br /> <br /> The film is about hunting monsters. American and Korean special forces are assigned to discovering creatures, though they are invisible through the film. The only people to hunt a monster in all of Korea is the main family and some random tramp who eventually appears to save the day! Naturally, several US / Korean agents are trying to stop on the road. <br /> <br /> The sister was included in the film only to be able to survive at the end of a vital hit. It was a clich√©, you knew it would happen, but to make it worse, doing everything in that part! and my final disillusionment, how the hell did that guy survive? monster floats with his head underwater for about 5 minutes! why did they not suffer the children?
