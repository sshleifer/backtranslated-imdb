I would give it a negative rating if I could. I went to this movie that did not expect much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! Snakes are, of course, fake, and the first two things that bite are boobs and boys johnson. Oh, how original; if I was a 12-year-old boy, I could laugh at it. I have no idea how this movie has become so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I did not have fun, it was not funny, I was not even bored! I was nothing. It was not so bad that it was good, it's just bad. Great. Do not waste money on this movie. Do not let this movie or rent it. There is no doubt about how high a rating is.
