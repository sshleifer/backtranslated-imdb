This film is a S.E. Hinton wrote in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 1980s, and Trueblood was actually one of them. The results could be much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a rather bad and fun piece of medium. Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumbler, I expect an accurate description. It was in the days of action movies that used boys in their 40s and mid30s, and dressed them in greaser threads or some sort of more feminine selection of gang clothing and they fought against miserable 80s music. However, Ray is lonely guardian of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a screaming part) who is forced to leave unexplainably on the train station when he escapes from the cops, is bombed and forced to serve the Marines. The flash goes forward today and Ray is back in town and is looking for his brother, who also became part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's opponent, and now the old score has to be violently settled (and again they must be cops and this time with the lady honor defended in the sense of action film) than Ray can continue life at a normal pace with his brother Donny. The film is ridiculous. For me, most of this is related to too much exaggeration, though not to Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn, who plays a serviceman with which he is spinning. The guys in the gang and Lowe seem to be making unnecessarily unnecessarily exaggerating like New York Street. Although a larger hanger is a recycled plot line and maybe some film that was a lot behind its main product of 1989.
