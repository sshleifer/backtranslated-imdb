Here we have two misunderstood children who have never had a chance against the cruel existence of poverty - Robin Hoods, which the police sensed as a persecution because she was sometimes wild. Gad! According to these crap, Bonnie was the sweetest little thing to the west of Missouri, who had learned to be a psychopathic murderer with a fun loving friend who really did not want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without doing a lot of energy to get them. He worked badly, made badly, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, a gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this waste water. Thumb down. -5 stars.
