Several unprofessional actors are terrorized by prehistoric creatures. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of the marginal stop-motion animation, but oh, how do you want this margin, when the rest of the movie will be replaced by animation workers waving around the inner tube with teeth. There is no time for terror when this film is hijacked by these comic boat boats that suddenly become the leading figures; but once again you have to admit watching them as they try to be funny, it's better than a sheriff's birth. Only at the end of one of them is eating and the other stays on the rock crying with tears of loneliness - it's no fun!
