We had to go to an appointment, so we turned on the DVR and recorded the end. At the end I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head. I said, "So you've been watching me the end of this movie and I have no idea what has just happened." He did not "make me", but you know. The film body itself was pretty good. There was a lot of tension here. That kept you. Then came the end. The end was ... well, it ended. You were not allowed what happened or why. Directly up to the credits I thought would explain something, but it never was. So I came to expect somebody to understand it and I just did not pay attention. No way. Here, four years later, I'm as clueless as the one who saw that I was. I still have no idea what's going on. I'm just glad I did not lose anything to buy it because I was certainly crazy. OHHHHH! I get it! The end of the movie is what disappeared! ROFL
