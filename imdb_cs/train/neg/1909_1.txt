One of the worst romantic comedies (the worst movies) I've ever seen. The boy (who works as a psychic phone!) He must pretend to be gay to move to the apartment with the wife of his dreams. Hilarity does not follow. Boredom, light gay-bashing, and horrible dialogue. If you read Brad Meltzer and you enjoy his dirty dialogue, you will enjoy this movie. Be smart. Avoid it. if you see it, destroy a copy.
