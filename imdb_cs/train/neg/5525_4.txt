The problem with family drama is that, apart from television films on channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to watch. And those that are tracked tend to be sensational and about current or current issues or issues in reports (or recent reports). Movies that explain or explore human beings are not popular. Especially with a young crowd who would be a fan of Miss Lohan or a younger crowd who tends to make films not only popular but financially successful for studios. The specific problems I have with this film are the cartoon of some of the characteristics. It was a lot to blame the character of Lohan's character (destroy the car, drug use, etc.) for what her father sent her. While it is unlikely, it is only a little to expect the audience to swallow. In addition, other aspects such as giving a young guy Morman oral sex, or actually becoming a good assistant to a vet who happens to have something for his mother, etc., all these elements just did not really help this movie . It was rather a sitcom that tried one of her "special dramatic episodes," then made it for a fully realized, well written feature film. When you look at a DVD and listen to a comment, especially for various alternative ends, you can really see everything that is sharp focus.
