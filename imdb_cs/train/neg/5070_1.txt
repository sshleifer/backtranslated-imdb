Television is affecting the company ... just look at the growing popularity of cappuccino stores after this smooth little piece debuted. Besides, real people who look as good as these people have no problems. In addition, does anyone really think that these people can afford to live in a beautiful manhattan attic with respect to what they do living? NBC just loves the insult to the viewer's intelligence, even though they are just around Gump's level. I know a man who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one-man apartment in Manhattan, which costs $ 2,100 a month in rent. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a show called Phriends where there are six ugly nobodies in dead jobs who live in a crazy neighborhood where the sirens are constantly wailing and someone is concerned every week ... and then the Lessor raises the rent. Now I look.
