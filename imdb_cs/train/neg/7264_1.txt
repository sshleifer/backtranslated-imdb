Just another film that uses unreasonable front male nudity; scary acting and love scenes are the most sexy without ever seen (and it's not me that I do not bind the idea of ​​two young people who love because I'm gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly demanding film with a story that gives enough arguments for a short film about five minutes, but he can create a 2-hour movie with him ... And this time , is not even the question of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community to talk about! God gracious merciful to us!
