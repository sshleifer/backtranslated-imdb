I've seen my share in Woody Allen's films, and although they're not always great, you can be pretty sure you're going to have fun. Probably the last really good were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - Since then, those I've seen are unsettled but observable. So when I was invited to see a new film by Woody Allen Melinda and Melinda, about which I did not even realize I was still released, I went happily. I have not heard much about it so I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. The assumption is over-explained, the cast is terrible, the scenario is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes did not say anything, and yet it was stretched, I suppose I would fill out what would otherwise be a 15-minute short film. I do not mind the concept of this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or tragedy, and of course the film continues to show us that by playing both scenarios. The problem is that none of these two movies are good at all. The comedy is not fun and the tragedy is not too tragic. Apparently, Allen came up with a good idea, but then he exhausted the couple or the time to finish the movie. The overall level of acting is also extremely bad - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and it's basically Woody Allen's impression. Previously actors such as Chloe Sevigny are just as unpleasant and the worst of the band is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame because her character is almost in every scene!). righteous to the actors, the script they work with is missing, if not there. Definitely a long way from Allen we know and love from classics such as Manhattan or Annie Hall.
