I was thrilled to see Catalu√±in's film in a Berlin competition. But after the performance I was completely disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many topics for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was terrible. Revenge, a very human behavior that is not pretty at all, is reflected in countless movies and games, as well as in gay and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr Villarong is trying to do is a pseudo tragedy that may be the worst film history. It's really a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I tell anyone to never see this movie under any circumstances.
