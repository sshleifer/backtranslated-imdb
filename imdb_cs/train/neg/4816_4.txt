I imagine the young people involved in making "Necromancy" (aka "Witchcraft" plus lots of other titles) had to feel a little strange creature with a man who had been involved with John Houseman in the production of proletarian play Cradle Will Rock "); People were afraid to think that foreigners were attacking ("World War"); and directed and starred in the greatest film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles starred in a 3-meter film about Satan's cult. There is essentially nothing creative about this movie. Lots of nudity, but background music is always really disturbing. Even if the film was not particularly predictable, it still was not good to see it. How little Welles sank. Fortunately, during the last thirteen years of his life, he has been telling the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about Warner Bros. cartoons for the 1940s) and hosted the documentary "The Man He Saw Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend the two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also plays Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
