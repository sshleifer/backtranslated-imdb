After watching "The Bodyguard" last night, I felt compelled to write a review. This could be a pretty decent movie if it was not for the awesome camera work. It was unpleasant. The angles were all bad, it was impossible to see anything, especially during combat sequences. It was even terrible. The story has Sonny Chiba, who is hired as a bodyguard, for anyone who wants to lead him to the top of the drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never equal with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, because Mob and other gang bangs are behind him. The story was decent, and despite the terrible dubbing it could be a good movie. Due to the better direction and editing, I'm sure it would be a classic Kung Foo movie. Similarly, it is more like another action movie of cheese 70. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence has a mark known to the fans of "Pulp Fiction" and then goes on to Karate School in Times Square, which is in no way related to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
