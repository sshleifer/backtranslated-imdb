I have to say that I usually like horror movies I have never seen ... but this was just amazing for me because of my depressing taste. I'm used to those horrible types, but this movie was lame. The game was terrible (although the scary (no toy intended) the unicorns were cute). And the sequel, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably when it first appeared, it was a huge wave and people liked it. But when she finds movies such as Ring and Exorcist Emily Rose, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow look childish. If you want the movie to pass through time, choose this one! Special effects are silky like heck. But when I see it was a low-budget movie, I can definitely see where it comes from. This will remind you of the film "Children of Corn". Independent rock movies ... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow who would kill people with corn maize, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows who would go to him, then these movies would be for you.
