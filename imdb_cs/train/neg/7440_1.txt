I'm going to the recording as the second person to search for movies after years of using IMDb, was motivated by the Purple Movie, Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. It was the worst movie I've ever seen all my life. The conspiracy was on the brink of non-existence, and none of the "puzzle-pieces" somehow remembered. The game was ridiculous and the script was embarrassing. How did this movie get back and become completely outside of me. The only saving mercy I found was Anastasia Hille, a cunning and repeatedly used word f. (And a brilliant sound design) If I were confronted with the possibility of seeing this movie again or being thrown out by wild openings, I would be against a complicated decision. I'm disappointed that I can not give 0 stars.
