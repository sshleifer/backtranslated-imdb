I saw this film a while back (working on a trailer for a film production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is at best average, Hopkins calls his performance in (but still blows Hewitt in his scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Trust me to avoid this movie, like a plague, if it ever gets. It seems to continue forever when the tired plot of land is at a noisy pace. It is tirelessly inoperative, cinematography is miserable and the direction is for pedestrians. Alec Baldwin should go to a film school if he plans to drive again. As for his acting, his character is totally unspeakable, which makes his rooting impossible. Dan Ackroyd is quite fun and the surprising makeup of the jury near the end of the movie is cute, but this movie is just terrible.
