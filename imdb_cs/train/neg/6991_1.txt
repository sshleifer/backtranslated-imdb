Just do not bother. I thought I'd see the movie with great enthusiasm and action. But after an exciting start it becomes boring and terribly predictable. In the middle of the movie, you have a small social lane and all the tension is lost because it slows down the speed. By the end it improves, but it is not really great. I think the director this movie was too serious. In this kind of movie, even if you do not like it, you're doing some nice action. I almost fell in the middle / main section. Rating 3/10. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br />
