Even in a bad movie is usually some redeemed feature, something you can say it was terrible, but there was that performance, that part of the script, or that strange effect, it was just horrible all along. The game was ridiculous, the script was horrible, accompanied by many unexplained breakfasts at Tiffany's links, and even the special effects were at best dirty. It was a very bad film, and even Drew Barrymore's wish was out of the question. See if you want to: a) suffer from harsh, self-injured pain. b) See how bad a movie can be. This is a movie in which I can use the clich√© "it's ninety minutes of life that I will never come back" with some justification!
