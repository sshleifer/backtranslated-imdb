I wanted to give Blood Drawing the benefit of initial doubts. Opening moments with a bloody woman sprang, and painter Diana was about to paint, and then the sucking of blood to exhaust her so she could use it for her art gave the impression that it might be a kick-ass artsy-vampire. This initial impression turned out to be untrue. Oh, Troma, a sign of any lack of quality: Occasionally they offer something that is litter but fun and at least some competence to junk food containers (or sometimes not). This is the case when it is not even fun to watch because his humorous attempts (ie the hero's father is an old vaudevillian who makes impressions of Jimmy Durant?) They are at best weak and any unintentional laughter undermines Sergio Lapel <br /> <br /> And it is not without trying, oh Sir. It is testing a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for the lights, of course, but the way they are used in the movie I created, a former study film director and an aspirant director who blinked in my seat: if I saw it in the theater, I would have blind eyes in many cases, he wondered if his DP really understood the basic three-point lighting. While this, along with a very faint sound design (or just a bunch of random loud buzz like on the scene of an art gallery), should not be something that will appear at the time of the Troma release, it should be something * essential * that a filmmaker can handle , although the script is not too humorous or frightening (and it is not), or if Lapel makes a strange mix of songs located in bizarre moments. It's not a good movie of any section, and maybe if you're a vampire (or just a vampire season), it may have a challenge as an alternative to a low rental base that is an alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, Blood Freak in 1972. You have a better way to lose your time overall.
