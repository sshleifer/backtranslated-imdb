After reading a book that was very important to me, the film gave me no sense of the book. It wonders if Kaufman liked this book because he did something else. Either it's just bad. The most important thing is where is lightness? Since the first scene, music has drowned most of the dialogue and feeling, and it continues straight through the film. I think the creators thought that, thanks to the playful play of the music, this story would have been easy - but they did not fail here. Instead, music can provide everything that "film feels", dramatizing events, so we look at them, so it's really hard. Another example of how this adaptation has failed is decorating the story to make it more dramatic. In the film we see that Franz goes through Tomas on the street that is on his way to Sabina. The introduction of this random meeting / meeting, which certainly did not happen in the book, makes Tom's story more important than light does. There are a number of other examples where the continuity story was changed, it is the worst, but it could be done because the book simply does not convert into a movie, such is Kunder's style. We're wondering if all the generous reviewers on this site have written their book and film experience in mind, rather than just writing about the movie. A movie that is so long that it is unbeatable. For those who have not read the book, I only recommend reading. For those who have, I have to say that you just lose your time and you probably end up writing a similar reminder.
