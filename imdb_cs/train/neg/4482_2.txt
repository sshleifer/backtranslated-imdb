Perfect little devotion ... I doubt one shot took more than 4 weeks after MTV. Horrible casting, worse than Kusmin's verse (remark: he managed to overcome Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But hey - the rich got what they deserved. The dark and angry Heathcliffe shrunk to the state of the golden thoughtful angel, the fragile and angelic Catherine introduced as a peculiar, meloun-breasted heffer, silent and weak Linton is peeping tom, and innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle-Gellar character from cruel intentions. 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and donors Abercrombie and Fitch - note. This thing was made for you. This is an hour and a half long music video where everything is given; you are saved from uncomfortable necessity without trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from the initial shock to their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said earlier, they were mistaken. A decent photo, but editing is at the level of TV production in high school. I urge you all: read a book or even cliffnotes; looking at his previous versions, even on Kusminsky's; but keep away from numerous future repetitions during which you will not have the benefit of a free commercial premiere.
