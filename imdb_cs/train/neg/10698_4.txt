Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film, while Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: Halfway around, Murray ignites because The Darkling is a kind of demonic creature that lives victoriously. He takes the rush and losers and throws them, while giving them everything they want in terms of success. It comes from the joy of the Seven Deadly Sins. Part of it, however, is that it needs to get people who may be faulty but not very bad. Otherwise, he can not "reverse" his natural goodness. That's what the little guy said in my voice, Barry White, which I found both charming and fun. Mostly fun. Like Barry White, if he was a little dwarf, he said to Aiden Gillen, "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, come here, Dee Plane!" During the film, Dee Dwarf (actually a robot cherub) speaks with Aiden Gillen in Barry White's voice and says, "It's okay to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you've committed murder, you've really been around the world," and other notes that sound like advertising for "Being Evil" or something like that. It's really a cheerful and sick way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Aiden Gillen is not F. Murray Abraham and film tanks once Murray gets an ax (or knifed?). F. Murray brings some happy anger to his role in this film. He's a good actor. Aiden Gillen, on the other hand, has a continual happy grin and looks like his English correctional comp. the class never touched Mythological characters and could not imagine what the film was about. ENDING is really scary and yet pretty funny. If this movie was a parody, the end was perfect. If it was not a parody, it was scary; but the cheap use of a small girl to add that the film itself can not. People who lost this movie, what they want to do with it sometime before the end. It just ends up as if they just realized they had run out of their money and had to make a quick ending.
