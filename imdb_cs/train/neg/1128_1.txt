This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Clean manure. How could someone connect with a heroine or have empathy for her is behind me. I felt I was looking at the history of the case of a schizoid individual with a borderline personality disorder. Just terribly. <br /> <br /> In its farthest light it can be seen as an attempt to produce and an "artistic" film - except that I could not find any art for my life <br /> <br /> If this the woman lived in today's world, she could be taken to a psychiatric facility and treated for a few days with antipsychotics. This, or simply allowed to walk the streets and become a bag. Why other characters in this movie have found something that has redeemed her - and trying to help her in her quest to become an actress - speaks more about their pathology than any convincing qualities that have made her worth it.
