Maybe it's dubbing, or perhaps endless scenes of people who cry, fall or go differently, but I found Europe51 as one of the most revolutionary (and therefore unpleasant) films I've ever seen. The film starts promising if it's good, because Mother Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled son (Sandro Franchin). While mum and daddy (crazy Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests for dinner, the young man tries to kill himself and kicks off a vibrantly changing series of events that finds Bergman spending time compassion for the poor and needy. Inspired by Communist editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she will soon spend more time with suffering than her husband who will soon infest her with a mad asylum institution for her troubles. Bergman plays a holy role on the handle, reflecting her role in 1948 as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini makes a fantastic job of lighting and shooting as much as possible. The script unfortunately loses its point of home with a brown subtlety because Andrea and Mom alternately declare Marxist and Christian phrases. I had the last final tear of the scene more than I filled these tired figures. The real step for Rossellini when he left neorealism, and he also accepted the mythical and mystical motifs of the flowers of St. Frantisek from 1950.
