I can not believe I was so angry when I saw that I was going to write my first IMDb review. This Disney document is nothing but a rehasted Planet Earth lite. Now I knew it was promoted as "from the people who brought you the planet Earth", but I did not know they would obviously use exactly the same cuts as the pioneering documentary mini-series. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something she already has on DVD. Disgusting Disney that he did not inform people that there was nothing at all at all (except for James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of sailing ships that I do not think they are on the planet Earth). the biggest crime of all, is that while Planet Earth uses a tragic story of a polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took this story and turned it into a friendly family. After the demise of a male polar bear, they show that his young one grows a year later and empties some garbage on how they are prepared for his memory and that the country is a really beautiful place. No mention of grown-up pups who could get to death because of the same situation their father had suffered, no warning of the problem for future generations, unless we have a joint venture, nothing. It's just a montage thing we've seen all over the movie (and many times more if you're one of the billions of people who've already seen the planet Earth). The theater has never left me shy and cheated in my life.
