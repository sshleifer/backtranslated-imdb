Man, what the hell were the people who made the film? More importantly, where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the movie: a woman who nudes naked in a circle of fire and turns into a werewolf. And it's not a transformation of Rick Baker's "werewolf," the people. We are talking about the worst makeup ever recorded on the film. Can I imagine some stoned Italian glue spread on naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniel, the protagonist of the film (is that a word?)) And asked her to roll in a fur coat. Well that's bad. <br /> <br /> From here it is not much better. Minutes are useless, because the scenery chew a male waffle actor on Daniela and her conditions, or something (I can not remember, but the dialogue is so bad when you do not laugh at it, you will cry). The funny thing is that Daniel is not a werewolf, it's a psychic who goes mentally whenever he's around (understandable because he's been raped as a child), so he thinks he's going to become a werewolf like her the predecessor of opening the scene). He can not help, but he plucks the throat of every man he meets and just wants to be loved! Things are starting to look for Daniel when he meets and falls in love with a buffoon stuntman who does not fill her "episodes". Take a look at the assembly, which is one of the most popular ones you've ever seen (laughing and skidding after diving headed through the window). <br /> <br /> Daniel's luck does not last when the film is filmed brutally, she is suddenly defeated and raped by a group of offenders who killed the stuntman. She remembers that I "spit on my grave," Daniel draws a bloody revenge on her rapists. <br /> <br /> This is 100 minutes of my life, I will never be back. But hey, that's the game you play when you're a movie geek.
