My roommate got a soundtrack Well, No, Nanette like a dab on a tape and she was listening to her continuously. After I finally figured out the brains with subordination, I found out that the songs are irresistible, especially famous, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But the rough soundtrack did not know what the movie was about. So the next day I saw his copy at a video rental and rented what was to be a long-lost version of the movie. I thought it would be amazing because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I've ever loved were not in the video I've seen. Now I have never seen a 1930s version of the musical, but this version was unfortunately disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dance, and besides, the sound was really bad and you could not understand what people are saying a lot of time. Indeed, the only highlight of this movie was the bizarre fashion of 1940. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that look like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre eye that holds on the front shoulder and then wrapped in this clean shawl. One dance sequence is a little strange when Nanette does this strange ballet thing with a picture of the girl's blades that throws her on it. In fact, it was one of Guillespa's best films, dreaming about being a visual artist, but is currently being condemned to draw pin-up girls for money. I like Guillespe keeping an old school and doing Nanette when his work, the work to do his career, sells Nanette for a miserable $ 5250. Does not he realize that the piece is his immortality? Stupid rabbit / girl with your feathers on your hat. When do you learn? Why is not it just a cigarette before the advertising men take the job?
