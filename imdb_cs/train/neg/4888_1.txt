Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips was left lonely enough when he made "Criminally Insane" 10 years before releasing this painful fear of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" lasted less than an hour would have to pay him to the fact that this story probably came out of everything he got out of ... but he decided to use TONS from the original from this one too, to the point of recycling the original initial credit sequence! Unfortunately, returning to aging quickly Priscilla Alden did not save this possibility. What little original footage in this movie looks like it was shot with a leased handheld video camera! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and I would be just as surprised if it happened! Avoid this and instead look at the original!
