I have recently seen the documentary "The Revolution Will not be a TV", also known as "Chavez: Inside the Conquest". Initially, I thought it had a real internal view of the events during the April 2002 Indonesian coup. But what bothered me was that the tone of narration and accompanying music were suggestive and that Hugo Chavez was not criticized at all. That's odd, because if the document makes an obscure description of what happened, it should be something like that. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary has been for several years, there is plenty of additional information available on the internet, and it has not been difficult to find, for example, "Urgent Chavez Investigation" - a coup d'état from 5 European television companies that funded a film that is a disappointment about Venezuela. "Lists many bugs and intended or unintentional fake in a document. (Just use the name as a search string on Google, you can find it.) Another interesting document was a video presentation of many mistakes in this document," X-Ray Lies. " a good counterbalance "Chavez: Within the coup" It's available at video.google.I strongly recommend that you look at "Chavez: inside the coup" to look at "X-ray lies" and then create your opinion. Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Brian were (consciously or not) part of Chavez's propaganda.
