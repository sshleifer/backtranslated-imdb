Absolute waste, worse combat scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or American ninja, etc. <br /> <br /> Really terrible acting, not the ability to watch in the whole movie is like casting wooden statues. /> <br /> Just look at how bad this movie is, it could have been acceptable in the 1980s, but it's a 2006 movie, I do not like this movie because it was not born 80s. <br /> <br /> If you like real combat movies, then look at tons of ja in ong baku and protector, these are the right martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> laugh and look at it today you can see unintentional humor on how gloomy it is.
