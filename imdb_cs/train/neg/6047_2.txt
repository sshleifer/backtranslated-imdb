What the French link worked so well is the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russ (Scheider). In this disaster, directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such jewels as Raindeer Games and Dr. Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his unique obsession with capturing Charnier (Rey). The imaginary idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of French local authorities laughed loudly. Please correct me when I'm wrong, but Charnier did not miss a city with only 65 pounds of pure smack !!! 32 million streets, but yeah, we'll send Doyle to find this guy, it's his end. Please!!! The story was weak. The game was terrible (with the exception of Hackman, who completely played his part). Direction was everywhere. Even the cutouts between the scenes were terrible. Make a favor and look at the first installment twice and skip this.
