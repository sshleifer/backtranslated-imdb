There is a word for this kind of movie and this word is "nasty". It was a cripple when it was hiring VHS, and it's a jerk on the satellite. <br /> <br /> You could be fooled by having reasonably soundtrack music in Kistofferson and Henriksen's well-known names, and the pretty Monument Valley scenery. <br /> <br /> It also has some curly hair that fights a lot. If that's all you want from the movie, then it might be happy. <br /> <br /> It's still miserable.
