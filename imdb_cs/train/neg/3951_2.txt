1980's "The Boogey Man" Ulli Lommel is not classic, but it's an above average low-cost cooler that's worth a look. The sequel, 1983 "Boogey Man II" is ultimately a waste of time, but at least it's fun if we do not take the smallest bit seriously. Now I left the door open for the next continuation, and I would not have intended to see at least one more. One day, when I went through video footage at a shop in the store, I came across a movie called The Return of the Boogian Man. When I found it was a continuation of older films, I enjoyed making some money ... I should know better. Although the title is "Boogey Man 3", this is no continuation of the two much better films I have named above. Well, not so completely. <br /> <br /> Pro: Ha! That's laughter. Is there anything good about this piece of cow dung? Let's see ... it's got a trace from "The Boogey Man" and, um ... it's mercifully short. Yeah, that's probably it. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Where to start? Decisions, decisions. First, this movie is a total hole. It emits from one scene to another without any distant or terrifying happening. The game is at best stiff. "Actors" are most likely friends of a director who had no previous acting experience and probably none of them. Give is nonexistent and the script is written. Direction is just terrible. The director tries to make the film look at all artistic farthes by moving the camera around, flashing lights and filters, but it does not add anything. Music is boring and heavy. The bindings on the original are distorted. Suzanna Love's character was named Lacey, not Natalie! And the events described at the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Also, if it has this number 3 in the title, why does it not even mention what happened in II. Finally, it does not make anything new or interesting for either the series or the genre. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: People who are wasting time and money should be ashamed of themselves. It's one thing if it was an original film that was the first and soaked director. But instead, it's supposed to be a sequel to a movie that's not a masterpiece, but it's damn sure a lot more interesting and fun than this. If there is another sequel I doubt, then I have to forget that it sometimes happened and will be either Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea how to make a decent horror film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
