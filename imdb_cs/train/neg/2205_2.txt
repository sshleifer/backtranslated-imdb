This type of land has great potential but was destroyed here. I honestly felt a cheese element at first, but I thought it would improve after the grotesque birth. I was wrong! So a mad scientist does a monster, wants to brag about his old friends before killing them, but of course escapes. After that, it's really bad. I had to count on how a shark-shark mask looked for some leaves, but I would probably lose counting. <br /> <br /> Go to the blood, dripping as the shark is looking for people. I hate to have a spoon of all aspects of horror film. Oh, and after being almost murdered by a mutated shark and jogging around the jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more fun than the middle one that will talk you to Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> This is where you find yourself in the monster dominance ... if you can bear to watch this bad excuse for the movie.
