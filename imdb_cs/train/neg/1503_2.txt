that's unbelievable! Fidani (who was also a spiritist) was one of the cheapest directors all over the world. This movie stole the original title of Leone's "Duck you sucker!" but tell the boring story of Pinkerton's agent against the murder "Testa di Ferro" (unexpected stuntman Gordon Mitchell). Everything is bad and crazy in this film filmed in the expensive country of Lazio. The story is also bad and crazy. Fidani was not at the same time capable and ingenuous. The story has become some crazy illogical stuff (like a discussion in the Sheriff's House and the dementilous appearance of Butch Cassidy! Yes, really, Butch Cassidy, which is portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd behavior, illogical plot, bad acting and fugue from one of the most respected anchorman in the Italian television story Renzo Arbore. Of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it's great and terrible, but I'm sure it was only for money and for playing with iron horses) 2 out of 10, but ... NEVER YOU !!!!!
