I recorded this picture on FX last night, and when I sat there looking at him, I thought it might be the worst movie ever. Bad play, bad cinematography, bad sound, absolutely incredible combat sequences, silly characters. It all caused it to be the saddest movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was enchanted by the fact that it was absolutely the lack of something competent that I had to watch ... and went on!
