Zu Warriors should definitely be an animated series because in the movie it's like watching an old anime on acid. The film starts from nowhere, and people just fly around fighting metal wings and other silly weapons until this princess has sacrificed her mistress on a cloud or something like that. Whether this princess is a god or an angel, it is behind me, but soon enough this flying wind is a bad guy coming in and killing her while that fellow with razor wings is fighting some other mystical God / Demon / Wizard thing. The conspiracy line is not either there, or it's extremely difficult to see that you have to be madly intelligent to get into this movie. The plot is soon followed by this Chinese mortal who is called by this deity to fight evil flying, a princess killing an evil guy, and soon we have a very poor choreography by Uwe Boll as a combat scene complemented by terrible martial arts creations on a mountain or something like that. Even the visuals are strange, some might say they are stunning and colorful, but I say they are blurry and like an acid trip (yes that's a word!) I watched it as dubbed and subtitles and both were just as bad and difficult to understand .... Who I am doing fun I did not understand it all.It felt like I was watching an episode of 30 anime in 1980 and completely missed as the story started or as he started reading comic series 5 at number 4 because I had no idea how this started where it went or when it was over, I was lost all the time. I can honestly say it was one of the worst movie experiences ever, as if you were watching Inu-Yashu in episode 134 drunk ... yeah, that's true, you do not know what the hell is going on. the brain is trying to solve it.
