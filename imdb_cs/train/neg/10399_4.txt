One of the main shortcomings of this film is that while the mockery of demanding yuppies is satisfying, they can not realize that film producers are guilty of being one of those who deserve to laugh. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppie is the intended misunderstanding that they (yuppies) are the only ones who are sufficiently sophisticated to understand art. While the film ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstanding in dining, I find it ironic that only people enjoying this movie have a taste in movies as well as those who make the choice of dinner. If these pompous characters that were in this movie had a home video at home, I would bet American Psycho would be one of those movies.
