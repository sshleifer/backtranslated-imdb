Since I've seen part 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they should NEVER do Part 4. Everything from sticky, and that means I did not like it's really bad, I'll take anyone to watch it, thinks. I think parts 1 through 3 have kept the atmosphere strong on the Damion, but without it, it's not the same thing. Surely until the end of the third part I got a little tired of the ongoing story line, but it was a good ending at the end of the third. Again there was no reason for Part 4. Even if it was possible they could do a much better job than this sh * t I had to sit down, lol. In an hour and a half of my life I can never see.
