Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, excuse me ... treasurer, whatever that means) that comes from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his predecessors got a clue about where treasures exist, which our founders, most if not all freemasons, chose to hide because they simply did not want to fund their independence so badly. <br /> <br /> The first mention is that it is located in a long lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, composed of Ian (Sean Bean), Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of Immortal "Gigli") and a few homeless, enter the cargo area of ​​the ship. They instantly spill tons of gunpowder all over the floor, not that it is by no means significant. They finally find the leash (the skeleton floats above it), and it turns out to be a pipe with writing ... on it. Howse. Do not ask me to explain it. It's a puzzle, and despite the fact that his expedition is obviously confused by not finding a real treasure, Gates wanders around as he fathoms about the meaning of the riddle in this frozen cargo ship, while the crew just stands around slack-jawed. I mean, come on. Someone should be a bit of singing in his disappointment that he's coming to the busy Arctic and finds nothing interesting, but he's just standing there when Gates enters his world and solves the riddle. <br /> <br /> The next key turns out to be a declaration of independence. Ian decides to steal him. Gates is horrified. Different characters offer a clear exposure (get used to). All this leads to John's boy pulling a gun on Gates, and the gunpowder will be in a big explosion. (that's why they poured all the gunpowder!) Ian and his followers flee, and Gates and the Dork Riley movie go nine miles at lower temperatures to the Inuit village to stop them. <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Riley then tells Gates in unbearable details why they can not steal the declaration because it is so protected by metal and laser eyes and high-tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that there's an opportunity to steal her from the Conservation Room. Riley says, what is the Conservation Room, will Gates ask? "Where do jams and jellies do?" I am not joking; this is the real line. Bartha does not even offer it as a joke. So Riley conducts all research on the Library of Congress and Archive and Water and Sewerage, fercryinoutloud, but does not know what a Conservation Room is. This indicates to a great extent at what level this script is. <br /> <br /> To the rest of this short, Gates actually kicks off with D I, in an absurd break-in that can only happen in the movie. (I also hate the way in which computer monitor technology is displayed - full of unlikely and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase will end up with a sign of comfort and an obvious angle of interest. At one point, these three, on the run, by law, discuss all their plans really loud in the clothing stores surrounded by people. A series of seizures and kidnappings by Father Gates, played by dyspeptic Jon Voight, leads good guys and bad guys to the huge entertainment house of Indiana Jones, located under New York. Particularly, metro builders have never found this thing. Gates and Gates Head Ian leads the wild geese of persecution. Ian believes they are trapped in a blind alley and left there. However, after they are gone, Riley asks how they get out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... press the button and the door opens. No I mean it seriously. Button, as if they were on an empty toilet in an office building. He knew where he was. Anyway, after a few more steps, they find the tremendous treasury (remember this is all under Manhattan!) Full of all sorts of historical golden things. Riley gets really stupid. Again. And the FBI Officer Harvey Keitel forgives them, they arrest Sean Bean and allow two chemical methods to get married. For each viewer, I think it would be hard to ignore the whole exposure, the logic and stereotypical signs for a very long time. Although some of his exposition includes pretty historical lessons inserted into a conversation at random. I'd like to have more conversations in this life.
