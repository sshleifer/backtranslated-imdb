I really did not like the movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in the camp and we did not like it, we laughed. Certainly, some parts touch, but the acting is terrifying, the effects are terrible and the whole movie idea is terrible (now I know it was based on a book I did not read but I hope the book was better than this, because frankly I'm he thought this film was very bad and boring. As I said, I went with a group of people out of the camp and we were excited to be there, plus I had a caffeinated drink, but I kept trying to stay awake. The only thing that kept me (except that I was afraid I woke up when I woke up) were shots that were totally useless. I really did not like it.
