I do not know why this behavior has been tolerated in the film industry! This movie (short) is rough (at least)! It's a lot of 5-7 year old kids who wear diapers with big bobby pins, act as adults (and too much!). But it is interesting because it is a good example of how good old days were not good! (Thank God we have laws against this kind of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is one short of "Shirley Temple Festival"}
