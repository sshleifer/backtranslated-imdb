It started badly, it was getting worse, and when the girl attacked the old lady at the end I literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we lent her and kill her with that death. Avoid this movie, some good cinematography and naked shots would be almost acceptable if I was 14 years old and Jenna Jameson was not seen naked a million times. If someone feels the need to watch this movie, I would strongly recommend that you spend the time more appropriately, as an example I would say that trying to infuse the Lego House into your sleep without erasing would be a good start. I have heard that this movie was not the original version, I would like to see the original because it seems that this cut version lacks all the conspiracy and most of the nudes seem to be able to tell me how I can get in contact with the Christian Villem owes my hour of my life back!
