This is the biggest insult to TMNT at all. Successfully, officially Venus does not exist in the TMNT cannon. There will never be a female turtle, it has lost the tragic story of four male unique mutants, who never have their own family, once did not disappear. The biggest mistake was to cross the Power Rangers to TMNT with a terrible episode; the tortoises were bad, and they all stood out of nature. They could do better work, better designs and animatronics and NE VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about these people ... it's good stuff. the lip flap was slow and unnatural. they did not respect the crushers altogether. the main baddie, some dragon-lord buddy was raucous. the turtles look furious with things hanging from the body what's going on around the raffin's thigh? stupid looking plasters! <br /> <br /> If they look normal, they act in rumors and get rid of Venus, get rid of silly children's cartoon sounds ... and better writing could be good.
