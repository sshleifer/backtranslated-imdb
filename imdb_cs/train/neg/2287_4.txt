I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and I really do not remember her, but she worked great like a naive girl who was looking at pictures because it makes people happy. <br /> <br /> She did not really think that what she was doing was bad, even when she left the company and found her religion again. The photos she has made are sure to be shaking with today's standards, and it's funny to see men with cameras getting all excited, and politicians pontificating the evil of pornography. David Strathairn (Goodnight and Good Luck) played a great role here. Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous girl.
