The actress filming a film in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires someone to go and bring her back. Complications are all jungle cannibals who worship a really ugly-looking "god" who likes to eat naked women. This is a horrible, clumsy movie. There is a great deal of nakedness and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It's an explosive film designed to appeal to the deepest dark parts of our being, and if the movie was not that boring, this movie would be classic. It allows it to face, despite the gore, ugly sex and abuse and the ugly monster, this movie is a snoozer. Stimulation is totally useless and will lead you. There are several parts of the fence that seem to be separate from each other despite the fact that it is the whole story. The worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue concerns the atrocities or protests of one person who "do what I want". It's such a quiet and boring film that if it were not for the frequent shouting of the victims, I would recommend it as a sleep aid. This is a movie to avoid if you do not need to sleep or if you do not want to see every European cannibal movie. (VideoAsia's video site has just released it as part of the Terror Tales series.) Their prints are special characters that appear to be the result of their print from a Japanese source (there is a fog) cut off to remove the subtitles, and their press has no introduction titles)
