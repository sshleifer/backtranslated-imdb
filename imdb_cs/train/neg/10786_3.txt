How this movie was shot with so many big stars is outside of me. It's a terrible clich√©, a movie with the worst performers one of these actors has ever done, and I'm really surprised that so many of them Star List would agree with this unfortunate film, What's even worse is the fact that they've happened in almost every country 100 million It's going to show, however, that big stars can pull out money even though the film is terrible I apologized to all the participants in this snoring Billy Crystal tried to do as much as possible with what was given to him, that the other stars are moving in. Whatever I do, it does not belong to an excellent cast, because no one could save it.
