This movie is something like a sequel to "White Zombie," because it is made by the same man (Halperin) and is a zombie. Halperin, George A. Romero of his day, but he does not reach this man. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and seek to destroy the source of his power, so the zombies can be sent for free. Also, love interest for the evil man. Where this movie really stands out is in this picture. Cambodian temples and dancers are very kind and the zombies look very strong in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we really do not see a lot of zombies in action, and the love story seems to play too much a role in horror film (even if it has a valid reason for plotting later). <br /> <br /> I would love to see some zombies attack the helpless city people in the 1930s, but they just did not get this movie. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) expected to fight against our heroes. And using Lugosi's eyes? A nice effect, but misleading because never in the movie ... why did not he create it again with new eyes? Overall, a movie that could be great and a small script could be reprocessed and could be a powerful remake sometimes (especially if it retains it in the same post-war timeframe). Hell, if they can solve "The Hills Have Eyes," then this movie has hope.
