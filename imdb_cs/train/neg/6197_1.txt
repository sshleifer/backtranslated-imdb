At the end of the film, I asked myself, "Is it a worse movie I've ever seen, or is it a worse movie I've ever seen?" And the answer is ... Actually, after seeing this movie and thinking a bit about its meaning, you just can not find any meaning and you can only remember two scenes that are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director has tried to put the question in the head of the crowd: "What are these crimes in comparison to the horrors of war and extermination?" as I noticed the two terrible scenes that are directly linked to the war and are horror (during the first scene you can shout the terrified girl and at the same time hear one of President Bush's speeches about the need to launch a war with Iraq, and on the other scene, pictures of three criminals who actually have a sword on a woman's vagina, are directly followed by archival pictures of World War II, but in fact I could not think of relative gravity with two different kinds of human horror I've done, I was too shocked by what I just saw and felt sorry for bad English)
