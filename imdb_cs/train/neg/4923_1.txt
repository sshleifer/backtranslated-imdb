It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie has nothing positive about. Some of you like this movie! I saw a lot of Dracula movies and I liked everything I saw, but when I saw the movie I said, "What the hell is that?" What stupid film. Now Dracula will become what he is because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt guilty of hanging. You are kidding me. That's the dumbest reason I've ever heard why Dracula became evil. Who also asked for a reason? What is this movie of this film? Whoever has come up with this sorry film, he should be suppressed. Even Dracula is terrible. If you've ever seen this movie, you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should he have the title done for me? Do not waste your time or money on this waste.
