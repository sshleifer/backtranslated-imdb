The problem with CONTRACTEREM is summarized in the opening scene. The CIA wants a dead international terrorist, so the contact black-ass murderer James Diall. The terrorist appears at a court in Old Bailey, London, which raises the question of why they want to expel the terrorist if he spends the rest of his life in prison? It will either be out of circulation. Was not the CIA had a chance to be arrested? If he accidentally gets an innocent verdict, then he will kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will spend their lives in the maximum security juncture <br /> <br /> Because the premise sets the story, the audience may decide to ignore the conspiracy, but the association itself pours fuel into the fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and a taxi driver in an accident, but Dial can escape. So the police were close enough to shoot someone, but too far to catch someone in a car accident? A film of this type of plot. Later, Dial finds a police inspector who is pointing a gun when he says, "this airport is surrounded by armed copper," but Dial can escape very easily without explanation. The entire movie cheats on its audience by relying on things that are never explained. This includes an important supporting character called Emily Day. Why is he helping Dial, even if he's a wanted fugitive? Your estimate is as good as my <br /> <br /> This is a rather poor thriller and do not take it to a "big name". Wesley Snipes qualified as a movie star but killed his career by playing in many inconsistent films. Charles Dance also appeared in the big budgets of Hollywood productions, such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but once again he is best known for having these days appear on the DVD and basically playing portraits. Like Lena Headey, they can become big players in the cinema, but they will surely not give CONTRACTER to their resume
