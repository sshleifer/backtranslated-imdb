This movie should never be made. <br /> <br /> What a pity on the budget. <br /> <br /> Find convincing actors and get the right movie. Very thin fence and unconvincing lines. Almost cheerful and it is a shame for action film .... <br /> <br /> It is definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Continue to play the same "shots" of the Stealth aircraft off. You saw it, and it was not good to run it again 3 or 4 times. It's time for Steven Seagal to leave the movie. <br /> <br /> His films are getting worse. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were bad, but this movie is even worse.
