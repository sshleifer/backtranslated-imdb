It would be much improved by being a 50 minute episode of Outer Limit. Too much surplus material and such as the main dirty man seemed to escape from The Phantom of the Opera did not help. The entire "Night of the Living Dead" sequence was incredibly stupid and quite useless. After all, if the dead were punished for sins, remind me who killed them all?
