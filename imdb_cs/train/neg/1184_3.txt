this film had a fairly good sound, but the paste was very slow ... really very slow. even if someone thought it was a cult classic, I think there are much better movies to watch than that. Cinematography is not great, but not the worst. the sounds are fine. lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anybody other than a movie student. <br /> <br /> The film does not contain music and the horses have sex, Or it's either good. and the woman who masturbates on the edge of the bed was simply stupid. <br /> <br /> No winnings here, skip this boredom. I've seen even more, believe me, but it's just a waste of time and I have no good reviews here. especially high ratings ...
