This film is about British war prisoners of WWII who escaped from the camp in Germany. I have found that the "Wooden Horse" is disappointingly boring. The subject could be exciting, exciting and adrenaline, but "The Wooden Horse" is narrated in a very clear way. It's a collection of simple and ill-told events, without any pause and excitement. The first half clearly tells how prisoners of war dug the tunnel, but the events are so clear they do not have enough mistakes and sharp shins to keep me on the border. The other half of the film is even worse, just moving from one place to another without it being for boys and cats. And the characters could talk a little less and have more action in the action movie! I'm disappointed with the "Wooden Horse", losing the potential to be a great movie.
