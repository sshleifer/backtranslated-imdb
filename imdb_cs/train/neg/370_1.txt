Blank Check is easily one of the worst movies of the nineties. The drawing is totally useless; his underlying loneliness is pathetic. You really believe that a twelve-year-old actor, who acts as a personal assistant to a millionaire, could do everything in this film, such as buying a lock for just $ 300. The idea, let alone the price of a sublease, will only trust the audience to the audience. Please respect your intelligence and do not look at this terrible, terrible movie.
