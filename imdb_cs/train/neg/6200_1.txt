This is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. This makes the "Requiem for Dream" look like a Disney movie. Although it is a technically reasonable design, acting, cinema, music, direction, etc., they are good. But the final scene of the rape gang is the worst and worst thing I've ever seen, and I really wish I could not see her. I'm afraid he will scare me all my life. Though I think someone thought the movie was very worrying, my wife and some of her friends were sacrificed very similarly, and I really did not need an explicit reminder of the horror they experienced. I saw a movie at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX and none of the cast or crew was present. I would love to have the opportunity to defend the violence in my film, which I considered to be excessive, free and unnecessary. The earlier scene successfully communicated the mood they apparently sought, but without bothering her face in extreme and explicit sexual violence. This movie should be wearing a large WARNING label. For these reasons, I would not recommend anyone see it. You were warned.
