This obvious disorder can have Mr Branagh's kibos career as Shakespeare's cinema adapter. (Released 4 years ago, not looking for adaptation ever since.) I just watched it on the cable - holy God, it's terrible. I agree with the opinion of the reviewer below, who said that reviewing something so self-evident and sad is an irrational act that appears to be creepy. That being said, I will take the risk, just because Love is laborious lost * is a perfect reward for those who have in the past invested with the leadership of Mr Branagha. Bran√°gh was always a miserable director: he was literally thoughtful; star-strike; (loves his American stars, but he loves more and he's damn sure he'll get all the good lines). In this sense, it is a sad fact that * Love is Work Lost * is a bit worse than the infinite, haunted, bloated Hamlet since 1996. In fact, this film may be more suitable, just because it is about 1/3 of the length . Branagh has decided that it would be good to update this poor early work of Shakespeare to the environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So it sets in 1939, leaving about eighty of the text intact in favor of eloquent interpretations of the standards of the thirties (wait until you see the actors who are in the course of "I'm in the sky" on the floor) shooting actors who are not known for their dancing or singing ). The result is a catastrophe that is so unreal, that one remains incredibly strong that, after looking at the first diaries, they have not been able to call a terrible stop. I do not even blame the cast. To paraphrase Hamlet, "The script is a thing!" NEVER could get well in this pile: admirers of RSC graduates are not better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could behave in this matter? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first mistake of Branagh was the thought that Love is Labor Loss * was a game that is worth shooting. Believe me, it is not. It is an anomaly in the Barda Canon, which is explicitly written for an educated basket of courtiers - NOT the usual audience for which he wrote. That's why there are lots of rare (and TEDIUS!) Word-play, links to contemporary scholastic nonsense, parody Lyly * Euphues *. . . in other words, hardly any material that can appeal to a wide audience. Damn it does not concern spectators who are already ready in Shakespeare's comedy. The game can not be organized without drastic cutting of the text and desperately "updating" it with any trick that is available. Which raises the question: Why bother? Branagh's second mistake was that Shakespeare's cream cake made a sub-order of Gershwin's marmalade. It is clear that the idea or hope was that the modern, deaf Elizabethan exercise would be delicious for the modern audience by administering the nostalgic American pop culture at the same time. But again, this raises the question: Why bother? <br /> <br />
