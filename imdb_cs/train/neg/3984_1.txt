I've seen this movie for several years back on the BBC I've been sitting over it. As? I do not know it's so down on the charts "so bad it's good," Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman have to collapse when they see it now. I think Woody Allen would do wonders with extraterrestrial land and the Baldwin part could be played with Leslie Nelson's gusto. It was again tonight, I tried to watch again, but life was too short. the few minutes I've been watching for Nicole was beautiful that she was so hot around 93, does Baldwin ever have a good movie? Pullman played his song in a "nice but subdued" business when the F-word comes out of his mouth when a lady from a "frasier" miscast ed as a detective accuses him of murder sounds so bad. stay away.
