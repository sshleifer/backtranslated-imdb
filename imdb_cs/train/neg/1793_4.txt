An interesting concept of vampirism that has something to do with the virus (but has done it several times) The overall movie is too long and stretches a little. Modifications could be more stringent. I'm sorry to hear about the credit problem. Perhaps the film has been rushed to the market. The lighting was too dark sometimes. But the worst technical problem is sound. The level was good enough to hear a dialogue, but many interiors have echoes, which is very disturbing. Either in the recording they were not careful, or a better mix of sound. He also got too much background noise. Someone who would make sound effects for martial arts scenes should come. The Tinov sword of the swords that had begun was not the sound of an epic battle. Particularly in combat scenes, strict editing is required. <br /> <br /> Also, the acting was a bit flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that the same guy writes in the movie and the stars in the movie, my experience is a red flag. But it was a good effort, so I gave him 4.
