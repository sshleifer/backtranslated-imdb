I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, I have no "respect" from me. I watched it just because the woman wanted to see me and found out exactly what I expected: a stupid story without real humor. It is full of lame, gross jokes and a totally absurd plot that revolves around the developer (Dangerfield), plans to build a Utah ski resort that has never captured my attention. In addition to Dangerfield the film played a weak cast including Andrew Dice Clay and totally across the hill John Byner (I did not even know he was still so close to seeing his name in credits for this.) This is really a disaster Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> 2/10
