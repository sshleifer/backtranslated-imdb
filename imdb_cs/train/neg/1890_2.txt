The problem I find with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to create a documentary or a movie. The merging of two genres simply does not work and leaves everything in the middle of nowhere. It is more like the director has chosen the most extreme of what is to be done around our everyday life, which is an unconvincing document. If it's meant to be a thriller / drama, it's too boring and monotonous. In both cases, what is the morality or message the director is trying to listen to to the audience? That around us are people who misbehave other people who are willing to be ill-treated? That there's a lot of fool around us? So .......... what then?
