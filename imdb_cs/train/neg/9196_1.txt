This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it seemed comical. First there is no conspiracy. The actors seem to read the cards and do the stupid things. Such as the persecution of the dead, but they still want to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, not so close to where it is as fun as any of Romer's works, who gets into the movie outlet. And the stupid part of all was that the video sequences were still showing action sequences. Just like we do not get a video game, it's a zombie shooting. Also, all 20 somethings some how we know how to use automatic weapons and hit the target without aiming a gun. And the way people die is so stupid. It was as if the ammunition had been exhausted, so they stood by and waited for it to jump. And when they are housed in front of the house, they get rid of ammo instead of shooting the open door, so stupid. FINAL VERDICT: If one of these actors appears in another movie, they are blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen for years. B-film on cinema is better.
