I had some expectation about the movie because it had a nice star cast, and it's the return of the pair Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because it was done by the same man who wrote the Dhoom franchise story because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 compares with Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt comfortable because it was nicely adjusted. Well, the first scene told me herself. The most important drawback of the film is then the action. Me and my friends laughed as we watched this miserable fight. It was like Akshay against 30 criminals, and everyone and the guns even had machine guns! Phew ... you have to see to understand how bad the action is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the movie is a predictable story. It reminded me of some of the first eighty films. Well, the only thing that the film stands for is the sexy Kareen, who is really hot on this face. And for that I give a rating of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Boys, please ... do ... you do not see that you think it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch it for some laughing in terrible combat scenes. That is all.
