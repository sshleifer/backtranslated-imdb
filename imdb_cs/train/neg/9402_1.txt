Why was this movie made? Even not forgetting the generous tax relief granted by Australian film investors, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film to be granted. For the good, the cast actors in this film are Aussie b-grade celebrities (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original drummer of Hey Hey's Saturday, and voice-over guy in Countdown. But when you say that, it's still very noticeable if you give him the brain he deserves: none, the script is bad (even for a confident b-type b), and the acting and film quality is worse, it often looks like it's a home movie, and the home movie has "realism." Anyone interested in the Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, pretend that this film was NEVER.
