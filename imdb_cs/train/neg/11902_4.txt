The hysterical thing about this film lies in the fact that, according to the director, she has trouble finding a distributor in the US, because most of them who saw him could not reconcile the seemingly conflicting message of Christianity and American anger. The idea of ​​seeing it as a religious film is ridiculous. Since the minister prays with the homeless or wants someone "Godspeed," is it a "Christian" film? It could be interpreted that it is in fact a mockery of religion in "land full" with all its material surpluses, the best organized mission can make them hand out a bowl of soup and bible verse. A lot of unfortunate or suppressed maybe? Lots of unnecessary homeless missions? What about a lot of psycho-Vietnamese vets? As a pill of an exhausting vicious surviving agent, "pink", do we think America is a "land full of" paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? We certainly do not have a lot of people involved in Palestine politics on the basis of phone interviews of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless, it would be unfortunate to be much more interested in peace in a distant country than their personal survival, for the world knows how Europe is "a continent of fullness" in terms of sophistication. /> <br /> In fact, I finally agreed with the title that the United States is a 'country full' and in this particular case it refers to a number of bad scenarios, amateur acting and discreetly directed films. Life is too short, and one, even an American, does not have "a lot of" time to watch this piece.
