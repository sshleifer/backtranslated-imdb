This movie was fun. Young Lea Thompson, young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it stretched, had impossible characters and had no target audience. Some children go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by their buddy friend (named Jinx). Space scenes are then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either screaming or scary depending on your view. Adults will be bored and thrown away, children may be afraid, because the way they were filmed really leaves a scary sense. There is an exciting romance, but unlike a shuttle - it never goes away. Why the first one is unclear, unless there is more tension between the characters - but if that was the idea, it failed. Young Leo Thompson should be weird and attractive, right? I think "back to the future" is great. No, she was irritating and average. Not someone you want to have as a friend or even a model. Joaquin Phoenix? He is really happy to have reappeared in his films in this show. Maybe she may act like Mikey in grain cereal ads, but she does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. He does not fit on the screen and I do not think we can identify him with our home. I would actually be happier if he never returned to Earth. I never recommend this movie to anyone.
