Simply put, it's the worst film from "Police Academy: Missions in Moscow" (if you liked the movie, you'll probably like it). What did they think? Some ideas should remain just the idea. The fact that this idea could film itself should be a crime. What was so bad that I heard you were asking. One word ... ALL. <br /> <br /> Rental Costs: $ 4.50 Tracking Costs: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund for both!
