The supernatural, revenge policeman returns to the third installment, this time acting as a guardian angel for an unjustifiably accused female cop. A standard stopper and a slash, but still a good acting and overhead, so it's strangely interesting and observable, though violence is not gaudy (especially the directorial cut that originally won the "NC-17"). > <br /> * 1/2 of ****
