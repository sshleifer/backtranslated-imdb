Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of four films, because there are not a lot of plotting, bad acting, pretty boring and some really bizarre jokes. But. And that's great, but there's one good actor, one good joke and a good start. A good actor, Tim Curry, is a good, repetitive joke, a haunted, strange butler with a disgusting hand that always makes cringey, but laughs with good things. And the good start is the spoof Excorsist. The plot of Scary Movie 2 is the main character of the original and many new characters on the way are invited to stay at night on the scary old mansion but survive at night? This movie is not very good, but if you are bored, you can also watch it well!
