He saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised at how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was amazing like Scrooge, but the rest of the cast failed so badly. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the stupid acting and repeated line: "Merry Christmas to all!" Otherwise, I almost fell asleep. The film is based on a story by Charles Dickens about a wealthy guy who thinks Christmas is nothing but a humbuge. After 30 minutes, the rich man is attended by three clergymen who eventually persuade him to celebrate Christmas. I can not understand how this movie, with the script so bad that it had to be written in five minutes, can be so well rated. Instead of this waste I recommend you, Bill Murray the Scrooged comedy. At least it was funny ...
