Unbelievably confused, bad and absolutely absurd ("horse, oh god, horse!") Thriller. It's sometimes scary, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. Watch how in the last 10 minutes each "magically" does exactly what land needs to "distinguish". Slightly unveiling leaders, typically eccentric from Richard Lynch. Video transfer is a real hacking job, it reduces the scenes in half and makes the film even harder to grasp. 0 of 4 stars.
