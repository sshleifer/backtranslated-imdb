Someone has to send that guy Uli Lommala back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever said he knew how to make a movie? Can we make movies ANYBODY these days? In the past, it always required TALENT before anyone could make a movie. After watching this lame BTK movie and the others he did, it seems obvious that the poor man has about as many commercial films as I am. Actually, I think I can make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has nothing to do with BTK Killer, except the names of the victims and the killer. AND IT IS DONE. Where did the guy come to the big belief that BTK killed people the rodents and all the other stupid things in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to get people into watching their movie based on the phrase "BTK" because of the glory he has achieved. Definitely poor. The only serial killer movie that I would consider to be THE DEATH is the charming film "DAHMER". The kid smoked so many cigarettes that it made me angry. Whoever did shoot it.
