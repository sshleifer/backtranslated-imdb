This is a terrible movie disaster. From the beginning to the end it is full of bad acting and worse direction and adjustment. The only redemption of part of the film is several Streisand numbers, because Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem with this film is that Kristofferson never sees the character of his top or character Streisand. The first one should be seen in bankruptcy and the other rising. Streisand's final number could have been one of the greatest movies if it was properly directed and edited. A single framed face shot throughout the song was a terrible mistake. If a group, audience, and wide-screen scenes were shown, it could be dynamic and interesting. This film had to be directed and edited by NYU Film School. The only worse thing can be a poor script. The ultimate musical number is the only redeemed part of this movie, and even it is completely disrupted by bad technical decisions.
