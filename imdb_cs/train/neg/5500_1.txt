This movie tries hard, but it is completely lacking in the entertainment of the 1960s that I remember with certainty. Although I'm 17 years old, I've watched some of the games on YouTube for a long time, and it's been fun and fun. This film is sad, but little justice. <br /> <br /> Special effects are rather unusual, and this did not help to flatter the camera. The script was also boring and lacked a sense of humor and a miracle. Other movies with sub-par scenarios include Home Alone 4, Cat in a Hat, Thomas and Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. Now I know that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and exhausted it too soon and I am sincerely sure that for this reason it is something for the family that it enjoys. And I was upset by my talking suit, despite Wayne Knight's loud voice work. But the thing that bothered me most about the film was that the unnecessary talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hanna, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels had dropped some good performances before, but he did not think he had a clue about what to do, and the figure of Elizabeth Hurley was unnecessarily gone. Daryl Hannah is a beautiful actress and generally ignored her and I liked her love interest, but unfortunately I can see her very little (not to mention that the Monster Attack is likely to scare the children than to enchant them) as well as Wallace Shawn as some government factor. Christopher Lloyd is freed and as actor I like Lloyd a lot (it was in two of my favorite films Clue and Framed Roger Rabbit and I like Back to the Future), but he was a little busy and tended to exaggerate quite wildly. <br /> <br /> Overall I wanted to like this movie, I was useless. Instead of being entertaining, it struck it as unnecessary, and it was a shame because it had plenty of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but unnecessarily poor performance. 1/10 Bethany Cox
