Oh, my God, I give this movie three stars for ten of the following reasons. the final sequence is completely processed and completely cheerful. that's what they get these three points for. Other than that, it was terrible. it was not meant to be so funny, it is obvious, but dubbing, playing dubbed voices, dialogue that said where is often cheerful. Performed and / or unfulfilled events also lead to great joy and / or throw things on the screen. like the whole city is killed and a small group of people standing on the balcony as if watching a glass of cooking or "trying to" escape the church they are looking at. <br /> <strong> Evil Mayor: I think something is happening outside, so you should go up and look out the window. <br /> <br /> hero: ok. <br /> <br /> Evil Mayor: Now is my chance to make some idiot go out and fire around with the fire is totally ineffective and get hacked up. insert the sequence in which this occurs. evil mayor: Damn, wait, I'll get this little baby and she'll walk out and cry Pappa seemingly polite that the corrupt corpses are not just scary aliens but they're actually zombies without body or skin or anything and she takes them away and I'll run! insert the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> The hero (above): he tries to escape again, the fool, and he leaves the door open, he's stupid, it's a nice view. > <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> The hero (on the ground floor now): I do not know, I do not see her anymore and it was not out there because I could not see her despite it, there and I overlooking the whole neighborhood and she stands directly from outside could she be on earth? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, someone will throw things on the screen after 10 minutes. so take a look at the first movie with a few friends, with a few drinks and make sure that when you look at it, you are absolutely blindly drunk and just mix up the stupidity of everyone. and there was no decent gore, such a pity.
