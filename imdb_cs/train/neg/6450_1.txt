But this movie is terribly terrible. I am sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. Sometimes they were delivered with mild sarcasm, which led me to believe that they did not take this film seriously, nor did anyone watch this unpleasant shutdown beat the monster slasher. While watching this "creature of an unknown" I could not help, but I thought the crew was not a budget or a competent writer. But if you look at yourself to laugh you'll be happy the movie is shameless to mock yourself because I can not see how anyone could look at it and be proud to draw it right on a DVD clich√© wanted to be an action thriller / horror movie fightfest to light.
