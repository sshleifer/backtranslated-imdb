I saw this movie in the evening and I must honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The game is fair, but the plot is totally absurd. The killer was born because of all the "energy used to make the film" and if the movie is burned, the killer kills? How incredible is it? The characters were relatively little developed ... For example, one suddenly mentions: "Do not you try to finish the movie because your mother can not?" So we should go with it? We had no idea it was her daughter until the middle of the movie. The movie did not really see anyone, we did not know anything about the main survivors, except that Ringwald's character was a whistling actress, that guy was on the set when people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like her mother. It's not really diving to know who they are. Things seemed hurt to get killed. The whole site is totally weak for my taste and I was very disappointed. Everyone who enjoys this piece of crap, of course, needs something to learn about the movie. I can not believe anyone would agree with a star or even work on this picture. It's not funny, it was not scary and it was a clich√©. I've found out that I'm predicting what's going on in front of every scene that believes it's not hard to do at all. It's shame and I'm deeply sorry I lost an hour and a half when I was watching the mess. 1/10.
