I rented this DVD for two reasons. Casting great actors and director, even if Robert Altman can be hit or lost. In this case, it was a big mistake. Altman's attempt to create tension came to his kester. After seeing Kenneth Branagha in a good movie like Dead Again, I did not think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope he does not lose his reputation. Robert Duvall looks like he has lost his way to the one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral, which includes playing in food films such as this movie. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent movies, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies," but "The Great Santini". This movie was really a great waste of time. I give it 2 out of 10.
