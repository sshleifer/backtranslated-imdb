I was about seven when this film diamond horror was launched. In the UK, in the summer of 1977, she appeared on television for several weeks as if it were an incredible movie. It was actually the first movie I've ever seen in the cinema, and I was postponed for the next few years. The next week I was invited to go see the new Star Wars movie and reject it. To date, I have never seen them, to protest against having to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I could say I was looking at garbage. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Rambling nonsense, which should NEVER be to the film. But I was amused when I read all these years later that the director had never acted like I did. Avoid all costs !!!
