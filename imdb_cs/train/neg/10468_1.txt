I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. It was a terrible movie. Scenario, direction, and acting were just as bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could have made a clever and thoughtful film, but not. I was shooting in the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the film focus? Where was something in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was badly done and wasted with my money. You do not see this movie.
