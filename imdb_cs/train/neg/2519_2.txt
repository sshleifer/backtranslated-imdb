In fact, I paid for this movie to appear in the theater. It would score 1, but the battle scenes between the robots are fine and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have more budgets than others. I do not have a problem with it. Unfortunately, sci-fi movies probably suffer the most in a small budget for obvious reasons. One way this movie fails is that almost every piece of each set looks sweet and inexpensive. I mean, could not they even "look" well? Another reason why this movie is terrible is acting When I was watching the movie now and knew what to expect, I can only look forward to it for the cheese factor, but at that time I was expecting a good movie and had no idea how horrible it would be it eventually ended. Fortunately, the experience ended in only 85 minutes.
