I subscribed to this page to find out what kind of notes people would make about this film's absolute disaster. I did not get in a second. The figures were all one-dimensional. They threw every topic that they thought hoped to hold onto something. He bet (and I hope) that everyone who is involved with teachers is looking back with embarrassment. There are some great actors, but you would never know. Thanks to God, he did not destroy the career of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsu or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no work of love, just a terrible effort became bad. BTW I do not think the writer has ever made a leg in a real school.
