I love horror films that bring true numbers of secrets, such as the "quiet hill" (which I found to be pretty good but still missing something) and the movies that guess you, I thought this was one of those films. Initially, the film starts with some really good tension and creates a good starting point for a good horror scene, but it turns only uphill and then goes faster and faster. I mentioned a quiet hill first for some reason, because I see lots of "stolen" themes from that movie. Overall, I would say to watch a quiet hill instead of this one, to its better, to its more spooky it has much more tension and also the end is much better .. And best of all, you will not feel ruined like I did with this .. It seems to be one of those "I like the movie so I'm going to do it in my own really bad version" a little movie .. Oh and one more thing ... Lordi .. in a horror movie ... it's like trying to scare a baby with a nursing bear who will "hug me and love you forever" written on the stomach ..
