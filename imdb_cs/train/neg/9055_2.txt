As a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the variety of his skills, I noticed that this film is being shown, and I was surprised to hear of it. I traveled more than usual during both periods that were filmed in 2000, and when it hit theaters more than 2-1 / 2 years later (that the passage of time is the first stop everything was not good with the production). Now Patrick Swayze can not act as sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to adapt to the differences between them. And Charlize Theron is someone with whom it would be a pleasure to see, even if it showed that she was watching the dry color. <br /> <br /> I was curious, I checked the information about making this site. Earlier this weekend, an unbelievable $ 600 for the screen appeared, and after his monthly theater in 2002, just over $ 400. In total, it was $ 261,000, which would have doubts that it could cover the hotel and catering meals and crew a week. <br /> <br /> The story is quite benign and even the use of the usual Reno local environment is as boring as the others. <br /> <br /> It's like a few SNL bits all together, nobody is too big and the overall presentation even worse. Independently, the cost of this production had to be considerable - even though everyone worked less than their usual fees - so the only thing that made it a barely acceptable opus was the quality of shooting and Billy Bob's presence (although of course somewhat laconic here in comparison with his usual work.) Think of the three outstanding, completely different characters he portrayed in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa," and you know he realized what was far before the audience had the opportunity to confirm . One star for him, even here, and one because production was better than, for example, a typical "Lifetime" movie.
