This sword-and-sorcerer story of the brutally brutal and cruel "hero" who murders the evil king is almost in every detail. The effects are terrible from leading to supporting roles. The breathtaking, cheerful joy with which the director shows the hero blurred around the blood is absolutely disgusting; nor is he redeemed with justice for his cause, for he is just as bad as the people he fights with. Z-movie editing is rich, including the scene where the character "dies" from the sword stroke, which clearly apparently completely escaped! The film is clear to women's guitar charms, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who are well-trained throughout the film. Like a twenty-year-old man, he can not pretend that a woman's body can not be carried on the screen. But the treatment of their characters is so humiliating and the sexual scenes are so informal and without the joy that I could not even enjoy this aspect of the film. Most of the cheese films of this time are at least somewhat redeemed (better in this regard), but it seems that DEATHSTALKER is to be taken seriously as a heroic fantasy. In any case! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 of ****.
