This movie was first confused. I usually like Gina Phillips, but I have to say this is a bad choice just like she does the movie Ring Around the Rosie, that one also has one of her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was much better. Faye Dunaway was good. She wanted to rob me completely, and it was crazy in the end. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) who comes to his twin burial sisters. She remains in the house that her sister owns and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with her aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) sacrifices her relationships to stay alive and can not die if she wants to live. Even when Jennifer tries to kill her, what she's trying to do. Ravens have a strange role in it. When relationships go to sleep, the rabbits eat the organs so they can not go to sleep. But they do it. Basically, everything is crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried but not dead, b / c must suffer forever so that Mary Ellen can remain alive. Yeah, I hope it will help. If not, I'm sorry. I love you.
