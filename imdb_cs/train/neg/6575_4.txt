An interesting film about the real events that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. She paid my attention to the end and did not regret looking at it. I have never read about this incident of raid, so I was curious if the rebels pulled him away. I love historical movies from this era. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is a conflict uniform. They look too good !!! The actor was sometimes a bit tough. I like an old man eating potato mash because he has no teeth. The wounded soldier playing with the hook was a little weird. Overall, it was a falling film.
