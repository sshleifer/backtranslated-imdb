Because "cruel" would be the only word that would describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you even start? In the stupidity of crazy I start with the terrible behavior of almost everyone in this movie. Scratch it. They almost do not belong in that sentence. I can not even think of a single figure that was well-drawn. Though it would be quite fair, it would be almost impossible to display these zero dimensional characters in a successful way. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name it deliberately does not include - pretending it does not exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, just the eclipse of the one played by Sebastian. The story was terrible God. She tried to reflect the shine that was first, but in many ways failed. Quite a few of its parts were useless - though I would admit (reluctantly) that the conspiracy plot was quite good that it was a surprise. And the end was at least slightly humorous. But this movie is the worst thing I've ever seen. Do not look at it. Just not. There is absolutely no value in watching. None. It only removes pleasure from the first one.
