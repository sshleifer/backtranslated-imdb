On the Fiji Islands, the greedy and ruthless owner of the Valalola Primal Park resort invites investors and guests to start a party of their ingredients made up of the hotel and the zoo to find partners for their discoveries. When a lot of thieves of small magazines put a virus into the security system to participate in hunting, the biggest zoo attraction? sabretoothes from prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossil compounds? escape, kill guests and guards for pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredibly lame and cheap "Sabretooth Attack" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Characters are terrible and not fun or enjoyable, and the story is a horrible Jurassic park that has a bad clich√© collection. Basically, all the lines and situations are bad and stupid, but the winner is when the guards explain that Sebla's dresses are bulimic and want to kill for pleasure. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "About Ataque to Dente de Saber" ("The Sabretooth Attack")
