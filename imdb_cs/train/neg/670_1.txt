Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is chased by a psychoactive killer who tries to kill her at the night of her ball. And so they kill their family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before I start, let me tell you that you've been tired of PG-13 horror movies that have not been scary lately. You are tired of the silly girl dialogue "Oh my God" and you are talking about girl things. And you're really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing is that you're tired of American, Japanese, and Chinese movies. It pretty much summarizes Prom Night, but I still do not. <br /> <br /> The only reason you see Prom Night is breaking a laugh. If not, you do not see Prom Night. You never see it kills and just hear the scream and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way, death is repeated as 24/7. So not only are they not scary, but it's unpleasant. While I met the occupation, I think I'm ready to hurl. Too many girls talk, too many guys talk and much "Oh my God, it's our prom". I understand it's fun, but it's too much to concentrate on. <br /> <br /> If I gave Prom Night a list of the worst movies in 2008 without seeing other movies, I would be the first. I will not be surprised if the DVD is cheap and fast. Do not really use your money or time for subdued acting, cheap fears, and "night's death" when watching a movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS If I could give the movie zero stars I would).
