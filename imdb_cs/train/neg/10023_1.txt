Damage to Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra, which seems to have lost her intelligence over the years and provided a permanent fare in this kinematic crap that does not at all justify the You Tube standards. I've done my teeth all the time I started in a schizophrenic direction, drawing a line that never worked, and I was ashamed at the last scene that my country and its filmmakers could be "threatened" by such stupidity. It is a pity on the actor for taking this work and even reminding him that it is some piece of work he can rely on. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed with your choice of film. Kareen shows plenty of skin for puberty and Akshay appears stupid. Anil another retard with a pride fascination for English. His buddies were praised in their acting, and with bizarre cinematography scattered over the last 15 minutes, enough blood to appear. DO NOT embrace any brain cells, energy or your money to see it - Go to the neighborhood / rent AMU - instead Konkany Sensharma - a beautiful piece of independent film that ever comes out of India. An intelligent, dizzying and wonderful story that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and give me hope that in the Indian film is not all lost.
