This is a totally unpleasant film if it was a glass film. I tried it because the stars of Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblume, two good actors, and because the conspiracy line - the boss of the crowd is about to be released from a psychiatric institution - sounds promising. The film is billed as comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should forgive the punishment - people in a dimly lit and elegant, somewhat unrealistic interior that shoots - in the head, belly, knee, leg, heart (no part of the anatomy is excluded as it seems ), when he tells an unclear and mysterious dialogue, which is probably supposed to be humorous in a postmodern way. The Goldblum dialogue for the entire movie could fit on a 3x5 card and wearing only one facial expression - a sardonic smile. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Burt Reynolds will sign up. Credits are called Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but somehow I missed it (a good step on their part). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and awkward; heir, in my opinion, in the style of "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers". If you like it, you probably will.
