I was really looking forward to this show, given the quality of the actors and the fact that Brothers Scott were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes were interrupted! Again, we are led to believe that the KGB are a group of inappropriate fools who have no idea what they are doing. At one point, there is a ridiculous scene where 4 KGB agents could not handle one CIA agent. I become tired of these biased, one-sided and utterly inaccurate impressions of Spy playing during the Cold War. It seems ridiculous to me that the US is not able to objectively record films about their involvement in World War II and beyond. Just as the U-571, where we are led to believe that the US has acquired the Enigma machine, is totally untrue. "Society" is very well filmed and acting. Locations are also exceptionally well-developed. Alfred Molina has great performance as well as Keaton (The difference between them is very well done). I really wanted to enjoy this show and no doubt I would end up watching the other 2 episodes, but I really want US productions to stop trying to portray their Spies, soldiers and others as supermans who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to everyone else on the planet. It ages quickly and seriously reduces the likelihood of what could be 10/10. <br /> <br />
