absolutely waste. I enjoyed Halloween and since then she is a johnny in a downward spiral. it's a pit. we get it john. pro-lifers are scary! you do not have to make a scary movie that scares me out of it to tell me. <br /> <br /> It moves here. He feels like John does not have much to do with it. for his merit, it seems he does not need it. There are plenty of times when the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look stupid or say something silly. I love a long cut. too bad carpenter does not know how to use it. he needs Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop crazy and bored with death!
