What is it? Low Budget Sex Comedy? Anyway, she perfectly describes people in Spain. They could come up with a better idea, I think they have been making such movies since the 1960s and people like it! This is not a teen comedy, nor a family (you can not leave your 12 year old watch 2 boys in bed kissing, never going to want to go to Spain). It should be rated "R", because it seems that only people at the age of 35 watch: I am really disappointed, maybe I do not like homosexuals (which is quite an important part of the film). /> Foreign humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturice), stick to the drama! If you want a new comedy to try Talladega Nights
