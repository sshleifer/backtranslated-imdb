This movie has a great feeling on Broadway - background, acting, "noise" - and yet it's all. Some "sense" on Broadway without a bang. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, the picture is separate, singing 'jumps' on you, to suddenly remind you that it's musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointment: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Inappropriate: Sinatra is a fiance --- surely the pitch and the accent of her voice was useless. <br /> <br /> Tolerable: Sir, "I remember the numbers on my cubes" Delight: Brando is a pliable singing (very impressed!) Surprise: How many Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in scenes Havana. It's a bone structure! How would I kill seeing Miss Leigh in the role that hit Brand again.
