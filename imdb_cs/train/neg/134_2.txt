This movie was gone very clever. It's a theme with every horror movie ever made. Valentine's ZERO is trying to be original. What is Valentine? It's a lot of people who give each other the same foolish message that was passed on to the same people a year ago. There's nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I saw it only once and I was looking at some of the films she broke. 1.From Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which someone kills. I know there is more, but my mind is slowly turning into a silk meadow, so they could not catch them as fast as they came. Valentine did not have a chance to be a good movie. How should every horror film have a "surprised" killer, people you do not care about, because their emotions are turning every other scene. One minute with a pretty girl turns into a bad B-ch, then she's an insecure woman and so on and her son. Normally, some horror film (in my book) can save gore, Valentine does not have it again. It was as if they were trying to make PG-13 but they failed, so they left the adjustment. <br /> <br /> You do not see this too inspired, rip-off if you hate and want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
