With all the excessive violence in this movie, it could be NC-17. But the gore could have been pg-13, and there was a lot of oath when my mom had an old crazy friend. There was a great character development that made the film look better, and after the boy returned to life as a scarecrow, it was a helpless hour and ten minutes of killing people. The violence was too great, and I think the number of people was over twelve, which is a large number of films. Almost every character in the movie is stabbed or chopped by the head but a teacher who called him "white baskets" and "hoodlum" (although the character lester is something other than hoodlum, not even close, known hood and part hood, do not want in class , sitting there and throwing on the teacher). The teacher deserved more terrible death than any of the characters but was just stabbed in his back. There were two exciting scenes in the movie, but it did not take long to be frightening. As I said, the murders were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their head cut off. If the gore was really fun, then it would be nc-17. Two children describe the body they find in the corn fields, they describe it as much worse than it really was, they explained to the police that worms are spreading in their hair. His stomach was not open, so there was no worm in my stomach, though I would like to see it. The effects were pathetic, the characters were lost, and the scarecrow could do lots of gym stunts. I suggest you rent this movie for death scenes, but I do not know it anymore, but I enjoyed excessive violence. Also do not bother with the sequel, I was looking for five minutes and was bored to death, it sounds good, but it is not. The original scarecrow actually interested me.
