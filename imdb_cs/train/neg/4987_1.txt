This movie is so bad and worsens in every imaginable form. It's not just a bad acting and a script, it's not a fragile and perverted time when he's watching it. What really makes this movie in shame of shame is the obvious struggle that writers and producers do with movies to try to make it funny. The actress, who replaced the offspring of Jean Rena, is old and learns the lesson in the first film to add a new girl to be married. Almost all original add-ons and gags are coming back, but this time it has made me rip out of my drawers because it's a waste of a perfectly good film. Torture of constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer in violent convolutions. This second film captures a successful original and pulls it out of the coffin and shows the corpse on a public square and perverts it to destroy not only the original idea and its heritage but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the spruce goose, could not fly, because in the principle that returns for the "necklace", he had no plot. No script because it was probably written and added to the daily press. Do not forget about the camera or pictures. Poor lighting and special effects made about it. This film would never have gone through a student film in the basic film 101. How did this crowd get nobody can say. It was a great loss of investment, and it seems that no one has the power to make this unnatural cruel mistake out of this suffering. This movie has one good part ... its ending! This movie is my # 1 worst film of all time, eventually "Howard The Duck" is no longer a Goose.
