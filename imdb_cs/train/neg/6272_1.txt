Meanwhile, at the local bar, people are drinking and dancing on 80th rock songs. Biker punk sex with a cycling bitch on a pinballs table before people and then trying to rape a virgin daughter Jessica (Debra Hunter) who is in love with another biker (Dale Midkiff of PET SEMATARY), who is back in cohorts with an assistant! Go back to the house and have fun, swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into the mouths of the victims and turns them into a relentless, killer zombie! If it is not enough for fun, there is a funny theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"), roller skates, some serious daisies and a psychic puppet (!?) That warns "DANGER! DANGER!" Like the LOST IN SPACE robot and recommends tracking One of the best ways to pick up men! <br /> <br /> This movie in Florida is so horrible, everything in. And hey, that NYPD detective Blue Jill Kirkendall became CNN reporter Andrea Thompson as one of the most common bimbos? Sure it is! It allegedly began in 1982 and new recordings were later added to the video release in 1985. Score: 1 out of 10 (and I think so well)
