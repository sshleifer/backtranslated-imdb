Such a demanding and poor attempt at sinfulness. Diabolical scenario and dialogue and really embarrassing behavior. A really worse movie I've ever seen (in the cinema). Nothing in my opinion will save this film from a complete disaster. I saw it when he went to the Brighton cinema. People went out and there were more people who chatted outside the toilets than in the auditorium! Finally there were boos and contempt from the humble crowd to the left, which was quite sad because there were relatives of one of the main actors and they looked really nice. The film was so bad that I did not feel compassionate with them. Everyone has to start somewhere and their son started his acting career with this really terrible attempt at 'taranthism in the UK'. 5 years of goodbye, but sometimes I still guessed to remember the sad night in the movies! This is a movie without redemption! I gave her 1 because 0 was not available. They should invent a "hanometer" for anyone who gets involved in this apologetic mess of the film. I know some of them have moved to better things, the positive thing is that none of them could sink anything less than this.
