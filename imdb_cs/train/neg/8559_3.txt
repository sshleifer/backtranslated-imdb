"It's hard to describe how exciting it is that it's a relationship like dramas like all the similar pornographic scenes that seem like a good measure, and they rise up as controversial - like money and stuff." - Ellen, Lost citation. "Kissing, like, as much as, mouth and stuff" is like the best artistic effort ever. Watch as Ellen's hairy arm and as Chris masturbate it was like my tall years-long film-watching experience and so. But before I'd like to start breaking new US-20-something-airhead recordings with my guides, let me just briefly become familiar with the high-as-light of this visual as a holiday: <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. Chris is doing his deeds with his genitals. And not just that: the way the camera (elegantly led by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with the full screen of Chris's fat white stomach waste after the end of the non-Catholic act - it was really exciting. I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, these scenes you should do in your next films, because that's exactly what we needed to continue what the great, great person, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95," started off. Fast and then hirsute, thick, white belly: what more can a filmmaker ask? Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris Ejaculate (even though I'm straight) ... Such poetry in motion. Such elegance, such a style. Overall, the divine inspiration came to the filming of this sequence - plus a considerable amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not get more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's furry and thick arms. Quiet cameras, which our two film directors so skillfully photographed (I can not emphasize enough), Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion about the correct identification of the gender in question. There were several scenes where we saw part of the body (leg, arm or leg), yet it was often a quarrel: does this part of the body belong to man or woman? Of course, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and their names, have resolved because their bodies were ideal for creating this confused gender. It was sometimes difficult to guess if he could see a woman's or a male leg. Patrick is so skinny and effeminate in her movements that she is hairless and untouched, while Ellen and the other girl are so deep that they have dense legs and hands. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way it neatly connects with the topic of rotation between the sexes: it is totally original and exciting. Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time while her former Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen looks for the left. "He has to love" The Simpsons, "which is quite leftist." I am glad that the creators of this film have decided to break the long tradition that the intelligent Leftists offer us. Ellen is so refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of "likes" she and her liberal friends could tell in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3,849, being accurate). They managed to realistically transfer their reality to a big screen with minimal effort and I appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 5. Close up your fingers. A lot of things for the fetishists, which I consider to be a very liberal and very praiseworthy way of addressing sexual minorities. After all, shoes and footfetishists are so small in a modern cinema, so it's nice to see someone there is CARES. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers more than just an eye. It's not just a modest little film about shallow people who deal with hollow relationships while enjoying meaningless conversations. No, it's much more than that. It is the light that leads all stupid creatures; the leading light that controls the unnecessary lives of the various pseudo-art wannabes who have just dropped out of the film school and plan to attack our senses with a small smile that perhaps plays at demanding festivals such as Sundance and Cannes to enable them to get the necessary exposure; some real cash for change, with which they will later be hired, like Sean Penn and George Clooney, to support the rescue of this planet and to solve all the political problems facing this world. What better way to do this than to do porn at the very beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen were making the camera here, as clearly stated in the final credits, then who held the camera while two of them were in front of him? They probably hired some passers-by and put them in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and look at my "TV & Cinema: 150 Worst Cases of Nepotism".
