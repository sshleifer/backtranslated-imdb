So I wanted to believe this film, in the form of the main comedy that this country recognizes, is a ghost and stereotype. Of course, it was quite different - let's be cool and nervous - and we went out the other side, who has little to prove it. I bet one small seed is for this. I know SL. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have comic chops to pull it off. Even Danny K had a better time. I'm really serious. Each time I introduced a bit of character, I still thought, "Darn, this person should be the leader!". Independent does not mean working with the camera must be terrible. The black and white were doing nothing for this movie - in fact, with such a flat conversation it hurt even more by giving boredom sharp reliefs. Both black and white were not sharp. The song was terrible. The use of music was terrible. Unfortunately, I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this film, and the composition was great - maybe that's why the lack of this movie was lost in my mind. I think Corne (who was more fun than he was doing before he said anything) spoke with this film and not with David - to see and understand. I bet the boys organizing Oppikoppi were horrified. One would think nothing would happen. I had the feeling that it could be shot in the garden of someone. I know regular people who have more fun, refined, and more sad interviews than any of these "comics". The buddy who joined the end was fine. <br /> <br /> Guess the SA comedy will stay a little longer in the stone age. Nice guys.
