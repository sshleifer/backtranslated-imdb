I remember the show. I still remember that I was kicking the funny song "The Smartest American People". Honestly, it should be titled by American chums or unhappy or utterly disgusting people. Dave could not save the show, nor did Bob Saget or replacement hosts for the AFV come later. The Jackalope segments were jolly and yes, Dave could have done good voices that were better than Bobs. But this show went to hell for lame mischievous videos that people passed. It also evolved as a rather diverse show with lame guest stars, including Olson's twins. Plus AFV was in his primary before he began choosing tearful nasty as sinful children as the winner. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still it's a rock song!
