This movie is not very good. It's boring and there's not much blood for a horror movie. A conspiracy of just a troll together with the power is happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had a lot of chances to kill vampire hunters because it shows that she has light as a reflection. But whenever one of them is attached, he only takes time and something happens when he is not stingy. No wonder it went directly to the cable. FINAL VERDICT: It's nowhere near as close as the first Vampire movie. You are a SUCKER if you waste time on it.
