I suppose that any novel, as well as a sister like Moby Dick, does not see many supporters with a depressed audience who have enough of their own troubles. But any similarity with the classic novel by Herman Melville is purely random. <br /> <br /> In fact, half the film is the forerunner of the main story, as we know it, and it was not too much for the film. First we meet Ahab Creely (surname and brother) as a happy soul with two legs and intend to marry Joan Bennett, daughter of Mappler's father. The brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is Ahab's top performer. Barrymore did not master sound cinematography, and he went with all the silent era histrionics plus a voice on a scene that would shake the rafters of any cinema in which this film was playing. We see that Ahab lost his leg to the big whale Moby Dick and I must say that the amputation scene is pretty awful. Of course it was before the Codex. I'm still sure the audience shuddered in 1930. <br /> <br /> Then the story of Ahab's pursuit of a whale he thinks does not blame him in the eyes of Joan Bennett. That's not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact, there's no female figure in Moby Dick as he wrote it. One of Melville's things was the investment of the crew of Ahab's Pequod with personalities. Other than Queequeg cannibal harpooner names there are, but not personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs could also be Smith and Jones. I saw this version of Moby Dick exclusively for curiosity and nothing else.
