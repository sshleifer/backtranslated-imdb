About 15 minutes, my wife wanted to leave. Not because of the material, but for the lack. They decided to fill in empty spaces where it would be a funny thing with the greatest language and utterly vulgar calls. If it were very rare, we sat and watched (not laugh, we think) and waited for more gross or insulting remarks. After about 35 minutes we got up and left. Everything we read was saying how great it was. The pendant looked good and Roger Ebert actually called "intelligent" and said it was not a gross sexual comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, this is the only other movie I've ever left ... and I have no regrets. I'm sorry to try to see comedy in America.
