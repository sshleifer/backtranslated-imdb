I was not sure whether to laugh or cry. Porretta looked good, but it resembled a Mexican porn star that is not an English singer. costumes? what costumes? T-shirt with stripes of black leather on it. it was Marion's clothing - or the lack of those - that really got me. making "fans" of this glowing man really believe that women in medieval England so dressed. The Mongols and Vikings were imprecise and stupid, but the episode with Alien was the worst of all. Especially because his makeup consisted mainly of oatmeal on his face - an old trick. The equestrian monster was quite entertaining as he emerged alongside the castle on the ladder - as if. American accents have reached out, as well as the initial declining voice over "RAW-bin Hood and LIDDLE John". The other robin and Marion really looked pretty, and what was left of the show was down there ...
