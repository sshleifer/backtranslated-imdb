I had to give this movie 1 because it's so bad, but do not let it think I was not watching it carefully because I laughed and laughed and even had a few questions. So half the time I laughed, half the time I said, "what the hell is going on?" or "why would anyone do that?" and so on. Mostly I was looking forward to the terrible effects of the fog, the 80th scene of naked scene / battle / dialogue / naked scenes, and the way the warriors' swords tremble in the wind when riding horses. And there are some miserable model effects (these are not to be considered real trees, are they?) And I still do not understand the guy who finds in the cave, what the hell is that? My friend told me about these films and I thought I'd try and I really liked the film like people like Ed Wood, I'm not really enjoying what the film should be, and I'll look at it in my own merry way. So do not let it distract you if you really thought it was an action movie, that is, I just like it for other reasons. It's much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can really make you think you're wasting your life by watching it (which I've seen several times in my mind). I think the best thing for most people is to have a couple of drinks, have some friends and laugh at this movie. Maybe it's a bit harsh, but I do not think you can rent it and see it. Yeah.
