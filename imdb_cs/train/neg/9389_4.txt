According to IMDb, as well as on all other websites that contain a review; this "thing" does not have a director. That would certainly explain a lot! Only a few people who gathered to shoot some perverse porn sequences and throw an ultra-thin story about the worship of devilish and female victims in the ultra-fast sanitarium. "Hardgore" is a great example of utterly demented sadness in the 1970s, because it is actually made with minimal production values ​​and inspiration for scripting. Horror films about Satanic cults were immensely popular in the early 1970s and pornography, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplifying story about a young nymphomaniac girl who has committed to mental asylum and has been brought into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action from the first night. Indeed, lots of dildo-action. A friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but her throat is cut even the same night. Horror aspects are actually poorly processed, from sadly painless satanic masks to congenital fractures of the penis. Photography and acting are almost unbearably amateur, but what do you expect from a movie that includes shots from sperm burning dildos and talk about amputated male reproductive organs? Head Lady Justin Lynn is rather a pretty girl with a fascinating body, but most of her stars (both male and female) are hateful and exaggerated hair.
