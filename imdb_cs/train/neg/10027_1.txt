The action in this film surpassed Sunny bhai in Gadara. Akshay Kumar has Leonidas supermotors at 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It's funny. With the exception of the typical comedies of Akshay Kumar and Anila Kapoor, I do not see anything positive about this film. The story looks like the writer's 10-year-old son wrote. The film is so unreal, that long-range shotgun director Anil Kapoors is the slightest mistake. In addition to Tashan directors, this film was no other Tashan. I'm sorry I have money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can put on IMDb or I would give it zero.
