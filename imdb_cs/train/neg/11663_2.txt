WHITE CHICKS Hold on why they can not dress like black smokers, oh yes, they did not even think. Can someone give me a Wayans movie where they are not dressed as ladies? Do not be afraid to count, Jack White and Michael Costanza wrote that the other members of Norton Trio were acting as directors. <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there are never any jokes. Only Wayans behaves like two girls. There are no assemblies, no traces and no laughter. There are plenty of "I think I will play some time crisis 3" At least for me it was (5 times it is accurate). Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies. Its only damages the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * of ****
