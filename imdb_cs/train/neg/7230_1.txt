I like science fiction, I'm fascinated by Egyptian mythology and appreciate digital animation. I thought a movie that combines these three would be at least pleasant. I could not be worse: The story (or actually lack) was totally uninspiring and lacking imagination - while imagination is usually the biggest part of a science fiction story. Dialogue and acting are even worse than average porn. In particular, Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term "poor performance". Bad talk would not be such a huge problem if Bilal only "the director" did not get so seriously; all lines sound like they should be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he has made artwork here. Well, in this junk mail there is no art or poetry, just eloquence! This guy should really keep up with comic books because he failed on all possible accounts as a director. The worst of all is horrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake that they even make werewings in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And because half of the characters are CGI-animated, there's quite a problem that CGI effects look so fake. If there are indeed Egyptian gods, then Bilal is dead, for they will no doubt be horrified of the absurd way he portrays him in this disastrously bad film.
