This movie was stunning. That's out of unintentional. I often meet a group of friends and go to the department store to find horrible movies and watch their comedic value. My friend suggested it to me, but as we watched, people began to leave. I really wanted to finish it just to say I had it, but I was not able. It is bad. Terrible running gags, chrome acting. The main characters are annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather look at Costener The Postman twelve times in a row before seeing a fraction of that movie again. I think they are trying to deal with some problems with the dinosaur discrimination, but it is part of the movie that really stands out is that the dinosaur constantly knocks on the tail and then acts on it. It hurts. Watch out if you're an ambitious masochist, otherwise leave this one.
