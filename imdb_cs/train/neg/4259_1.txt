I did not know about this movie until I was convinced that I saw a friend who heard that it was a "non-stop epic battle scene from start to finish". It could not be further from the truth. It was one of the most boring, badly written, amateur-driven, spooky films I've ever had a misfortune to look at me. I would rate it with a movie that I consider the worst film of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is essentially no story, it is hard to believe that the creators of this film thought that this cheese soap opera would be taken seriously as a real historical fact. It also contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little jewel ... Guy tells the girl "You feel like a moon." The girl replies: "What's scaring the moon?" FOR GOD! You are kidding me! The scene in which the guy was drawn and crazed was laughing at the audience, because it looked so ridiculously cheap, and the FX sound of that fellow who broke reminded me that someone was making a sound with his mouth. If you are playing in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I actually decided about 45 minutes when I needed to fall to my sleep ... and I did it. Sad.
