It is a film that attempts to translate Thai history, located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was in line with the many Thai films I watched and enjoyed, one that has Thai actors talking about the crazy Thai and martial arts. Well, that's none of that. This movie is filmed exclusively in English, full of Anglo actors and has a production value so terrible that it is ridiculously bad .... but not fun! Who can blame this waste? The effect, dialogue and most of the sets were pretty bad. Some battle scenes seemed to be choreographed by a local high school drama club. Special effects were also mostly bad, but some of them were just a cheap screen animation that provided a particularly cheesy effect. It has one great epic battle in rural style, where several thousand add-ons come across the field in costume, but when we see that both armies fight in battle - HA! That's a joke! The film has several beauties. What a pity they did not show a little more skin. At least it would be something that the boys would appreciate. Do not bother.
