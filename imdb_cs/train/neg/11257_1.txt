This movie feels EMPTY. In every scene in the movie, the maximum number of actors on the screen is about 10. Because everything was shot in front of the blue screen, there are never really any extras and the movie feels weird. <br /> <br /> ACTING was nasty! It's so obvious that it was in front of a blue screen, because you can see an actress / actress on all the action scenes that is interested in half running when it should run all my life. Look at the floor, /> > Spoilers: You also find yourself staring at the movie. At one place in the Sky Captain's home base, there are seventy aircraft on the aircraft. They keep warning that an attack is coming ... So what do they do? nothing. All the aircraft are thrown away, and again the only person who fights back is Captain Sky ... The whole world is under attack and he is the only person who has ever fought. At the very end of the movie, you can see hundreds of plains ... but what do they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
