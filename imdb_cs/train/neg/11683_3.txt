Three story lines and their connections are not enough, "Inside Man" was a very long and incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though he had his moments, the film began to look like a quick thriller that quickly swung to a slow crawl, quickly jumped between high and low, and barely lifted the pair for the last 20 minutes. I give Denzel Washington a respect, very well played his part with a full understanding of his human side and not just a typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen has also done his duality very well as a "bad genius" and a "criminal clergyman" (both are not the same in retrospect). Overall, however, each person individually created a great subsection. Yet, when the parts finally gathered and everything was counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or a summary of everything. Everything ended with the very little energy she started with, with many conspiracies, a lot of questions, and as I said earlier, without a place where the normal level of Spike Lee was. I have to completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not the movie they play.
