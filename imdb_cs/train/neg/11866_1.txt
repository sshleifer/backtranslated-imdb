First of all, this film, according to slick, said he received the "best film" at the Worldfest film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm had to be a quiet year. He did not say this worst movie at all, but it's definitely upset, it's just as bad as another Aussie B grader "Body Melt", but at least it did not look like it was shot on HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers watched a lot of Troma movies and really bad class B movies, and they thought they could burst into a deal with this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not do me wrong, I really love low-threshold movies, just the fact that some of the characters have falsified American accents, almost as if they have a greater chance of selling them in states or something. In fact, disappointment also ended, the show could have been exciting and some good fighting scenes. You can fully realize that movie makers are trying to copy the "bad taste" with the total explosion of a car, a rocket launcher and an infinite number of people who are shot, but the finale lacks some supernatural humor or style like "bad taste". <br /> <br /> If you like watching really bad gore films, or you're interested in making movies without budget, watch it, otherwise keep going.
