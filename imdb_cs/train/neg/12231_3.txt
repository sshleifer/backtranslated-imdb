I saw this movie, and occasionally I was absolutely curious when I believed that this movie "saw me". Munchie promises a "farce" for the coming years. Watch the Star Wars, do not look for Munchie. As a responsible parent (I am talking to those who are now parents), I (you) will not let my (your) child ever attend this pseudo-occult video festival. The fact that Munchie is a Satanic, co-viewer, probably misses a chilled "duh". He is wild, alien, native and utterly malevolent - like Bogey's man who was immature to grown-ups, attracts children with a lifestyle they can never afford (without it being possible for years of self-sacrifice and prudent stewardship). He is a trader of easy answers and false ideals. He is all that a morally conscious spectator is not. He is his own devil Ron Popeil. I pray (I mean it literally and figuratively, with the emphasis on the fact that this movie did not fit the DVD format). I hope this type of "yellow film production" died in the cold night of 1994 without sorrow. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention it. Comes a lot.
