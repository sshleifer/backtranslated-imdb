What Bleep we know is a deceived and random look at the mystery of the universe. We are presented with a show of obvious experts (none of whom are nominated) who are dragging and pontificating in a non-scientific way. Their conversations are scattered into negligibly small segments and scattered in some crazy cgi and banal miniatures. The film filters topics from the fields of science, philosophy, theology and politics, is together, regardless of accuracy, and then some of the prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence and any other difficult question that filmmakers want to show their finger. <br /> <br /> These are mistakes and logical errors of non-sequiturs. How did we start with quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying that two plus two are equal to four, so I can move objects with my mind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original in this movie and almost nothing is accurate. Any discriminating viewer will be disturbed by heavy edits, intrusive and unnecessary special effects, and a general lack of content. Educated viewers will be frustrated with the tears of violence given to science and every other subject that this film touches.
