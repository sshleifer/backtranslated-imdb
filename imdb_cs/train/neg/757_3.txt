My children are watching the show every day. It's a great program for younger children. However, they need to stop displaying re-runs and making some more real shows and getting rid of Rooney and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle bop with pure white pearl teeth, and the kids will notice these things and ask if they ever try to teeth? Does it ever point its way to the United States and if so, where do we find a plan for? And one more thing if we could add. Moe, you have to stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you emerge from where you scare younger kids and what about pulling the rope? What does it mean? other than wet all the time. They need to add newer items to their show instead of the same oil. Children are so interested.
