I was thrilled to hear that someone had written a document about what it was like to be Puerto Rican. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I thought she might know what it was like to be Puerto Rican. If I knew it ... it was Nuyorikanka. Still, she was anxiously sitting with my popcorn to watch. I realized 10 minutes that my initial worries were right. Rosie Perez has little to say about Puerto Rican. This "document" is rather the first hand, a very personal personal account of how it is a Nuyorikan ... and everything that means. She (like most of the Nuyoricans I know) have a puzzled, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How could they not ... stay here.) Yes, they are all proud. How to be! But he did not know the knowledge of REAL culture, history and political background or language for most. Everything has become very obvious when participating in the Vieques. Regardless of the fact that I personally deal with this issue ... at least I know why it's damn good for me. There she is arrested for something she did not know very little about ... and she only participated because it was "Puerto Rican cause". I really do not know how to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, please look at it as a partial description of women's way of self-discovery and acceptance. Do not take it as a gospel ... it is not true. Consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This film is not and should never be a basis for other Nuyoricans for their information. Instead, it is just a step towards finding more information, learning and discussing what reality is. Not just what comes from the eyes of this woman.
