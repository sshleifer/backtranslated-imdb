First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> First I confess my mistake: I did not realize it was made for a television movie. I was "thrown out" by the "R" certification. The story is strong, but the movie is too long about 40 minutes. Direction and continuity were excellent. Usually the actor was extraordinary and had a good job with his characters. On the underside of the movie is that it definitely falls into the genre of "chick flick". Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should require an "R" rating. There is no nudity or inappropriate sexual scenes. In fact, there are no sex scenes. She Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests on the SG-1 series, but this film did nothing to advance their career as they all used as low-level actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic as usual, and Mitch Pileggi was thinking about the modern day Lee Marvin. The highly talented Megan Gallagher, with whom I was an actor during the Millennium, was not too demanding to show its range of abilities. Tracy Pollan was the biggest disappointment. Besides being an under-actress and not very attractive, her voice is totally unpleasant. I found out that she was switching off television during the interview. I would recommend this movie to everyone who has Lifetime TV. I'm not going to recommend paying any money to see this movie however. Since I did not find anything that would cause censorship, it's a movie that's only worth watching for television, because nothing will be solved. As a television movie, I would rate it as 5 out of 10. As a feature film with the "R" certificate and as a strong cast, I rated it as 2 out of ten.
