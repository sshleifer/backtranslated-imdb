Luise Rainer earned her Oscar for her performance at The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role did not require any. She did not say much and looked pale in the whole movie. Luis's character was a slave who then married Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). In ancient Asia, both actors were not Asians, but in their roles they were very convincing. I hope Paul Muni has received Oscar for his performance, because that's what Luis had to get for his Oscar. She has to be a breakthrough actress, one of the first methods. It looks like something Hollywood does often. Al Pacino played Italian and Cuban. I felt that Luis's performance was dim, and when she died, she did not change in the expression of the previous scenes. She remained the same throughout the film; just changed its expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.
