I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: 1) Host Steve Martin was at his most sad: "I saw team assistants helped Michael Moore into his limo trunk" and "I do not mention about a gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle head in my bed. "2) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody the best actress (Genuine applause) or Roman Polanski as the best director (Genuine jerseys and boos), but they won. <br /> <br /> Last year's award ceremony was not too bad, but the surprise was little and I was glad to see RETURN OF THE KING awarding a prize even though it was not the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better) but what the BBC covered down Jonathan Ross to get several of his sycophantic wheel buddies and pretend that they were cheerful when they were something but. So when I heard that Sky was covering for British television, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make references, but instead ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh, when British television desperately criticizes film critics (of course they are) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly to LA to give their honest views to the winners and beaten <br /> < > Chris Rock was not too bad, but not Steve Martin, while the place reminds of a sports hall with seats! In my opinion, it is not a very strange arena. The main problem I had with the ceremony was a format with "smaller" Oscars that were handed over to the winners who sat in their seats! There is no such thing as a "smaller" Oscar, and precisely because the prize is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design, they are equally deserved as the Best Picture or Best Director. All winners should be able to march to the podium. What a group of arrogant snobs is becoming an academy and I agree with the comments that this format is shameful and, if not surprising, could be the worst ceremony in history. As for the award yourself <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett. No big surprise for the competition category <br /> <br /> Best actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints because Freeman is one of the best actors in America <br /> <br /> Best actor - Jamie Foxx. The most predictable award at night. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best actress - Hilary Swank. Big surprise, because everyone thought Annette Benning would simply win on academic politics, but Swank deserves it and gives the best speech of the night Best Director Clint Eastwood. Big surprise, because they all thought Scorsese was awarded the price simply because he never won. Actually, I'm glad, because if it did not deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, it did not deserve it AVI√ÅTOR Best movie - MILION DOLLAR BABY. Again, another big surprise, as they all thought the academy would share the best director and best picture award, while I thought the AVIATOR's Hollywood friendly conspiracy would make it a dead end for the best shot, while the controversial subject MDB would turn a lot of voters who may be illustrating this prize is that voters decided to ignore Oscar politics this year, and they really gave out prizes to people who deserve something that they did not do in the past, I mean, and A SHORT FOCUS defeated WORLD INDUSTRY for gad! And for a long time the academy can vote with their heads instead of their hearts
