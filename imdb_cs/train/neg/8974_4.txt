this movie, I will not say "film," was basically nothing and worked mostly for the popular events of the time. yeah the war was on full swing (the intended game), and this film gave the soldiers and our viewers treatment. But let's get something with a little more substance. <br /> <br /> He loved to see the young Buddy Rich on the drums. the music was good all over. <br /> <br /> But one portrait after another becomes fast. <br /> <br /> I did not recognize Zero Mostel! so if you're one of the "greatest generation," as they say, you'll definitely enjoy this movie ... <br /> <br />
