No wonder it was released directly on the DVD here in Australia, no redemption contains anything at all. Dialogue was hokey, acting, horrible and script sweetened !! Who would think it would be a good idea to make a sequel or to continue the much better film John Badham, Wargames from the 1980s, but they had to be something because it was a bad idea! Amanda Walsh was as good as an eye candy / interest in love, while Matt Lanter was good as the second main father - that's about it. I do not intend to recommend Wargames: The Dead Code for everyone, look for hackers or the original Wargames - both are better than this one!
