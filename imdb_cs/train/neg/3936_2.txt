Wow. I thought it might be uncomfortable, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like watching good auto-crash films: those that are so bad you can not turn away because you want to see how bad they can get. That's the only reason why I could leave TV for a morbid fascination. It was not such an acting that was only average or a little worse than expected from this cast, but the assumption and plot that would never have seen the light of day. The script also causes moans. As for cinematography, someone else noticed that they were using "curtains" like in the old 50th TV show ... but without irony? At first I thought he had to be kidding, but the film was too serious to use it properly. Do not even ask me for a score ... the only peak is the last song Morcheeba. I think they wanted to let people have something with their $ 8 ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if this is because Timothy Hutton has a lot of trouble in the recent past? I think if you do not expect too much and want to watch a soulless thriller, it would be better to spend your evening nail clipping, which is why it deserves 2.
