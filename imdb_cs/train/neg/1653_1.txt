It seems bizarre that someone read this script and thought, "It's funny! I mean, it's so funny it just has to do it!" Who was this person? Is he or she really a responsible person? Are they the ones who owe me their time, rather than the director / writer? This film smells in the most possible way. There is no contradiction with a good conversation and not a single sexual figure. And the story ... I prefer the second worst film ever to have, "No Hold's Barred" by Hulk Hogan to quite a degree. It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison. The end is omitted with a few minutes of outputs, and it is still in 80 minutes. Outputs include laughing members about the "merry" mistakes they have made and things that have become bad on the set of this comedy. I like to see someone laughing somehow, with some connection to this movie. "Nothing in this movie is funny Nothing, it just goes on and on It's really the lame I love films that are so bad they are good It's so bad that it's ... Something but I do not know and Amanda Peet does not feel completely, and is actually the only half of the good thing about this movie, but that does mean little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
