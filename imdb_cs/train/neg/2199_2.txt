I caught "Sorrows Lost" at New York Film and Film Festival and I think I had some great hopes for this film. It's sad, it's just another Visual FX business card. The story is nice. Poor illumination and camera work together with less than great editing and music make the film look poor. It is really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production at FX level! You can not just get off with the cool FX in the shorts already, it has been 5 years since the "405" made a great splash. At least that short quick, cool and it was even a bit funny! None of this can be said about "lost pain".
