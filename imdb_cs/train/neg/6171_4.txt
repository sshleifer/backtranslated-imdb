Good. it was not a surprise. many people will tell you that it's cruel. but they all talk "shiztz" this movie is very slow. He starts with some guy who does the preparation to feel no pain he says it's "my son" there are some bloody scenes, but I found them a little weak. you can also skip 40 minutes of film and get to the eye scene that was surprisingly impressive and ill. there are really stupid scenes in this. and they're copying hits and slaps with silly fake slapping sound that laughs at me! I would not recommend it. Keep in mind gore dogs. <br /> <br /> See if you want a similar 20-10 minute scene that's not so great yet, and it's a random scene of the guy who's trying to rape his mom .. yeah it's weird.
