1. Watch 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder mystery with very little laughter. The film seems to have been based on previous Italian film credits, but was overwritten by two relatively popular American romantic comedies. But this, which Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers do not decide in comparison to other efforts. The story is about a couple of Americans who play Richard Lewis and Sean Young who hit a lost dog and hope to make a fortune for reward after seeing an ad in the paper about the return of the dachshund. When he tries to return, he sees a hand that comes out of a garage door in a lady's residence that she believes is attached to the rest of the dead body of a woman to give them the money. They frightened and instead turned to the police and told them the truth that they were doing as refugees from a scene that they expect to be built for murder. The other characters in the movie are previously met by a train and hang around the Monte Carlo Gambling Center, which does the various things that need to be put into the story. Other members include actors such as John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. When the police learn about death, they begin to question the main characters and, of course, they must work through their fucking lies to find out what really happened. None of the aforementioned actors are able to bring this film out of its average state despite several fun moments that are mostly provided by a pair of Belushi / Shepherd. It's not a terrible movie, it's just not so good. There are a lot of average movies and that's just another pile. Try it, you may like it, you probably will not.
