This movie is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The plot is ridiculous and the whole "boy" is so stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and stupid. Let's look at it, it's just a "black comedy". It's just a senseless horrible piece that should never get into the theaters. Jokes are not fun and acting is terrible. Please, please, save the money before he saw those worthless pieces. I had to endure to sit through the Little Man for an hour and a half when I wanted my eyes to bleed. I'm disgusted to think of that! Who writes these crap? Actors have no talent, how do these people get to Hollywood? Earn money from this waste!
