I had something for this curry chick for a while, and no complaints about what she looked like in this movie. But after I caught him last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure that's the only thing in a movie that's not substandard. The script is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is terrible. I saw in another comment that somebody commented on how great are sex scenes ... what? Not at all. If this movie is so bad, you could turn it into softcore porn, but instead I see some pasty white guy blocking me when I see Wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing but fucking. They should get to the film, so the film was not a complete waste of time, but not. With such a scenario, it should mean that Wuhrer's prospect would look like it's alone for the movie. 2/10, just because it looked so hot.
