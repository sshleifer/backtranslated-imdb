I had great hopes for this film. The theater monologue is great and Nothing Balthazar is a very interesting person who has a lot of experience and knowledge in terms of movies. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of many Belgian films, but this film is bad. It is absolutely unbelievable that actors, who are 34, suddenly play the role of teenagers. "Linguistic games" were hideous and over the top. Nothing in the movie seemed real to me. The end was too deus ex machin for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and I think I lost an hour and a half of my life.
