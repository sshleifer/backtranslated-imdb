CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best recordings such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING are from mid to late 60. <br /> <br /> MATRON is itself in no the bad thing is just that we've all seen it before, with a thin conspiracy (a lot of spits trying to get into the hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills that they want to sell to Third World countries), a slightly funny, though uncoiled nature. I think that's where the problem lies - Gags are not all so funny that unprepared nature begins to show its age. Did we need another movie that uses a woman dressed as a woman to drive a conspiracy? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago, and I have a problem trying to forget a very fun line. This is a serious problem for comedy
