For anyone not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book should be interesting. It is colorful, well-performing and depicts a high adventure, but those of us who know the original stories are scary. I could hardly sit down. For some reason, it seems that scriptwriters had to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word differs from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be hard to film. But why do writers transcribe the story instead of adapting it? In this case, the writers broke up. Just a few examples: There was no rebellion on Renon. The officers took over the ship after the half-mad master captain got completely upset when he fell into the hatchway - for reasons that were supposed but never mentioned. There was no martial lawsuit. The investigative trial was held in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor the wife of Col. Ortega. Hornblower, himself, was never in the brigade on either the ship or the shore. There are lots of such manipulations with Forrester's story. On a purely technical basis, I think the film repeatedly uses a flash device to injure the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why did the screenwriters have to provoke a good story?
