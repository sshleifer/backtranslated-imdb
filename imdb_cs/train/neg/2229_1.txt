Maybe it's not fair because I did it only halfway through the movie. One of the few films I could not track because of cruelty. The effects are horrible, working with the camera is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, and the whole film is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example, during the coke shop, the coke is only freely stored in a briefcase - I'm not an expert, but I think people generally put it in the bag. They use the same stupid sound effect whenever punch worthy (it's over the top of 'crunching' sound 'and they use toy weapons with dubbed in sound effects. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever.
