This is another of many B films without movies called noir movies in the hope of provoking some interest in something that is deprived of it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are average. These are three wooden wires. I think John Dall was supposed to be going to the film industry, but then someone realized he had a little talent, and then ended up with the television. Lee J Cobb, who is usually amazing, can not come out of the bad scenario and the wrong direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be femme fatale, but nowhere can she convince the audience. The movie has two of the most common cars I've ever seen, the one in which John Dall goes for Lee J Cobb is especially strange. DVD conversion is a typical alpha.
