This film lacked something I could not put my finger first: charisma from the lead actress. This inevitably resulted in a lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading husband. Even romantic scenes have come to the point that they are just actors in the game. It could be a director who mistakenly guessed what the actors needed. I just do not know. But could it be a screenplay? Just who was the cook in love? He seemed to be more deprived of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and of his youthful exploitation than of something else. He never convinced me he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this movie. But do not forget she was nominated for an Oscar, so listen.
