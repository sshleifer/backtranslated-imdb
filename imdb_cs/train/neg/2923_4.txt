The story was quite interesting, with the Russian revolution of the background. I also enjoyed a tour of Budapest because the film was partially filmed. Unfortunately, the two main characters were zero chemistry, so it was hard to believe that love story between them. Hunting scenes were forced and mechanical. The Jordan chalk was really hard, almost icy. Rob Stewart was pretty charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend. The end, when we finally find out who is after them, was rather weak and it made no sense at all. I think I would have made this movie much better if the relationship between the two actors was somewhat more credible.
