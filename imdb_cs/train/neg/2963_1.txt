Since I started attending this site and voted for movies, I've never made a movie 1. Even the worrying "Dance! Workout with Barbie" got 2. <br /> <br /> Whenever I seem to be looking at what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop asking the following question: "Is this movie really as bad as the awful soul of sucking the beast that is "Theodore Rex"? "And I could never answer" yes ". I'm doing everything in my mind to know what he's doing in the dead speech: "Hey, we're rebuilding Blade Runner and Barney in Harrison Ford Role!" and decided it was a good idea to really spend the time and money to get the movie. In addition, I want to know what the heck of the kind of market they were going to sell it towards towards if it was not steep on the video. This is a rare monster: a movie that is too scary for kids and is too stupid for adults. I asked, "What does it mean?" but in that case it could be really redundant. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all you need to know is that you should only be exposed to this absurdity if you are one of five or six hideous "Howard the Duck" fans or if you are curious to see the most movie Evil Insane all the time, or you really want to punish.
