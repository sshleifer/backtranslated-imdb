Alfred Hitchcock invented any thriller you would think: set the standards so high that every director who makes the film with tension will be fatally compared to him. The main subject of this Bullock vehicle, all thoughts, was almost everything in Hitchcock's classic "rope": the two students who committed unscrupulous crime, Nietsche's philosophy, and the tracks the boys were spreading, were the first to bring them to the screen. And the eighty-minute film, which was a technically boring tour de force. <br /> <br /> "Murder of numbers" is not done in one room, like a "rope", you think. And the highest level of originality, two cops against bad guys, and you would never guess, these two cops are very different: in fact, Bullock plays the role of a woman living like a man, and her partner (Chaplin) is just as shy as a shy girl. The performances of two boys are not really meaningful, not as good as Edward Norton in "primal fear". <br /> <br /> Well, you know, the "rope" was so good ...
