This movie is so bad you can not imagine it. The game is terrible, even worse than in third-class masterpieces. It is a pity that this film has been the most successful in Switzerland over the last 20 years. Interaction between soldiers had no meaning at all. The story could be removed from the blues of the photo-story, the dialogues were as wooden as the Treebeard, and the fence holes were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. Today, however, he does not need much to satisfy the audience. The actors were beautiful, for example, the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hanging (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. This is a really cool person! Especially for young people aged 12 and 13. But the media created an atmosphere in which you were not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the dynamics of the peer group by implicitly saying that you are nerd unless you go with the other "sheep" and say.yes. exactly what it was like when I was in the army / that's exactly what I'm gonna do when I have to go to the army ... on every cheese thing that has to do with drugs and cold. And I do not think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning the toothbrush with toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I offended the lieutenant). It is not necessary for every movie to be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to have fun for a few hours and forget the problems and I think it's not a bad thing. These films, however, affect teenagers by showing them a cold lifestyle that is actually just stupid and turns them into helpless ignorants and egocentric idiots. But because now that my opinion is not very popular, I will be silent now, and I recommend that you avoid at all costs this terrible film and save your wits! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
