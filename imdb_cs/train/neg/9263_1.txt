What was the deal with the clothes? Everyone was dressed like something from the late 70's. The cars were even obsolete. The school was obsolete. Monastic clothing was obsolete and the hospital looked like something from the 1940s, with its departments and wooden staircases and things. Nothing in the whole movie was a sign that it did not happen in 1991. My mother laughed, "Geeeee-when, when was the movie MADE?" When we pressed the "INFO BUTTON" button on our remote control, we were sure that 1991 had to be a typo! Has anyone else recorded it? My FAVORITE part was when a woman told her a nasty shame on the phone, the reverse cross in the mirror, and she just said, "Well, look, I have a congressional meeting about it later." That line was just classical. YOU ARE A MAN! My favorite part of mother was when she gave them the "delight of a devil child" of her own Rottweiler. My mother said, "What the Spawn of the Devil ... Rottweiler needs." She also enjoyed all the people who collapsed in the churches, holding the chests. Her most popular part was a guy in a school car park, a 5 km / h ride, a truck ride / tipper / front loader. He had about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he just went on, and he had a really silly blank expression on his face. I mean how fast can you go to the school car park?!?! It does not matter!
