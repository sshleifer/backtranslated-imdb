As a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. Beautiful decorations and sharply lighted sets make some remake of this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of many television films of the 1970s. Crenna is not a bad choice because Walter Neff, but his handy wardrobe and "swank" flat do not fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting character. He does the best to make it work, but Samantha Egger is really a bad choice. The English accent and California seem to be unable to keep the candle Barbara Stanwick's velvet and sex. Lee J. Cobb is trying to be a fashionable Barton Keyes, but even his performance is simply gruff, without style. She feels like a television movie it was and reminds me again of what a remarkable original film it is.
