I was looking at the weekend this afternoon, because there was nothing else, it would be much more fun if I chewed my legs and maybe less painfully. I urge someone to watch it just to see how the movie might be so terrible, it was certainly deliberate. I caught up with every unnecessary attempt at humor that took place in a childish, dishonest, badly done way that it was not convinced. This is a movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, thinks I'm exaggerating? Give time and think again. Terrifying, absolutely terrible. If it were not a prank, the director and someone else responsible for it should be removed and immediately shot after being forced to watch this movie again.
