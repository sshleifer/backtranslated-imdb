As a fan of White Noise, he was utterly disappointed, as the creator of cinematography was quite good, well lit, good camera, reasonable direction. But as a film it's just as predictable as any other "so-called" horror movies that the market has recently flooded. Although it had a bit of a "cold factor," the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Effects) does not seem to be believable. This film did not explain the reasons for some of the events, but continued with them. Acting was far from blowing minds the main character portrayed no emotions, like many recent thriller / horror films. I certainly will not buy the movie on DVD and I do not recommend anyone to go see it.
