When I first started watching this movie, I was looking for some fine metaphors, but I was soon told that this film really came from people in the train. Interactions between people are like those you can see every day on the street, and when a slightly more interesting situation sometimes appears, the dialogue becomes boring and boring. It's not that I do not know how this movie tries to portray the way people interact, it's just that they are very boring in this movie. If you want to see and analyze such relationships, you should really really go out and buy a train ticket and look at you on the train with you. It's realistic, but you do not go to the movie to watch the movie about sitting there and looking at the movie.
