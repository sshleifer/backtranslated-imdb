This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - lots of crazy characters on some silly mission. His signature culminates in the fact that the entire film has been united and fought each other in a crazy moshpit over hidden money. Whether it's the winning lottery in the weekly Malamaal Weekly, black money at Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., the director becomes ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong; As the clich√© and the shamelessness of his films may be, I usually end up enjoying a comedy. However, in most of his previous films there was really good humor (Hungama and Hera Pheri are remarkable ones). Now, the delight of his films is fading when he uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The pisces are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav is irritating and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is all right and Sharman Joshi is the best.
