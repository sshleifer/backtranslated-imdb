I wish I knew more about this movie when I rented it. I would put it in the queue based on Heather Graham and her strong notions as an actress (IMHO). While some parts of the film were charming, much of the film felt conceived, unfurled or otherwise boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor so many people who thought the sibi were a couple ... I do not care how much of the story is that it's still a little, matter. And Charlie, because of the zoologist, certainly does not seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it with her (except for her bitterness and some common interests) that caused her to fall down? The story could have been much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with a reviewer who sometimes bothers her), a taxi in turn and dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were such great dancers, I wish, because the bits shown to us were really better than most of the rest of the film). It could have been better.
