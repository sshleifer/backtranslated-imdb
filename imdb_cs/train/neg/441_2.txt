We do not have it on TV in England, but we went over the Internet to YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! This is from the creator of Jim Worm Draw, Douglas TenNapel, I've never gotten into the cartoon, but I have to admit it's better. The cartoonist has not done anything since then. For Doug TenNapel it's a return travesty and everywhere low! The story is about three cats who will inherit the house and a lot of money from a dead old lady. They are argumentative and continue to disagree with what they want to spend their money. "BORING"! The animation is scary. The main characters are to be cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Just strange animal monsters with big mouths, pointed teeth and crazy eyes! Human and other animal characters are also really ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Also stories are lame and probably copied from older shows. I was surprised how 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb audiences received this show. Television really is not what it is! But most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you on the web may not agree with me. I'm sorry, but it's a complete waste of money and a complete and complete waste of time and you're glad that Britain too hates these bulls (oh yeah if you have a digital one you have) but I do not, that's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and that's very lucky because I put the next exhibitions the worst!).
