I'm probably one of the few viewers who do not recommend this movie. I thought visually amazing as all Ang Lee's work (every frame seems to be nice to print), I was really disappointed with the movie disjointed tempo. It was really too long. The story takes place at the time of the Missouri civil war and is a young man (Roedel) who joins the Bushwackers' wild powers, a sort of renegade who confronts confederations that lead a geuril type to fight with Jayhawkers, their counterparts in the Union. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played Skeet Ulrich, to enter the group after Chile's father is shot dead and his home is burned, probably by Jayhawkers. The story follows Roedel and Chiles' adventure attacks and their interactions with other war victims, including a former slave who fights for Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright), and the war widow played Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that every time a movie unfolded the story to an interesting point, it would turn to some other subplot and let things go undeveloped. For example, agitation between the Roedel group caused by the former slave Holt, involved in Confederate causes, is briefly proven through some conflict over properties and protocol, and then dropped later in the film. The young villian / blunt Bushwhacker hates Roedel and faces a lot of anxiety and violence against him, but we never know why. Some characters never look on the surface; I think that's because the movie includes too many of them, as well as taking a lot of history. The historical detail was excellent. I liked looking at housing, furniture, clothes, etc. And I thought the leading actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, though they came across a little bit of dialogue. If you really do not like history or are a huge fan of Ang Lee, do it for it.
