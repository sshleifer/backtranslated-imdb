We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. While the adaptation is not too precise, these films were nevertheless excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney movie. However, I regret to say that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those films. Not only does it fail to meet some of Madeleine L'Engle's most basic expectations, but can resist scriptwriting, acting, special effects, and ultimately respect for the audience. I do not think I'm trying to be malicious; on the contrary, I entered the open mind into this matter. I thought it was made for T.V. the film would compensate for his lack of blur-glare in his screenplay. After all, the Star Wars Ewoks would have been decent, if a little stupid. Think about the original star wars being made on the "lunch budget" and look for George Lucas! But from the first scene I started to disappoint and surrounded me as if I had been too close to the Black Case in the trials. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Greedo's filming became the first symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition in 1997 (a catastrophe with monumental proportions including a disgruntled director who makes some vicious changes in beloved classics), Mrs. Whatsit is officially to become my personal a symbol of confusion and stupidity, which is a Wisdom in Time. The reason is that it was mutated without conviction. In addition to the slightly controversial Star Trek: First Contact and Radio decision-making, our film stars have decided that it is appropriate to visualize them as crows. That's true, the crow. In addition, the celestial form of this highly beloved person was attacked by what looks like an eight-year-old dementia; the majestic half-circle, the semi-circle with its wings became a huge human head with a haunted smile that is clumsily mounted on the body of horses that clashes with a cone and which has happened to sport a pair of wings in the middle. If I were five, it would psychologically traumatize me all my life. The worst thing is that when she spoke, she turned herself back to avoid the responsibility for synchronizing her lips, which led to the scene she had spent looking at the back of her head and looking at a single, immobile face, a bit of special effects less credible than ET <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He personally always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter: plain hair, glasses, and a figure most of the supermodels found in laughter. He was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic mathematical genius who simply could not care about Nicaragua's imports and exports. In the movie, it's an unpleasant consciousness for which I have no compassion at all. In fact, he makes me feel sorry for the poor Mr. Jenkins, the school principal who is still struggling with her. Calvin, the kind, intelligent guy that everybody thinks he's a jock, has become a jock! Irony is terrible. As for the unforgettable Happy Medium, they took a pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a "over sex" being and she likes to look at "fun" things like girls who fall from swings. The only three people I'm thinking about doing a decent job are Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit, and the red-eyed man (dubbed "Dude with red eyes" due to his complete invention as a character). <br /> <Story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the film is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, who did not do a good job of telling the story that appeared in the book, while retaining an interpretation of the original work. This is the sole of a book with a pleasant conversation with Hades in the underworld, apparently not knowing that his body is destroyed. As the Dark Lord adds only to how well it has proven that the truth must be felt and not seen, the warming of the Ixchelu's wands (replacing the wondrous creatures that aunt Beast holds between their ranks) tears the spine. As God the Dead records how delicate the Terror Earth-like Camazotz, the torn pages are scattered in a sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the earth of evil. <br /> <br /> I am sorry that this movie exists. I do not believe the actors were really bad. It's the way signs are written that destroys them. Wrinkle in Time deserved to adapt Lawrence Kasdan directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, enhanced in Industrial Light and Magic by John Williams, who won his sound in Skywalker Sound, released THX and sold Twentieth Century Fox. In its present state, the film is not suitable for showing to people who respect. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. The book was good, the film was bad, and Mrs. Whatsit was ugly. Score: 0.1 / 10 (if I could) <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> </ b> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, and the main poster / poster has an image of the three main characters who ride around a flying horse across the castle. Some might say it symbolizes a high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who did not even worry about Photosho Meg's hands properly.
