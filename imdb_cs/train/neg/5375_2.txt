When I was watching this movie, I almost felt I had lost 2 hours of my life, but I think there is something good about it: <br /> <br /> If I had to rate it like any other movie, you will receive 1 or 2 peaks, but if I classify it as a low budget. film, it can get 3 or 4. This is a movie to be "complete" and without too long bore passages or a waste of time. This movie is not. But I think a lot of independent films are about showing film skills, and because this movie has some attractions. If I comment on what directors should take with me to my next project, I think distorted sound effects have some quality. Some characters will also be able to build, but it will make me forget about what they should miss out on in their next project because the character building takes too long because it is mostly irrelevant to the film plot. Even long periods of time spent walking should not continue with the next project - what does it mean? I think this movie tries to be a bit of everything (building characters, tensions and plotting), and it ends up being nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie is trying too much and too hard, and I think it should be shortened to a short film. I simply managed to find one hour of walk around or a meaningless dialogue that would cut out of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things in this movie. The story should be simplified. I know there's got to be some secret in this movie, but the slight surprise of who's a murderer is not a secret. The story behind the "mystery" during the film will receive almost no attention that leaves the final "point" as a quick, unsatisfactory affair. <br /> <br /> That's why I would like to say that this movie was a nice attempt, but I can not. I hope directors will learn from their mistakes and will produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in cheap learning from the production of low-budget films, you do not have to look at it - I do not see much about why everyone thinks it's bad. As others have said, I am sure that many of the dozens that are dedicated to this film come from people who have somehow contributed to the film. This movie could not get a "10" rating from any remote objective point of view.
