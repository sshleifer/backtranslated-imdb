I, like many other Bachchan fans, are impatiently waiting for the remake of Sholaye. This movie was not. Thank God they did not let them use the name "Sholay" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is not a good title. Working with the camera, places, costumes, totally out of place of the dance, the dialogue is made up of the best movies I've ever seen. Are you wondering if the actor actors agreed on the film because they needed money and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast. The only unpaid actor, an ant, was the only one similar to the first film. Abishek's role was totally absurd, he needed money to pay for his wedding to Asha? Save money, your mind and your time, do not bother with this movie or DVD when it comes out.
