An inevitable remake, and can not come closer to capturing the original spell. Extreme length causes more than a few portions of yawning. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style and mostly lacks talent, not just with actor but direction, sets, costumes, etc. They are all under par. It has a clear non-response to the period's details. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member to show any taste, Tyne Daly is not too bad. He had to stay pretty well alone. The singing moves well (Vanessa Williams) the poor (everyone else). Watch the original version of 1963 and skip this version. There is not much to recommend.
