"Witchery" can be just the most incoherent and lamentably written horror film of the 1980s, but fortunately it has several compensating features such as fantastic gore effects, exciting music scores and some amazing casting possibilities. To be honest, the scenario does not make sense, but who cares about when Linda Blair (unfolded hairstyle) portrays another girl who has evil powers, and David Hasselhof shows a dense photographer (which seems to be a movie that constantly contains bloody voodoo , stitched lips, upright crucifixion, cruel burns, and overused, but really scary melody, eight random people gathered on an abandoned holiday resort off the Massachusetts coast, a young couple is here to explore the dark history of the site, a dysfunctional family (with Linda Blair, pregnant when no one seems to be worried about who the father is and what his place of residence is) he thinks of the reopening of the hotel and of the lavish female architect simply labeled for casual sex They are forced to stay in the hotel's night room and then in the house aging an actress or something that always dresses in black, starts choosing them in different interesting ways Everything is in some way connected with the introductory sequence that shows that a woman accused of witchcraft jumps out of the window. In any case, the conspiracy is definitely not very significant in the Italian horror franchise, which began as an unofficial detour from "The Evil Dead". Atmosphere is sometimes disturbing, and makeup effects are undoubtedly the best feature of the whole movie. There is something extremely morbid and disturbing when I look at a defenseless woman who hangs her head down on the chimney and waits for her to drink.
