Impressed! This is the worst film of SRK and one of the worst Bollywood films I've ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (except SRK, of course, even if he can not save the film), and does not make much sense. The director looks all very confused, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealistic and yet trusted. Well, he can not even. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours before you release, do not watch this movie please! (Let's say it for your own good!) Continue your search, find something to follow!
