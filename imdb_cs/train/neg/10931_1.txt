I went to see this movie with relatively low expectations when I thought it would be a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not. I could hardly sit with a movie without wanting to leave. I went with my two children (aged 10 and 13) and even asked, "How much longer?" For the rest of my life I just wondered who would approve this scenario. Even Reliable Fred Willard could not rescue disturbed dialogue, state jokes, and banal plot. I would suggest that whoever wrote and directed the film (I use this term freely) should put a class on an internet scene that would write a class or get to the local school class because of the film class. At the very least, there are many books on overhead, on-screen writing, and the production of films to teach them about structure, conspiracy, dialogue and stimulation.
