SCHIZOPHRENIAC: WHO MANGLER is another example of what happens when you get a lot of shameless people together to create an "extreme" horror movie. Any kind of acting, production, storyline, FX, etc. ... come out of the window in an effort to create "shock value." Do not let me down - I consider myself to be a connoisseur of "shock" films and a sleazier / gorier / nastier better - but it's still nice to see SOME talents from NEVER involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Rush, a drug-addicted crazy show that takes orders to kill his fake Rubberneck dummy. He's going several times and killing yachts and other random people and shouting about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (these are "fucking" for those of you who do not talk about New York ...) and how he wants to rape them in ass. There are several weak scenes of necrophilia, very little gore and some nudity to mix things a bit - but nothing you've seen in a better movie ... The only redeemed thing I can find in this slow motion often (unintentionally?) Cheerful shouting - fits from our main man, Harry. He goes on and on to want to kill everyone and do them in the ass, and after a while he becomes quite comical. In fact, I was almost tempted to think that there should be a homoerotic subtext to this film, with all of the convoy calls and constant shots of Harry running around with his donkey. In all sincerity, the joker is not one more in this movie, then a couple of cats showing some T-a-A (and some full-frontal, for good). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is slightly fun as a one-time watch, but I really can only recommend those who want to say they watched the film SCHIZOPHRENIAC: WHO MANGLER. To be honest - the title, by far - is the best on this garbage ... Generous 3.5 / 10
