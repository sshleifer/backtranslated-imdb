It was a parody of the LOTR-trilogy. But this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. THIS IS PERSONAL POSITION. I have no doubt that there are people who will love this sense of humor, but there are better parodies in films from well-known directors like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I work in the cinema and DVD Shop and the success in this movie was similar in both areas: In the movies, it was a pleasant (but not a big) success in the first two weeks, but then when reviewing those who saw it was not very good , the movie dropped very fast. On DVD, it was good for a short time, but no one has asked for it. In the last ten years there have been two worst movies I've seen, Ring Ring and Torque. I can not decide which one is worse, but I'm glad there are so many good movies so I do not have to think too much about this question.
