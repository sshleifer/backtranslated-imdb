It may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say this, but someone who can read it will probably find that each conspiracy turns right. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie, I liked it. I did not do it in the way of some movies that offend your intelligence, but everything seemed too predictable when it comes to getting the desired happy ending. There were certainly fun bits on the way, but few of them were original. At least it was not for the gutter. Christina Applegate looks fresh and Ben Affleck is working hard. Their scenes together are the only redemption. All others are cardboard cutouts, including surprisingly James Gandolfini, who had to do it for someone as a favor. Overall, it's harmless, but not inspirational, 90 minutes.
