and not in entertainment. it is bad. it's shocking that people posted positive things here. the story is upset, acting is bad, it's not scary, special effects are not special - oh no! the blackboard has its hands! oh gee - the mirror has turned into water! hair, clothes, and make-up in the 50s are not accurate, and they get a middle-aged man with a retreat line to play the game itself. it's like a later nightmare on the ulm street. I like sitting to watch some sort of hot horror movie just like anyone else, but there are better ones to choose from.
