This movie, which was released directly on the video, should be provided with a warning label that is dangerous to human health and may expose the viewer to boredom. It is still another shrouded, evolving religious film with "adventure" with good boys (believers) who suddenly disappeared and evil people (non-believers) left behind. It's an interesting concept, especially when we see it happening on a flight that is controlled by an infidel who has a sinful affair with an air hostess on board (no need to say that the sinner will not disappear!). Unfortunately, when all the pilots were disbelievers, the plane did not fall or the film would be mercifully over. Though it might be interesting without a heavy religion, as a whole, the productive film does one gag, acting is terrible and apparently computer-generated simulations are very fake to look for. In addition, it is another film shot in Canada, which is considered New York City. Win me ... I will just read the Bible.
