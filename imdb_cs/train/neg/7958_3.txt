Protégé runs linearly; do not expect any quick action without being breathless, because there are just no moments to sit. <br /> <br /> There are not many circles, so do not expect one. I would not want to break the acting - the show would be much worse if not for Wu acting, which was the only saving mercy of the film. And that cute little girl. Humor is at best weak, and the show must also go through a drug campaign that employs the usual shocking tactics (esp scenes with Zhang) to tell us what we already know - that is, drugs break down families, heroin fools you, it's not that easy bounce, you fall into a vicious cycle. <br /> <br /> It might seem a bit harsh, but I feel the show is far from smooth and somewhat disordered (* SPOILER ALERT *: Take, for example, when Andy Lau was brought to the police station: what? have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997. "And that's the way they caught it, no, no pursuit of a car, just a jump on the scene that in the first place undermined Wu's role.) I suspect that lack of creativity is attributed to reality that it is, after all, the production of Mediacorp Raintree, a Singaporean production film company.
