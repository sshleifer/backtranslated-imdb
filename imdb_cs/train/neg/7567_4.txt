The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a mental illness in the past. She will end up in a psychiatric institution after she starts to believe she is actually a cyborg. In an institution he meets Park Il-Sun, the young man who develops it. <br /> <br /> If you're reading it, you probably know how a talented Chan-wook park is. But "I'm a Cyborg ..." is a great diversion from the familiar and (sadly) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any movie or story that tries to do something else. God knows, we all get enough crap in our local cinemas. The main point of the movie I have to say is that she can not say anything about mental illness or create characters you care about. This story must be one of the most important things I've "seen in years ... but weird is not enough." The film does not have a heart ... just surrealism and confusion, it seems that the main theme of the film is confusion. , but it's Chan-wook Park itself, which turns out to be the most confused.
