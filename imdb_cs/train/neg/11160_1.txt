This kind of "inspiratory" saccharin is enough to make you worse. It telegrades its feelings as the largest traffic light on earth. Removes from the audience their own interpretation and feeling by deciding for them. The big surface is swimming in crying orchestration, which must act as the connecting cables on a dead car; I think you'd need such a challenge to feel if you're stupid enough to watch the movie as easily as this. Streep glows and wonders if he really has a deep feeling on the display, or if it's just - a display turned on and off as a light. Because I can not see for my life how she could find life in such a mud of film. While it's based on a true story and inspiring, I'm sure set-ups, executions, and performances are played as third-level television or half-college.
