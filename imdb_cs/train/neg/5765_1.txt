Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to get started. The last film was an average effort. Put it beside this load, it's a classic comedy. While the other part was full of humorous and inexpensive engagement, at least it was funny. For humorous humor it's not funny. Jokes, pratfalls and visual gags should be naturally fun. Touching the viewer over his head with tired jokes is not good. Humor in this film was aimed at teenage imbeciles who will laugh. When they managed to get into the crowd at the high school, a sense of self-control emerged from the window. Circular parodies are not funny. I have been watching them in comedies since 1998. They are so late. Michael Jackson's vocals are also not good. What is even worse to do the fun of the two broken are "artists" whose best days were NEVER. The death of American cinema was slow. Such films are nails that are whipped into the coffin. What happened to real humor? I did not smile at the cinema for too long. Too many bad movies shake the brain. Do you want proof? Go to a local mega chain store and see what's on the fields. This movie is bad. Do not trust the hype. I'd rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer this bad excuse of comedy ever again! It's definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
