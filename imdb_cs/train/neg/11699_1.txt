Dilution of thinner is definitely thin. And rough. An obese lawyer runs a gypsy woman and a gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight ... to bone. OK, gypsy curses should be fun, but lose weight lost wrong? No way. Besides, Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another horror writer and screenwriter of this humorous movie, is doing it too. The attorney is not just criminally irresponsible, he's bold, haha! Thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who sneaks as he has never seen anything as disgusting as fat. Hey, I can just say, Well, look at the mirror.
