Nothing can prepare you for another crazy trip! This time it brings you the inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As for exploitative films, they do not start! Like a science fiction, it's just non-original! All we see is an ugly female android wearing a bikini to destroy Earth and show off everything that is almost bare to resist! Give me a break! If this fun thing is, then why not the dust of those old swimmers from the attic of the attic for a change ?! It would be much better if it was not really dull at high, but that would not have done great. I would like to point out another film called THE ASSAULT (1996) Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. This illustrates why top action movies "femme fatale" from the first person in America are not related. Excuse me, dogs!
