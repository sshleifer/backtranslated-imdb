I was expecting a Grendel movie, a book written by John Gardner in the late seventies. It was based on the epic Beowulf, but she said from a monster point of view. <br /> <br /> Whatever you think about Gardner's book, a Beowulf-based film would not be entitled to Grendel when he does not say anything more about a monster beyond the boundlessly poor scenes in which the CG monster is depicted as nothing else than the modified Predator. In addition, writers should be punished for misinterpreting the original story and contributing to the growing growing ignorance of a US television viewer. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood to make it so bad. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
