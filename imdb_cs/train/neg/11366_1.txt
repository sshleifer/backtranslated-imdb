The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during Sneakpreview. It was not even a premiere. I remember there was some of the directors there, or you do not remember who. It was a Belgian film we never heard about, so we were quite neutral and we did not know what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a great actor and everyone else is worth peace. The actor, who is a star, has been growing for a long time. It helps to realize the film called "Shadows" in Belgium. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film started, we noticed how much he was scolding. Nothing against occasional swearing. However, it was far from poisoning. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone from a cast, a non-English speaker uses the word F **** or S ***, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. We quickly lost the number of times we used the words F and S. Everyone was glad to be out of the theater. And we had to vote, but it was hard for us because it was only 0 to 10 and we were looking for -10.
