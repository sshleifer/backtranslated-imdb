Some of these comments to viewers are just ridiculous. Is not it pain to keep track of important others with you? I apologized to my friend for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly weird. Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unsuitable, especially when Vanessa makes this ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same clumsy girl in my so-called life. It must under no circumstances be pressed. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was the only redeemed part of this movie, she was on the screen for five minutes, and I swear to God that she stretched the movie screen and stormed me. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I think it was a well shot movie, it was pretty nice, the setting was interestingly dressed and it gave relief from the intense boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> I do not know it's quite pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast composed of "The Biggest Actresses of our Time" is so hot. She certainly had more than a few noticeable editing errors and the main character (Ann) was a huge blockbuster. I was glad she died. But it was because I felt bad about Lila, Anna's girlfriend - mainly because these two ladies were better actors and I made myself feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD, Evening in the movie. You did not want to have fun and did not even think you thought. I hope the book will be better, so it does not waste even the time of the people. 3/10
