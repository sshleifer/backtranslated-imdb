That was not what I wanted to see. I bought it on DVD, and under the movies I found myself irritated and turned off the film for a moment. Heres what I did not like: <br /> <br /> 1 at the father <br /> <br /> 2 tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 dinosaurs (mostly) looked fake <br /> <br /> 4 The bad scientist and he was annoying <br /> <br /> 5 The image quality on the DVD was really bad <br /> <br /> What I wanted: <br /> <br / > 1 Music by Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have a soundtrack from this movie. Unfortunately the sound quality is not good, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> 2 For the first time, when we see dinosaurs, they inspire a bit of astonishment. <br /> <br /> 3 The baby is a little cute when it's in the water and it's playing. <br /> <br /> 4 This funny scene happens. <br /> <br /> 5 Children who see this movie hope that evil is always losing.
