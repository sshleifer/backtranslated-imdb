If you saw Friends, the font will feel very good. Especially the last 3 or 4 season friends often share the same comedy series. The exhibition is about a group of people whose connection lies in sharing the same class when they were still young (about 10 years I think). Now they are in their twenties and meet again at a class meeting. Here begins the series. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with several story lines at a time. They are usually not linked in any way. Each story line is cut into several parts, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> Sketches are where I have problems with this series. Just like in later seasons of Friends, it's often a rather silly environment with hardly believable situations. One of the main characters does something really stupid, which is hard to believe. The situation is heavily exaggerated, as if it were not stupid enough. If you are in this type of humor, you may like this series. It's a great turn for me. The reason I started watching friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially trusted story lines, with some romance that lends you the characters. The class has nothing to do with it. Characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far. Therefore, it is impossible to concentrate and enjoy them. At least with friends, it took several seasons before the couple exhausted, and all character features were shed. But in the Class it seems that steam has run out before it starts.
