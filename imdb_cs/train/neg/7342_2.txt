"The Man in the Attic" is a movie set in the 1910s. It's inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, this is a story that did not really need to be explained. Looking at the box, the people involved in the packing of the film tried to make this film smelly and erotic. They use terms like "illegal passion", "forbidden affairs" and "unlimited pleasure." They even show the image of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) who holds a gun! The story includes Christ, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns her own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband. Christ and Edward fall in love with each other. The allegedly "shocking" part of the film is this: Christ's husband discovers this matter and forbids them ever to visit each other again. So what do you decide to do? Christ ends when Edward lives in the attic. Wow! Christ finally sees someone else and Edward is extremely jealous. So, and so on, and so on. <br /> <br /> "The man in the attic" does not include any new territory. It's an original Showtime show that explains why stars are a few actors in list B and both of them appear briefly in buff. <br /> <br />
