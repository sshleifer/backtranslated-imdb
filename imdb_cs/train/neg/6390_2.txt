I've seen about a thousand horror films. (my favorite type) This movie is one of the worst. For me, the idea is driving a movie. So even a poorly processed, cheaply made film can be good. Something strange is definitely cheap. However, he has little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene has at the beginning with the movie. Something strange has nothing to offer. Save the pain!
