Until the last 20 minutes, I thought maybe this was Jackie Chan's worst movie (except his work before 1978, which I'm not familiar with). The last battle sequence has changed everything: it's long and good and intense - really one of the top of Han's career. To get this done, you have to sit up with a lot of "comedy" that could entertain five-year-olds (oh, look, someone tossed tomato on that person's face) and endless "football" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which contains the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a cock" - to watch what it's about). "The Dragon Lord" is worth renting the final fight itself, but the rest of the film is for Jackie collectors and even for those who have seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
