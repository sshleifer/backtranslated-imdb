The soul of the old mummy is transferred to one of his followers to punish all who have contributed to the desecration of his grave. The transformation of the soul makes the young man an age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, blood is exhausted from those involved in digging. To be as quick as possible, the Pharaoh's curse is a fairly insignificant affair. While the movies represent some good, original ideas (mummy blood sucking, soul transfer, interesting make-up effects, hand burst scene, etc.) And several atmospheric moments, direction and tempo are the definition of fertilization itself. To make things even worse, the first 15 movies is a relatively short 66 minute runtime consisting of nothing more than padding. I usually go for those slow-moving mummies, but my Pharaoh's curse is also testing my patients. Casting helps very little. With just one exception (Ziva Rodann is a lonely bright spot, if the film can concentrate more on her mysterious character), the cast is as boring as the screenplay. Finally, I do not know who would want to give a servant who looks like a mummy in his pajamas, but it's a ridiculous, ridiculous look at the creature that is about to cause fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite most of the negative comments on the pharaoh's curse, I intend to rate it 4/10. It's not a good rating, but it's generous given the problems I have with the movie.
