The form of the film is that it is a seizure. There are surprises, twists and turns, reversals and excitement. Occasionally, it's actually "on the edge of the place" movie. But it disappoints and is very disappointing. The vicious piece is not credible; his character is not together. I reject the movie "spoil" but I just say that the character we met at the beginning could not be the one we see at the end. The second main disappointment of the movie is that - in the end, something more than a bloody movie slasher will happen. There is only a small qualitative difference between this and one of the films "Friday 13". Not that every film must always be tasteful, but this film is happening due to occasional dripping. <br /> <br /> Although the film contains the beautiful Sean Connery, it does not even change its usual standards and often only seems to be going through the steps.
