Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950 teenager in horror film. It's not a movie of horror or science fiction. The plot concerns a group of teenagers who are going to be disqualified from the "hot stick" club because they can not pay the rent. As soon as they dug, they decide to try the old Haunted House. The only rescue for the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the She Creature suit) turns out to be a movie monster without a job played by Blaisdell.
