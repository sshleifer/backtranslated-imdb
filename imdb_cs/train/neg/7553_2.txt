Amazing phenomenal success. It's really horrible. <br /> <br /> First ... Nicholas Cage has now gotten into the Over-Emoting final in his acting class. Wear new hair plugs and a face that has been lifted so many times that its hinged back ears seem to hold back, emitting not only the sick emerald but creating a "hero" that you have no interest in. <br /> <br /> I do not know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. It creates women totally deviant and evil ... and they pay them back by giving Cage a few of them straight into their face and calling them all "b **** es" several times. I liked LaBute's early movies and a few of his musical plays ... but it's a strange wonder. I give this film 2 out of 10 just based on Ellen Burstyn's performance. At the time she finally emerged (bravely through the scenes with the wig on her forehead clearly visible on her forehead), it seems that hope may be lost. He deserves the Oscar here, and now that he says he has a straight line and when he seems to be wearing a white mum and a blue, white and gold facial color floating on Prut's man, you know that working with Scorces and Friedkin she really made this role so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad-head and cuckoo that must be seen being believed. <br /> <br /> The most notable are: Nicholas Cage fleeing from swamps of bees and then falling down the hill. Nicholas Cage steals the bike and looks like Mrs. Gulch from the Wizard of Oz on horseback. Nicholas Cage runs around the Island to kick the door looking for the missing girl. Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once promising acting career in a "quarrel" with Cage. Ellen Burstyn dancing around in said while mummy. Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not afraid) to walk through the forest, taking off the costume (but leaving the bear's legs), and then Nicholas Cage screamed "Who fired him? Who fired him? Who fired him? Who fired him? Who fired him? I do some karate moves to some villains and you have not lived until you see the last 15 minutes of the movie and its terrible epilogue that looked like it was shot dead in your cousin yesterday. <br /> <br /> No need to say, if you can go through this movie without laughing laugh then you deserve a medal In the film I actually appeared in a movie where I stopped talking and wondering if it might not be complicated to send "hysteria" films ... just to remind myself , if Cage screamed / whispered / whispered to her dialogue that he really took quite seriously, I think this is meant to be a cult movie over and over again ... just because, that it is so terrible.
