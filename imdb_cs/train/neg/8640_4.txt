I was looking at the 3/4 of this movie and I wondered why there were such terrible reviews. It was pretty easy to watch (at 3am). It was good casting - the role of Kevin Dillon of the sociopathic serial killer was very credible - it was both charismatic and cool. The rest of the main characters were not that bad. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. A married couple can not imagine, so they go to a fertility clinic. The sociopathic donor of "genetic material" fixes on the recipient and in a typical stalker form disturbs their life. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the movie was pretty good .. we see that "Conan" grows more obsessed when it educates its child and creates a perfect family with a mother. Of course, things do not work for him as he planned. It's not a bad plot. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were terrible. I'm very tolerant of the movies (especially at 3am!) But I was amazed at how bad the end was written. In fact, I tried to exclude! Overall, this is not the worst movie I've seen, but I could not sit it again (if I did not end up). The only quality she played was Kevin Dillon's role - one of the best serial killers ever. Try to look at other channels before I watch it .. But if nothing better, try to try .. =)
