Kurosawa really threw it out. Every genius is allowed to fail. The concept is fine, but the design is poorly blurred. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fancy fantasy movie. The poverty that hit Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic view. Many of them have interesting stories. Very disappointed film.
