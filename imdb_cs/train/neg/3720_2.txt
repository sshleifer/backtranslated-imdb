Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? It's definitely not a serious thriller? There is no indication that there is any intended humor, but on several occasions bad acting, poor direction, and a terrible scenario laughed at the audience in the cinema. The conspiracy is acceptable - a promising young artist who has reached his peak shot by a killer that he has been mistaken. The killer sees the portfolio of young artists he carries and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the fair, the killer meets the sister of dead artists and eventually falls in love. It's all very predictable and the end will not have anyone guessing because it's so badly written. The film takes place mainly in Vienna, Austria, and shows how beautiful the city is. Do not waste your time on this movie, even though you've been studying how to do it, directly or script the movie!
