A huge hit with an Australian viewer can still be enjoyable today, but its worst political inaccuracy and blunt and clumsy humor can be a bit of a cracer. It takes too long; some contents could be saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie holds his own, desperately needing some new stuff as well. I admit that his occupation Aussie's attitude is funny but also becomes annoying as the film attracts. Some say Crocker's songs are the best and are definitely original, but "funny"? Barry McKenzie's adventure will become a landmark in Australian film, but we should do everything in our power to make sure that the overseas audience does not see most Australians like Barry McKenzies (or Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10
