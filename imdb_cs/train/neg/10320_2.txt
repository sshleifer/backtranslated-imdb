I really hoped it would be a fun show, considering what humor and skilful insights. And to talk about the hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the show at BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world. Unfortunately, this show is not even able to get closer. All the jokes are obvious - those that are just fun when you hear them for the first time, but seem to be chaotic - and do not give them any new treatment or twist. All characters are one-dimensional. Acting is - well - average (I'm nice). It's a classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. If you are a Muslim, I think you would have to be foolish to believe one of the white characters and if you are white, you would probably be somewhat offended by the fact that almost all white characters are portrayed as either fanatical, unconscious, or both. Not that making fun to white people is a problem - most of the better comedies have roots in it. It's just a problem when it's not fun - like in this show. Canada is crawling with funny people - so much so that we regularly export them to Hollywood. So how could the producers not find this show?
