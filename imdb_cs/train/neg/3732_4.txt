Maybe because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this film was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen it since the 7th grade at the Presbyterian School, so I'm not sure what impact it will have on me now. But I say he felt impressed ... and most of my friends. It served this purpose at least until we were older enough and sufficiently informed to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly frightened of what the newly transformed Christian had to endure after suffering had he not received the mark of the beast. I do not want to pamper the film for those who have not seen it, so I do not mention the details of the scenes but I can still see them in my head ... and it was 19 years.
