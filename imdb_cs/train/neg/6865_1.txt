This movie was so bad that it was ridiculous. I could not help him. The story is standard, it is quite horrible (supporting acting, like a neighbor and a friend's lawyer were better actors). It's a little fun if you waste some time and you like to see the end of the drama. <br /> <br /> Headliner, who plays Kathy, was fascinating because I could not decide was the result of a bad operation or just a bad deal (I decided it was both). This leaves the script to comment, which was pretty terrible. Pat remarks, idiotic decisions and ruthless stupidity on the side of every figure in the movie. Perhaps it was what was so boring; I do not know. I just watched how bad it might be. (In fact, the dialogue does not even classify it as a "clich√©" - but it is almost totally unpleasant.) Overall, a very bad and cheap film. Files, the same scenes (house, building) have been shown over and over again without artistic creation or actual connection to action; more like props that were accidentally triggered in a bad game. The Chase scene could have been shot by any youngster in the warehouse or old school: poorly shot, cheap props, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the end. Go find out.
