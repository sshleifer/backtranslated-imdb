Rich Anthony Steffen (like Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochist lover and a British lord. She brings sexy red-haired women to her chateau where she whips and kills them. Black-and-white stripper Erika Blanc (like Susie) will temporarily disappear. Mr. Steffen is persecuted by his wife, Evelyn, who died during childbirth. As a therapist, she decides to take her again after meeting with pretty blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladys). By the end of the movie they will have to dig a few more graves. The "Evelyn Night Out of the Grave" is at least a great title. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
