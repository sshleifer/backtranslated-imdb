Although the story was very detailed and the story was understandable, the fact that the Steven Seagals voice was nicknamed to someone else over most of the film was terrible as he was not sure who spoke. There were many parts where he would speak with a deeply patient voice, and then another voice that spoke to him. I do not know why he would have difficulty in making his film with his voice, I think he could shoot again events that did not contain his own voice when he recovered. Rate this movie 3 of 10 based on movie quality. When you pay for a movie, whether it's in a theater or a DVD, this movie is not worth the entry price that was charged. I have been a longtime follower of Steven Seagal and all of his films he has done in recent years. Today I think it's one of the worst we've ever seen
