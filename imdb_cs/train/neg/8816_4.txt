I saw mommy ... well, she kissed Santa Claus completely; he has his hands on his thigh and thinks bad thoughts. It was enough to emotionally suppress the young boy he wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was disturbed by the quality of the toys he produced and the lack of Christmas spirit. I was expecting a real slasher, that I was very disappointed that fewer than a handful of people were dying and there was no nudity at all. What a bummer. I wanted to like it, but it was too slow and really did not have a good script. I did not expect great acting, but I definitely wanted some action. There was nothing here.
