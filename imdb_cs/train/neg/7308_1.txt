Liongate has not yet proved. Every lionsgate movie was incredible. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities, and they kept squeezing me again and again. And Cabin Fever is certainly no exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of this movie that was so frustrating and bad. Here's a conspiracy. For some reason, Guy cuts a dead dog. It gets infected with a random virus, transfers it to the camp, the children get infected and they die, the city learns about it, and rather than assists them, kills them. then water is infected and everyone dies. end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely slowed down, you do not care about any of them and one kid should be stuck with the boy meets the world. Me and my boyfriend, I found out how to talk about how our classmate's fat and stingy are more fun than paying attention to this movie. We've managed to do it to the end when screaming bulls $ @ t because this movie will do you. <br /> <br /> And I'm still confused by the random slow movement of the karate moves of a random child and as it seems that everyone out there in the country is completely slowed down and killing. And again, why did this dog invade the girl? why did the boy who tried to kill himself sit on a chair and waited for him to kill him? was it part of their plan? Wow. the best plan. I can not believe that this movie was awarded a theatrical release. I could barely stomach on DVD, let alone sit in a theater that does not move an hour and a half. It was not frightening, funny, not cold or anything. it's just a 90-minute loss you could use to ... not know, grow a tree, or something. it's much more productive than this waste. Acting, special effects and script are a joke. Never get it. <br /> <br /> Fever in the cab gets one bad foot shave scene, out of 10
