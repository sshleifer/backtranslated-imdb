Not quite out of the wall, but completely stupid. "Killer Tongue" is a restless mix of sci-fi, horror, and supposed comedy. What makes up for it is a pointless and totally incoherent film. There is very little dialogue, mainly because the scenario, if there was one, is a complete "pond waste". I would not even say it strangely, like "total nonsense." This movie will surely disappoint you and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on it, and if so, the dirty odor will stiffen like rotting fish .......................... ..... ................................ MERK
