I said to myself whether to borrow or not. I'm always afraid to borrow something I've never heard of (I can not remember it in theaters). Great cast ... that's what tilted the scales. 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching it. The first minutes are fun, but incredible. Then it worsens. Writers of this film could do little research on future projects if they want their movies to be even better. Or they would just try to write something a little believable. I'm giving it 3 ... 1 for writing (just because it's words) and 2 for getting so many good actors to agree to make this movie even if they had to read the script. Oh, my god that movie is angry.
