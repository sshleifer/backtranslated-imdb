I gave this movie a rating of 1 (sad). The only reason why he should get 1 big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines, no matter what terrible material he throws his way. Mira Sorvino is so beyond its element that as a viewer simply can not overcome the fact that it is even in such a piece. A silly, stupid story and a terrible production. NEVER use rental video $.
