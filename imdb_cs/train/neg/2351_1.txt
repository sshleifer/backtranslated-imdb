I have no idea how she managed to stay watchful during this show. It was swinging and amateur, the story was old news, and the plot of development (or its lack) always had my eyelids falling less than halfway through each episode. That's about all we can say about it because it really lacked any substance. How do you like people like this? It's stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it ... It's like if some of you have been hopelessly looking at such unsolicited things just because you like the way some actors look or because for any crazy reason you did not see the same patterns in dozens of performances a million times before. I just-- I'll forget it. This show hall and fortunately it's forever. I wish I could get to work on the demolition of O.C. forever.
