Yes, CHUNKY, this is a nickname that romantic lead Donny Reeds played with Tom Drake. So let it be clear now. Since her first ing√©nue role in GET-AWAY (1941), her last DALLAS (1984-1985) Ms. Reed NEVER could be labeled CHUNKY. Not such an attractive and lean actress. Whose role in M.G.M. she seldom lived on her talents. <br /> <br /> Reed is supported by the cast of competent actors, who unfortunately have to fly through this alleged "snail ball" comedy. Clearly M.G.M. was beyond his depth to do this type of film. The better type produced by COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Even the "touch" by Ernst Lubitsch, or the joke from Preston Sturg, could not save the film. A fairly conventional romantic comedy that had all the signs of prewar (WWII) efforts. If Irving Thalberg were still alive, the screen would either have undergone a major change or the daylight had never been seen. It fit into the "safe zone" of Ludwig B. Mayer, where there was no demanding family fun. A form that could not stand in the post-war challenges of DeHavillan's decision, the loss of theater chains, television and contributed to the decline of M.G.M. Perhaps for her Donna Reed the best days that culminated in 1953 and her Oscar win as Best Supporting Actress.
