For Duran Duran's loyal fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this. The producers have decided to become creative and make the film a science fiction story in the 80's, including the evil Barbarella villager from which the band got its name. <br /> <br /> What this idea has failed is that in the midst of some of Duran Duran's 80's songs, confusing and annoying scenes appear to show that a fictitious antagonist tries to stop the band at one of the concerts. Not only is good music repeatedly interrupting, but we have to suffer with some cheap narrative told to the evil Doctor Mario. It's almost too much to wear. 2/10
