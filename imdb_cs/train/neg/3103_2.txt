So there is an old security guard and a dying boy, and then there's KEVIN, the world's biggest shock. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, dirty and virgin girlfriend AMY. When he returns from work to ... a random house ... finds his "friends," the sexually confusing KYLE with a red shortcut and a truly rebellious raptor DAPHNE. Soon Daphne's friend, trigger-happy sex-crazy macho lunkhead NICK, will be joined. And there are title creatures, a spooky little puppet that kills people by giving their hearts a desire. Kyle's heartbeat is to connect with horror, a dirty woman in spandex. Nick's heart longs for throwing grenades in the school canteen - I mean a nightclub. Kevin's heart longs for a whip with a whip. Amy's heart is the desire to be a disgusting bitch. Daphne is a nasty bitch, so he does not have the heart's desire. On the way, a really hideous group is singing a really strange song. Hobgoblini will return to where they came from. "Citizen Kane" can not keep the candle of this real masterpiece of American cinematography.
