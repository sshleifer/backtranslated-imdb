Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" I bought at Walgreens for a big big dollar. I'm still not sure if the dollar was well spent or the dollar stupidly unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Pretty awesome scenes and costumes. There seemed to be a lot of thought and effort in them. The sets are very Mexican in stylization. I really liked it. And Santa is impressive. One of the most impressive Santas in moviedom. I guess the original intent and purpose of this film was something uplifting and cheerful for children. But somehow it will become very frantic. In fact, I am left amazed at how disturbed. Maybe it's English dubbing, which makes it look so upset and bizarre. One of the reasons why I prefer films in the original language that were produced and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives unintended traits. The boy's voices were at least dubbed with real children's voices, very strange compared to the women who looked like children who tend to sound very much. Do you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around the ballet going in their longjohns? Not you? I did not even see this movie. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? Now it's tossup. I can not recommend this to anyone because it is quite disturbing in my own bizarre way. However, its unintentional bizarre is what it is worth watching. You decide what you will do. I do not know ... for me, I felt uncomfortable seeing the demons constantly making cute ballet movements. It's just bad ...
