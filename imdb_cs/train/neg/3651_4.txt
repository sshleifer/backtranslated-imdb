I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with some funny jokes and many that just did not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's offspring. It was confused. It would be much more fun if they only had someone new, instead of Moriarty's resurrected. Some things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very entertaining, as always. McCloud's horse was funny. McGarrett of Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett. Connie Booth is of course very good with accents. She's from Indiana, but she played very well English and New York. Unfortunately, the script did not get much. I was expecting a more entertaining movie. Instead, I have a rather confused bad-script movie. Rather ironic, because Booth and Cleese were together on this. Maybe they were going to split in 77.
