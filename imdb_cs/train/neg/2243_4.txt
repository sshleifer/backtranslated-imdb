This does not require a revision that would be a warning to potential audiences. It's a rather generic ghost story about an actress who captured the studio during the shooting of the dramatic war of World War II. There is no fear, no grief, no surprise. One shocking moment that looks a little foolish to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there are some really nice edits once in a while. The story never gets closer and the movies are really just a full bust. 4/10.
