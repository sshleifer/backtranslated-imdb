I was chasing LIVE YELLOW out of my video store for all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was first confiscated by US customs if she had ever tried to enter the country and was therefore a fan films considered to be "controversial". I had to really see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around young Swedish dramaturgy Lena, who wants to know everything about life. In particular, he wants to focus his attention on creating a document about what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. Asking politicians and ordinary citizens of Stockholm about their views on politics has sex with their dramatic teacher, classmates and married men. What kills me about I LIVE YELLOW is 40 years old it was considered pornographic. Indeed, the sex and nudity of the scene are little and far between, although it is not shot as some cheaply produced porn. While my extreme mind finds it shocking, in fact, sex and nudity are the mainstay of Swedish cinematography. Even Ingmar Bergman, probably their response to the old good boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his movies. I adore the filmmaker that any sex that appears in the film is for artistic purposes rather than just shock people and make money to show up in pornographic theaters in America. I AM LIFE YELLOW is a good film for anyone who wants to study meat and potatoes (without a word game) of Swedish film. But really this film does not have a lot of stories.
