If you read my reviews of Syphy's "Dinosharka," you know I can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these films can make for television broadcasts. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they are still quite entertaining in the "so bad, it's a good" kind of way. So, when I tried to (and recommended) undoubtedly the hokey "Dinoshark," I sat down to look at "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy," SyFy Original Movie about a half man. With access to the SyFy Channel movie for creating B-Movie Creature elements and casting that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could that be wrong? Well, because of my surprise it actually lacks a mark ... not much, but enough not to recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, his titular monster, a feared Hybrid-Humane hybrid, has a backseat on a pile of faux-military heroines who really become the main villain of the movie. Though the hammer is threatened with body counting, he (or what you say) comes just before someone is going and leaving immediately. The rest of the movie is feasible and our heroes are being bombed against the above-mentioned soldiers. It's not just as impressive for me as when I look at a walking hammer, eat people! <br /> <br /> Read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
