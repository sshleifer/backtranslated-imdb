There was no original idea in this story. The themes were extracted from various sources; several of them are the Ninth Gate, In The Mouth of Madness (Another Carpenter's Movie) and The Ring. She even went to the same damn circle of The Ring and used it as a film name tag. The soundtrack Cody Carpenter was picked up from Suspirie. Hopefully, nobody will repulse the word HOMAGE against this commentary. Yes, I saw the theater playing Argento Deep Red. A claim of honor would be a conspiracy. This was the bottom-barrel. Throwing gore and "disturbing" pictures into the pot is not a good horror movie. Carpenter knew it sometimes. He should disappear in secret or get a time machine.
