Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> It's no good reason , why do not I see this movie .... Or so I thought that ......... These people did not JBJ ... <br /> <br /> Why o Why did I forget about it? <br /> <br /> For all the critics, the first half of the film is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There are some intrigue and you feel the scent of horror mingling with the excitement that I realized when I'm watching on movies FAST RIKE, LIKE LOCK STOCK and SNATCH. Kareena Kapoor is very skinny in a very thin model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar, because it can only be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is unpleasant, but a bit funny, you get rid of that you can not understand most of the time. <br /> <br /> Saif is a side ala Main Khiladi .. again. <br /> <br /> There is an occasional laugh and a couple of giggles and several goose bobs during Kareen-Saif's love (Kareen in the rain, behind me in the circle hmmmmmmm). But most likely this half is projected more than it delivers ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> almost jest when this interval came not only because of the wet karen because of what people thought were the things that would come. <br /> <br /> THERE IS THAT we have dealt with mutilation that is difficult to put into words. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and her face enjoys a big body (only girls can notice it and the other boys will notice that the second floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOOR AND ITS SIDEKICS ARE ON YOUR NERVES. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who, to some extent, bears madness, but even after a while becomes intolerant. <br /> <br /> Everyone, if they are presented with one abstention after another. <br /> <br /> !! WHAT??!!! WHEN?!!! WHERE?!!! What I did to do it ... Collective breathing passed through the audience before every song in the second half, which was common even without a movie around her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> THIS FILM IS TO STAY AS A BUZZ THAT MAY CAUSE THE HIGH, WHICH ARE THE FOLLOWING LOSSES AND FOLLOWING FOLLOWING FOLLOWING REMEDIES. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + with Cast, Akshay Kumar, the first half. <br /> <br /> +/- with what, when, how, to what a lot of confusion (we need a book to fill it out). <br /> <br /> A total of 3/10 (I'm trying to avoid 1s and 2s do not seem too extreme but do not make mistakes this movie is indivisible no matter how decent the first half is).
