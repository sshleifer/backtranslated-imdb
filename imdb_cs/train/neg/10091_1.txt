I can not believe that this movie was ever created. I think the director is trying to become an artwork, but it only makes him worse. Zombies seem to use too many eye makeups. Zombies are just in the movie for a few minutes. Finally there are a total of five or six zombies in total, certainly not a nation. The best part of the film, if any, is definitely a credit because the painful experience was finally completed. Repeat more user comments, voodoo priestesses are weird and do not make much sense in the whole movie. There is also a scene with a snake and a Romanesque girl that just does not make any sense at all. It's never explained.
