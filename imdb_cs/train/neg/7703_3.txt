The famous master show will enter the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly he kills him and escapes while the old lady gets a heart attack. The name of the female killer is Sawa. She's always going to school and working for the evil Akai who sleeps with her. One day Sawa finds out he killed his parents .. <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit disappointing gore fest. "Kite" has a style, but it's still rubbish. A strange plot about a teenage girl who kills people as a killer tried to scare and touch at the same time, just causing the story to fall apart. One of the most important events is the action sequence that includes the good / bad hero Sawa along with the bodyguard from the building, but the dramatic structure is not nearly as good, and the director Yasoumi Umetsu is a weird and grotesque animation of the faces of the face is terrible. It's not just that sex sequences are just scary. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3/10
