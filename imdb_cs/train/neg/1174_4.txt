Eric Rohmer's "Lady and the Duke" is based on magazines of the English aristocrat who lived in the French Revolution. But it's a nice affair whose weird, painted backdrops and a controlled conversation tone. Most notably, this portrait of the age of terror takes place almost entirely in one of the real events; one sees very few ordinary people in this film, and only a few of the chaos, poverty and terror that came from the salons of persecuted but corrupt aristocratic classes. The result is often boring and eventually unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive companies on the brink of destruction; it's a disappointed film from a renowned director.
