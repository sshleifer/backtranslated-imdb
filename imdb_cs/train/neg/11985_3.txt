Were you ever eating worms? Here is the "document" that will show you! Yeah ... This guy eats live worms! And that's probably the most interesting part of the movie. This film was pretty well summarized by the previous reviewers as rather dull. I fully agree. The film just does not go anywhere .... if you do not like eating a worm! It's one movie that it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for ... because nothing really happened. Now on the technical side: They should give the baby a haircut. Who's trying to look ... Bozo clown. It was almost funny ... I almost waited for it to turn into a hairy dog ​​or something. Plus; the boy was too difficult to look hungry sometimes! You should keep him from unsolicited food several weeks before shooting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film almost forced me to sleep. And my children could have done about 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. I admit that the country was very impressive. And there was a decent story that could be with it, it could hit it. It seemed safe enough for the children to watch: Bearing scenes and "oddball" eyeballs were too weak to scare most children and the short "skinny" scene showed nothing. I gave this very generous 3.
