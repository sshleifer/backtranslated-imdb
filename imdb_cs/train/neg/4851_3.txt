watch a team of bomb removal experts in Iraq count on the time before they come home. This in itself sounds boring. Each time a little description came out telling us how long they left, it made this film without a conspiracy that would go on and on. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. I have something to miss. I'm a big fan of war films if they're doing well. It had a "jarhead" syndrome. A movie that was sometimes beautifully shot, but cinematography does not prevent it from being totally boring and useless. And he got shot over the slow "gun-based cassette". they could save money and just get out of all the other films with the gun in it. I had no empathy for the main person, always hoping that his ruthlessness would cause him to die. In fact, the film would work much better if it had. I read several reviews and seemed to feel that those in the armed forces did not want it and everyone else loved it. I have never been in power and I am with them. It's a tough disgust. 3 stars are for cinematography.
