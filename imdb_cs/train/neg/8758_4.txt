It was not a movie, but a ritual collection of performances from the acts that were part of the British invasion that followed the dynamic entrance of the Beatles into the musical world. Some of these actions did not make much of a pond on this side of the pond, but many of them. The best are Herman Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and Dakota, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals and of course the Beatles. It's such a fun watching of these young events they chased earlier and polluted their actions.
