This is the case of many people who think they are so smart they have a story that suits the time. Do you remember the ubiquitous political conspiracy captured in the cameras in the years leading up to Watergate and a little later? Most of the films that tried to make money for television so strong, "so nasty" conspiracies were in fact captured in their own view of the view. I've never been a fan of The Conversation that I think is so dated as the other plot, but Coppola was the truth of his main character and Hackman was a pretty nice actor to observe. I think these plot films are mostly drowned in deep heroes. Lots of questions unanswered, a lot of discourse ... But it takes at least Bergman to build a movie about such invisible foundations. Another man is a perfect example of his time: one political soup served with the idealistic character and the dreadful plot that touched him. Neither part is interesting in itself and the whole does not improve. In fact, you can tell how bad it is from the first sequences that could accumulate murders without going on any plot. Pedestrian mode in its worst, like most film, is one pompous accumulation of scenes that turn around the violence that has been naively brought under the audience's eyes.
