Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his own debut, this time it's a laughing movie. During a diving trip, Rome finds the body of blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her legs, as you would expect, wrapped in cement. Rome immediately after the case after being hired by the Waldo Gronsky male mountain. Rome is immediately in danger because it has to investigate some types of mafias who have been turned to him and he is considered the main suspect, he must now continue to run and hope to solve this case himself. Portrait Sinatra is trying hard to sell good-hearted jokes and believe us to be a good detective, oh, not to mention sexual attraction to the liking of Raquel Welch, but in this project, the saber called vanity is disappointed. The frankly mixed smash that surrounds every woman is absolutely stunning, every woman in the movie is a touching head that likes to bend in front of the camera, director Douglas, of course, wants to get close to the cracks of his asss each time flexing their back muscles. It is even a ridiculously cheerful gay figure who claims to be a "real men" movie for "real men" who reaffirm their own flagship sexuality, a shameful shame.
