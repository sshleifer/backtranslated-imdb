Captured this picture on a tube on Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked at the IMDb to find out what the others were thinking about. I was not surprised by the number of stupid people who enjoyed this fluff. But I was surprised when I looked at the comments to read the Hated It category just to see that they did not exist. I was shocked; I always look at the hated is that they are always those who hate the movie no matter how good it is. Somehow this film got over unharmed hated, I say it and I deeply report that I hate this movie! I know I should go into the details of why I hate this movie, but I will only pay more attention than it deserves.
