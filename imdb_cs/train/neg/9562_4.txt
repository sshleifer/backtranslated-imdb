I think it could be a decent film and some of its parts are fine ... but overall it's movie B. The same goes for the plot, the parts are fine, but it has several openings and peculiarities that do not quite look like. The activity is mostly fine, I've seen it worse. :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... From here it gets a little better, but it's too much. <br /> <br /> If you borrow it, add more and use it as a warm up. Keep expectation low and it can work for you as well.
