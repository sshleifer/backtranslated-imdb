This movie was so predictable that all the time you hope the obvious suspect is innocent, yet there is another big turn. However ... it is not. He continues to talk creepy and still ignores it. Mary found a lot of evidence in her place and still trusted him? And what was it like a "bait of traps"? There was no trap there. She confronted him, said, "excuse me, I have to go kill somebody." He left, and it was over. Trying to use other suspects (as in one older carnival girl at the end), but they are totally underdeveloped. In fact, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth and setup is just weird ... who hangs in the recycling plant? Her tearing and nothing is well developed. For example: When he leaves his place for beer, he finds photos and runs out and he catches her and they end up in sex in that car ... what was that? Her reactions were not portrayed. She was afraid of the car as if it were practically rape - but then we only see that she is showering the next morning. booooooooo It could be much better .. so much better.
