(aka: TRINITY IS ALWAYS MY NAME) This sequel looks like it was done to make the excellent European box-office success THEY CALL ME TRINITY, only this time Joseph E. Levine and the Avco-Embassy pictures wanted to use America too . It's a shame they did not get too far because the Hill / Spencer paintings in the US have little success and this very boring, exhausted movie does not help. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful offenders and will take care of themselves. They later deal with arms dealers who smuggle weapons from the monastery and who mistakenly think they are a pair of federal agents. Everything falls apart across several fun scenes, especially when Trinity and Bambino are in a fantastic French restaurant and do not know how to go. And the shark-card scenes were also slightly humorous. The original title music sung by Gene Roman sounds like Bobby Goldsbor's fair singing, which took place in the 1970s, while the musical cues posed throughout the movie are pretty good. I'm not sure if I want to buy a CD soundtrack, but some others maybe. The film could have been empty for half an hour and it would not be so long. It looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in it about 2 / 3rds. The DVD is also terrible, with constant mud in the soundtrack and bad print that seems to be sent to that big landfill in the sky. A big step down from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
