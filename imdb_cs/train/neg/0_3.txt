The story of a man who has unnatural feelings on a pig. It starts with an introductory scene that is an amazing example of an absurd comedy. The formal orchestral audience is transformed into a crazy, violent crowd of crazy singer singers. Unfortunately, it remains absurd all the time without a general narrative that ultimately makes it just too far. Even those of that time should be turned off. Encryption dialogue would make Shakespeare a seemingly simple third grader. At a technical level, it's better than you think of some good cinematography of the future great Vilmosa Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest are briefly seen.
