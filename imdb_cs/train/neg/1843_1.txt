Wow. Just terrible. I was a fan of the original film, and I was absolutely seated in part 2, 3 was better and better. 4.5 and Freddy's dead were bad. But nothing is as bad as Freddy's nightmares. Freddy behaves like Rod Serlingesq native to this series of anthologies. I can accept Freddy becoming one section after another, but at least in films, Freddy brought the films, but here they were so badly made, they looked like the high school productions of the horror series. Poor actors if you really want to say that after this performance, it was obviously exactly what they paid. I'm pretty sure it's a stop for two types of actors. Those who are just starting out on the Hollywood ladder are totally willing to take some part that would blame the fact that they had to take the porn they offered to them last week or the actor on the Hollywood ladder that I had to take the porn the work they offered last week. I expected Dana Plata to be a guest star, but she was already dead at the time of production. <br /> <br /> <br /> To paraphrase the Nancy Line at the original Elm St, "what are you trying to do not follow this."
