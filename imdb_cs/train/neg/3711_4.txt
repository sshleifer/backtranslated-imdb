I did not see a movie trailer when I went to see the movie, instead I based my judgments on the views of my friend. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls on the face. <br /> <br /> During the movie Rock brings some funny jokes, but unfortunately the film is very comic. The film looks like it wants to integrate laughter and love into one, and that it tries to fail. The love story in the movie is directly bent (fortunately), but it's made worse by its filming that rock is serious and insignificant. After all, the film is primarily designed as a comedy where the main sense may be. It does not have much in the movie. <br /> <br /> The complete plot is also totally uninteresting. Some parts were totally discontinuous. If it was funny, they definitely did not do a good job. A couple of angels from heaven tried to make a few jokes that were dry and boring. The first couple of incarnation rock rock rock was also dull. If this is one thing, they did it right, but they made Rock look better by comparing it.
