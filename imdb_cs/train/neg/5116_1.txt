I chased this movie today when I thought it might be a good football movie because I'm a big fan of football. Boy, I was wrong. This film is too religious and preached and is really unrealistic. This movie says to a large extent that if your Christian gets everything you want in your life easily, like becoming a great football player! You will not become a great football player by becoming a Christian and asking God, you will do it with practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and give you everything ... puh-lease. This is not true, the spirit. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only part that was funny was when they were stupid (Shultz cartoonist - no, the volley who flew over the Atlantic, etc.) But really this movie was not so great. I do not recommend this, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
