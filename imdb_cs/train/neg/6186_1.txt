There is a spill. Susannah Yorke is a bright young Jane Eyre and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35. White-haired George C. Scott looks and behaves like arthritis 80. Jane's dead uncle is in better shape! Wailing and jerking, disgusting and cruel. He looks like a murderer who sent his ax to get it sharpened; we are not surprised to hold a woman in a cage in the attic! The big love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is a lot of darkness in the novel, but Bronte Rochester is relatively young, athletic, strong and charming when he chooses to be. He has great talk and singing, good reason and conscience that unsuccessfully tries to suppress.
