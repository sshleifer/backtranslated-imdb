For the first few seasons I thought Apprentice was a very entertaining and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week interview for employees was innovative and the show's producers managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out". The new season 6 is nothing but a big joke and has nothing to do with the business - at all. In earlier seasons, they have put much more emphasis on trade-related tasks - now they focus mainly on the meeting room, where competitors are expected to do ALL to keep them on show (that is, lying, backstabbing, etc.). The meeting room can be fun, but it's fun at a low point. Sometimes you're wondering if you're staring at Jerry Springer's old episode. The show's performances are extremely boring and mostly a show of companies that are stupid enough to pay NBC for publicity. And as for half of the contestants living in tents in Season 6? It's just stupid and has nothing to do with real-life business. <br /> <br /> This season I have absolutely no respect for some of the contestants, they all seem like idiots. In the past, at least some of the contestants had some integrity, now it seems that the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on show. It also seems that Donald Trump's massive ego is getting bigger and bigger for every season that's going through and honest, I do not know why someone with a common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the conference room usually makes no sense at all, and sometimes it seems he just wants people to throw away for what's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. Please NBC, for God's sake, release the show as soon as possible. It's embarrassing to watch. The disciple was one great TV show, but now it's just a big joke.
