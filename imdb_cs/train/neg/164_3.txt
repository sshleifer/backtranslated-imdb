I'm not a huge fan of Star Trek, but I was looking forward to it. I was impressed by the preliminary descriptions of the Enterprise, its cramped submarine, and the rough-edged technique compared to the Trekmy we're used to. I did not see anything that would be of interest to this pilot. I have found that the plot is complicated and confusing. I admit that I liked some character development - the concepts of people as "adolescent" species that are ready to overcome their pieces were fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> But I do not think I'm going to love this series. <br /> </ p> <p> 3/10
