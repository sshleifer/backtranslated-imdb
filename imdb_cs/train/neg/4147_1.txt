I'm a passionate fan of scary movies, all sweet and pretty funny is my game. So imagine my spirit that I went to a local shop and found vampires vs. zombie. The name is just too fun, you know that nobody in the world can pull something like this, it just has to be bad. And boy, it's bad. Looking at this horrible film, I did not speak literally. Me and my friend sat outside without talking for a few minutes, and we both thought about the future of our lives after watching this movie. I interrupted the silent silence with the words: "... man ... What?" Yes, I'm a fascinating individual. <br /> <br /> It's a quick 'street review'. There is no "WTF" mode at all. Characters; No development, forgetting. Music; Worse than porn. Vampires; Their vampires? Zombie; Their zombies? Eventually; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, it's so bad I want to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and get into depression.
