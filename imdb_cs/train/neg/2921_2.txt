The story is about a genealogical researcher (Mel Harris), who is hired by Queen Estee Lauder for her aunt. Her aunt (a marriage that we have to assume) is trying to trace her long lost family in Europe. All she has to go on is a photo of a young girl standing under a decorative music box. The researcher heads to Europe and searches in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. Scenery is a real thing and is actually shot on the scene (unlike the murder, she wrote where Jessica is going to visit the remote setting and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, he meets a young man who also tries to solve his own family secret, and they try to find traces and threaten bad guys. Dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I was looking at it because of the scenery, but the script was so bad that I only stayed to see if it would get worse. Oh yes. The activity was also off. I can see why Mel Harris's career has never been clear after thirty, but is adequate (she seems too old for her star). But the helper players are directly from the community theater. I also lost the number of times they called each other "Budapest". Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, all right? I realized that it would happen to the film that it must be one of the Harlequin films, and that's enough. I guess it says everything.
