for a lot of time I was looking forward to seeing this movie, here in Latinamerica japanese or some oriental films have no distribution in theaters, we find some of these movies in some underground shops, and I just found Avalon, I was waiting for something good but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene, the rest of the film is boring and absurd, just stupid, with many useless scenes and a boring story. I'm wasting my time and this movie. Sorry, but it's true.
