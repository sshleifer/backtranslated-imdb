For a series of fans, I must admit that the Hidden Border is not bad at all. But viewing this series can not be based on whether it's a fan series or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity also. I think they are people with ordinary work and great enthusiasm for Star Trek. But you do all this work. Removing all of these resources. All the time, and yet all the mistakes. <br /> <br /> First, the actors and the lines are terrible. For the most. Dialogues belong to the 70th Military Exhibition, not Star Trek. The Captain (Mr. Squinty) seems to be ready to mix at any time. And most characters just read their lines. Directors should be aware of the fact that "retake" is not a word in the dictionary. But I also think the series is made in "Two Takes Frakes," which directed many episodes and films by TNG. I also could not help, but I thought most of the actors were typical Trekkies. Without getting deeper into this assumption. <br /> <br /> My greatest concern about the whole project is the quality of the release. When they first decided to devote so much time and money to this series - why did they not do it in high quality? Using a low-resolution, fast format is a loss of talent. Even the "higres" episodes are considered poor quality compared to the standard ranges of quality that are issued. Using the Xvid encoder with higher resolution and file size would greatly improve this experience. If the problem with the band was a problem, setting this torrent tracker would solve it. Let's hope that the crew will decide to improve the series and hopefully release it on DVD, which gives it the quality of the project it deserves.
