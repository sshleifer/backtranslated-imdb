Hunters catch what they think is a forest, even if the audience sees them as a werewolf. The hunters never realize it, because after shooting, it looks normal when they are desecrated. The doctor moves the eyes of the werewolf to a man who has lost his own in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, gets sex with his sister (Stephanie Beaton) before even getting bandages. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he finds out that his wife also cheated on him. When the smoke machine sends the clouds around the amateur painting of the moon (with a fake tree branch in the foreground), it turns into a werewolf! His fuselage grows, split his shirt, and grows on his head a huge werewolf mask that has red light in his eyes. His trousers remain intact. The mouth chewed unconvincingly, although some robotics (or hidden hands) in his eyebrows gave him a nasty look in times. Despite the bad werewolf clothing, there's plenty of blood and gore, and they're pretty well done. There is even quite good decapitation later in the movie. However, when a person falls from a height, he does a rather bad mannequin. Rich has a friend named Siodmak, who is an occult expert, and also accidentally encounters a small man with a crutch named Andros, who is also such an expert. He's trying to help him a little bit. <br /> <br /> The rich kills people who have badly done it. The policeman is investigating the murders and is trying to hit Beaton, who does not care too much about the lesbian scene, so nothing is wrong. <br /> <br /> Quite cheap, but between nudity and blood and gore and no-story, which combines (most often) the safest game with the oranges and the wolf's hands, it's somewhat fun. Available separately or in a box Scream Queens Vol. 1.
