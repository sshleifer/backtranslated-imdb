I'll bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore have agreed in advance how many episodes they want to appear. Is not Gene too attractive to go into the women's team and then throw herself on her sword? And a big pussy? What the hell was that "look at me, I'm a rat!" double episode crap? All these cliché mafiánů try - COME ON! The big names that voted for have happened that they have already received money for their charity and got their own order. Hmm ... This is not a reality, but a theatrical performance! Mark Burnett's next show "Survivor" has also raised a question for me when Johnny Fairplay goes out when he has a clear time before his baby is born. Yuk!
