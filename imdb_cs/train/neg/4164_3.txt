<br /> <br /> What's left of the planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving surviving rag-tags. They have to eat insects and insects, or what after the war poison, or something, almost destroys the entire human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth who are still able to live in comfort, we call him "All knowing big boss," has a great deal of effort to prevent some secret seeds from spilling into the air. It seems that everyone knows the big boss is the last person on Earth who knows that these spores even exist. Spores are far from any living soul and are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> All leading big boss wants secret disputes to stay in secretly protected containers. So he does the plan to send in the macho action team to remove the contingency containers from all protection systems and secret positions. Sending people to secret spores is no longer a secret. Sending people to turn off all protection systems allows spores to be easily released into the air. What about sleeping dogs like that? <br /> <br /> One of the pleasant features of ENCRYPT is the vibrant and elegant Vivian Wu. Since the extraordinary members of the macho action team look with mechanically predictable timing, Vivian Wu's engagement is acceptable when it comes to the fact that her old employer so wished. She is the object of love, a subject of desire - a very credible concept! Vivian Wu fans may want to try out an excellent B-movie, which has been the last couple of years called DINNER SPOCH. DINNER RUSH is recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
