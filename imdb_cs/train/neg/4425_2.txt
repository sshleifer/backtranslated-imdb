The film about Renaissance Harlem and specifically one author. It contrasts with a modern story about young, gay, black artists. If it sounds vague, it's because the movie is alone. He is well-controlled, relatively well written and, for the most part, well acting. Also, scenes in the past are shot in a moody black and white. Also, this is one of the few films that deal with homosexual men who DO NOT encourage sex scenes (not so explicitly and without fronts). Still, I hated it most of the time. The film is filmed all over the place, filled with incompetent characters (including the main protagonist) and (it's a killer) moving at the speed of the snails. Three times I was considering leaving the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His spoken poetry shows that it was the work of love and lasted for 6 years. I really would like to enjoy more (there are very few films honestly dealing with homosexual blacks), but I can not. If you're not interested in Harlem Renaissance, there's no reason.
