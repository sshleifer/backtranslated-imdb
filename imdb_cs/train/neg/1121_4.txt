During the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic who sleeps without lingerie, fantasizes about killing his roommate, trying to steal a magazine from a newspaper stand and longing for the cold young man he meets with the station. And he's the hero of this senseless movie that's dressed everywhere (except Krabbe in at least one scene too much), but he has no place to go. The basic plot is very simple, but it is stretched for almost two hours to reach the unnecessary conclusion. Verhoeven has nice visual perceptions but captures scenes of wild hallucinations, obvious symbols, and hopeless gore when he breaks out of ideas.
