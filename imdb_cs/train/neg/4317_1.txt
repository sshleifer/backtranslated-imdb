My husband found this film very schlocky. It started well, but quickly it was incredible and ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor except Abbie's girl, which was really amazing. Furthermore, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon, Angel. Also, without giving up anything when one of the characters has a tragedy, it almost looks like a nonchalant. At first we thought it was a "shock," but then we realized it was just a terrible scenario. We love almost all Hallmark films and their stories about heart warming, but this film does not cover the opportunity to be one. There are so great - do not waste time with this terrible movie.
