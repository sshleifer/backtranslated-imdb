I had great hopes for this film. I thought this assumption was interesting. I caught it, even though I found acting besides Helena Bonham Carter, incomprehensible. For a long time, I was hoping to repay my time, but in the end I had to wonder why they even bothered to do it. Perhaps the George Orwell version is a message that is worth it to be possible. If this movie did something, it inspired me to read Orwell's classics. I think it's hard to believe his story may be as unsatisfactory as the adaptation. If the filmmaker's report is "a worldly life worthwhile living", well, then they succeeded. I would not recommend this film to anyone; 101 minutes of my life unnecessarily.
