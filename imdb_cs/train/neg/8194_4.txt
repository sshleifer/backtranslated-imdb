How hard is writing a traceable movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? It seems to me that it is very difficult for the writer. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays BIG brother). I had to miss this part of the story, but it really did not matter. Many scenes seemed to be in place and devised; such kind of "funny imagery" scenes that are drugs out of WAY ​​too far where there is some sense of comedy is lost. The director / producer attempted to go "slz jerker" at the end, which would be appropriate if nothing that led to this point was worth it. <br /> <br /> Ugh, great disappointment. I see how some people can look forward to it OK because many people take all the garbage that they get into the feed but I'd like to wait for this on DVD. It's not worth the $ 23,978 you need to get your family into movies these days.
