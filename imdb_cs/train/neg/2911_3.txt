This film is exaggerated, predictable, demanding and hollow to its core. The settings are a faithful era, but they are conscious during their extended exposure. The persistent artifacts stop the action and make up almost the same as the empty dialog. Tom Hanks seems to be in as much sleep as Bruce Willis did in the Hart war. Tom, you can not put the depth of the character simply by making you empty! The content did not guarantee Paul Newman's histrionic action. It is a mud packed in the shell of an atomic bomb.
