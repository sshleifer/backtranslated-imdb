Another "son who does not grow up" and just other similar records. Heder in another bad wig, leading Napoleon, huh? Anna Faris is forgotten, as always; Jeff Daniels phoned that from another state; and Diane Keaton ... how would someone become a partner in her career? Do not bother. Nothing is said here, which has not been covered many times. I will say it; it's about a hundred times better than "Failure to Run". In the movie there are very few funny pieces if you think Eli Wallach's curse is funny. Ha, Ha! He's old and killed a f-bomb! Tee, hey, hey. Jokes!
