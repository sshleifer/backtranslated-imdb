In my Lit. the class we just finished, Hatchet and this movie is nothing like a book. (1) Brian has never done worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother cheated on her father in a tent car, not in a forest where anyone could see. (4) A man who cheats his mother does not have black hair, has a blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the film: (1) A thirteen-year-old man can not fist his fist through a window in one strike. <br /> <br /> And for playing, the guy who played Brian was a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> I believe the scenery was impressive, though I doubt the director even read the book. This movie is good if you have not read the book by Hatchet, Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start a complaint to the director.
