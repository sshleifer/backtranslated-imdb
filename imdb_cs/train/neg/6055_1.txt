I originally received this two-episode episode - now I want to think more about it. I also wish they had negative ratings. <br /> <br /> I watched and I was surprised how poor the whole thing was from beginning to end. I love Ron Pearlman and John Carpenter ... so what happened? Last season 13 was dragged out because of the way it handled the problem of abortion. I think this year Mr. Carpenter has done something so gray that you can not see immediately whether he is a pro-choice or an abortion. Only after I sat down and thought that I realized she was very abortive - he gets the most out of it when the "mother" shoots a child and kills him, except to the fright of "father" who goes to the dungeon and leaves his mother undamaged. But you also see this in the way he treats the character of Ron P. - I hardly think that if someone in the past faced the threat of being in danger of having a restrictive order against him to immediately disobey the police. Instead, we have a guardian who almost balances him (he only pays), does anyone mind having a strong look at something, though it is not something I agree with, but I think it is that it would seem to be sitting somewhere in the middle. But political problems aside, this episode was out of the poor. The music was retro-70 and just did not work. The effect (other than Ron P.) was bad. The effects were scary - maybe it would be better if you did not show a monster at all than to show how powerful the monsters are. having Masters of Horror does not matter when I'm sitting in really bad episodes and finding the good ones. It's a little bit like lending horror films from a video rental shop - you'll always be able to do it, and it's all worth it. I agree with the poster who said the name must change from the Masters - some of these people simply do not deserve the title. (Let me emphasize - even the fact that I hated this episode, John Carpenter TOTALLY deserves a title, is a master and over)
