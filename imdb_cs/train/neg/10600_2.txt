I will be honest. The only reason I've watched TV is that it's at the bottom of the IMDb 100. And right now, I wonder if half an hour really worth another check on the same list. > <br /> <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself in a huge fight with universal soldiers after the main computer has pulled the HAL to defend himself. And yes, after all mandatory explosions, shots and persecution is the last. Combined with a terrible actress and a bit of a dull setup, he made sure he was a place on the infamous list. Just for those idiots like me who want to watch the entire list. 2/10.
