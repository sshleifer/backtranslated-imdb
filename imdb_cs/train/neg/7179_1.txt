No matter how well his "message" is - this movie is a terrible train - a terrible actor, lame camera - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to get a stutter - it's miserable. You look at DVD bonuses and the way the camera watches it - just dries it - loves being the focus of attention. He's a bad actor - reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker Eric Schaffer. Some, as Carr has shown this film at New Age City and New Age churches - where the injured people looking for reinforcement and attention are talking about how the film touched and it may have happened - but as the film itself is jerky, sappy .
