I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a Miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer just joking with the audience: "Let me see how much emptiness you can keep (the audience)." Dialogs are empty, ... the scenario is minimalist. In a few moments, photography is really nice. Several sarcastic lines are half funny, but during this "comedy" it's hard to really laugh. I laughed myself that I could watch the movie for the rest of my life. If you can rise above the director's fiasco, we will find the good acting of several legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and the very good performance of Emir's son, Stribor Kusturica. In short: too bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should be the best of the movies. Instead, he decided to make this low-budget just-for-my-private theatrical film with an arrogant attitude to world trends and negligence towards his old fans.
