You know it will be a joking movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. It has been done 50. 2. It's in black and white. 3. Does not have an actor name! 4. Screaming makes a lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, that's not overcome - this movie has gloriously incorporated all four elements above to make it a true cinematic error. <br /> </ p> <p> Okay-shhhhh, but we're going to discuss special effects-or their deficiency-you captured underwater scenes? It looks like it was badly shot by an aquarium - to note that the hood is drowning in the breeze. And repeated reuse of the Stock Footage, (the exterior of the home, scene bridges - greatly enhanced the KRAF-Tiness of this film - not from "PLAN 9" - I saw the creative use of stock records and hey where there was a lack of special effects - do not worry - instead of this special effect in this movie Yes, this movie even cleverly used this old hack trick. <br /> <br /> Grab popcorn - set the brain to stun (several fermented beverages DEFINITELY helps) sit down and wonder why that damn gave the movie again? Wayno <br /> <br />
