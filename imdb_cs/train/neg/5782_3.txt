The Lesbian Vampire film about a couple on holiday who remain based on what they think is an empty castle, but is really used as a pair of lesbian vampires. As vampires bring occasional sacrifices, couples go about their business until the two groups break down. <br /> <br /> A great-looking film with two very sexy women like vampires is nothing for eye candy, recommend this cultured movie. Yes, it's a sexy vampire story. No, it's not interesting outside of women. To be honest, the reason I saw the details of this movie in horror books and magazines looks great, but besides ... <br /> <br /> For those who want to see only sexy vampires.
