This movie is a good example of how to destroy the book in 109 minutes. Except for character names, the film is very similar to a book. A book full of strong Latin characters, and for the most part not Latin. There is no development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate characters. And removing the full generation is unjustifiable. Isabel Allende wrote a powerful book and the book is what should be read!
