In a movie like this I expected it would be nothing fun except that I was killed ..... what I got was even less. Christmas Eve 1947 is a child witness to parents who do it while Dad has a Santa suit. He runs horribly up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later, and Harry Stalling is your regular everyday joe ... he waited for being obsessed with Santa. After his boss makes fun, he goes mad, dresses like a santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and his boss. An incomprehensible neighborhood caught up with him, and just as they were going to burn it, he drives his van from the cliff ..... into the moon. It's not the best end I've ever seen, but it was original. It was a slow, boring film that really did not have any redeemable quality, except when Harry went to church visitors. Hardly any gore and even "sexual" scenes were weakened. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 of 10
