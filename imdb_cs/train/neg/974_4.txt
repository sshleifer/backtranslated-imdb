This movie sounded as if it were fun and interesting from his description. But it was a bit kidnapped for me. Very slow and hard to follow and see what's going on. It was as if the filmmaker took pieces of the film and threw them in the air and let them join together, whether they landed (definitely not in sequential order). Also, nothing was made of any consequence. I looked at several different Korean films and noticed that the good part is well made and requires some idea of ​​the viewing area that differs from the typical Hollywood movie. But he could not finish me. I saw the second and third films and still did not do anything to me. I still do not understand what the filmmaker was trying to say. If it was only to show a typical secular part of human life, I think he did it. But I was looking for more. No need to say that I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
