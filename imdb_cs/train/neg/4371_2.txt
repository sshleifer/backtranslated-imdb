After leaving the popular Andy Griffith Show, Don Knotts and his film stars attempted a famous series of enemy but mature-comedy cars. Unfortunately, a "reluctant astronaut," shot at cheap (like most Knott films), is much worse than others. Don plays a small bourgeois schnook he takes to the Astronaut training camp ... but not as a space trip candidate - they want him as his new guardian! Some may say that weak satire is capitalizing on the then fresh Americans fever for the new technological age, but that is really little justification for restless kids to be occupied. It comes from a good start, with OK setting and nostalgic locations, but it becomes more and more spiritless and idiotic. * z ****
