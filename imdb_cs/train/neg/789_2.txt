five minutes after I watched, I signed up to IMDb to warn you not to bother with this movie ... genre: horror? he had a moment of gentle tension and I thought about myself all the time "Something must happen soon" it was not ... when the film ended I felt so embarrassed for the writer / director I was never the biggest fan Patrick rea this guy just did not know , how to make movies, and following this justifiable justification of horror movement, which I was not the greatest fan of, who would not watch another of his works. <br /> <br /> I was taken in a summary of the events, please do not make the same mistake. I gave this movie 2 to the actors ... they were not bad and there was no mistake they got wrong ...
