I would do it 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed. The story was poorly developed, for example Incidents were too short and short, for this reason it was not morally clear. I thought Brenda Song did a great job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have difficulty solving his role. I saw that there was a need to include western elements in the show, but there were certain parts where the Chinese elements were also needed! A villain for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot instead of something of Chinese culture. The ultimate and worst mistake was the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the show. Others may point out that this is a "Children's Show", and therefore there is no need for such high standards. But there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which were much better in story development and presentation. In conclusion, I think Disney movies should be better explored and better planned. A good show is not enough with a variety of martial arts moves that will have to be relied upon.
