I tried to really enjoy this movie. When I watch, all I think is, "This guy gives me my lungs, I'd get the limitation order." It also calls for encoding with capital letters. Was it really an interview before filming? "Make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially awkward people into a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain how bad their lives are!" From what I've seen in my life is that the last thing we find attractive on our ground in a potential partner is a constant self-deception. <br /> <br /> The film's mood is clearly 80-ish; slowly and slowly. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, just a few of them.
