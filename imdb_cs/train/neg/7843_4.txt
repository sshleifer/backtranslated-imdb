This is a slight follow-up: it lacks the interest and light touch of a magnificent "man called horse" in almost every respect, and hardly seems the same genre compared to the others. <br /> <br /> The return is almost the first parody and attempts to evoke various Indian ceremonies, but he encounters how he tries too hard to fill the spell of the first. In this movie, the tribe is lost and abandoned when it lost its homeland, modern life hit paradise and live in desperate misery and poverty. Maybe this is: the first film has brought us to a place where we would like to be, a simpler time. This brings us to the broken Indians in the miserable world, and the White Man is a hero and a savior who rather dispels the whole idea of ​​the film. The beauty of the former consisted of the fact that the white man had learned and found that real civilization is more of a value than Western materialism. In the second film, it's all missing, so we'll end up with a weak film. Great disappointment.
