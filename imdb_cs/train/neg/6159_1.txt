Why is everyone who has seen this film feel that it is their duty to say whether they are swordsmen? This point is absolutely irrelevant as to any argument that should be raised against this whole dog of the film. I think sports movies fall into two categories; well-written films about human spirit and competitions and "Swords". Frankly, this film has never been able to decide what it wanted to be, a touch drama for trying to be the best in life, accusations of competitive motivation or martial arts. In the end, he did not make any of those convincingly or completely enough to give me an ounce of care for one of them. I'm also a fencing instructor for the record (and now I'm officially just as bad as the others). But putting the wrong fence into the movie does not mean it's wrong automatically. I mean Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, Good Movies, Bad Fencing). I like the movies. But if for some reason you bring bad sports to a bad movie, people think they're just purists who think it's a lame effort. Do not be fooled by any comments on the smaller fencing theme. That's just a bad movie. Ultimately, this film has nothing for fans for swordsmen or film fans, or just for everyone with pulse and three brain cells. When I see the movie and I have to think, `Man, I wish I was watching the Powerful Ducks. "I know it's time to embrace the argument with the theater manager to get the money and find out if someone is in the lobby that will give me some time back two hours of my life.
