This loss of time is a totally unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing other than the original is added to Perry's backflashes, which are marginal. It misses the documentary feeling of the first film and the cruel urgency that made it so effective. There is also a painful Quincy Jones' soundtrack, which has added a lot to the original movie. I can not understand any high rating for it at all. It is bad. Why is someone losing time or money doing this bullshit, and why did I throw the time to watch it?
