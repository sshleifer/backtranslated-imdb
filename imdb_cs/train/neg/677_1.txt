I'm afraid to think what people have to think about ecologists after they have looked at this piece of exaggerated, preaching of cinematographic waste. Even before the star starts, Starlight will have a cocktail that anyone who dares damnation to the planet will look like a feather who wears a crying cunning idiot. ? Alien Rae Dawn Chong comes to lead a model of flute underwear in a mystical effort to avert the impending collapse of the environment. But first he has to defeat an evil stranger who does not look like a refugee from Castro Bar Street. Luckily, they have a mystical grandfather, Willie Nelson, to help (who seems to be a bit embarrassing, just like it should be) along with cheap F / X shovels and the shooting of unnecessarily dull music. <br /> <br /> Of course, the clumsy script helps cover the movie trite plot and the staggering tempo, but it's just the tip of this melting film glacier. Anyone interested in this film should withdraw their association until it completes the true course of science.
