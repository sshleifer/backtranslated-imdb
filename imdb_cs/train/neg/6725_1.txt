What could be a study of a stimulating and emotionally charged character is a completely predictable factor. Fox is fine as Nathaniel Ayers, a trained musician, Julliard, who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Orchestra until his schizophrenic bouts escape into the street and eventually disappear. Looking for a good story to support his career, reporter Steve Lopez (Robert "rehab" Downey) knows him and tells his story. If we take every element of the classic "how we get into the slides" of movies, we borrow very liberally from the "beautiful mind", take a fake "feel good" stance of movies like "Rocky" - choose a sequel number - a lot of melodrama in the 1930s style, what is left on the screen is the burned film shell. It's ugly, sad, completely predictable and plays too often on our views. I hate to say this, but this is the movie that, if you say you hated it, people give you a bad look. I really want to say something positive about this movie, but I really can not. His acting will buy it a little, but it's not enough to give him more than one star. Strictly made for film films. It is not worth your time.
