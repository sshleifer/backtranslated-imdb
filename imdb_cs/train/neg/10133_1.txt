If you are not mentally ill or die the hardest segal fan you will bother this horrible excuse for the film in less than 5 minutes. Plot - Even for Seagal, the conspiracy is simply stupid. I think it's not just bad, barely continuous. Acting - Incredibly wooden. They have literally seen better acting in porn. Ironically, this movie is trying to raise money for this audience, a "lesbian love scene," which is absolutely enormous. Special effects - they would not lose their sixties sword and sorcery. <br /> <br /> If you do not lose insomnia and exhaust all other treatments, do not make the same mistake as I bought and bought this DVD because you will ask for this hour and a half of your life back.
