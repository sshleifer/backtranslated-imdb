The film was shot in 1942 and around the Second World War, the film industry decided to use the spies around. The movie is fun to watch with Eleanor Powell's beautiful dances. Late Miss Powell was certainly a great swing in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young look by Red Skelton. Two of them also starred in "I Dood It." Moroni Olsen, three years later, was excellent when the investigating police officer in Mildred Pierce again appeared as an officer, subject. The problem is that Olsen and his rogues are really Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self and he gets rich support from Virginia O'Brien.
