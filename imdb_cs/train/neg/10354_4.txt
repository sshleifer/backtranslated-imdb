I went through Netflix and came across this movie. I had beautiful memories of the book as a child, I decided to check it out. This is the movie you really should transfer. <br /> <br /> It is not worth seeing. It's very boring and uninteresting. I feel like it will be for the little ones. There is no magic that the book contains. This movie is not horrible, but you just find yourself in it for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that just happen to be strange. The character of the witch is not very good. The family behaves as if it were not a big deal that these strange things happen. I know it's a kid's film, so as an older audience we can not look too deep in things, but the whole movie feels it has been written and produced by people who have never had any previous filming experience. <br /> <br /> The DVD I started jumping in the last moments of the movie and instead of fixing it, I turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I really did not care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book instead.
