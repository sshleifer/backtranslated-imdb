This is even worse than the original Death game. An upset, incoherent story leads to Billy Lo falling from the helicopter down and killing him as we leave to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So, not just starting with a clone Bruce Lee, the movie will kill it and another thirty minutes to the story. The main reason you look at this moment is when Bobby Lo fights with the left, which of course is a lion in the costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also a villain, who is usually quite amazing, but his screen time is quite small. Above all, they watched this and the original Death game as they are part of the Bruce Lee boxing set. No wonder they are part of Lee's finished works. No one would buy them otherwise.
