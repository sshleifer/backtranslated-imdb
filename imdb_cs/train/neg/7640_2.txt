Basically, I found that Eden's curve is very poorly constructed, so it's hard to see. But there is something to be said about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in choosing settings and clothing. The "back to earth" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that were not dramatically decadent, as described in many later versions of the 1970s, were true, as well as "Do not Ask" Pseudo-Liberal Brotherhood of Intellectuals on the East Coast, with the difference being that I think it's probably a new English school than one in Virginia, where I imagine that the "good boy" mentality still dominated even the elitist schools one. Another thing that I appreciated and could relate to is that it was a time when homosexuality was not associated with so many leather or tattered queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles unrelated to these terribly exaggerated images. I felt very unhappy that "gay culture" came from Castro and Christopher Streets in the 80s of the last century into some standard forms that defined the movement and left a huge number of homosexuals who were suppressed in their lifestyle. I prized the movie mainly as a way to remember the more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without a "scene".
