Let me begin by saying that I saw this film as part of the agreement. I was really boring one day in 1997, so I fought for a movie rental business. I asked the official what the worst film he had in stock. He hesitated me to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he was giving up the $ 1 payment fee (he said it would be bad to charge more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So watch that I did it for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God - enormous. I do not need to go into details of the plot, read more reviews. Jokes do not make sense. The game was terrible. I know it's supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. You can try to watch it as something you laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not that funny either. Avoid!
