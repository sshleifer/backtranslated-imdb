In addition to Brady Variety Hour, it was one of the most popular televisions I've ever seen. The quality of video production was not too bad, but the overall look and feel was undoubtedly in the early 1980s. And Marie Osmond looks like she's fighting Avona's lady .. and she's lost a lot of time. Too many eye lines. It was a bit embarrassing to watch veterans Danny Kay and Eric Severeid who were involved. Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley about the African Pavilion in the World Exhibition Space, which would open "about a year." From this writing it's 17 years later and it's not yet opened (Unless you count Disney's animal kingdom.) All in all but for all the flaws, it's still an interesting visual piece of Disney's history.
