A young American woman visits her Irish roots and reflects a druid witch who does not have it. It seemed interesting, but after an interesting start, I lost myself and spent most of my time thinking about where it is going. It seems that the film breaks down in two directions - are we looking at the problems of Irish and American women who are in trouble with alcohol or are we looking at the terrible horror of the evil witch coming back from the past? The director can not decide. Two of them do not seem to gel and you will never get anywhere. This could be much better done, and the story seemed to stretch the end. It was very boring and disappointed.
