My brother is in love in this show, let's do it straight. I fully agree with the people who said they were copying Dexter's lab and relatively odd parents. <br /> <br /> I have never really liked some strange parents, I think some things have laughed at me, but most of the time it's totally unpleasant and not at all cute. That's almost the same way I felt about Johnny Test. Beyond that, I NEVER attack you. Gags are so stupid and unnecessary, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids do not have such a dress! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is amazing, but c'Mon! And the Dexter Lab, which was one of my favorite series, and I still do not mind. Which disgusts me and is ashamed of Johnny's test, which one of these amazing shows will make an absolute JOKE! One thing. The. Dog. Yippee. So. Unpleasant. It's louder and more ambiguous than Johnny! A gay accent? What a fudge! I hate the dog until I die, and I hope she dies, because it would be better for the kids than to listen and watch the bothersome bulls that are doing at this show and pick up a gay accent. If you do not want your eyeballs burned in miraculous flames and your brain emptied from this show, do not look!
