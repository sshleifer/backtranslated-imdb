I do not look for quality; I'm trying to get over 74 well-known videos that have been banned in the UK. It was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a total 10-second cut. Some colleges spend their Christmas holiday preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking along with four kids. Which one is slasher? Real murders are not too cruel, so this video is not really ugly. There are the required flashing beans, but it has nothing to do with college children. <br /> <br /> I had a suspect very quickly and showed myself to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of them. The end procedure was smart; I have to admit that it's a little bit original.
