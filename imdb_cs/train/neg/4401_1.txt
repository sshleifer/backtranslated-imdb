We went to the movie with the band because the game we were about to have been canceled. It's undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever. It's not like I do not like cult movies I do. Nothing happens in the movie. One feels no connection with the characters at all. endless times without dialogue. A car. How does this car carry a huge tent and beds and clothes for every day? It's two-seaters! However, I must say that the landscape is beautiful, but not in the film, the director should film a film so we can skip about 80 minutes of time without anything happening. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it because it's a waste of time
