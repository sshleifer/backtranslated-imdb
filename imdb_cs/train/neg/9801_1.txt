I remember that this show was on TV when I was a child at the beginning of the nineties, and it was a fury about kids with trickery tricks that make kung fu on and walk around plastic dinosaurs. It's called power guards. I remember little kids going hip, and then the shirts and things from the show were forbidden in many school districts across the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never said it as a show, especially when Fox Kids played better performances like The Tick. Most older teens have always looked at executive officers in a ridiculous and contemptuous manner, and it is not hard to wonder why. The shot is at best ridiculous. Colored ranger costumes look like things you would work and dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into acting and, of course, those really ridiculous hairstyles. All the boys are running around with earrings, half of them wearing 90s and wearing the same clothing every day, and then changing into a t-shirt that wears the watchers. <br /> <br /> The toys are especially ridiculous, and it was a joke to many innumerable night talk show guests. And of course the two worst movies ever made, and I think the two worst movies ever shot were based on this show with almost every critic who destroyed both the movies and the shows on which they were founded. <br /> <br /> Executive Guardians are nothing but a bad TV trader, especially for bad merchandising toys. As an adult I do not look kind, but more like the embarrassment of nine-year-old children, fashion and earrings.
