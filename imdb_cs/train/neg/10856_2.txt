Now, look, I'm not going to lie to you, but I got this movie at just $ 3.99 from a friend, because Danni Filth, lead singer of the increasingly popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth." Of course, I expected violence to be the worst, for Mr. Filth could be seen among conspiratorial lines. But dear God, I was so bad. This movie seriously bites, great time. Being a low-budget movie (haha, wait, make it ZERO BUDGET), it obviously lacks the beautiful music scene from the Howard Stern orchestra and the special effects of Spielberg. No, that's all one camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. Consider, for example, when our stellar and violent specter, Mr. Filth, violently kills thieves. Grabbing on the throat and blood flowing out, but oh, it looks like a men's shirt is packed with a fake blood juice package. Fans of Cradle Of Filth: You hear two songs in the whole movie, but with camera angles and dirty shooting, they pull the whole joy of DOWN. <br /> <br /> My last comment: I'm driving away from it. It's blood, gore, breast and hey, even a dirty story. So if you love scary violence, almost no voices (yes, there are no words in this movie), then buy it. But if the dirty movies are your thing, avoid it. Do not waste money.
