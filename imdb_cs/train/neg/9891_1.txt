I think the biggest disappointment in this movie was that I was expecting the acting actors to shoot and justify how poor the acting was. When you think of a strong theme, brilliant scenery, and effort to create beautiful scenes and magnificent paintings, it's a shame that little attention is being paid to acting. <br /> <br />
