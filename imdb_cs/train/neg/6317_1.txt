I have no idea what San Francisco came up with this silly plot, but they probably need to get rid of all the drugs they use and put their analyst in dangerous money - NOW. Yeah, that's a credible story if you consider the alien abduction sequence in "Life of Brian" to be credible. This film is a bit more than a left pipedream. If the US and the USSR surrendered nuclear weapons, the result would be the removal of a single real barrier that would prevent both of them from engaging in war. Bad as Korea, Vietnam, and other wars of the times were, they were "proxy warfare" that led to superpowels being bounced off direct engagement. This film reflects on how realistic was the moment a group of high school children will continue with a hunger strike against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As if someone said, "Mr. President, some children do not eat at Drastic High!" and Ronald Reagan would say, "My God, I'd rather rethink my defense policy!" Correctly. Like this movie? It would not be better if the Soviet Union collapsed because they could not support massive weapons ... wait, it happened!
