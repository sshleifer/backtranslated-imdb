I can not believe I lost five hours of my life on this garbage. The previous five-day offer of this author was very nice and I really look forward to it. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit because she either murmured or played with her lines, but most of the rest followed her example. Remarkable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old trainees whose dictatorship was exemplary. Do not the producers explain before they are broadcast to make sure the dialogue is heard? As a result, I think I've lost track of what's going on, and since it seemed that the conspiracy line originally turned into a standard thing among the Muslims, and the rest I soon lost interest. The end was a complete anti-climax. Complete bagpipes.
