This film is too skeletal. It's a rather low-budget movie (I hope!) That apologizes a bit, but the lack of a decent cast and exhaustive conspiracy has made it too hurt. Phillips is quite believable in his role of a torn son of a lone family looking for himself (though his family is ... er ... well, a bit white ...) but the rest of the cast is grappling with straw. Every moment that has the potential is destroyed by excessive melodrama and there are many paths that are a clear sign of deficiency of land that need a filler ... I do not intend to recommend this movie to someone who is not even a fan of Phillips or to absolutely nothing to do . 4/10.
