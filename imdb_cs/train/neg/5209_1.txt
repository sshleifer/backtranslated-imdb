Okay, so I was bored and watched all the way. The film is mild, harmless and insignificant. The story is so sweet that it shakes your teeth on the initial titles. The tail of two "traumatized" children learns about the "God" of a fairy tale that has sincerely left me somewhat traumatized. It uses the Irish blarney in a stereotypical way that one hopes it will never see any true Irish. It focuses on children who have sincerely vanished after their first attempt at the "OIRISH" accent. Everyone for all reasons why they get exhausted.
