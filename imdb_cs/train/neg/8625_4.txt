In the unlikely situation where some aspiring directors read these comments, I would like to offer some advice (free!) From the viewer's point of view. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to do spoof of exotic adventure films, go on. Do not try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, when you have a sinister "comic relief", the character is killed and cracked and followed with the monkey by shaking the tree and sinking the coconut on the head of the cannibal, just as if you did not have IDEA what movie you would like to do. This one is boring, meandered, cheap, racial ... you get a picture. Several clever moments and several shots of Kathy's nudity (too uncomfortable here) are hardly worth your trouble. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
