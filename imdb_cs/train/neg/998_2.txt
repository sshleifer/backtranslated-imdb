It's a bad thing when a generic film has more information than the film itself. The complete "parcel summary" written on the movie page contains details that I could not collect from watching a real movie. I found out that I was still trying to figure out what details I missed, what could tell me what was happening (beeping). Unfortunately, without success - this movie leaves monstrous stories if you could call it a story. It's as if they were trying to trick us into thinking that there is a movie that shoots so much to resemble the story and the rest left our imagination. Newsflash to the creators: I paid to watch you Make a movie. I can sit back and imagine drawings and stories for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I've never paid enough attention to put a name on my face, and I see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I've ever seen in the lead role in each movie, A or B. I was thinking well, maybe she did not really want it, just got a strong offer for a movie that was not in? Poorly. She was listed as one of the producers. The next time you make something, do not make yourself a leader if you can not act. If you really can, create a decent character to become. Also, someone here mentioned the White / Latin question - yes, I hate to say this, but this film will come across as revenge against white men of the elderly who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there's nothing in the movie that watches observers on Latin characters. Adrian's character looks like a cockpit blockbuster, which is no better than a story antagonist. As for the character of Maya, she did not look like a real person. Anyway, Hollywood is ashamed that this movie was even made.
