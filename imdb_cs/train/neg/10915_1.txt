I think that war films should try to express the horror of the war, to avoid idealism and to respect some basic principles of military character. Zvezda barely makes the first. Zvezda is a Russian war movie, I expected patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic pictures, fresh scores, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I did not need was naive non-love, unrealistically stupid war scenes, and abuse of syrupy sound in a movie that cautiously avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) to the end, but offended our sense of history by the end of the note on " Polska ". Missed opportunity as a movie, but not as a propaganda apparently.
