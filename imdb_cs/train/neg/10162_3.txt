This film was recommended by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was amazing because it was so real: "Just how are the people in the Ohio Valley!" I'm out of the field and I've seen the movie as, "Just how people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked there with minimal wages. We laughed a lot, joined the people of our age and took a break. young people walked together at night. Older people had little time after work because they cared for their families. This area is beautiful in the summer and there is no grief in the winter rainfall anywhere else. In addition, "if you live in a manufactured house, you have to be in depression" congratulations, the story lacked all elements charm, secrets or even a sense of fear. </ p> <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , she would probably be a friend there. I read reviews that seem to suppose Martha is jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, nicer and thinner," but if it is, it is not shown. All we really see is that Martha learns to recognize Rose for reasons that would apply as if these three friends were of the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling omitted during smoking sessions, omitting a loop in making social plans, using, but not evaluating, and eventually being disrespected and injured. Just one thing: Do we suppose we suspect Kyle's murder, because he once had a few panic attacks? Please. This is a stigma against mental illness to a new level.
