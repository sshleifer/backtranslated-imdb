I do not remember the movie where I cared less about where the characters come from, what happens to them or where they are going. I realize that Hollywood's greatest experience is observing the navel, but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take time with them. For what it is worth, however, the discussion that followed a performance under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series noted that maybe three women had a certain redemption. I do not agree.
