Professor Paul Steiner conducts research on substance transfer. He developed a machine that he can use to make an object such as a wristwatch or a rodent disappear just to re-establish the object elsewhere. But in their research facility there are those who do not like or dislike their experiments and do everything they need to see they fail. After an unsuccessful demonstration that could save funding, Professor Steiner decides to test his machine on himself. As expected, it is terribly wrong, and he is transformed into a heavily frightened fool whose only touch kills. It seemed that it was not such a good idea to re-watch the screened person that same week I watched Fly, Return Flight and Curse Fly. It seems that there are only so many films about the transfer of matter and the potentially terrible effects the human body may have that one person should take three or four days. I'm not sure what is responsible for the movie list as a source material for the Designed Man, but much of it is similar to Fly's films that it can not be just a coincidence. Designed man, however, is not as good as the worst of the Fly trilogy. In addition to being terribly non-original, the screened man has several other issues that really hurt the enjoyment of the film. The big problem I have is with Bryant Haliday at the head. It's such a horse-ass that not only do I dislike its suffering, I really do. Supporting cast members Mary Peach and Ronald Allen are almost as bad. They are so unobtrusive and boring that it does not matter. In fact, there is very little to be excited when watching a projected man. Soundtrack? is not very memorable. _________________ "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a copy of the Mystery Science Theater Episode 3000. Funny things, while not absolute, very often, poorer film, the better the MST3K riffs, the guys hit almost all of the signs with The Projected Man, I'm very excited about 4/5 on my MST3K rating.
