None of Keaton's most powerful efforts was that it might be a shrouded attempt to avenge the family he marries - Talmadges. The Polish / English language barrier and series of matches lead Buster to marry a great Irish woman who (along with her father and brothers) rescues him until he thinks he could be heir to property. Here are mistaken identities - gags are set up and are not worth paying. <br /> <br /> This short metro has at least two real laughs - Buster cleverly turns around the lack of dinner with a calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate. The second is a family photo, and the whole group is slowly falling into the floor as the camera tripod loses its stability. Overflow of yeast beer could be a catalyst for a massive gag series of gags, but will stop short (for all accumulated) developments. <br /> <br /> Cinema print is crisp and clear and the score is one for piano players, drums and sound effects. None of Buster's best efforts, but it's worth a few laughs.
