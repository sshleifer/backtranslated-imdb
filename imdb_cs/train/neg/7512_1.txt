I had to leave the theater. In an hour I saw only people cheating on their wives, skating like dogs in the routine and using the word f-word as a diabetic using Equal. <br /> <br /> No, thank you. <br /> <br /> It was especially frustrating because the movie could do a lot. Each of the characters could be quite interesting if they were given more than to smash, talk and swear. Several times it looked like she was going to be some kind of character, all that happened was another sexual scene. 1) several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees the murder scene 3) Vinnie looks moody over the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats wife and 5) Joey (most liking show) from his parents' house. More than I expected to see. The shooting and the interplay between the characters were excellent, but it was NEVER for them. The flood of sex and vulgarity is hardly worth another hour before anything happens. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Spike. Take lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. Either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
