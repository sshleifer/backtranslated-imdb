Why bother to see this movie if you have great movies to see. It's a complete waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad because I wanted to watch him. Everything in it is wrong. The actors were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds in the movie. One interesting thing is that we want him to die because he's so stupid we get him. (I do not remember the name, but it was BOJFRIEND "The Chosen".) /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 Stars from 10
