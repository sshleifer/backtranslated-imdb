Siskel & Ebert were amazing at this show, whether you agree with them or not, because their own professional opinions have arisen due to a real conflict. He made this show behind him, for he was not really a film critic and because he replaced the smile for the opinions. Now that Ben Lyons appears, I feel like I'm looking at "Teen News" - do you know that baby news that hosts kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. Obviously, they have only met the constant diet of major films throughout their lives. The idea that these two dignitaries have something to interest or should lead to telling about movies is absurd. If they study nonformal film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they simply think it "confusing". Wait - I think I have it ... ABC owns Disney ... Disney is making movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were just hit-or-miss with a large budget studio staging - what a surprise: these two guys LOVE a big studio schlock and just manage to tolerate a few indies. In addition, everyone knows the age group the TV advertisers are targeting. Fragile nepotism is the cherry on the cake. In what alternative universe do these boys qualify as film critics?
