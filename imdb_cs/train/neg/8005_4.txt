Gwoemul (Host) - Because of pollution in the Han River, a mutated beast comes to the ramp. The youngest family member in the park is caught and is left to her family to find her before she becomes the last meal of the animal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, I love unconventional films: Mute bears, all over alligators, Komodo rags, full battles. The creatures' properties are my favorite kind of horror film. So I really wanted to like The Host, but it was not. <br /> <br /> There are three main issues with this: <br /> <br /> The first one can be seen with a quick glance at his IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many goddamn genres. He took too seriously to be a comedy, and yet it was too light to have a real message (although he seemed to try to make a statement, anti-pollution, anti-American, or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mess with all other styles. Secondly, after the initial attack on the monster, almost the entire film is not happening. The Central Family desires to find one of their own, while the governments of Korea and America seem to be doing nothing. And that's it, they just wander, occasionally beat each other, probably a little comic relief. This lack of action has received me attention, and apparently it has done to the director, because the whole plot of the plot has not been solved (the mystery mystery invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten and never resolved). <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> And finally, the film is clumsily political. He paints Americans as stupid and evil, but he does not give us any American figures deeper than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious silly American and wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant, he asked his boss, the coroner, to refrain from chemistry in the Han River. The American coroner does not feel manic if he orders the assistant to go on. Just like racist, it's lazy filming and there's no excuse. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is good, the kind of mix The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the motion effects are pretty cool, and the initial monster is haunting the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice pictures in the movie. Some of them remind me strangely of the way Firefly was filmed (camera shake, sharper shots, etc.). In the end, there is also a pretty scene where the hero and the boy who rescues sit in the family home of mobile stands. It's night time and the snow is falling, the street lamp emits cold light, but it's warm glow from the dining stand. Overall, I was really disappointed with this film. I was looking forward to a decent creature and instead I got some pseudo-political horror comedy. If I look at IMDb comments, I can not help, but I think if it were American production, it would be planned. Just because it's a foreign film does not mean it's good. In recent years, there have been some great movies from Korea (such as trilogy of revenge and fraternity), but it certainly is not one of them. <br /> <br /> I was once in favor of a remake. Fix overhead, improve scripting and it could be a nice movie. As it is, they are not worth a couple of hours of any time.
