This movie should be called "Plan 9 by joseph smith." I think his curiosity is undervalued. that dramatist Paul Ehrlich read "Population Bomb (1968)" and created a musical response that was created specifically for Mormons. the whole point of the game is that as many children as you can, it's part of the "heavenly father" plan. and everything that stands in the way of having more children is very bad. to get it? <br /> <br /> This version was shot in 1989, which is confusing. it's utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the game was actually written in 1973 and of course, theology is part of the 1840 battlestar galactica part. some actions take place on the ground and some in "preexistence, a purposeless room where annoying children wait until they get their body to come down, try not to cast the door on missionaries and lose their shot of heavenly glory. <br /> <br / > It's as fictitious as it comes, but do not let the poor theater spoil your appreciation for this demented Mormon universe, where "cold kids" are all in control of the population, (probably) their parents' counseling have no more children! " when the game was written, a cultural norm in the ld community, and more importantly, considered part of God's plan. parental planning chooses parental choices, and large families are now much less a cultural standard, so the whole doctrinal vision of the film about the modern Mormon myth! ahhh but it's really just as good as music. So there are some catchy tunes that just will not allow this movie to die in 1970 to the death for which it was intended. your brother and sister are singing some love songs that will make you wonder if there's anything else to do. and heavy, cold kids make new kids on the block look like metallica. so do it all! Gather family around, do some shooter ride-on and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
