On a remote planet, the psychopath is saved from being executed by the cosmic monk. He will release several prisoners and leave the jail in a space ship. It joins an extremely large spacecraft circulating a supernova star. This massive craft is populated by only three people, probably because the budget of the film does not apply to the hiring of many actors. In any case, the short story will end up a bit in the game of cats and mice with bad ones. The psychopath in this movie is curious to be annoying. "Unpleasant" is generally not a term we would use to describe a fool - unhinged, scary, dangerous perhaps, but not "annoying", but he is. The three people who occupy a giant ship are seriously unconvincing because they guarantee such important roles - this ship is virtually a big city! Since the film is set for about 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge craft can exist, regardless of the fact that it is used for such a relatively secular task. Despite the huge size of the spacecraft, the garrison has all the scary clothes, the tiny rooms and the dining room consist of what looks like a plastic table and chairs. But there are plenty of passages. The film is quite well performed and acts as an average sci-fi thriller. But nothing great.
