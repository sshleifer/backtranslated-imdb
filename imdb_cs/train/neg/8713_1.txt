Everything in this movie is bad, story, acting, effects, but its funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine with an army uniform that's ten big sizes is so bad with a persistent attempt to frown on his face as the leader of a special ops band of his cheerful! "Terrorists" are just as frightening and realistic as "predators", it's so fake and wrong in everything you're trying to laugh at. The part where the giant T-REX, which somehow went down aboard the ship and then somehow got down is blown up and you see that the metal pole stuck where its head is the perfect end. If we get into bad movies, this is a golden pot, mona lisa bb-bad !!!
