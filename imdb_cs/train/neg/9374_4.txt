This document is at best when it simply shows the offices of Aurvedic healers and the preparation of the treatment. There is no denying poverty in India and despair even for their richer clients. However, as an argument for Ayurvedic medicine in general, this film is failing. Although Indian clients say they were seen by "aleopathic" physicians, these doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take the unclear statements of their patients in nominal value - "the doctor said there was no cure," "the doctor said it was cancer" Well, "no healing" means "no treatment" and what type of tumor does the patient have? The film is in its weakest situation when it shows American Ayurvedic practice. There is apparently reduced to the stunning suggestion that having high-powered work on Street Street can cause injury to your stomach.
