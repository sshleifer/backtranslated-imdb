This movie is so bad that it simply resists reality. Shooting is the best material of the school class, acting is pathetic, and the director should forever be excluded from film production in any form. Not so bad can not be seen as a comedy like something like Showgirls. The only thing about this DVD was the art of packaging. All I can write to those of you who did not have the bad luck to witness it is please do a deserved favor in advance and do not waste time or money on this piece of rubbish. To see the movie about comedic aspects, there are many others that are worthy of such a waste than this waste.
