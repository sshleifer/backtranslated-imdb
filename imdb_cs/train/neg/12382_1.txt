Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would move to their graves if they knew that guessing who was at Rip Off dinner was actually in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors gave a great cultural statement to Stanley Cramer's masterpiece of 1967. Today's rift is a joke. So a white guy from an overly stereotypical Italian family on Rhode Island brings his African-American girlfriend home (insert GASP here) to his father's funeral. His reactions to family members were of course ... predictable. This movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish, my girlfriend actually started a false snore to tell me she wanted to leave. Make a favor and rent the original. Go to Wake.
