No matter how this show is still in the air. There's a couple who stayed together, married and had children, but everyone else fell apart. What does it make sense to continue? The show can be fun at the beginning. You see that all the girls fall over one man that almost everyone likes them instantly. It's like real life! Girls start to talk, scare each other and show their true self (or think). But the one person decides who chooses to think they can marry and live happily ever after. What is really true love? How can you fall when you're forced to pick them? This show is incredible. Do you think dating online is bad, but people have to go to TV to find love? It's not realistic. How could she be a girl with a man when she goes out with a couple of others who go out with them? None of these questions are answered and, finally, when the show ends, you know that there will be no happy ending in the future. For everything we know, everything is written.
