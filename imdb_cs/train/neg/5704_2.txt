After reading some good reviews of this movie, I thought it was time to go and see it. I do not know why I was bothered. Basically, this family is entrusted with a leash that leads to the great hold of an ancient treasure hidden by the Knight Templar during the Independence War. Apparently he had to be excluded at all costs from the hands of the British. First, why did the knights call the treasure from Europe to America? How did the Nic Cages figure that Charlotte was actually a ship? How do he find out all the clues and puzzles in a minute? And how can two people suddenly become thief masters and steal what is probably the best guarded piece of paper in the world? These are just some of the plot holes in this unpleasant battle of action in Hollywood gone wrong. Cage was in some great action movies - "Face-Off" and "Rock" - so why did he get it? Is he too old ?! His character is quite unpleasant - indeed, this "ordinary" kid steals the Declaration of Independence, overcomes thieves with weapons, escapes from the FBI, and generally seems invincible. The whole movie really does not make sense, and in fact it was quite disappointing.
