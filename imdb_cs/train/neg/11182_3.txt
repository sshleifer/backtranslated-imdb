A very silly movie, full of silly inserts and Jewish links. It was a serious film, but it could not be taken seriously. Known film plot ... They were in the wrong place in bad time. A terrible subplot that includes Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too regulated. I noticed that Al Pacinos's acting skills seem to go down. A troubleshooter, but nothing more worrying than Pacinos, is the terrible accent of Atlanta. Damage control must repair this film damage. OK my trim is bad, but not as bad as you in this movie. This film is not only boring but also rebellious. Usually, the rebellious film is observable for improper reasons. This movie is illegal. That's what I did. This plot, if it was a bit better, perhaps with a little better acting and the elimination of a terrible subplot, and even stupid jokes, could take this thriller out of irritation. What is left to us is a dull, stupid film that made sure it was drilled into our heads that Eli Wurman was Jewish. The embarrassment of all good Jewish people everywhere.
