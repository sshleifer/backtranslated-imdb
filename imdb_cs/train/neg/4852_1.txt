I once saw this movie and I thought it was okay. Then my friends at work said, "Watch it again, it's better." So I did. And because of my surprise it was the second WORCE! There's a word limit, so I'm going to get that ball. <br /> <br /> - Bombing scenes were so stupid. Why would someone on earth expect someone to launch a blast ??? -None of the characters here is even remotely sympathetic. This is not the first time, nor the other. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and the last time I checked, the car did not explode from a single rifle shot or burn it, a small fire extinguisher ... did over 3/10 viewers really watch the movie ??? - The camera is so shaken, I can barely tell you what's going on. The opening scene with the robot had my stomach off, the rest of the movie was not much better. <br /> <br /> -Sound scene. The McManus Brothers (from The Boondock Saints) would look their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why does that guy gun go where someone shot one person? In addition, why would he spend so much time cleaning balls, overloading, heading and NEVER if there was so much chaos around him? -SAS RUNNING Types of Stay and Fight Back ?????? Huh ????? Are soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not think it would be homophobic, but honestly, the scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Long for your own good, but too short to get a lot of material. It seems that Bigelow thinks the more action the better. It looks like it's wrong - the movie is full of redundant action scenes that are thrown over to turn you away from the lack of a central conspiracy. I know Watchmen is longer in 163 minutes, but at least the movie was not dragged. This film, on the other hand, makes and feels longer. The only good thing was Renner, which was, at best, satisfactory. But do yourself a favor, just skip it and do not put it in hype.
