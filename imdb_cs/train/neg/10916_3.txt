I see home audiences how they can applaud this movie. For outsiders, no interest interests, it does not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. The anticipated romantic angle was redundant and scattered. How a young woman could "love" the lieutenant to see him, it was nonsense. As I mentioned at the end of the movie, I could never meet just because it was a distraction for me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots, and this was shown in persecution in the swamp. Several hundred German troops advanced and pushed the Russians into swamp. So the Russians were hiding and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and simply stood where they were listening. I suppose they did not want to get wet shoes, but I'm sure the officer ordered 20 or 30 men in the water to search the wetland. But that would end the story. The Germans also entered the barn where the Russians hid in the attic and did not bother to shoot in the roof. At worst, a soldier threw a grenade into the attic and did not come up the ladder to look. I saw several reviewers saying they were crying at the end. I wonder why? You knew this little band would have perished, and there was no heart in it.
