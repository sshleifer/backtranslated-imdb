An interesting story about a soldier in a war that is about to save the life of a young girl from the enemy and is a scary event, even though he has saved many other captured children. The film captures the head, and this soldier is now a high school teacher who is run by most policemen watching the corridors, bathrooms, and even classes. In other words, high school is a prison and most children pay very little attention to their teachers or directors. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays soldier and teacher teachers and decides to finish teaching and go to another field. The supporter, however, asks him to have his class as a teacher. At this point in the movie, when hell breaks down and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy if you choose to view it!
