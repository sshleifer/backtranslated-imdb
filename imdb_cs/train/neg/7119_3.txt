* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I'm sure back when it was released in 1958, it was very good for its time. At that time, movies were slower to view and analyze the story. Here one moves to a house owned by his last wife, who has mysteriously died with his new wife. Gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who is also director of the film) is really an undervalued character. He gets a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that he has trouble because he knew that the first woman's death is a bad game. She can not tell Jenny what happened, so she tries to scare him with his skull. Jenni, we will also find that her parents have died, causing the life of mental anxiety that has led to institutionalization. Like today in many viewers, I found it to be a little too slow for my taste. But if you love slow horrors without a big gore, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
