Shame Shame Damage to UA / DW for what you are doing! <br /> <br /> I was horrified. <br /> <br /> Do not take your kids to see this movie. Humor is completely inappropriate for children - and they will be disappointed and disappointed. Sure, we all * read Amazing Children's Books and we certainly have expectations ... but that's pure waste. Dr. Seuss will be ashamed, and he would never do his "thumbs up" for such an unfortunate attempt to use the classic. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Use your money for a book. If you own a copy, buy the book and give it to Toys for Tots. This movie is NOT worth the "free" viewing of tickets. <br /> <br /> Stick with the book. TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual display - save money ... seriously. SAVE your money - it's going to be a patty day on the cable. <br /> <br /> Shame shame shame on what they do!
