Slow, Slow, Slow ... There is no secret or excitement in this movie. If you do not know who's the "mole" in the first ten minutes, you have to be dead. The secret service had to be such because it took them all to join them. There are no compelling characters in the movie (not a movie). The pace of the film is slow, there is no tension. A shot killer is an excellent shot if he does not think of Michael Douglas, rather than everything he seems to be able to hit a large glassboard. The funniest scene in the movie is when the presidential wife says the codeword at the anti-climatic end. It's a ridiculous laugh. At least six people rose and the film left early. I would join them if I did not sit in the middle of the line. I would not want to make this film to anyone.
