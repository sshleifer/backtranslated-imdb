What a dirty movie! Worst of the worst! This movie is just as fun as a dead slug. No-talent-co-so-sometimes-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script? Was it sometimes a script for this horrible movie or the director just accidentally pushed the button on his camera and then decided to shoot the film when they went together? Is it to be a child's movie or a comedy or what? My friends, a younger brother, are in the 6th grade, and he and his classmates just made an amateur film for their school project that surpassed this strange film. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! There is no excuse for this movie!
