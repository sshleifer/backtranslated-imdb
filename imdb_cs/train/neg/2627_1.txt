This bomb is just one "explosion" after another, without humor and just absurd situations. Indeed, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strong points. I give it 1 in 10. It would be zero, but this option was not allowed. Excuse me, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we need money. And I'm still floating on Tim Burton about Mars. Nicholson was so brave to admit it was Turkey. But if it was turkey, this movie is not even a stomach. I wish I could say "give me money back". You can bet if I could. But that's a problem with premium services, a subscription to a variety.
