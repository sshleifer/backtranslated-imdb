Sometimes the movie is so terribly horrible it has a destructive effect on your morale. Do you really start asking yourself what does our company mean that the standard is so terribly low? Can they sincerely expect to have so many clich√©s and still have fun? Of course, he is still the Hollywood head, which makes GUN the main character, the drawing of the device and the source of all conflict and resolution in movies. The character needs a weapon. He gets a gun. He can not do it because he has a gun. He first puts a gun. Oh my God What do we do! He has a gun! He waves around and acts more damaging than real human beings. For several minutes, he pushes him into one's face and shouts questions. A distinctive feature of any conclusion is the pleasant sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> It is a real challenge to repeat such a tired, crumpled formula; the film has to be very smart and well done. This is not one. He has no life and no personality and will vacuum these components. it will be that you feel good about living in the time and space you are doing. Really, who needs it! So yes, I'll say, I think this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved in creating this inferior soul-killing waste should be publicly concerned by doing everything to us.
