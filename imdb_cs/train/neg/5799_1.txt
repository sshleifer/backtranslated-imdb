This movie I rented yesterday mainly because of the lookout art and the summary that was written on the back of the jacket. After jumping into the DVD player, I reviewed the cover again, and although I took the cover from the plastic browser, I still could not read any detailed information about the film production. This film is called Evil on the Jacket and he has to find it on Faith Films to find out any link to IMDb here. Filming and special influences in the movie looked pretty good ... Then the game reader spoke. Oh, dear ... Reading this actor sounded like a high school schoolgirl whose voice managed to change the pitch and no attempt to read the line from the script. At first I thought I was getting a bad disk from audio synchronization, then had to assume it was a foreign movie because I could not read a jacket ... English dialogue dubbed. If they chose the right person to copy the dialogue, this movie could be decent. I gave him a chance about 20 minutes before I ejected him when I found out that the bad line reader would not be killed, but would remain a permanent masterpiece. Yes, that's bad! The casing and the art of making the movie are great, so it gave one star, but less than 1,999,999 stars for a corrupt dialogue. I do not recommend it!
