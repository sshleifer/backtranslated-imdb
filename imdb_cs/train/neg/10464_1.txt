This film is not based on the Bible. It completely leaves Christ out of the movie. They do not show the resurrection or the second coming of Christ. Let's say it. It does not describe the scriptures. The end times are called a great tribulation. The film does not show bad times either. Seven bowls, seven villas and seven thrones of courts are boiling over a 15-second news item of the sea that changes its structure. Anti-Christ was killed for 3 1/2 years in tribulation and that's how the film ended. The only part they got right was two prophets. Naturally, they did not use names, because it would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst part of it was that I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to hold on to the unsuspension. I feel the movie is evil. It's a fake, like everything the devil does. I just hope it does not last until the film is on the left. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is that it was bad. Bad actions, bad special effects, bad plot and bad character development. I've seen better Miami episodes.
