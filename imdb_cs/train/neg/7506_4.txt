Good actors and good performances can not mask an unreasonable scenario, a bad dialogue, and behavioral patterns that do not differ in anything you care about. The most interesting is David Berkowitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, no suffering, no special reason, nothing teaches us nor does it bother to have fun.
