This movie is nasty, indefinite waste. I like romantic comedies sometimes. Watching good is like eating ice cream for dinner. It's not something you will do all the time, but the experience is so pleasant that you can ignore how unwise you are. This film was thinking about how stupid I was that I kept sitting all the time. Everything about that was cheap. In fact, it looks like the movie is overexposed at some points so it's so washed out. It boasts cheese CGI and lame files, too. <br /> <br /> Writing was awkward. I know you can expect some conspiracy problems in comics, but you usually do not like it because you laugh. This movie is so unfortunate that you are actually sitting and interested in an unlikely series of coincidences and totally unbelievable behavior. Events were placed in the movie just to move the characters from one scene to the other or to give the exposure. Sure, all the movies work, but you should not notice it happening. Inelegant. This is the term I should use. <br /> <br /> There was almost no one in the movie who would be really nice. I did not care who had ended up with anyone until they were all absent from me, and I did not have to listen to them as they talked about it. Why would the only really cool character in the movie, the character Paul Rudd, want to have something to do with the totally bitchy, condescending, controlling freak that plays Eva Longoria? Likewise, almost all the characters have consistently occupied the closest solution in each situation. Does a direct man pretend to be gay for five years just to sleep (and bathe) with the woman he is attracted to? The best moment they could come up with a happy ending for the same schmoe, where she and Rudd get the same annoying kleptomanian sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive and attractive women. Maybe they will find something better than they appear on the road.
