The only way to get something out of this movie is to bring him close as a comedy. Seen in that light, it delivers it. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a serious movie, check out somewhere else. This film has absolutely no depth and offers just a little more than just a simple and one-dimensional exploration of "problems" without any insight. Creating a film about stereotypes and then creating each stereotype in the movie is an extremely bad strategy - especially when those same characters just break their slanderous forms in predictable, stereotyped ways. <br /> <br /> The Rhymes and Ice Cube busts make the film almost observable and Michael Rappaport turns into a good performance, but the script is so terrible and the social commentary is so trite, it's hard to find something to be redeemed.
