I've seen 7.5 IMDb ratings on this movie, and on this basis I decided to watch this movie my roommate rented. She said she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I was alarmed for the first time I saw it," she whispered. Perhaps, compared to other Bollywood movies, it deserves 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I've seen in my life, it deserves more than 3. Every movie where I can always guess what's going to happen is not for me good. The characters are incredible, what an act is not realistic at all, and their motives are fictional. It's dramatic and the songs are not that great. My biggest problem with Bollywood is the lack of finesse. All the emotions are too exaggerated, and thus not at all realistic. Any emotions or connections between characters that are the least delicate must be magnified by unnecessary songs. I think I understood that the relationship between father and son was more like a friend than a parent-child relationship without having to be broadcast over five minutes of songs. The silly, funny, funny laugh was not fun or necessary (Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the hall). If the film tries to bring tears through the most striking means, it is not meaningful, a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Generally, if someone has terminal lung cancer, their son who lives with them would know that there is something wrong without having to be told. It takes too many holes. Initially, the movie was fun and cute about Bollywood movies being people who do not watch them when they look at him gruffly, but it's just boring. You need a lot of skills to make a movie that's fun and irritated, and the best way to do it is not usually to have all the fun parts in the first half of the movie and all the hearts at the end. <br /> *********************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************************************************************************************** ********* I did not make a single tear, or I did not feel it; I was rather anxious about the dramatic ending. I do not want to recommend this movie if you want to watch something good, I recommend if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is a little sad.
