Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> An unusual setting for the American War of New Zealand. Unusual items, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers, from one illegitimate child of a dead Senator's son, another living with seven Marines (one by one) before being murdered by the returning spouse POW New Zealander. Unusual to see Paul Newman deliver such a bad performance so soon after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody There There Loves Me". Unusual for the two great "stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, to be a little worn in the movie. /> <br /> Unusual that I could bother writing a review of such a bad movie, give it to him!
