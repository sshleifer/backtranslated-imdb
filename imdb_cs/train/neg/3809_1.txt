This show is just uncomfortable !!! I'm sorry that the actors had to try out the fun (especially Bob Saget), the laughter is trying to cover the sad jokes and the song "Awwww" appears at the worst times. Excessive children are no exception, especially Olsen twins. This show is also a city cliché. If you want to look for the word cliché, it should be "Full House". Each story line has a "lesson of life" that learns at the end. Sappy speech does everything better and even has the ability to make it the most inferior baby has a sudden realization of good GASP too bad it could not be possible in real life. I do not know how anyone could watch this show without worsening character or laughing behavior. that he is screaming on TV and saying, "It's not fine / SAD / CUTE" If life were such, the world would fall apart.
