I tried to go through this movie twice, succeeded for the first time - and it was like tooth extraction - and it did not work out for the second time despite the great DVD transmission. Problem? It's just too boring. If you get into the dramatic scene of the courtroom that occupies most of the second half of the movie, you have done it, but it's hard to get to that point. There are some interesting interviews "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) in court. The end touches when Lincoln leaves and portrays his Memoral statue across the screen. It's a nice story, a good performance and such ... but in the first half it misses the spark and discourages the viewer who hangs there. I suspect that real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
