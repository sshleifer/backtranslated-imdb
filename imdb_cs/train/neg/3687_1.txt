It's not just that it's a bad movie; it's not just that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers are in this movie; and not just that the script is terrible. It's just that ... this movie is angry ... great time. These people lose money in terrible scripts. It has to criticize Mexican society, but we are pleased with such films. Is the wrong language humorous? I do not get it. The Mexican cinema is in great difficulty if this kind of films will continue to play (and will be written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please do not think that this kind of movie is well received in Mexico: We hate and do not reflect us.
