The previous poster apparently worked on the film. It's a joke, how bad it is and nobody would judge this kind of movie the way it did. Mentioning all the names of the actors and what they were before is a sign that they are somehow involved with them. > <br /> Right now it's on Cinemax and I was sure it was a movie where the porn stars (the one called Ava are beautiful and well equipped) were forced to do something else for some crazy tax reason. <br /> <br /> Also, when I first saw it, I was sure it was made in 1986 and I was born in 1973, so I thought I knew what I was talking about. .. but no ... it was in 1993 !! Incredibly! Although I would call it one of those bad ones, it's a good movie. Just like tracking a train wreck.
