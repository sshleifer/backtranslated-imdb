No doubt this is one of the worst movies I've ever missed! The conspiracy is, I'm sorry, I said there was a conspiracy? The most dangerous moment was when ... no, we can not think of one! The best special effect I was hiding under the bed was ... that neither of them can think of anyone. You know who the assassin was right from the beginning. There was nothing scary in the whole movie, in fact, the only two vaguely interesting pieces were when you saw a nurse, Misty, in the shower, and when you saw that Sister Toppan was taking her away. This movie should be watched only to get an idea of ​​how NOT to make a horror movie !!!
