Although in many respects I agree with other reviewers' comments. I've found that the conspiracy and the idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The sad problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor." As this person has ever been in a movie or on television, I can not imagine it. In my opinion, Wal-Mart would be better. To see a person with such a low talent involved in paying roles, ask the question ...... "Who knows"? I would love to see that this film was recreated with a certain talent. I do not think the writer thinks this movie is worthless to see.
