And I think ultra light. This film contains four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing more than that. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this, except that it has a couple of really good bits, most of them are not too funny. It does not even work like romance. What about a romantic comedy? Not for life. Most dialogue is too flat to be sophisticated, much less fun. What a real asham is that it is not bad at all. This movie could have been much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the fake ways in which films are being promoted, accompanied by false quotations from critics. The film uncovers the unspoilt press junket area - all paid trips for journalists who almost always write good reviews. But instead of exploring what should be the core of jokes, it spends about three minutes on this territory and moves in the hunt with the lame romance of the film. Just like Catherine Zeta-Jones, the character - whinny, a self centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she gave, but practically did nothing. It's all homogenized waste that looks very pale compared to some of the things we've heard about those stars over the years. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's hard to understand what caused Zeta-Jones, Julie Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal to sign aboard this convicted boat, which sinks like a repeat of "The Love Boat." In fact, like the old joke, they should have forgotten the script and made a deal. It would probably mean a better story. So, go ahead and tell us the filmmakers what you have in those stars that have appeared in them?
