I saw it for free, fortunately, and I wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same thing old movie studios have been accustomed to over the past ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are the opposite - and yet they are attracted to each other. If this story line does not surprise you and will not excite you, the movie will not be. <Br /> <br /> Lots of visual gags and jokes. In the middle of the movie, I began to realize that Ben Stiller was really not so sad, but he was trying very hard. And Jennifer Anniston is not really that pretty, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymour Hoffman had to pay a lot of money to be in such an average hopsaw film, and I expected more of them. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I saw it after seeing the American Tangle, a really fun and original movie - and I put it in my head and found that filmmakers would be forced to sit with these two movies back - maybe they would make sense to them, and they started to make better movies with unknowns rather than the stuff that best works on airplanes.
