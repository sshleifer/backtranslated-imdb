This long-lasting film is less about Berkowitz and his influence on the NYC, but more about caricature painting by a group of Italian-Americans known locally as "Guidos." The problem is that Guidos are uninteresting, no matter what story or environment they are submerged. They're already lively cartoons, so Lee is just amplifying than simply displaying them. someone has a cartoon they do themselves, does not go home and says, "Hey, do more ears and noses!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the film are two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the lifestyle "Guido". The most important story about the characters, especially about John Leguizam, is the best film that will bring you a nice film that will fall asleep. Especially due to its long run. <br /> <br /> One more strike: For someone who said he was a Yankees fan and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how Phil Rizzuto is wrongly written in the final credits.
