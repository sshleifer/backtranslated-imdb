If you are a fan of really bad movies and think it's funny, you'll be great acting on Shaq. First, putting professional players into movies almost never works. Shaq had to be the worst actor I've ever seen beside Dennis Rodman, who also made some bad movies. However, this film is also bad because of a naughty child. I would make it zero, but that is impossible.
