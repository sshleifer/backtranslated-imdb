Very disappointed version of Lorna Doon. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in the story, too short, seemed low. Lack of dialogue to understand the story unless you are familiar with the novel. In some scenarios, Lorna seems to have cold pain on her upper lip. I'm sure makeup is best to hide. I do not think they wanted to stop filming until it burned down, regret. Most likely why this film missed the kissing scene. Only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and it should be true. The Lorna Doone version of 2000 is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable, and more faithful to this book.
