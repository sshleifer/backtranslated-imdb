I have seen this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as well as probably all other voters. The director was present and seemed to work very hard and was very devoted to the project, which in my opinion explains the above-average reception and indicates he has. It's the most similar to the popular Australian children's episode "Round the Twist", but it takes too seriously to even the redeemed feature. The film itself is worth seeing if you are trying to make a worldwide tour around the world to visit all the UN member states because I can not think of another film from Fiji, but generally it was general, misbehaving (even if amateur) and prey to subaltern mentality. The morality of the story seemed to be that indigenous islands would try each other, but as long as the decent white governor is in, all the problems can be solved (leaving the island).
