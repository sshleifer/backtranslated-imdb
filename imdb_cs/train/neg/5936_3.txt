This movie was a disaster from beginning to end. Scattered performances of "next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with Bono and The Edge, as well as the artists themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who will stand in the film with others in his magnificent, yet gentle position, wisdom and humor. The rest is too busy trying to normalize him like St. Leonard or as an old prophet. Many of the performances are unforgettable oversized interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright) or lack of achievement. Only Beth Orton and Anthony have come to a striking distance from Leonard's own versions with a little restraint. A little unpleasant little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled with all the films - such as the focus superpowers of red balls in many concerts and interviews, blurred blurred camera work, the use of digital delays on some of Leonardo Cohen's comments (which is harder to hear what is said) and the creepy , a challenging low drone under many stretches of the interview (an attempt to add gravity?). For a real thing to see the songs from the life of BBC Documentary Production in 1988.
