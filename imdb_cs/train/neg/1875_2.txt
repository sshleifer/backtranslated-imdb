At first I really loved Henry Foola, who made me a very small number of movie visitors. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this movie was full. Watching Hartley and the actors talking about the movie in the extras - so full of pride and insignificant analogies to Star Wars - was stomach-rotation. This was a producer-side hype (HDNET) realized on max. The true example of the Emperor and his new outfit. Mostly I feel that Hal has destroyed HENRY FOOL forever. I do not think I can ever see it again in pure, innocent light. Do not forget Hal, you can just suppress some people ... and so on. The director will not be here anywhere today if all he did was spit out nonsense rubbish. It is sad that it is a pure example of teaching in ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or its box office hopes are really gloomy. I do not mind a decent story. For the actors it was like trying to act in a strait jacket. Score, according to my Hartley, is without taste. The drum will hit the entire dialog. There was one Apple Soundtrack that I realized was a smile. When I saw a trailer, I thought they were trying to grab a new audience. But it's really such a ridiculous ride. I'd like to spoil the movie, but it was done. It's rotten. FOOL franchise is dead. Henry Fool lives long.
