the only nice thing about this highly mockable movie plays "guess" that place. What will mean a landmark in Toronto for what American / international place. <br /> <br /> who knew the antichrist was Russian? of course we can not be American because we need them to save that day - Oh Buck ... tell us the whole truth ... you will show us the light ... and the way out of the building those unpleasant anti-christers get their way. Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope that they will not do another! We do not have to pray.
