Ursula Andress's "naked body is one of the things that you do in God." The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) also have large bodies, so why is a higher degree I can give a film of such quality and nudity just 3 Since to get into Ursula's incredible body, we have to sit down for a movie that is otherwise unlucky and boring (keep in mind that I watched the entire 101 minute version, not a 78-minute American version that probably turns off a lot of foreign material). In a typical Italian-comic tradition, most characters are exaggerated cartoons (army angry, "Latin lover", always drunk, naive maid), which are not funny, simply overcrowded. (*)
