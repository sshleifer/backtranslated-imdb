Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Effect, dialogue, handwriting, sound, lighting, land line. Actually, I can not say anything positive even though I like Swedish movies. Combat scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously. And when the main character loses his shirt while avoiding bullet streaks, I'm not sure if it's a joke or when someone really thinks they are ingredients in a good movie ?! Regina Lundov√° is the only half-actor actor, but disappears in a flood of ridiculous pronunciations and incredible reactions. It leaves you scared that someone actually spent time and money on something like that ...
