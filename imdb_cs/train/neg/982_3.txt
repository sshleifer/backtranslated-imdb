The real star of this funny story is the famous technicolor. Visual treatment for the eye, film does not allow to stimulate the mind and the heart. At first I was intrigued by the idea that Dietrich and Boyer are leaving religion to "find" their ability of love. What follows is a great disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in production, and man feels his torture. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe surprised her performance - sometimes your face scary to look at it - a infallible mask. Boyer, as a monk, held a formula for monastic liqueur (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage to God," the reaction of his fellow citizens keeps shock and fear of preserving the organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer has got rid of his past well. However, the following path is too predictable.
