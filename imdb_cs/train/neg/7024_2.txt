I borrowed this movie because not only its gay theme, but the idea of ​​playing the role really caught me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was filmed in San Francisco because I live near SF. And, of course, it was nice to see castro from Castro County (though I really care about more gay men than a woman). But besides, I can not really recommend this movie. The characters are not really developed for me, and when they finally get to the "role" I've been bored of my mind. And the role playing scenes I saw were a bit embarrassing when I watched. Effect leaves something that is desirable. Needless to say, I did not finish the movie. I omit this.
