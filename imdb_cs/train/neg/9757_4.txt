It's not the biggest movie I remember Paul Naschy. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst fencer I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came because the contest was just as bad. This film is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is none. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; only Robin Hood adventure against the evil baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be king. The main feature of the film was to see Gracie Nilson, who made four films in two years and disappeared into our regrettable loss. Where did she go?
