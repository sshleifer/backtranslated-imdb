I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy series in service, director Stanley Donen, while she does not like it? It's a kind of film that thinks about two things - when all the parties involved (including some well-known names) realize they have a hand cream and what's the worst among them in a number of rival aspects? I'm still thinking about the first one, but my voice for the other goes into a meandering plot, sometimes a difficult script, an uncertain tone, a lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and a lack of relationship between the characters. You have to add very unequal behavior to criticism, but it is understandable that the actors face these things and seem to be under-practiced. Often they often barely get rows fast. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urban personalities, but at times he seems restless and staccato in his delivery. But I have to say that I was relieved when the initial suggestions of his character will be matched with the indescribably vulgar Jayne Mansfield leaving with Suzy Parker. What kind of film do you like? - for me, the beauty of Parker, which also acts as a gentle and dignified Grace Kelly. Overall, the film is a nice look. The navy characters are very smart in their uniforms - but you really need to be interested in the terrible black tunic Fu Manchu that you have in your luxurious suite. Even Grant can not look elegant in his. Back to the side of the loan, Ray Walston is doing praiseworthy work with his character, and for me, he was interested in hearing the heroes before Hogan Werner Klemperer speaking without a presumed German accent!
