Calling a film about a crippled spirit to avenge the fool's and tomb's tomb would be too ironic, but it is undoubtedly the undefined combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); while it is still observable in itself, it is so clich√© that it raises laughter instead of the intended chills. However, thanks to the terrible fears that the British film industry found in the late 1970s, even an average scenario like this one, he was able to attract ten star names - Cliff Robertson (as a breathtaking husband), Jean Simmons Jayston (as Robertson's business partner ), Judy Geeson (as Simmons' actor), Jenny Agutter (Robertson's artistic half-sister), Simon Ward (as a mysterious driver), Ron Moody, Jayston's best friend and wife), Florou Robson (as a housewife), David Tomlinson read the will of Simmons), and most surprisingly, Jack Warner (like the sculptor of the sculptors) - although most of them have nothing, I'm sorry!
