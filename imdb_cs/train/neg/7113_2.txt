SCREAMING SKULL (1 out of 5 stars) This movie boasts plenty of great introductory credits (a screen story that warns filmmakers to have a free funeral if they die for fear of watching this movie, a terrible shot of a skull emerging from a quiet pool and ubiquitous terrifying music), but the film is sad everywhere downhill. The widow takes her new bride into her remote castle building ... she tells her servants and friends that the new lady is very fragile due to the tragedy in her past. Well, at that moment he will begin to see and hear mysterious things no one else can. Her husband assures her that it's all in her mind and ... well, you'll probably find out where it all goes. You've figured out what's going on long before our unfortunate hero ... because you've probably seen exactly the same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and also better). To add to countless film misdemeanors, it seems that most of the edits of this movie (many cheap DVD compilations) lack some key scenes. You see a heroine who slowly walks to the window ... opens her ... you know he'll see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene breaks into her sobbing in the hands of her husband. So what did she see ??? I think we never know.
