I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently. The scientific channel worsened, but not much. The bustling ripoff of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are freelance, absorbing as many extras as possible. CGI is quite poor and prosthetic eyelids are ridiculous. We get a gore that helps a little bit. Wait until you see how a mad scientist who started this whole mess. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently it was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can. It reminds me of all the low-cost STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
