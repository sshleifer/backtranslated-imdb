I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" is nothing but a very atypical, standard detective show, in which, as in any Quinn Martin show, Act murder, Act II was the lead person who portrayed murder, Law III was a conspiracy plot another legendary character), Law IV was a resolution and Epilog was Betty (Lee Meriwether) and asked her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) to find out the crime, and then someone said something funny at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was the late great composition of great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Special, the initial credit sequence caused me to see the show and after seven seasons, it was a show in the air. I also admit it was nice to see Ebsen in a different role than Jed Clampett, although Ebsen was a bad miscast. I just wanted the show to be more fun than when I first remembered it. Update (November 1, 2009): I was following an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Channel Archive of US Television. Let's say I was kind on the Barnaby Jones show.
