The story line has been washed a few times; "breath of life in the retirement home". Several plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems, and news articles have beaten the subject without end, but it is still a great platform for studying characters. If Gideon was more enthusiastic, it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is overwhelmed with clich√©s (even the subtitles and summaries of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost scared me in its ineffectiveness). Mostly indifferent acting is the ultimate slap for this weak film, but the rest is fine enough to make the lack of focus of actors almost irrelevant.
