I love watching Jerry like the rest of the world, but this bad justification for soft-core porn flick is unnecessarily offensive, lacks anything like a joke, and serves only as a self-promotion for Springer. Even when running at a speed of 90 minutes, the movie is horribly stretched, and I have a common sense to leave. Just cruel.
