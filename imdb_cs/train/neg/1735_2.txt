I feel that the producers of this mess went off to make the most painful, ridiculous Western at all. "PAINFUL" is the best word I think I'll describe. <br /> <br /> On the plus side you have a beautiful color photo and a beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who worked well in an annoying role, written so cruelly that no actor could give a nice performance. Production values ​​were quite good, which only accentuated the terrifying story and script. Things I hated: Stewart Granger looked as little as a Western character with a British accent, and a silly, immaculate, still white scarf tied around his neck. It was tiring as the city's inhabitants and his son kept quarreling and insulting Granger, and he never spoke or answered. I know we should stop mistrust and appreciate the west as a symbolic morale game, but this spell broke magically unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst being at the end when Granger miraculously, quickly and simply grew the dynamite around the canyon going through a bad boy and then Granger puts himself in the perfect place to shoot the dynamite from a very distant distance to create rock slides to bury and frighten the cattle and the bad guys, seemingly to destroy them. two main criminals. The other worst is all about what is outlined in the scenes of the soap opera. Nothing in the movie seemed to be believable: I could not believe what the whole conflict was all about. The evil guy drove his herd to market and wanted the cows to chew on the road; I do not understand why something could not be solved. Do you need a dispute over land ownership for that? Do not bother to see it.
