I just watched it on TV and what can I say, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed to be from Melbourne where the film was shot. Diabolical acting, amateur make-up effects and really bad soundtrack. As for the plot, it's even more stupid! Some of the scenes made me feel as bad as it was. There is a reason why these types of films are coming to late night TV - because they are utter rubbish! Avoid at all costs.
