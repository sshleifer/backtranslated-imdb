I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and pulled out! It was not funny at all. The audience just sat all over the film and did not mix at all !!! The children did not even smile! That's sad for Disney movie! I thought they could find someone better than Martian than Christopher Lloyd! He was really stupid! And it was not funny! I thought the talking suit was really stupid! In the original TV series, the suit does not speak and does not move! In my opinion, they should not waste time on this movie! I give him two inches down! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to someone! Thank you!!
