As the mother of two young children who are or should have said they grew up with many of Scooby's reincarnations, I feel like I have a good attitude to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. If it's like a family we have not seen any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby we get a clue we could use as a light weight, no special Saturday morning cartoon. But that is basically a problem that is so light in its current format that it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and the gang. I'm sure she can quickly get money, but I'm sure the long-term purchase of old and young people is in a very real risk of losing. My 6-year-old son, who saw the new version, was really disillusioned, and without any statement he said it looked really bad animated and why it was not like the last series (Where are you?). Scrappy Doo was an anomaly, but still infinitely better than this. Hopefully, you will receive instructions that will apply to the manufacturers.
