The familiar comics of Enki Bilal have for some time seen this movie. I thought it would be a good way for artists to make Bilal spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie I would recommend, and I thought I would like it ... I was wrong! The film was a real torturer to watch. The idea has the potential ... but the film leaves too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this film feels it can do better. I will not suggest whether you should see this movie or not. It is likely that you are reading the pages you have already seen or that you will see - but be prepared for a very bad 102 minutes.
