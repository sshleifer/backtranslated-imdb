You know the movie is bad when its peak is able to see a short moment of "Jeopardy!". The saddest thing about White Men Can not Jump is that it has tremendous potential. For several years I have lived in an area that is quite similar to what is shown in this film; racial tension was high and basketball meant everything for everyone. The film about membership in this "basketball culture" could be very interesting, but the average performance and bad screenplay in White Men Can not Job left something that would be desirable. is cyclic. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing basketball. He then returns to his home and together with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories stand up to the climax of some kind, but the "peak" I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (this case was "Billy either wins or loses money by playing a basketball game"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is also interesting. It seems that White Men Can not Jump writers have forgotten this rule, because the plot can be summed up as "Billy has to pay bills". I appreciated the pace of change from other sports movies, but - I'm sorry - it was just horrible. I could not worry less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for her apartment. Despite all this, White Men Can not Jump is a successful movie. Apparently some unheard-of sports fans will reject horrible writing for several basketball scenes in them. Others, certainly, were attracted by big names playing a major role. It leaves me a miracle if the cast has been replaced by previously unknown actors and the theme of basketball has been replaced by lacrosse, anyone would be troubled by watching this film? I really do not think so. I give this film two stars out of ten; the extra star is for "Jeopards!" a scene that aroused me for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
