I simply gave it three because she did what the buddies and hoped to do: Have fun. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to think about a zombie movie with Romer or Fulc, but what I rented was laughter. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for fun or a movie that would shake your head in embarrassment, go for it. This is perfect for fans of the Mystery Science Theater, but the only downside is that it's so bad that it does the same fun. <br /> <br /> I personally think it's a shame that it's about any other Hollywood title we may know, because when the movie is so upset, it has its own genre.
