This is the largest stack of blinds I've ever watched. DO NOT KNOW! The creators of this film should be a band from any other film. It starts with what's going on, and then quickly loses nothing. I think I'd like to see dry painting, but look at the cover. The actors were horrible, the conspiracy faded, the shooting was left to work. Not one good thing she could say about this crap movie. If you borrow this movie, you will lose money. I'm really enjoying the National Lampoon, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to drive. I feel I should sue these holes that have caused this film to lose money on rent and time to lose.
