Maybe I was not the biggest fan of the Blair Witch, but I still appreciated this effort so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives that are in various IMDb commentaries. "Unique", "Intelligent", "Future Cult Classic" and so on ... you have to wonder where these things will appear to people who describe such a bad effort. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Altered is a poor, weak film that does not really respect. Silly is not funny. Horror and gore are not scary. And any "thought" aspect that some poor people have seen in this movie have been caused by serious delusions, because there is nothing deep or clever in this mess. OK, so we know nothing looks like. Is it at least tolerable? Is the experience useful in any way? Unfortunately, no. Beginners have very poor acting. It's not a section that says most B movies have better acting today. Plot? Boring and chaotic. Dialogues? Many amateurs are doing better. <br /> <br /> It's really the direction that's puzzling. I did not expect any significant improvement over Blair Witch, but at least a small step forward. Instead, our director seems to be getting worse over time, not completely killing previous experiences. If Altered is a major bug, it is the main file. A large part of the plot takes place in one place where the main characters are closed, but Sánchez has not been able to bring any personality to the site. Taking into account that in Blair Witch the forest plays a big role and is so many characters (like an antagonist if you want) as three students, you think the director will realize that there is a need. But no ... this place has no personality thanks to careless direction and no detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to save. Hard Hard hard fans "Blair Witch" are better for Daniel Myrick. Although its output is far gold, it has a better structure than Sánchez and some of Blair Witch's teachings are used (unfortunately in weak stories but still).
