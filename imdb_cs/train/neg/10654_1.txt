Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a huge safety pin ... these are the words that best describe this terrible movie. I love horror horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but it must have been the worst thing ever happened. The story is thin and ridiculous, the actress is an abomination, the script is totally ridiculous (the best is the end of a fight with a cop and how to solve who is a killer - it's so horribly written), the clothes are unbelieving and funny on the same scale, the hair is big , plenty of bosom bumps, men wearing those t-shirts that reflect their stomachs (it's bad that they actually wear it!) and music is just a synthesizer, again ... in almost every scene scary music, breasts and paramedics are taking bodies. ... and the gym is still not close to death !! All the joking party is a really bad film whose only charm is to look at the catastrophe that was in the 1980s, and you have a good old laugh about how bad everything was.
