When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and it turned out to be a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that seats are moving). I think the version I saw was a shortened version (15 min.) And it was also recreated to add motion effects. It was a cute movie ... but it was. It was educational, and she was talking about the first mission, but the end of CGI Spacewalk seemed a bit ... well ... trite. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to all parents who want to entertain their children about the first moonwalk. Let's say the character actors were well chosen and the characters themselves were cute. So, everyone, I say, if you want to bring younger children ... go for it. But if you want your older children to take them to another movie ... thank you.
