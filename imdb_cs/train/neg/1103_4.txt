As a young black / latin woman I have always been looking for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie in the video store, I thought I'd like it; unfortunately I did not. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story simply did not materialize. The film has continued to move on and on, and many of the characters appearing on the screen just come and go without contributing to the overall film. If the director did a better job linking the scenes, maybe I would enjoy it a little bit more. Frankly, I recommend a movie like "Raising Victor," over this one every day. I was just not overwhelmed.
