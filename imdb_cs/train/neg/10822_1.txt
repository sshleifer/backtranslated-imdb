Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English, and this writer should read. I hate it when writers use Spark notes about what the novel is about. This movie is unbearable when you read a book. <br /> <br /> The whole 'red room' is so profoundly funny that I wonder why they even bothered to put it in. In the book, the "Red Room" is a foreboding for the whole story and the rest of Jane's life, and Helen Burns is so serious in the movie that I'm happy to die and soon leave, one of the most persuasive characters in the book, not a red head. she is missing out of her life and the rest of the movie. Make a favor and forget about this movie and read the story, as Charlotte Bronte says.
