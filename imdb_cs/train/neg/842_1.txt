This is not the fault of Michael Madsen, he was barely in it. This movie was terrible. If you want to laugh and get bored, go ahead and check out this movie. Words can not describe how stupid it is. I apologize to Michael. The cinema was dark. All the other actors are unknown. Watching is a feeling of soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This film had a sexual subtext because it is a S & M underground killer. The game was bad, except for parts of Michael Madsen. He looked as if he wanted to laugh. I hope he got paid for this dirty movie. It's something I would not be proud of. It's not even a B film for a cable, it's more like F and should never be displayed.
