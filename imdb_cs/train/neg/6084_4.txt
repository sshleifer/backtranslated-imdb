It is possible that the man who was called could cause irreparable damage to the floor of the rack. Maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day, but I seriously doubt it. James Garner decided to put money on the spaghetti western market and brought a lot of Americans to fill the cast out. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> Garner is always busy as a sympathetic rogues because he's so good to play. But he played seriously and did it well in movies such as Children's Hour and Hours Weapon. He can and has turned away from his usual stereotype part successfully. But a man named Sledge can not be considered as one of his successes. He has taken the title role as Luther Sledge, a notorious high-priced offender. After Tony Young's partner is killed in the lounge, and Garner takes Eastwood's appropriate arrangements, he comes out of John Marley's lounge. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in a nearby Territorial Prison, and it looks like the golden shipment is placed under the lock and the key there for an afternoon stop for people carrying things in a running run. Garner gets his gang together to become a flock. <br /> <br /> Here's where the movie walks completely out of the wall. Usually heist films show protagonists go into a lot of methodical planning. Certainly this was the case in the Wagon War, which another reviewer quoted. But in this Garner, he decides to enter prison as a prisoner of the fake American Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak to be robbed of gold. <br /> <br /> It was too much to swallow. If gold was so easy it should have been long ago. But I'll tell you those who love the blood and the courage of the Italian westerns, there's enough of three movies in the prison break. This is not the whole thing, of course the paddlers will fall out and we have another gore festival before the end of the movie. But at the time, the whole movie lost a lot of coherence. Allan Jones, a big movie singer of the 1930s, is listed in the recordings. But because of my life I will not find him in the movie. Perhaps the choir fate might be better. <br /> <br /> It could not hurt.
