Yes, it was a pure, unbelievable, condescending blabber. We know that French people often have a clever idea about the US, it is puritanism and opinions about sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have the opportunity to follow these attitudes. And while some of these prejudices may be true, NEVER INDIVIDUAL from the Midwest City shown in this movie ringed real. A man who never had sex because he was told 20 years before his cock is too big? Where in the world would you find it? Jokes in a bar that only plays vintage bluegrass? A city with about 16 people, less than two hours from Chicago, but without big gas stations, without home TVs, without McDonalds, without children ... The population, who knows each other's intimate details, is still tirelessly meeting as one big family who hate each other. Adult men grow in pillows in a local caf√©, have farms, but do not pick up, kill the guy who does not like everyone, and they seem to get along with everyone with the same emotions? A liberated French girl who sends a 17-year-old lady for her sexual generosity, too many a fellow of the flesh that emits from the cornfields with the breath of the Illinois wind to help reject the same 17-year-old farmer? HELP! I am so confused and overwhelmed by the absurdity of this film that I am not clearly expressing how ridiculous it is. Look at what you need to avoid. God, I hope I did not destroy it for you!
