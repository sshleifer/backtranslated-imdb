I had time to kill before watching football, so I saw that this film is being offered on a scifi channel and literally after watching it I thought I met my version of psychic walking after Bataan's death when I realized a movie that he broke off a series of mummies and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought the initial credits were at the top of the movie and then got into such a deep descent that the recent fall in the stock market seemed like a hiccup. The game was so bad that I hoped one and everyone would be buried at the end. Casper Van Dien's leadership took me a long time for Steven Seagal to work in a high caliber in "On Deadly Ground," because the reader's line was so wooden that a wooden lumberjack was thinking about sitting on a shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression that my kitten was more prominent when he asked for popcorn to eat. The direction was so profound that I looked back, desiring that the Countess had a third year that had a greater pace and a better vision, and the fact that this film seemed to be linked to the doubts of the above-mentioned film work, of which neither you can not think of honor. The FX movie was so bad that I thought the director and the producers were environmentally friendly by recycling the cheap special effects of the horror Z-twists from the past years. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley, and Geoffrey Lewis are doing in these films is outside of me, and they should look at litigation against their agents for preventing them from being involved in such a movie. My warnings for one and all are watching this movie at your own risk because this movie can cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged tracking. On the side of the note, I noticed at IMDb that movie pay is sometimes posted. I wonder if it's so that actors have to pay off for their bad performances in these movies. Be careful and safely avoid at all costs.
