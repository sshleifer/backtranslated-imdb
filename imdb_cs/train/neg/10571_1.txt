my wife is a fan when it comes to this show. In this case I bought my annual seasons from one to three and the fourth is on order. Personally, I think the show is one big prospect that the cast is just as bad. Alyssa Milano should be looking for other creamy movies she filmed, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace Vampire to name a few, other female actors supporting acting are just as inappropriate in her imagination. I have seen better special effects in the old series of Republic Pictures that I saw as a child. I understand why the male leaders have stayed at the exhibition for so short a time, though I do not know if it was their own choice or not. Please. please do not modify for the next season as it is enough, Bob
