A very outdated movie with a terrible clich√© and mawkish dialogue and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk persist. Pseudo "good movie". She does not have time to find out how catastrophic this is the intellectual turkey. The first scene is complete drilling, full of histrionic and hysterical exchanges. The sound is terrible. The motion of the camera is without imagination, just like building up characters. No poetry, no fine psychology, no interesting shots. The actors are constantly smoking and we see beer drinks ads. Very cheap, really. (one exception: Ned Beattie is a nice and simple way to play a hit).
