The amazing story (Amis in his worst), unnecessary and self-confident "decadence", obvious shock tactics, and disordered acting make this film (rather like "Rancid Aluminum") the epitome of everything that has gone wrong with the enormous British film revival. Humor is, in the best case, limp and the complexity of the whole arrangement (including an "Internet terrorist group" - ooh, as modern) really begins to cow up. <br /> <br /> Final Summary - A half-baked attempt to be 'nervous' that no one has any favors. Yet it is always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen ... <br /> <br />
