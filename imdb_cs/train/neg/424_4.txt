Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries and I went to see the full-featured film version of "Earth" from DisneyNature. I think, like car makers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care for the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it would require a special unit with the word "nature". I know my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse and who does I have to tell my personal feelings of Disney every year? <br /> <br /> In addition to incredible cinematography, it was Disney's typical disappointment. It's a half-dozen Disney movie trailers that feature Disney clich√©s, overly dramatic music, recycled shots (Disney claims "40% of new shots"). I even started to think that James Earl Jones's story is a little dull. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman makes every story Warner Brothers start wearing thin. I really think that Disney had bought some natural BBC photos that were so spectacularly done that they felt she would sell herself if she'd hit some orchestral music and the soundtrack. What is Disney obsession with showing predators hunting and killing baby animals? There were half a dozen such scenes, finished with pale young men on the brink of breaking the throat. I think Disney needs to acknowledge that the animals have a rich and interesting life outside life-saving and death, appealing to the film-oriented teenagers that their parents have attracted to this film. I was also aware of how Disney stopped without implying that one had anything to do with climate change. Are they so afraid of small minorities denying that they think it's still a controversial topic? <br /> <br /> I recommend skip this and rent the Blue Planet DVD on Netflix. Natural movies seem to be best done by the British at the moment.
