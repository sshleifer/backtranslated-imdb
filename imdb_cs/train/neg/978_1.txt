I watched this movie recently with her sister, who likes Sophie Loren's performance. I'm a man called the Cultural Barbar. I hate art in any form or form. Rambo is more of my movies, action, kills, blood, horror. If you recognize this, avoid this movie as a plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing like that. Let me give you some biographies. It starts with 5 minutes in black-and-white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in an apartment building attends a show in honor of Hitler, with the exception of the household, anti-fascist and guardian. The woman who is cheated by her husband encounters anti-fascists. He falls in love with him, he wants to love him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Yet they love each other. At the end of the day she reads a homicide from her homosexual and the guy is deported to agents. End. Do you want a shorter curriculum vitae? BORING ... Is that short enough? The guy used his gun at the beginning of this film and shot himself to save the audience from this atrocities. On the side note, my sister loved this movie. As I said, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
