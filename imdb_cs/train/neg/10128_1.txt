he was my hero all the time until he goes with it (if you can call it a movie) I went to the show to look at it and went out and not just asked me for the money back but I asked for double the money, the hero acting and the cause of the hole was ............. I can not believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to filming the 4th finals with a second-rate secondary actor. I was looking at how it is expected that some people will kill him the way he usually does. When it is reduced to using a single jade between the blades to make a rival and the guy falls like a bunch of bricks, something is wrong. The story is incredible as a movie, and even if you justify the visual and read this story as a novel, you'd wonder why you even picked up the book. Steven Segal goes through the moves and seems to be doing just because he is obliged. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenarios he does not show up at all. I hate to repeat the comments of other people, but the use of scenes records for cut scenes and visual aircraft in flight are pathetic. The status of the scenes that are being stretched is turbulent and the scenes seemed to have worsened over time. The Zappruder movie, which shows that President John F Kennedy is murdered, is more and more permanent. My sincere view is to say that you do not waste time viewing this movie, it is not in accordance with the norms of his work a human flash or injury. I read one review that said the movie had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal is paid 5), and that the film is still coming under budget. I have to agree. No wonder it's a direct DVD movie because no movie fiance would play.
