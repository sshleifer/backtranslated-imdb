Yes, there are great performances. Unfortunately, it happened in the context of a movie that apparently has no idea what it does. During the first 45-60 minutes, music takes place as a realistic performance. Suddenly for about an hour in a row, the characters who had always talked to each other suddenly began singing to each other. To further confuse things, a little further, for nothing, they do it for about 15 minutes of conversation, then it seems that this idea will drop and go to other things like a number starting with a jazz club drummer and two electric guitars, which suddenly changed into a fully orchestral piece with a massive invisible chain. Above all this incongruity as music is used is the clear inability of composers to actually write music in the style that is allegedly portrayed. While the first pair of songs mimics the Motown sounds of the 1950s, the rest of the movie is just a (bad) Broadway show. Then there's the pure stupidity of the fragments of the band that makes a bad imitation of the Jackson family and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown and Lionel Richie. When he began to transmit Stevie Wonder, I could not laugh loudly. That was definitely one of the films that attracted me to my little time on the ground and I do not like the fact that I lost two hours watching this movie.
