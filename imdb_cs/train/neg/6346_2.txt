This movie smelled! You will want to return the two extra hours needed to overcome it. The sliding door, with Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howitt, did what Melinda and Melinda were doing much better. The film was smart, funny and well-performing. I was interested in what happened to both Gwyenths - or rather to the characters she had played - and the supporting actors were fantastic. Where Melinda and Melinda are difficult, the dialogue is devised and I care less about any of these people - at least about Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10:00 - and so melodramatic that she is ridiculous and not in a comedic sense. The second Melinda is all right but forgotten. Earlier Woody Allen films worked because I guess he spent time on the script and the actors were talented. One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this script in two months: you can say. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around her are not enough to have the whole presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and many other people you know you've seen in other movies, but you can not remember which of them. Sad, very sad.
