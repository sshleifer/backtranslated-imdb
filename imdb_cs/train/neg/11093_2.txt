If the film were fictional, the film could stand alone and could be judged objectively. Unfortunately, for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are very unfairly shielded against Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were not taken into account (Carter was not a candidate at the time of the murder, there is no evidence that he had saved a boyfriend in his youth), but some of the bigger facts, apparently excluded from Joey Giardell's decision to " racist "judges, is unjustifiable for those of us who saw the fight on the tape and completely disrespectful of Giardella. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero from someone who at best has trouble and trouble around much more than any normal person (arrested several times for defeating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter never saw his actions in the 1960s and even now that he refused to talk to his son, a man people could look for. Everyone knows that Jewison can drive and Washington can act, but why they chose this story because their vehicle is behind me. Is Hollywood so much that they need a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all their bio films to be credible? (Heres proposal How does Denzel play the film about himself? Now it's inspirational) Based on all the inaccuracies in the film, I would propose to pass on this.
