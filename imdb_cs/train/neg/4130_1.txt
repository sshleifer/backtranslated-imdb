Top candidate for the worst movie ever made. It seems that Joanna Pakula has the character I.Q. of 3, which is just one less than a writer and director. The script would not pass through the high school writing class; "jokes" are juvenile; the concept of anger. These artists were probably desperate. I stayed to the end to see if it gets worse. Oh yes. Life is too short to spend any part of watching this movie.
