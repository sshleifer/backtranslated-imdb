The first 30min flick was unreal and hard to know what was going on (if you did not read the book - which I did not have). If you can stick with the first half, the other half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet - nothing less. The way he was shot would have thought he was made in the early 1980s, not in 2005. <br /> <br /> There were no extraordinary moments, insignificant but moving without being bored. I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, her part would be better occupied by more players at the level of other partners to maintain a balance.
