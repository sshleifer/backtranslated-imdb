The group of us who watched this movie was really disgusted. We were willing to forgive that our favorite character Jo was not on (not as writers / producers could do anything about it). The script was wrong, the script was partial. What really troubled us: 1. When the two guys realized that both were going with Natalie, they did not just let go of the stupid (and ultimately humiliating) contest - but just because they were macho competing guys, not because they really did Natalie wanted. 2. Despite not being able to choose between the two boys before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decides she really loves one of the boys and is ready to marry him? (and it was not a pretense to be a better person, it's as if the writers have tossed the coin and then just spit it at some appropriate place in the movie). 3. Blair has a reason to talk about how she does not want children, and then suddenly when her husband says he wants to have children, he agrees with him bluntly.
