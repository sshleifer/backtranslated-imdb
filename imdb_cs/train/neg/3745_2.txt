First; it is very artistically trying to describe the history of history only from the position of weapons, bacteria and steel. The same was trying to make Marxists out of economic positions. The reason for Western success can not only be the stupidity of happiness, the benefits of domestic plants and animals. We see that all the benefits and bonuses all over the world are useless if they are not wisely mastered. There are no huge natural resources in Japan, but Japan is one of the best world economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, is only a moderately low success. Both of these nations have and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film Daimond said it was very important to understand the factors of weapons, bacteria and steel to understand. Perhaps the main factor of the world's difference is not geography, but the ability of people to understand and use things? Mental ability to understand. And in that case geography is just subordinate.
