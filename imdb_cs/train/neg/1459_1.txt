This is by far one of the worst and worst accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler I have ever watched. Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but playing him as Hitler is simply wrong. To regret Schrieber as a long-time friend and help to Hitler, Haefengstal had to let go of despair and despair from Simon Wiesenthal. J-W plays a Nazi supporter, bad bad casting. It was not a nice family film with good historical background. It was Hollywood garbage at its best, putting on the strength of a strong (but highly rewarded) support to cast actors who seemed to have all but disappeared from the actor's radar for the last 5 years. <br /> <br /> The fake German accents (vee vill vin said var) insulted German people everywhere. My mother is German, and she sat eagerly at the sounds of the voices that changed from American / English / German in the same sentence. Supported casts make better cardboard cutouts in the local video store than on the screen. Jenna Malone as the fateful Geli Raubal was gorgeous, capturing the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who eventually ended her own life to escape what her future would be in Hitler's shadow. <br /> <br /> If you wanted an incredibly fantastic and historically accurate description of Hitler's early years that led to war and holocaust, rent "Inside the Third Reich" in 1983 Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler . It was good and it made more sense. "" As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you that I got into my books to confirm a myriad of inaccuracies.
