This film is a free collection of incomprehensible analogies and poorly designed fence devices. Film History: The director of this film was a perverse who ruled the city by shooting random women. When his wife discovered the film, he was forced to tell the story quickly. He claimed to have filmed a film called "A Brain That Will not Die." Eventually his wife asked her to show her her "so-called film". That night he quickly shot some other scenes with a friend and "The Brain That Will not Die" was born. I hate this movie! Plot Synopsis: The character's fiance is killed in a terrible traffic accident (caused by ignoring clearly displayed traffic signs). She catches her head from the debris and recovers her. He regains his head and raises a lot of troops. That's almost what's going on for the rest of the movie. Eventually he fights and is killed by a monster who lives in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monsters store the footman and I suppose they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Side notes: The end of the credit screen says the movie is called "Head That Is Not Die". /> <br /> I hate this movie!
