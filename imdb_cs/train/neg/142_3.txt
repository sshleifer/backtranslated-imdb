First of all, there are some good things about this movie, but it's all clich√© slasher stuff in combination with adolescent film. In the ad for this movie I've seen, great emphasis has been put on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people are trying to make it (not that it has to do with film). And what does that look for everyone? Maybe it's part of a character, but as I said, acting ... But writing is fine. You know who the whole movie is, and you can almost predict what will happen, but not so irritated. I think the book on which it is based is probably good, judging by the conspiracy line, but next time I read the book to get to know her than to follow it.
