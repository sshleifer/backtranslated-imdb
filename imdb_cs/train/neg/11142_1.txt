This is absolutely the worst piece of crap I've ever had to watch - it was so bad I should have studied it :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is so bad that it's fun! It's not even close to the dirty CGI animations in Spawn, that's so bad, it's har har ... I'm overwhelmed by the fact that some distribution company really put the money down to release this on DVD but I think they'll get it more money because the cost could not be more than a few hundred dollars. It's terrible that the nursery class would do it. <br /> <br /> Look at it and laugh!
