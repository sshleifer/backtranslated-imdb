Men, I love police movies full of action, shooting, chase, etc. Boy, I was going after watching this short and unsatisfactory movie. We've seen it all before, hostage, bank, neighbor ... Nevertheless, two evil men who shot several officers and innocent people who just stayed in the fire - without getting to Kevlar. br /> <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Go back to the bank where you do not talk hostages do not lock the safe or the door when they drive out bad guys. How stupid the director thought we would be. Okay, the shots between this fake documentary filter were good, but after seeing the movie, I thought why the police did not get a decent shootout course? And why there were so many cops and SWAT was for a real long break. Really bad.
