Fun concept, but badly executed. In addition to the relatively good effects of makeup, it really is not much. There are obvious problems; for example, after accepting what seems to be a week and a week to get out of fat to normal size, the main character seems to be from normal size to deadly thin in days ... and once he is deadly thin, he stays nearly as deadly thin what seems to be a long time. In any case, the film has far worse problems than it - cinematography is definitely a low-budget-TV-quality show and most of all is pretty awesome all around. Robert John Burke seems to be always trying to get some strange penetrating personification of Charlton Heston, and it's really painful to watch ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I make this film as tall as I am is that once the film has entered its last 1/3 or so, and Joe Mantegne's figure has taken over, the film develops entertainment, the campfire "cheesefest battle" Feeling, and gangster crazy plans for the suffering of the totally unpleasant Gypsies are somewhat fun. The end, if foreseeable, is also a nice sign. Avoid if you are not a King-of-Phile or you are really psyched up on the idea of ​​Fat Tony's voice from Simpsons a terrorizing gypsy camp.
