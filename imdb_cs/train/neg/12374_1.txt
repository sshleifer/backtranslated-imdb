I do not remember seeing another murderous / mysterious movie as bad as this. This movie, about an investigator investigating the mysterious death of a friend in a car accident, has a complete proof of bad film: bad acting, boring story, lack of tension, bad humor, and no track. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a television station remarkable for the broken low-budget and campes made for television movies like this one. TV films, of course, have no boundary factor or tension, like big screen movies. But this movie certainly hit all the sour taste. The filmmakers missed the opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" a great television movie; title will offer you some tension. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, you do not have to watch this movie. This movie itself can kill your taste for TV. <br /> <br /> Grade F
