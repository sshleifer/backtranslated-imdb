The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares about older people. One day he decides to kill some of his relatives. At about the same time, he decides to model his killing after the 1960s of the zodiac. He gets in touch with the author of the Zodiac book and forms friendship. Michael has a weapon (seemingly the only weapon that appears to be in the hands of some other actors, but not shown as the same weapon.) And he got out of the murder. Original. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie if you love movies B. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editors and acting really drowned the story. I thought the "blood" was just too fake, in some places the lighting was terrible, and the dialogue was just too standard. The film was shot on video, which is fine, but the adaptation of the movie has just created some strange scenes "Plan 9". It's not a bad movie for fans of B-movie, but if you want something a little polished, go to something else.
