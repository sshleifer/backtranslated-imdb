In 1998, Michael Keaton's childhood comedy of the same title was convicted of being dirty special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George had prepared for this horror comedy, they have a positive mind. A killer snowman looks like he is made of polystyrene and his arms look like excessive gloves without gloves. Which was probably it. Casting it dense in this parody dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as a City Doctor is particularly memorable in a small but cheerful role.
