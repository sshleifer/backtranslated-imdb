If you see this turkey mentioned in the TV Guide, avoid it as a spider !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lime a great pile of fetid dingoes kidney does not have to start describing how this film is bad! There is only one fun scene (memory eruption scene), but it also measures only .001 on the laughmeter (out of 1000). Whoever would write this turkey meat should be forbidden to write another movie for life.
