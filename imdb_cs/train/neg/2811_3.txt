Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? It arrived on Sunday afternoon at 3:00 and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God my son was out, or I'd be scared if he saw soft / medium porn! People who make movies do not care about who is hurting or spoiling? Children could follow the church and that is what they show ??? !!! The game was good and I enjoyed the tension, but GEE! It was violence and bad guys, but that can be expected in Western film. Randy Travis was really good at his role. If writers, directors and producers have just left the launch of such unsolicited sexual scenes. What do you need to stop walking in this direction? Where can I complain?
