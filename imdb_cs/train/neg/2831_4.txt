I've seen it recently with my wife and found it better than Caine thinks, even if it's not too much a cop. The biggest British screening actor does not seem to care much about this role, which is a shame because he could lead him with greater conviction in his acting. Rex Harrison seems to be even less bothered, perhaps unexpectedly, because his character is very badly written. William Holden is better, but his time on the screen is ephemeral and again his character is not well written. Beverly Johnson is a beautiful woman I've ever seen, but she has little work, the film could get a lot by focusing more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character that does not touch the serious tone of the film. Music is bad and Omar Sharif is one of his many pointless cameras (his career has been based on it for decades). Richard Fleischer must be blamed for not doing it more effectively, he was a horrified, unpredictable film director, and that's one of his weaker films.
