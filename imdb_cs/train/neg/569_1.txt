Thank you for killing franchise with John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film sucks on so many levels that it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this austerity budget brings me a yawn. Jon Bon Jovi (Poor Kevin Bacon) will travel around Mexico with a surfboard, hiding a hidden section holding his vampire killing device Antonio Banderas's guitar case at DESPERADO. He picks up a couple of "hunters" along the way (including an annoying feminist infected girl who takes the pills to make it unchanged in a vampire), and they set out to stop a female master vampire, less on their way (walking through the sunlight, that he would steal the Black Cross and perform a ritual to allow it). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've seen it and made it much better. John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Honestly, I think he is his main and incapable of making another horror classic. The only decent film he has done since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is a bullshit, to the incredibly inexpensive, slow-seeking and slow-down GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this celluloid waste. Where are more giants like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), SAVE YOU FROM NEW YORK AND AGE? Carpenter Wallace shows that he can not write his way out of a paper bag with paper - the script full of yawns, moans and recycled gag from the originals. Did I mention that I hated all the characters in the movie? There was no unforgettable character throughout the movie. How's it going? This movie has nothing to recommend. Even a DVD presentation is not good; the menu looks awful. For comparison, JASON X: "WELCOME 13th place in space" was a masterpiece. Now it's a way to do the sequel and (again) energize franchise, ladies and fetters as well as create exciting DVD menus.
