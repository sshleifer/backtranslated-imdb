This film is not only a very bad film, with horrible actors - or presumed actors - in bored direction and uninteresting story, copying the scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso" directed by Sergio Martin 1973 (two years before), one of the most famous psycho-thrillers Italian film and cult film all over the world. In "La Sanguinusa leads la danza," the director plays the scene of the bed between the black girl and the white girl with peeping watching from the bedroom window. Of course, the scene in Rizza is ridiculous and inferior to softness and charming in the movie Martin. To give another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-thing who plays the scene is simply the best way to prove that Rizzo's film has no ideas, no original, no taste and nothing at all. I think such things are an offense to the audience.
