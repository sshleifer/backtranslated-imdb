Was this one of the most challenging movies I've ever seen? I do not know why? Just the stories about the guy he's about to marry, and instead he's going to love someone else. The story was told a thousand times. No new or innovative at all. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's wrong with this movie. Most of the time when these actors / actors are gathered by filming a movie that has been a million times before is really fun. Usually there is only a little clever thing in them that is not in any other. For some reason, this attention does not concern you. Can you choose some funny parts or smart ideas in it but for some reason they are simply not fun or smart in any way? I wish I explained it, did not I? Just do not waste time on this?
