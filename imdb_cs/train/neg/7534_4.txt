Mummy tells the wine about men, women, and sex between them. Huh? At the beginning, the mummy asks the viewer: "Imagine having sex with this girl, imagine that you have sex with this boy" about thirty times, while flickering images of half-empty young people. Later they said mods boys pelt mod girls with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or quickly move forward) the mummy, the shorts are not in themselves bad. I found some of them rather funny. My personal favorite is where a sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his lizard is sitting on the bed. This is one, well, bizarre movie.
