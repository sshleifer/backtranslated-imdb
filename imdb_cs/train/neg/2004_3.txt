I have read the book for a long time and do not remember the conspiracy, but remember that I enjoyed it. Since I'm sick on the couch at home, it looked like a good idea, and hey! It's a lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The film is populated by actors and class B actresses. <br /> <br /> The female cast is from Desperate Housewives. I've never seen a show, but there's a lot of show ads and I get the essence. Is not there anything original? Sure, but not for the whole life. The men are all pretty women looking and acting, but girls need to have a husband, I suppose. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a woman struggles with a man for his life and what does he do ??? Kick him in the testicles. What else? Women love it, but let me tell you something ... It's not as easy as it always does. It's not all bad. I got cold for an hour or two, so I have to pay for it.
