Saving Grace is surely one of the leading candidates for the "How to Destroy an Appropriate Movie in the Last Minutes" award. Naturally, if you mix a picturesque village in Cornish - a largely populated retired girl - with a liberal dose of marijuana, there will be some stupidity. The last seven minutes of the film, however, descends to absolutely absurd and is not even redeemed by being especially fun. It's a real shame because this comedy has the potential to be just as good as 1998 Waking Ned Devine, who also portrayed a picturesque little village and its inhabitants who want to get out of a tricky situation. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed by Grace Trevethyn, whose marital heritage of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of making money. The gardener helps her, Matthew, transform her horticultural knowledge into lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads to confrontation with the local police, the spouse of the spouse, and the French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . who all appear in their greenhouse at the same time. The relationship and relationship between Grace and Matthew is well-portraised, and Brenda Blethyn is emotionally involved with her character - you can really feel what is going on. Casting of minor roles is excellent, although some of them are somewhat unusually eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is very unlikely and does not even correspond to the tone of the film. And certainly not hydroponics such a revolution in the world of cannabis growth? Sadly, the film plays a gentle humor for rot and ends as fake as marijuana plants.
