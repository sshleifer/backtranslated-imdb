It was a tear-off of the same waste that we had to watch for half an hour before we watched Bob Saget's host. Dave Coulier just thought it funny and it was roughly the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos, except for the hosts who have a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen really needed money and Coulier had to go to the trash for his jokes. It was torture enough because they had to see him mimicking Popeye and other full cartoon witches starting at Full House. The guy who played all the practical jokes on all deserves to get to the end of grade A wedgie. Coulier had to need money to please Alannis Morisette when they dated.
