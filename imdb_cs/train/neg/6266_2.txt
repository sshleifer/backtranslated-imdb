It seems that someone can make a film today. It's like everything you need is a camera, a group of people that will be your cast and crew, script and little money and wall you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation, and often this kind of low-budget movies will appear as a bagpipe. The video store police are filled with these so-called "Movies". It's not even wine pleasure, they're simply wasting celluloids that are better forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making dice, but most of the films are from the movie Gold. However, some of the films they released did not have anything to do with making, and some, such as "Nightmare Weekend," did not deserve any form of release at all. <br /> <br /> Benefits: Cast members are doing the best with miserable material. Some unintentional cheer. It moves at a good pace (It should be 81 minutes). Disadvantages: Wonderful writing that contains nasty dialogue and countless holes. Badly illuminated, especially night scenes and an end you can not do at all. Does not make sense. He scored badly. Cheap and very dated effects. The overall lack of character development and you will not care for anyone. This is supposed to be a horror movie, but it's missing in this area and it's not even scary. Nothing interesting or exciting will happen. Loading unnecessary padding. <br /> <br /> Concluding thoughts: I never expected it to be a forgotten gem, but I never imagined it would be bad. I do not know if this is the worst movie ever made, but it's a certain candidate. Throma was supposed to let this film rotate instead of releasing him. Do not use the same mistake I've made and let your curiosity get you the best of you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
