I saw this movie originally in the theater when I was 10. Even at this age, humor was slightly offensive to my adolescent intelligence. In the past, whenever I saw Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum would break and he felt very uncomfortable and even a little sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this film today, I was not sure why I felt so. Obviously, I have blocked the memory of this film, yet my negative feelings have remained against the two offenders. I seem to have forgotten that I saw this movie, but I subduedly mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen from the authors of this inhumane work. <br /> <br /> I was not brave enough to see it as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process, I should probably focus on confronting this childish fear so I can really follow it. Some regression therapies and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea.
