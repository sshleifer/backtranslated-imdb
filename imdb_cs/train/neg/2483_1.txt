Undoubtedly uncompromising turkey, a mixture of anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie, which is one of the great problems: it's deadly. In addition to one-digit I.Q. conspiracy and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is berserk casting. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) strives for everything: playing romantic leadership (with his appearance and his age! He and Woody Allen should start a club for a hopeless, mirror aging comic), and he tries to be moving and entertaining, sad and smart, trying to sing and dance and succeed in NONE !! A long shot from his good old times with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> I thought I had myopia for a while, because everyone in the movie still says that Cherry Jones is this pretty girl and that Michael Cumpsty is this incredibly nice stallion! The guy who plays secretary Claire Bloom is a facial bald thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the subject of the passion of two leading women! Mike Starr, who was the most incompetent and saddest cop you've ever seen, deserves to be among the ten worst performers in recent film history. The saddest note is to see beautiful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukow absolutely wrong and attack. At least I hope the two stars have paid their bills home (and then fired their agents) with this flop. It is no surprise that acting by the miracle of Sukowa has returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood has! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to get a really bad movie from a really bad screenplay with a berserk casting director, study this - otherwise stick on! - 1/10
