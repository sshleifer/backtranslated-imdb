Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally watched this terrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off in the first 10 minutes but I thought I'd give him a chance because he had to improve. Or at least have some redeemed features, as if I thought at least that you would think that the type of film, or as really intelligent, or very well filmed or something ... No need to say it was not the case and I wasted for about an hour and half life. I do not even think why it's terrible because it's a waste of time to explain that this "may contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down the spoilers thing and pay more attention to ensuring you rate your movies and comments it is not good for you to write good reviews or to participate in any way in the movie or anything else. I thought it would be funny after this terrible movie that came to see hoe bad rating would be and I was very shocked to see a relatively high rating ... all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be some completely different film .. I'm still a big IMDb fan but seriously re-evaluate this rating process because this movie should not be rated higher than maaaybbbeee as 3.
