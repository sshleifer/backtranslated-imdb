An expedition led by enthusiastic Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition. She meets the beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They soon find themselves face to face with a mummy with blood ... and Simira just knows what's going on. Real delays. I caught it on late night TV when I was about 10. I could sleep! When I saw it again so many years later, I see why. It's a slow motion, the mummy does not even show in 40 minutes (and it's only 66 minutes!), Playing moves from bad (Dana) to really bad (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood found. This film focuses on second-rate dramatics (including a stupid love triangle) rather than horror. <br /> <br /> It's three stars, because it really looks pretty good, they all play straight, there's a good actress from Diane Brewster, it's short, and mummies (all three) are not bad. They are not scary, just scary. Still, this movie is very bad. Certain fire cure for insomnia.
