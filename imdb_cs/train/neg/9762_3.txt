Alan Alda plays writer George Plimpton, who was really "sporty illustrated," who was invited to become a member of the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather unnecessary, insurmountable drama curiously mitigated by fantasy. Director Alex March is interested in this material interestingly, shoots him in quasi-cycling mode (with a macho commentary) while giving the story a touch of capraesky whims; yet by developing a cinematic flash in this arrangement, it turns the main narrative into mixing. Alda's complacent, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is full of real pro-athletes (and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend - how is it for fantasy?). * 1/2 from ****
