I believe Shakespeare explained what I read beautifully. I think he (the lady) is too protesting. The whole thing seemed to me as if the author tried to convince himself! Located in unsuccessful literature (writings of the same time period, but unrelated to the Bible) many times, but I can think of at least three references from the top of my head, which accurately confirm the historical events in the Bible. Anyone can combine data and prove what they like, but that does not mean it's true. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English and German, of course, the roots are common) nothing remains the same, it is still growing and changing. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James version is the one I found the best in any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice that there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added to the translator and can be released and the average of the whole verse will change. The writings of the time of Christ were written without a space, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These writings look like one long word and the translators added all of the above. For example, how would you read it: GODISNOWHERE you read it because God is not nowhere, or are you reading it because God is here? The same string of letters has two completely different meanings. That is why many Bible scientists use "Lexicon" to help them translate, as it provides a word for translation from original Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew, depending on the language in which it was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when you translate into symbolic logic, you prove that God exists, but you can not prove it does not exist! Finally, I like to listen to people who think they are so smart they are qualified to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! When we put off the soapbox, God blesses Maegi
