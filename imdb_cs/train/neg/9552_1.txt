Just a good old fool. I mean, really stupid, not stupid like Killer Tomatoes or Ed Wood movies, it's probably the deepest movie I've ever seen. To give this film golden turkey is an insult to turkeys. Calling this movie is silly offensive even for silly people. As far as the future of American cinematography and art is concerned, it is better that we actually start World War 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my only one braindl. <br /> <br /> It's a really good movie if you're suicidal.
