I watched Envy two days ago, on a DVD, in a friendly house. The premise of this movie is very promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with great potential, but he can not deliver. I looked at him with about five friends and nobody liked the whole movie. Jokes (which are few and far apart) NEVER are funny ... the story line is crap and they never answer the question ... WHERE SH * T GO? Of course, the answer is NEVER. This film lacks any comic value, and as some other users say, the only thing that's even worth watching is Christopher Walken as J-man. None of the characters is developed, the plots so thin that it is almost transparent - and is it the song all over the movie should be funny?
