One missed call, another Asian horror based on a cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror film based on the "Pon" mobile phone. One missed call was as boring as the one. Maybe the phones are just not frightening or something like that, but this step was boring and boring. No tension or excitement for me, and the last monster was disappointedly deep and insignificant. The film stretched somewhat in various parts and felt too long. He did not hold my attention. It seems the phones are hard to make terrifying, it's like trying to make the pop automat note. And it's ridiculous to compare it with "The Ring," it seems that every Asian horror film is compared to it and so far I have seen no such change in the least. To Horror Directors - Disconnect the phone from the hook as a horror device.
