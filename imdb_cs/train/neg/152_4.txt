You can consider some facts about spoilers in the discussion. I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to get this Oscar, and I think the academy was right to vote. (Other Oscars for Best Actor nominations and such ... I do not know but it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg drives it is so devised, so unpleasant. While watching this film, I made the differences I made during the Film as art course and screamed at me: "Sentiment is a sincere feeling frankly. Sentimentality is a sweet and unreal, false look at life." This is a sentimentality beyond the peak. When in real life, someone ever starts to read loudly in synchronicity, how do Celie and Shug Avery do when they sit on the bed and pass through the Nettie letters they found? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the movie: all men pile up around Miss Millie's car and then jump in unity as a flock of birds take off when she goes to go; Harpo falling over the roofs of the various buildings on which it works (cheap jerk); a whole group of people heading out of the Jook Joint together into the chapel as if magically interested in choir singing ... keep going. Nothing is true. I even wondered if the name Harpo was chosen because it was the real name of his wife Sophie, "Oprah", back. Spielberg is not over such "cuteness". It is not so that Spielberg is unable to act frankly out of action and emotion. Schindler's list was amazing, deeply touching me, and I very much admire Saving Private Ryan for his realism, even though the story is a little fancy.
