I saw this cinematic mischief in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (back when the tickets were actually sold for $ 1). This is the only film I ever left (with my friend, while the screen was an idiocy that is a sketch of "Laser Bra 2000"). It is obvious that the reaction of my friend and my friend to the film was common. It's not that I found a film offensive (either as an 18-year-old or now) but rather a fool, stupid and apparently unhappy, rid of the unintentional humor that makes Ed Wood. That's why NBC has refused to broadcast it, rather than misunderstanding Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to lead the movie banker). <br /> <br /> I was surprised that this film apparently did not publish a list of the "10 Worst Movies of All Time". It definitely does mine. You were warned.
