Unbelievably bad acting, no good, unclear story, and flamboyant images and slow movements where they are least needed: Adrenaline is all that the film should not be. Georgina Verbaan (a so-and-so Dutch soap actress who did not participate in her English classes) plays a rich Freya girl who has the habit of "seeking excitement." What basic things do dangerous pieces, break things and poison people. And not in the fun way Jackass. Then there is the Dragon (Rivas). Sometimes he leads the group, but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there's Frey's dad (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. Finally, we got Jason (debutant Fyall), a friend from Freya. One day Freya will disappear and everyone seems to be involved, but we, the spectator, really do not care, because none of them is either sympathetic or credible and the story makes no sense. Why did it even happen? 2/10.
