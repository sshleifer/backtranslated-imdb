Oh, CGI. Blessing when properly used. Sin with people who do not know what they are doing. It's sad that this is not the only thing that is wrongly used in this unsuccessful picking of the bumps. Okay, someone who reads a number of my posts probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low-budget horror. And 2: If a cute guy is a low-budget movie, we usually show them. So, let's get out of the way right now. This is a low-budget horror movie I did not like. It's mostly horrible, laughing, and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I've seen this year. As for the local cute boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins this prize. This boy's hot! And surprisingly, it's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute ass ... it can actually act (well, as much as possible in this courageous movie). Now that we have the cleaning work off the road, let's continue with it. <br /> <br /> In Cliff Notes, there is a story (do not worry, I'm trying to give up) ... The film crew travels to the remote island to record a documentary of two surfers (a cute boy and his friend) Surfing sharks. It is unknown to them a relatively large saltwater crocodile hiding around the island. Croc appears, confusion arises and people are eating. Roll end credits. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie pretty much blows. It started quite well, but soon it became stupid and stupid. The main character becomes lunch (somewhat humorous) and our remaining heroes pay one costly ship at the cost of the victims. Also, if this rafter is at the top of the food chain both on the ground and in the water, what is all the sharks around? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think there will be a few modest sharks around her. FX is one of the worst I've ever had dissatisfaction with. CGI is terrible and even managed to squeeze animatronic crocs. Beware, filmmakers. National geography. Discovery Store. Croc Hunter. They know how crocodiles look. Obviously, you did not refer to any of these judgments by appearing a monstrous look at the end of the movie. And what about the gang of pirates / drugs? Did you just need another reason why you tore the woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's fun to get small genres in the world of movies. With Alligator and its sequel, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, it now looks like the "crocodile / alligator" movies should now get to Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Tobe Hooper's crocodile was good. Blood Surf, soaked. <br /> <br /> My degree: D-
