This is one of the movies I want to be at the bar. The film is quite frankly boring. Which story is very delicate and you have to guess. The film is accompanied by demanding camera techniques that seem to be deliberate to cause migraines and make it a student film. Did I say it's boring? If at the end of the movie suddenly died all the characters, I would not have to worry less because I had no emotional relationship to any of them. There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but it was about it. This is the first time I ever thought of going out of the cinema during the show, but I believed it had to improve. I was wrong. The kind of movie you could threaten naughty kids.
