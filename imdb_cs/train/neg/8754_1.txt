This movie is really terrible. After I saw the ad, I thought it might have its magic ... but it was not. Girls can not act and can not sing. The soundtrack of this movie is full of their songs and it's not a nice look, a terrible storyline, incredible plot, one of Disney's worst movies! Ally is not a bad actress for "Phil of the Future," so I do not know what happened in "Cow Belles". And her sister, AJ, seems to have only seemed to be her sister glory "fame", and she has no talent whatsoever. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learn some morality clich√©, but it's too late to save this train wreck. <br /> <br /> Amazing
