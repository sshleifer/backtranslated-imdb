It was a cruel waste of time. No plot. The effect was so far below the plane, it should be used as an example in the acting classes of what you WILL NOT do. It is only a commercial break-up of an older universal soldier who also shakes the bottom of the acting barrel. Sadly, VD needs its ego to enforce every few years, and it is still sadder that people will pay good money to sit down. This kind of scholar gives the film of martial arts a bad name. By way of comparison, Segall, Norris and Arnold seem almost talented. Maybe VD should take Leslie Nielson's track and do the send-ups of his genre. And at least we could laugh at him instead.
