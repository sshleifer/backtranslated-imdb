A truly frightening film. She feels like she was a direct person in the early 1990s who wanted to show that homosexuals are good, normal people who are the mainstream. Retrospective to offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred way to salvation for sad, lonely sex fools. Wow! Who knows? Supporting characters are caricatures of homosexual stereotypes (feminine kašpar, bitter, lonely queen, phagová háje, etc.) and the main characters are darling, middle-class, middle-class clones of little interest. <br /> <br /> As far as the couple's romantic and ideological matches are concerned, there's not much to say: we've seen it before and we've done much better.
