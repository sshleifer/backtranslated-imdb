it is, of course, very nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, but I would expect something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. starting with a scenario which, in my view, is not wise, as some may think. especially the sophistication of dialogues that give viewers a position as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations that are mostly making the movie unbearable. has also an obvious end; you can easily perceive the killer from the beginning. the weakest part of the scenario lies in the fact that the inability of seriously ill patients to act as normal people as well as the professionals right now! sometimes they have been looking for patients who are on heavy medication to behave as professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people can not use, also in the scene where employees searched for the most dangerous patient without any weapon that would be protected was another a special point of the film. and the scene was so suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! they are not the only weak parts of the film. was very valuable in the movie. the rendering of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal, and it seems Togan at the very end is the worst mistake he could make in his first movie! an upset about the size of the film and the interviews that the actor had just given people to be curious and make them see. Gen is complete disappointment. I would like to wonder that if Sahan was not so famous, could Togan shoot this movie with this amount of budget? I hope Togan realizes that it is not fashionable to act as a director, as he said in an interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely, and Night Shyamalan did it! you should be aware of the fact that Hitchcock and Shyamalan are not yet !!!! hopes to be next-door and creative in this big industry!
