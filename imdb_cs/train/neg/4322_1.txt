Read and note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (it was all!). <br /> <br /> This movie is constantly grieving and trying to produce (I think) the modern American town of Capra-style fable. If it fails ... completely and completely fails. I'm trying to think about one good thing and I can not. Let me mention some of the most important ... <br /> <br /> People will not die, they can spend eternity as immigrants in the Santa factory. Angels are, in fact, former cowboys sitting on trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Even the photographs are gloomy - Snow appears at the end of the freezing, it looks cold, damp and miserable everywhere. <br /> <br /> As you can guess, the movie has a happy (schmaltzy) end. What a relief!
