When I borrowed this film from a friend (fortunately I did not buy it), the "Final Vampire Horror" was printed on the package (which really looked bad and ugly). After watching, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is haunted by some vampire / zombie makers. Illumination, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt at holidays on a ten year old VHS system, if not worse. The movie I gave 2 out of ten and just because the promo-T-shirts looked a bit cool. I do not want to reject movie students or spit in general, but I saw Braindead and I saw a movie from students that is ten times better than that bullshit.
