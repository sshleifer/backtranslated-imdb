I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I have just seen makes all his direct editions on the video over the last few years seem like his initial 90-year hit in comparison. The Secret Bio Lab does a new kind of drug that will lift the human adrenaline system until they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its end of the world ... or something. Seagal also traveled like jellybeans, every time I looked up to command new faces so it was hard to follow the evolution of personality, and I know that Steven's athsma prevents him from screaming to the top of his lungs, but so why is he constantly dubbed people who sound like him? Typically, movie scenes and action sequences can save themselves from the complete loss of time, but it was not even close. As I said, it was more of a horror movie with lots of blood and leg than to quarrel. The problem was that it was not really scary, and Seagal looked right, because the infected people had a speed of light movement even though the 40-year-old Seagal 280 pounds killed them unilaterally? I think the lonely peak of the movie was the first 20 minutes when new recruits asked Seagala to come to the club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
