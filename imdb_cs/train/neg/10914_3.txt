Isn 't it funny if the average schmurra that leads to miserable life suddenly becomes somewhat magical, turns your life upside down and will it teach you some valuable lessons on the way? This pattern never gets older, right? It's such a sure fire way of doing a classic movie! Take a look at important hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... It must have been Rob Schneider's thought, when he did the partially successful Deuce Bigalow: The Man Gigolo and followed it with The Animal. Because I've already seen the fence through sarcasm, let me paint it more: Schneider plays a loser cop who suddenly got involved in a tragic accident but rescued him by surgery ... which causes him to bad times behaves like a horse, runs like a cheetah, etc. This movie is somewhat more enjoyable than other films with Schneider's film (for example, another hot-dog follow-up by The Hot Chick), but almost feels they want to hate viewers by casting television star as a romance (Colleen Haskell of "Survivor") and portrait of Norm Macdonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. We apologize - nothing unforgettably good except for the value of production. I just want to end this review by making slight references to other movies in the movie may be fine, but when it comes to lines that are delivered exactly the same way ("You can do it!"), There is a word - "milking." Actually, there's another word - "cheap."
