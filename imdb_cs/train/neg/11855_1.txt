This is one of those films that appear on cable like two in the afternoon to talk about bored women in the home. This is the second speed. Poor Mathew Modine seems to be getting the whole movie to sleep. And God will help Gina Gershon. Her accent is too high. Sounds like a true English woman. It sounds forced and fake, just like her acting. She should stick to what she does best, a lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. Other characters are not better. They are two-dimensional. empty, defective and stupid. How should we care about these people? At one point, Christy Scott Cashman is losing in Central Park. Really? It's not that difficult to navigate Central Park. Just follow any path. Not only did I care about NO characters, I hated them. The only reason I've even stayed with this film wreck was Fisher Stevens. Even his great humor could not save this dying fish. Every scene is a typical romantic comedy ride and nothing leaves us to surprise. The script was horrible as well as acting. If you are going to throw this fish back!
