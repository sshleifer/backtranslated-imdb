As a fan of horror films, I try to keep track of all the major news of this genre, especially those that are the products of my native cinematography. And I can say that the "power of fear" (or "Vedma" as her Russian title) is one of the weakest movies among them. First, it can not frighten a little child, it moves so slowly and so predictable that there is no room for real horror. To be honest, it is bad at all points: from the Gothic plot (I do not know why the Russian producers / director decided to turn the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into some laughing and ridiculous American thriller of a modern day, previous reviewer - it is not a little exciting) cheese work of actors. All the actors, including the leaders of Valeri Nikolaev and Yevgeniy Kryuk, who are very famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something similar, and they seem to have not even bothered to play, just speaking English without any expression. And at the end I do not understand why they shot a film in English with Russian actors? I think that was their wrong direction. At least they could bring some American or English actors to the front to make them look more convincing. The same thing I can say about the so-called "Small American Urban Background", which was shot in Estonia and it looked like that. The only positive moment I found in the "power of fear" is the visual effect. They are not excellent, but rather good for Russian film. And the music is all right, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give two stars. Overall, if you want to see a good horror movie? do not waste your time and money on this boring movie. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I advise you to find a copy of Viy or the Spirit of Evil. It's a truly amazing film based on the same novel as "Power of Fear," but much, much better.
