if they gave me the possibility of negative numbers I would use. This movie was really terrible. I went to theaters and expected it to be terrible, and somehow I managed to overcome my expectations. The script was weak and acting was painful. I wanted to go out but my friend was driving and wanted to get the money, it's worth it, I think we were both disappointed. Growing breasts when girls get their super performance and change hair color was wrong. Eddie Izzard seemed ill for being a super villain. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came as psychotic and strange as Matthew (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.
