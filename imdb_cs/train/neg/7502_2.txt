I've always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this was a total waste of about 2 1/2 hours. I was expecting more of the Son of Sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have little to do with serial murders in 1977. The talking dog was ridiculous (you know you have trouble when all film patrons laugh inappropriately). The whole movie looked very incoherent and was not very interesting. Sexual scenes were totally unavoidable for action. I'm not in movies against sex but should have some point (unless it's a XXX movie). Overall, we were very disappointed with this effort by Spike Lee!
