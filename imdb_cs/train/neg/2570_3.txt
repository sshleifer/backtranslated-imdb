I read that "There's a Girl in My Soup" came Peter Sellers during the low season. I'm not surprised when watching the movie. Nothing happens in the movie. It seems that the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film; It is not. The whole movie seems to have just accidentally shot everything that happened without writing anything. Maybe I have not seen every middle-aged movie for older people trying to be hippies, but this film gives such a bad name. <br /> <br /> Overall, Sellers and Hawn played much better movies than this, so do not waste time on it. Pretty worthless.
