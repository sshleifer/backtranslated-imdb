His spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character blinked at her chest. That was pretty tight. Before and after, the film is quite hurt. The game is like an E-list and it's well-presented in the movie. Not to mention that the budget is so low that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are playing the same person. The entire movie looks like it was shot by the camcorder instead of half a decent movie. The only other reason I liked the film was that Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. Besides, if you saw this movie in Blockbuster, do each favor hidden behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be mentally rated.
