What an unnecessary opportunity to really make an interesting film about a complicated topic. There is little research on what really feels as a straight (or homosexual) man working in a homosexual sexual environment. Dancers still talk about their art as if they had no erotic component. Not all prostitutes need to be hired, but they are really sex workers who play fantasies and sell private seating where more than dancing is offered. The film would have the impression that she liked the women who go to gay clubs and eventually hire "dancers" for a private meeting. Even the shots in the club show only women in front of the stage and "dancers" only play on women in the audience. It's simply not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite hard to make a living to make private dances for even women and couples. So what do they feel about their gay admirers and clients? We will learn very little. Instead, we get a fill. Gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about costumes but does not provide any information about the dancer's life and attitudes. Pictures from Mexico City are generic. False assembly, which shows the roasting of sausages, is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a totally simplistic film that should be interesting only for those who want to see some pictures dancing nice guys. The rest of the film is an insult to homosexuals.
