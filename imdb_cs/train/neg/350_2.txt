The theater performance of Fishbourne (which is a bit strangely fun) and Ed Harris (short feature) are remarkable, unlike Connery, who apparently does not make sense in his role and end up in the motoring behavior of an 80 year old man. The script does not really make sense; Imagine 60 minutes. happy end fence plus a sudden change of attachment without any argumentation structure with respect to the characters. It's more an accident than a screenplay and can be useful for screening purposes at screen-wrights. The more you recall the details, the stronger this impression is. The death penalty is not a problem here, although it is an object from the beginning; it will disappear slightly without further comment. Subject and environment could be good.
