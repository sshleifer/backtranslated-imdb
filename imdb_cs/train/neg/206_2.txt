I gave this movie two stars just because Dominic Monaghan really made his efforts in his acting. Everything else about this movie is extremely amateur. Everything connected with the direction of this film was very badly done. The director should not only rethink what he's doing for his life career, but maybe he should watch several movies. Dominik Monaghan is a very trusted actor who puts him in a movie of this caliber, so he looks terrible. Anyone who was an "actor" who played Jack's best friend should never come in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small film, but perhaps some time and effort should be devoted to people and their surroundings. Do not waste time or money on this movie (just like me), you will be very disappointed.
