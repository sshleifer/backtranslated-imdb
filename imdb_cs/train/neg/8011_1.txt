I really had to capture another movie from other commentators on this site, because at the premiere of the movie at night the audience was so humiliated by the dialogue that (or I'm not kidding) half left. The film, as if thinking of approaching some daring new territory by presenting the story of the homosexual story, uses the visuals inspired by David Lynch, inspired by Fassbinder's acting performance. The performances in this movie are so dull and boring that I thought one of the actors would go for it as if the screenplay was unspoken. What's worse is that it's colorful as the Miami Vice episode. I do not know who the director thinks he is; may have claims to be unreal as Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all of the above-mentioned directors have a level of erudite sensitivity that is not enough here. I could understand the meaning of this movie about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces such as bad education, mysterious skin and show me love, why bother with this movie turde? There's nothing new here.
