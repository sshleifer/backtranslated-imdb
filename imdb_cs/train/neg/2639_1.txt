Let me first start this review with the fact that I signed just to write a review and warned people to save their money! It was one of the worst pieces of waste I've seen from The Hulk. The plot was the most predictable waste you could possibly come up with. If you expect 24, but on the big screen, flush this expectation down to the toilet instantly along with the money you would use on the ticket. You can get more joy in this way. The game was horrible, the plot was totally unrealistic (along with the so-called "twist" at the end.) I have to say this .. I ended up surprised, I do not mean the conspiracy plot that surprised me, but instead effortlessly that they could be considered together behind a single scene somewhat decent action throughout the movie. They climbed so fast that I did not even realize it was over until I had seen the credits that rolled and at that moment I thought I was burning the reel of a movie if I could just find out how to get into the design room. Casting was terrible for several reasons: first they had to accidentally switch assigning characters because Michael Douglas played the role CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland was supposed to play. While Douglas sneaked through agents, tapped on phone lines, hacked into systems, and pulled out the people who followed him, Sutherland played a less capable agent who was always in the mood, even though it was not bad for him. He plays a very hideous agent, nothing like his Jack Bauer is playing for 24 darling fans. I can only promise you that this film will be disappointing in all areas. This may be best compared to the remake of "The Fugitive" / "In the Fire Line" but written by people with mental disabilities
