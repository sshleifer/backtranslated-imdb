Released on the DVD in the UK as Ax, Choke is a teenager slasher who fails in almost every department: the story is almost nonexistent, leading to a movie that consists mostly of people wandering around a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are obviously destined to survive films), they are all reluctant, which means that the viewer can not care less when they are killed; deaths are not severe enough (if a short shot of pounded beef covered with fake blood changes your stomach); and the carefree sexual scene appears without any nudity (an unforgivable mistake that happens when a swinging swing!). A thin pebble plot sees punk band members locked inside what appears to be the world's largest night club (there are endless deserted corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where an invisible invader chooses them. At a low budget effort, production values ​​are okay, and actors seem to be more capable actors, but with almost zero real terror, unwilling to get into the mess (that's slasher, so where is the graphical scuffle?), Too terrible dialogue (especially from the motionless early enough drummer) and some poorly recommended use of sticky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the movie becomes very boring.
