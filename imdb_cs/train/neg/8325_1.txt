I just saw this movie last night and I was still disappointed because I was someone who had very little expectations. The biggest mistake in this film's abomination is that the main point of the plot (the guy who wakes up during the operation) had nothing to do with the result. That would end in the same way no matter what. So, what was the point? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had four naval suits, and did not think people were asking if the patient died on his desk? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is totally without talent and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just ridiculous from start to finish. I'm pretty sure that if you could feel that someone is cutting a shriek through your chest, you'll have more pain.
