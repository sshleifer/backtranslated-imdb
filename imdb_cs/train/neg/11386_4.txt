One of those documentary films "Thank-God-Not-Live". This tells of two fighting factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries and the surrounding nations of Medellin. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and death run uncontrollably. Boys, not older than 22 years of age, not fighting the war, are in jail. Girls ?? not women, girls ??? Always respond the same way when one of them is killed, with tears and screaming. You scratch your head; what did they expect? I do not know what is more disturbing: night shots and civil unrest or that all seem to passively accept things as they are. Or see that boy drinking what he does not seem to be his first beer, what, 10? If you took these young men out of their situation and gave them a place where they could do more, how much would they choose not to keep? <br /> <br /> Based on this document, I'm afraid.
