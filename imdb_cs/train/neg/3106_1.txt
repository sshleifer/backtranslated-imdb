Whenever I create a list of absolutely the worst movies I've ever seen, this film is always on it. He has no redemption. It took all the will to possess the whole thing, and before that I poured my own blood before I had to sit down again. What's wrong with her? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to the midnight show on Saturday night. I was the only one in the theater alone, and a lot of loud, noisy, rather indecent teenagers who were sitting somewhere behind me. It was obvious they had a good time on Saturday night, and they came to this "comedy" for some laughter. Before the start of the movie, they laughed and joked during the previews and commented loudly on the old old days. It was boundary unpleasant; if they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into a real movie, maybe I said something, but I felt tolerant and empathetic to their lively pastime, so I let go. And when the movie started, they settled down. Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" with an effect that was not just on itself but on this deafness. <br /> <br /> During the whole movie, no one in the theater smiled. Not even once. I'm not alone, not crazy kids. Absolute silence, except soundtrack. And when the film ended and the lights turned on, we all, all of us, slowly pulled out of the theater in a slow, dark, absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. That was the effect that this "comedy" produced. No laughter, not joy, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing film and it was not a bit sad. Preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not entertaining. I consider Melbourne "Blazing Saddles" the most beautiful. I'm still blown away that the same gentleman might be responsible for probably the smallest fun movie ever. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: If you feel too happy to give this film of faith; otherwise do not say I warned you.
