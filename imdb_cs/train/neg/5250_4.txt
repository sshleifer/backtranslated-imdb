I absolutely enjoy the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited to hear that a film based on a book is in history. But I was really disappointed with the movie when I saw it because it did not catch up to what I loved about the book - the ridiculously funny Eric and the interesting way he looks at the world. From the beginning of the movie I realized that things were not Like I imagined in the book. So I just went for a ride. It was not that bad, I think. Miss Belmont was totally different from what I imagined! I did not think it was smoke and beer - Jean Kittson playing it is funny! Actually, I thought the movie and actors / actresses made him good, but unfortunately, I'm such a fan of a book (one of my favorite books) that I could not help, but I felt disappointed = P
