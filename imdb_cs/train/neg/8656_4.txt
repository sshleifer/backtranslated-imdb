This is the first non-zombie subgenre review ive done, but this movie is worth a review. Dinocroc is generally a good film, but unfortunately the b-film is still obvious. Dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought the film itself needs a bit more weight than in action and violence because whenever a croc is displayed or on a combat scene there is not much except croc is displayed and croc either kills or is repeated in a repeat process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus, and the acting was better than the average, and the most surprising thing is that the crocodile looked faintly, instead of a coughing caricature * curse comodo * cough. I enjoyed this film so much that I'm glad it's a sequel that's more than what I can say about some movies in general. A total of 3/6 stars and worth a watch.
