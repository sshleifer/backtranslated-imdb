On the day he finally came to see for me the persistence of Azumi's fate as a murderer, the realization of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world that went so ruthlessly during the first saga. <br /> <br /> It's as poetic as when I'm talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I recovered the heavy sentimentality of the House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto, which portrays the bloody killer, 2 I began to appreciate the shortcomings mentioned above more than ever before. <br /> <br /> Not only does the assassination of each killer appear to be slow and unsuccessful, but many of the important elements are omitted. In Azumi 1, we saw that murderers are using various stealth tactics (their number one priority), as well as logic that makes their stamps easier to execute with quick executions and faster escape capabilities. But this time I will not take this film, because this time the story is slightly improved and Azumi causes her more obstacles to avoid getting to the warrior and showing no signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly postponed for much of the film and is basically playing a moderated Go Go, minus cool weapons and a sense of danger. <br /> <br /> It brings me to the final punch, which is an action just masked in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic. In the first half of the movie we see the debut of many promising opponents with breathtaking looks and even exciting weapons. Because of no surprise, they sometimes meet with them, but the film is inadequate when each of them begins to die too fast and too easily. In Azumi 1, young assassins were largely overwhelming the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying wars, and the final settlement between Azumi and Bijomaru compared with the Azumi 2 fights at least culminated and is worth it. Some interesting effects were introduced, but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the lack of each meeting. I am not disappointed with the conventional style of Samurai films with their quick and realistic battles, but the characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and directly from the anime that the rules could be broken and the action should be enriched further. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> As an open-minded fan for a wide range of films and animations, I will not lie and admit to my neutrality and a lack of respect to the first Azumi film, but I will say right away that after watching Azumi 2, he looked like a flawless masterpiece. For what it is worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love would go straight to the video, with an invisibly richer budget and an unsuccessful opportunity to add or even expand on the bumpy path of desperate killers, according to their strength to restore peace, with the unwavering courage to die.
