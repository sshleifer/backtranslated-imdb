What seemed to be a good presumption of the movie ... unfortunately does not reach almost every level. Very hard to watch at the beginning of the movie I really found myself struggling with the desire to turn it off the biggest issue from a visual point of view is the fact that working with the camera is simply over the top with so many "arty" splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the movie that they actually take off from the whole. He really tries too much to dump you momentarily and build on a thrilling end, but the film has only half the concepts and an inappropriate script that just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused for trying to go so deeply.
