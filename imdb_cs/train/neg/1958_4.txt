Where to start. This movie started out as something that looked like a "Darkness Falls" breakup. The old, disfigured woman living in the woods gives children gifts for their teeth. Does it sound familiar? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls," the fairy teeth killed you only when you saw her. The daddy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need a rocker, his hippie girlfriend or Bubbase and their sister? I think it would be a movie without them. The producers seem to have sat down and decided they needed more people in the movie to make the inherited fairy people kill. Although it is nice to see a pretty blonde who is not portrayed as a bubble-head for change. I'd better rent it, but I would not buy it.
