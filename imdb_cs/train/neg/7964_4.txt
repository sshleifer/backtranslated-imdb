"Creepshow 2" is something more than a white imitation of the original that was designed with a different meaning than changing the name of the previous movie. It even amplifies the shortcomings of its predecessor, which was often predictable and difficult. Yet, for the first time, there was enough excitement to deal with regular rest, resulting in uneven but generally quite amusing efforts. The sequel has a few useful moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more apparent. From time to time it brings, but most of the time it just takes. <br /> <br /> Just like in the original, all stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts. The wooden Indian is alive and killing the murderers of his owner with vengeance. Teenagers are absorbed by a water creature. The hunter returns from the dead to watch the careless motorist. None of these spaces is in itself bad, but they lack the inspiration. There are a few surprises and no fear. This is a textbook example of motion picture without motifs. It does not help to make this cheap film look flat-footed, though, to be honest, it was not much work. Finally, the second story comes out best, but not much. <br /> <br /> Most of the performances are fine. George Kennedy, as an unhappy business owner, does an adequate, if not particularly inspired, job. Dorothy Lamoura, on the other hand, is quite good as a motorbike who felt a vindictive, sympathetic to her situation, despite the predictable and redundant material. However, most characters are thin overall overall. <br /> <br /> One would think that "Creepshow 2" would prove to be better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to the script, based on more stories by Stephen King. Makeup Effects Artist Tom Savini turns into some good, cruel work. So why is the film disappointing? I think Romero really did not want to make a second film, but he was forced to do so for financial reasons. It was a decade of horrible sequels, clones, rip-off and whatever, so this was certainly inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script is rushing, picking up his paycheck and running. I think he had to do what was necessary to finance his projects; we can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (from ****) Released New World Pictures
