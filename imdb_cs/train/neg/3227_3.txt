This is a repayment in a notorious series of guinea pigs. A short-lived Japanese TV show that was canceled after the psychopath admitted to being inspired by killing a young schoolgirl show. This short series, like all other movies in the series, is practically free of any storyline. A group of men captured a young woman. They bind her down and continue to torture her to death while videofilming her. They took her, poured boiling oil on her, used the pliers, and finally, in "loving" detail, pushed the needle with her eyes. This is the most direct of all Guinea Pig films and one of the first. It was probably the movie that, more than any other, gave Guinea Pigu a reputation for being slick. They surely inspired Nicolas Cage's "8 mm" film. These films have become quite popular in horror circles. They continued in polished yet graphic films like "Naked Blood". They probably fill the emptiness left in the Mondo films, which has calmed down slightly and become a television reality. It is not recommended, but it is likely to attract those who will see something once, and I wonder why, then, I know I did.
