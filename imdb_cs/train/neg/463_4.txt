Blonde and Blonder were unhappy. Apparently this was a terrifying girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less fun and using too many sounds and background music. IMPROVE A LOT OF BASIC NOISE AND MUSIC IF YOU HAVE A PLEASE !!!! It's getting very boring and totally inane.It is not a step anywhere soon, and I felt more frustrated as this nonsense went on. Maybe, the only thing that saved me before this movie 1 was the last 30 minutes. I found it somewhat fun and interesting as it was coming to an end, but that was the only part. I also could not help, but like Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard's characters a little. Even though this movie did not get any laughing from me it kept my attention. I do not want to avoid this movie completely, but there are thousands of better quality movies that spend time and money than Blonde and Blonder.
