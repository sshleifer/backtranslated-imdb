There is no way to avoid a comparison between a cat in a hat and Grinchem, which is a Christmas tree, so we can skip this part of the way. First of all, let me start by thinking that Grinch is an underestimated and unexpected film. The cat was ... well, that's terrible. Jim Carey was busy because he is a great physical comedian, and he has ruthlessly pledged over the top, nasty characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks. Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? Children may be less concerned and Austin Powers demographic model will not spy on this movie. So what did the studio think? The cat was obviously linked to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why New York Accent? Not quite in line with anything Dr. Seuss sometimes wrote. Myers even allowed himself to intertwine with his Scottish hook. I wonder how many different voices the director and studio tried to adjust before they just went out and said, "until you say fahklempt," you can keep accents. "Meyers never seemed to find any comfort, either with a costume, make-up or a diary, and jokes that were few, rough and ageless, when Myers picked up a garden hoe and added it to the camera:" dirty " everything except the rim shot was missing, and it would not even help. The same people who created Whoville "had a clear hand in creating a city and home in a" cat. " Sets and props were very tempting and gave the viewer much needed aversion from bad writing, direction and Myers. There was some fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actress who seemed to be aware that she was in a movie based on classic Dr. Seuss and remained faithful to this genre. Call the SPCA. This cat should be castrated and never be reproduced. Please, please, no sequel.
