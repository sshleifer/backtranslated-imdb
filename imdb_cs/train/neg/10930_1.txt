This movie is a complete dog. I found out that I was trying to find something to laugh so that I did not feel as if I was running out of money - and my time. Writing in this movie is terrible. It's a shame that this is not in line with the standards of other Hale Storm films. They should save money on getting a list of games like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, and have spent money on the work of the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly used for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie lets you wonder what the main plot was - including subplots. After watching this film, I left the impression that the producers hoped to capture some humor of Napoleonic dynamite, where there are not as many lines as the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this movie does not provide rows, characters, delivery or humor. I should go to the dentist instead!
