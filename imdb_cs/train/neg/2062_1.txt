I read all the reviews here after watching this piece of film waste and took at least 2 pages to find out that someone else did not think that this terribly dysfunctional assembly was not in the 1970s or in any other era! If this is not the smallest fun set of sketch * comedy * I've ever seen, it will be until the moment it arrives. Half the sketches have already been performed (and infinitely better) deeds such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I wanted to say that a nice animation that takes about 90 seconds is the pinnacle of this film, we will not get as close as summing up how helpless and the waste is wasteful for 75 minutes. Seminal Comedy? Only in a world where seed really means semen. Scatological humor? Only in the world where the scat IS is really fawning. Vocals of the predecessor? Only if we think this is a manual on how to compromise. Breast and burns and strange beaver. Nice ... if you're a teen boy with at least one free hand and you find that Playboy does not exist. Give her a break because it was in the early 1970s? In any case. Ten years ago a sketch comedy appeared. The only way I could even forgive this movie is if it was on the shooting range. Retro? Hardly. Clown sketches, which are finely puzzled, may be in some circles (and could be really funny), but it just looks really sad. What held me for 75 minutes? I believe they could save really fun skating for the end. I gave the film 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomnia or coma patients ... or to people with blocking ... their jaws eventually opened in disbelief.
