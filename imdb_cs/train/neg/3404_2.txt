I'm not going to save this movie for all the unsurpassed technical issues, it would take two days to figure out how it's not even far away. Others pointed to all the relevant stupidity. <br /> <br /> Because of this, I could still have some pleasure not to include all the Mudlin, furious, furious, sentimental Disneyesque crap, which is so out of place anywhere but anywhere more than outside, where the smallest mistake can mean instant death. Both the "crew" and the "real" astronaut were equally wrong with all their nonsense nonsense before everything else. This completely destroyed any value that production could leave. I'm surprised NASA left this waste, so so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important. If you have not seen it yet, save yourself irritation. Follow Apollo 13 again. At least it tried to be a bit realistic.
