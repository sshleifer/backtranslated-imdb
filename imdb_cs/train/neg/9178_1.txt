The thing about calling "The House of the Dead," the worst film of all time, is that it really is not. There are worse movies out there. I watch many Hong Kong movies about ninjas, which are essentially the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama that has a trail of ninjs put in the end to create something that could technically be called "film." But the house of the dead is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. When I walked halfway, I felt I was a little stupid to have spent 45 minutes out of this waste.
