... and how bored you! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films of the 1970s that did not create without any actors, a tricky scenario, a sad direction, and a relentless desire to merge "horror" with a light comedy. This film will introduce a paleontologist who will find drawings of a water dinosaur under a crater lake ... a meteor falls from the sky, and a water dinosaur of clay varieties will begin to terrorize and eat the inhabitants of Lake Crater. The whole thing will take care of our local Sheriff Steve. Much of the film - when it does not show that the blood of the rest of what we imagine has to be the beast's food - they spent the crazy antics of two guys named Arnie and Mitch, who used to hire a boat. Trying to be so funny that we get the lines, like when we look at the brand, Mitch says Arnie: "You badly wrote the bait, it's B-A-T-E." The laughter here was rather rare. Then we see that they were drunk together and imagined the trunk of the tree as a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy be careful! Dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in the wrong way. And at least the lake is beautiful.
