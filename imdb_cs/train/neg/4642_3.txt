I saw "Rachel's Attic" and I thought I would be in a pleasant visceral ride. However, that was not the case. Visceral, yes, but nice? That would be big, fat, no! The only reason I gave him a "3" is the fact that Gunnar Hansen appears (sometimes so briefly) as one of the film's curvy characters. As I have ever been told to Mr. Hansen in this work ... I never know. The story is interesting but poorly executed. Direction is pedestrian and playing is average. The only thing that is worse is the special effects. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in elementary school. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time to change my career ... I heard they hired Mel's Diner! There are very few, well-made, Inde movies coming out of Michigan ... and "Rachel's sub-circle" is not one of them.
