The person who wrote a glowing show of this deployed project must be related to a writer / director / star - or he is in fact the same person who rejects rational thinking that this film will attract anyone who is not connected with a very tightly woven inner circle. What about? You want to make a movie - tell a story; entertain; draw me alive characters. Sure, you can do it artistically without bowing down to the elements of business for mass appeal. But do not put the elements of artistic expression in a vacuum where the audience is constantly struggling for hidden narrative creations. If I have to be overcome by a dreamy psychological thread, then you will make the concrete substance easier to buy.
