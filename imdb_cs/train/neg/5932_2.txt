What documentary about a musician does not include a single artist himself? Unlike "Ray" or countless other movies about musicians, half of the entertainment in the theater (or on the couch) is once again experiencing the great songs themselves. Here all the covers are covered with uninteresting characters and these representations will not capture Cohen's slow, jazz style. Often covered with poorly sung folk versions. Yuck. Interviews are more with other musicians and characters than with Cohen himself. Seldom the film plays Cohen's reading of his own work (never singing) - like letters, poems, etc. The film has not really captured much about the life of the artist's story or about its development over the years. Great disappointment for the big Cohen fan.
