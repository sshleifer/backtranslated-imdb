Jesus Christ, I can not believe I lost my time watching this movie. I was just looking at Jordan Ladd for such anger. But watching this movie almost turned me off. This is terrible! I could watch the Survivor Series 93 over it. <br /> <br /> The leading boy in this was so bland and generous. I would like the great Mistuhar Misawa Tiger to drive '91' into the back of his glass window. I was angry every time I said "lake" and "cabin". I would kick his ass. Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. The real angel. She could not even save this complete joke of the movie. Unfortunately she could not even act like she was away when she took the right drug. It looked cheerful. I also loved where Jordan accidentally poured yogurt. It reminded me of the time when ... never. <br /> <br /> Anayways, watch this movie because it's scary.
