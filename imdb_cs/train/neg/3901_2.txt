The script is nice. Though casting is absolutely incomprehensible. costumes do not look like some of High Highbury. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Mrs. Beckinsale speaks English better than Mrs. Paltrow, although Mrs. Paltrow's acting is the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, is romantic and not at all sharply looking and merciless as Mr. Knightley in the TV version. P.S spectator can not see Mr. Elton-Ms at all. Smith's relationship, as it was in the motion version, so one does not understand where Emma was trying to do the Elton-Smith match (except for the portrait).
