I do not know why I still do it for myself! I continue to defend Dutch and Belgian cinematography, and claim that they should get more credits and chances ... and then they beat you around your head so that this is unsolicited! Intense care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing ever in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's an attempt to create a Dutch attempt to create its own horror franchise, clearly based on classic American classics, such as Friday 13th and Halloween. Producers and writers have been really high on this, but really dropped. Intense care has become an embarrassing product for anyone involved and hence a true cult movie. It is almost impossible to pursue an original copy of this work and it has only been shown on special occasions such as "the night of misfortune". Exactly 5 minutes of Intensive Care attempts to tell the story and even create a plot ... then it turns into a fragile and low brain slash in the movie tracks with terrible - yet very cheerful and inexpensive - effects. The efficiency of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are several respected names. Koen Wauters plays the leading role ... This person could also be the most famous and most popular artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, a bunch of television shows and an idol of many young girls. He never mentions the thing he played in. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, they try to persuade themselves. Intensive care never happened.
