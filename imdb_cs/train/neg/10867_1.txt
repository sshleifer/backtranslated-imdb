This is a movie that tells you two things ... 1) I can do much better than this (acting, writing and directing) 2) It's so bad I have to leave a review and warn others ... <br /> <br / > It looks like it was filmed by my flip video. I think that even my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me. I noticed that there are some positive contributions to this home video; It must be left to crew members or people who have something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. let's hope the writers and the director leave the business. nor talented enough to do my ads !!!!!
