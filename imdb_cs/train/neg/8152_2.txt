Do not Use Water is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on the 1966 Broadway play from Woody Allen. He plays Jackie Gleason, a funny genius for "The Honeymooners." Director Howard Morris appeared in several comedies by Mel Brooks (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and made animated characters (Gopher from "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) What Happened? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the assumption is too important to work effectively. Allen's original play was on the tongue, which is why he worked on Broadway and Allen's remake of 1994. Scenario R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the premise of death and make too many changes from the original game. When Gleason's wife was in this version as an airhead when she was a woman in the original, it's just one example of why it does not work. The game is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can not save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a great actor, as he showed in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His abrasive personality could work here, but the miserable scenario does not even give him a chance. Very bad. Estelle Parsons's airhead wife controls the nuts after 20 minutes. Find out how fast it will take you to strangle. It is also a shame because she is also a great actress who has performed in two "exceptional" performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel." None of the other actors did particularly well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated the film so much that he made the film in 1994 with Julia Kavner (Marge Simpson) at the head. They make all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. It's finally on the video after a long battle for rights. Go out and find this version. The original 1969 original is suitable for cleaning unwanted guests who will survive their welcome. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 stars
