There is so much wrong in this movie, but it is summed up: A terrible act - so bad that it must have been expedient. bad script - they could have some good ideas, but it was not the best way to present this story. ridiculously bad end - in some cases the end can save the movie - not in this case. if you can sit with the whole movie, you will want to end up in the end because the end is not even waiting. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It was all the torture that was sitting in this movie, I would appreciate someone being warned in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better. Even you will regret that you have got through unspeakable torture.
