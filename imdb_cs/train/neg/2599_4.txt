I have a DVD very cheap and I'm a total of Drewbie, and that's probably the only constellation where this movie might be of interest to anyone. The movie from Drew's early movie looks great and she's pretty A lot of really cute scenes such as a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, lots of sexy clothes, etc. Never show the friendly charm we know from her latest movies. <br /> <br /> The film itself is quite average or below average and looks much more like it was made for television than one for the cinema. There is no real horror or tension, and dialogues are often granaries. The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly do not understand. But maybe it's nothing. But at least you will not reach the end that you would expect, and it will also come much sooner than you would expect. Overall, I think this movie is for Drewbies exclusively.
