Since this film was composed in less than a year, it can explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, roughly 76 minutes of actual film). But what he can not explain is his lack of humor he had in the previous film. <br /> <br /> Gags are fast and sometimes not fun. The only real fun part is fast spoofing at Nike basketball, James Woods' performance on Max Van Sydow's Exorcist, and scattered pieces all over the film. Very unfortunate was the takeover of Charlie's Angels who, as Scary Movie's first scenario and Matrix's spiritual scene, essentially recreated the scene without getting a lot of humor. Today's youth may not be able to concentrate on the spoofing of classical supernatural horror films of the 1970s, such as the exorcist and possibly the 80s Poltergeist, et. al. <br /> <br /> Let's hope Scary Movie 3 will take some time to get together, making spoofs more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing, however, is that the film is more than the last of the promising young actress Anna Faris (with whom I admitted it seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting skills I give the movie "3" of "10".
