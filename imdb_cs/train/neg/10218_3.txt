** Spoilers included ** <br /> <br /> I heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the end was especially terrible. What I did not expect was a complete change in training with about twenty minutes. What begins as a typical Cowboy / Indian Western suddenly falls into a very boring romantic comedy about Honus (a soldier of the blue title of Peter Strauss) and Cresty (Candice Bergen) who escaped Cheyenne's onslaught. Most of the film then focuses on the two disjointed people and hence on the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then appears and kidnaps both for no apparent reason. They then escape and both appear (separately) at the base of the cavalry on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. When Cresta got married to one of Cheyenne's bosses, she escaped the equestrian base and joined them. So common. Then comes the end. After long hours of bad deal with clich√©s they fail to get the story together, the film will then turn into top exploitation involving, among other things, decapitations and the child who is shot at the back of the head. Similarities can be made at this stage with the Wild Bunch, but the wild band has the same tone and has not used extreme unreasonable violence. In some respects, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, which has also completely changed the way to shock. I hated Soldier's Modra, nor did he find that the end was particularly worrying, but it only seemed a blunt and unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see the movie with a really worrying defeat of innocents, I would recommend Elem Klimov Come and see.
