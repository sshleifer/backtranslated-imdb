This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not just one of the better crime films. This movie should be considered closer to part of STING Part2 or possible zone. Remember these gems! The only reason why this film was shot was a cult of cult. This film missed everything that De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard on. There was no sympathetic nature, and it is the fault of everyone who is doing it. I hope RISE TO POWER will win every RAZZIE how he can, and maybe even invent some new categories that will allow him to be a record holder. After watching this S @ T FEST, I sat down and looked at the original way of Carlitos to get a bad taste from my mouth. When I watched, I wish Pachanga came and set off from my misery.
