The most significant moment of this film for me was without a doubt Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was determined against the type and showed he could handle an unconventional role. Hanks is usually the good guy in the movie - the one you like, admiring and spice. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this film he came across as a noble - his purpose was to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Still, a gangster and a murderer had been killed before these killings. So Hanks played a role I would not expect him to get out of it. <br /> <br /> Hank's good performance aside, though I certainly could not call this nice movie. After the opening, which I would best describe as enigmatic (it was not quite clear for a while where it happens), it will turn into a very dark film about the complicated relationships that Sullivan has developed as a gangster - (Paul Newman) some boss of the crowd and trying to raise their two sons and keep them "clean" to say so; isolated from your business. After the older son witnesses the murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him calm, gets a wrong son (and mother), and Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) leave. It becomes a strange kind of father and son connecting the film. Although it ends on a somewhat promising note (at least in the whole context of the story), it is really very dark that the mood is enhanced by many scenes being shot in darkness and rainy rains. I have to admit that while I was honoring Hanse's performance, the film as a whole simply did not find me. 4/10
