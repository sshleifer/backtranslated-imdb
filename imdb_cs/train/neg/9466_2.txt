This movie was physically painful to sit down, perhaps because (like many people of my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, smart, moody and subversive at the same time. "Cat in the Hat" exhausts all the interest and spark of the story and the performance of Mike Myer as a cat is mostly amazing. Why is the Borscht Belt accent, unfortunate idea, inappropriate jokes, carefree costume? I had to come back and read the books again to see a real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This movie is INTERRUPTED and is too long. <br /> <br /> You do not expect every child movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but it sets the new low. How could Mike Myers need money?
