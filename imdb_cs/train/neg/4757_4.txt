It's a while ago that I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now is his husband and Jude Law, his wife's mistress. The story is still the same and it's a great game. <br /> <br /> While I was filming, I always felt I was watching the game. That's one of the reasons why I do not like this classic remake. When I look at a film adapted to the game, I still have to feel that I see a movie and not just a game. Director Kenneth Brannigan has made some amazing movies in the past, but this time he was missing. Another reason was the appearance of the film. The design was modern, stylish clean, uncomfortable and cool. I never felt that someone ever lived in the house. The photographs were not bad, but the flash was terrible. Sometimes there was a blue light, a dark, green light, so that it was not pleasant for the eyes. <br /> <br /> The meeting was really good. Michael Caine's and Jude Law are at their best. I really would like to see these two guys playing together on the stage. But I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Jude Law. The weakest was the central part. I remember that in the original this part was still very mysterious and simply beautiful. I tried to watch her twice, and I always fell asleep in the middle. The end portion is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more critical for the audience than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
