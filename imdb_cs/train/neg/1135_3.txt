I did not read Lincoln's biography, so maybe it was an accurate picture ... And maybe it's because I'm used to the same alienated and unrealistic worship of portraits that unnaturally deify Lincoln as brilliant, honest and rescuer of our country ...... But why would they shoot a movie that would feature Lincoln as a coffee? While Henry Fonda made excellent Lincoln, his portrayal of "aw shucks, I'm just a guy" seemed a little offensive. [He promised it was Bushie Jr. it's all they think is "just a guy" so we do not care that he's a rich and privileged fool-but that's another story altogether. <br /> <br /> Not only does the movie illustrate Lincoln as a kind of simple (almost simple) kind of guy, the film says that Lincoln has just got into law and that he was not even interested in the law - just with the falsely simplified idea of ​​the law is about rights and wrongs. He is not a very good advocate in the film (he sits on the table with his feet and makes the glory of the witnesses) and the result is usually determined by chance / luck. because it was funded by the Republicans (in response to a game sponsored by the Democrats that came out) and partly because it was just a sentiment of time, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie!
