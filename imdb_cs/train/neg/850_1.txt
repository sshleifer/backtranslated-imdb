That must be the deepest film I've ever seen (the spoilers ahead of us)! First, the conspiracy is stupid. The little kid is weird and they move to the hotel because his father is his manager. We found out that the baby has a gift, "Shining". This gift has nothing to do with anything other than to make the baby look great. Then the film is boring and boring, until one gets crazy. He's about to kill the child and his wife fiercely because ... well, he feels it. Why would he otherwise do it? We suddenly see the naked woman in the bathtub. The man kisses her and realizes she kisses the dead corpse, which is totally disgusting. Somehow, a black guy who has an ax comes in. Then a child and a woman take a black man's vehicle and leave a father who dies in a few minutes of subcooling. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but this category falls directly into this category. The music is horrifying, the characters are nasty (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the fence is twisted and fits to describe vomiting, the end is very predictable, the story is slow, tedious and boring. This movie is greatly overestimated. KEEP THIS FILM ON ALL COSTS. I am surprised that IMDb gained such a high rating.
