"Seed" is torture porn ... no doubt about it. But strangely, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a more polished film than any other he made in recent memory. Every time I look at the Boll movie, I feel that some pages of the script need to be missing. The story and the dialogue are simply huge differences. Of course, nothing makes much sense. Films are somewhat unrealistic in this respect. <br /> <br /> ********* <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br residences, unlike real policemen who would enter and clean the house in pairs or triplets? Why do police officers never use the radio? How can bodies break down so quickly, a process that usually lasts for many months? (I knew there was a time-limited photo ... but Seed would never be able to kill people if he always waited for the previous victim to ruin.) How Seed can wear his pants and mask while waiting for a series of deaths instead of typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter the prison with maximum security, walk around the cell block, then leave again without stopping or even noticing? When nearly 80 people were murdered (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film), why is there only one investigator on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide to go looking for Seed in Seed's house, where he was arrested and murdered his victims? (Did he not think he'd do it before?) Why does a police detective ride solo, without backing up and without letting the expedition know what he's doing and where he's headed? is particularly frustrating when Boll apparently gets out of the way to understand why the electric chair does not work properly. He spent several minutes on the screen when he could afford to make other aspects of the film at least a little more logical. END END SPOILERS ***** In short, the film just serves as a framework for several different scenes (perhaps Boll would think of these as on his "vision") brutal death bludgeoning, head shots , electric shock and dripping of live animals raised to the skin. (The open scene of the animals that are skinned was really useless and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The main reason is undoubtedly bludgeoning the death of a middle-aged Seed with the ax. Obviously, a lot of time has been devoted to this, and it reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", although without a Steely Dan soundtrack. Is it a good movie? No. Is that worth seeing? Only if you are a devoted fan of the genre of porn torture or you are totally determined to see a sample of torturous porn. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this movie is quite disgusting and may be bad in points, it's really much more competent than most Bolly's films. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a director. I can only hope to continue for the torture violation and continue in the veins of the post.
