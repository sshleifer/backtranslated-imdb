Oh dear ... like an Englishman and a small part of Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins's work in the industry ..... I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see, I'm no one who hoped for a better one. So my notes are "straw in the wind". But that's the reason, right? - I have no ax to grind the commercial value of the work. I, a full-fledged member of the great unspoiled, go see the movie to be taken to another place. Yes, suspend the faith for a short time. But do not enter into a state of complete mistrust. Had it been an unknown author and a director, I would have assumed that this "production" would have been seen in oblivion. Unfortunately, no, and I was wide-eyed and confused. When I saw some of the awesome reviews I made from this work, I'm a little worried ... Maybe it's like trying, without prejudice, to see each film according to his own merits. Regardless of author, director, study or even the renown of content. My advice as well as before me: Do not remember and do not say the same production. It's full of danger. Films must be moderated to maintain credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in the school news "He could and did better ..."
