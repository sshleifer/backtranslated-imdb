I personally would advise people to avoid this movie. Overall, it's the work that looks and the fight is badly choreographed. Slow and too unconvincing. If you buy a Hong Kong Legends DVD movie of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is Bey Logan audio commentary. But in any case, ever since the movie Ninja Watching has appeared. I do not think so, and I do not want to. Overall, with regard to films, I have one golden rule: Avoid movies that contain the word 'Ninja'.
