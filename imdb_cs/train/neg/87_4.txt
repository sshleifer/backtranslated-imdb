I've read all the Love Come Softly books. They know well that movies can not use all aspects of the book but generally have at least the main part of the book. In this movie I was very disappointed. The only thing this movie has in the book is that Father Missy is coming to visit (although the parents are coming to the book). That is all. The storyline was so twisted and far-fetched, and sadly, from the book that I simply could not enjoy it. Even when I did not read the book, it was too sad. I know Pioneer's life was harsh, but the whole movie was a downer. The assessment is based on the fact that movies have the same family orientation that makes them great.
