I love monster movies, in general. Even though they are unlikely and stupid. But it's hard to like this movie when it's so unlikely and stupid And it tries to take it all seriously all at the same time. Just like in a really blissful kind. While the idea is somewhat material, just as Orcas is known for killing Big White Sharks, it is really hard to find it terrifying when I can not help but just see the angry Shamoo ruining things. Especially that one scene in which a building exploded causes the Orca to do ... and when it explodes, that thing jumps out of the water and it was as if I was looking at a show in the Sea World with fireworks. In addition, it kills many creepy moments before even suggesting it will happen. In addition, JAWS takes several strokes. It's like "Hey, we look de facto and we can come up with BETTER reasons why Orca is attacking". <br /> <br /> Yes, you ignore your angry **** ups in logic of course. But JAWS had one thing your film does not have. That's scary. Yes, its unlikely. Yes, it's a little outrageous. But honestly, credible or not, Killer Shark is not as close to being as awesome as Big White. And the wrong attempt to develop and write a character just hurts. Even JAWS Revenge is more terrifying than this.
