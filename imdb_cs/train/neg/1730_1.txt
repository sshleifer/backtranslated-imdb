First of all, I want to point out that I know only because of my younger sister who always follows her. I think it's the most uncomfortable TV program. There is nothing laugh about any "joke" and preserved laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if it was shot in front of a live audience. This laugh will show how a "dysfunctional" show is. However, I prefer the young casting talents of the cast. But it reminds me that they will look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The show is well connected with the overall annoying voices and style of CBBC lecturers. Why nowadays the young must be criticized today, it is outside of me. That is all.
