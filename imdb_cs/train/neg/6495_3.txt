I rented the movie based on what the trailer showed and, of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins. When Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make the film, it would be the end result. I do not think I saw such a movie that caused the LSD trip to look like an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of pieces where the characters start flashing or different facts and the movie will not culminate in the last 5 minutes when it makes sense at once. I wrote a blog blog that basically gives everything a clear overview and I will not do it here. It's a good cinematography, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me tell you if there's one redeemed feature for this movie, it's music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogues are incredibly good and incredibly bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I liked some parts of this movie, I really did, and once you get to the end, you'll actually find out what's really going on. It's unfortunate that you have to go for two hours crazy to get to the climax that minimizes the effect of the whole movie. I give him 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this movie is not acting, it's all.
