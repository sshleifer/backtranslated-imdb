I see a lot of people liked this movie. For me, it was a movie that was created directly from writing 101 and the guy failed in class. From the time Lindsey Price appeared to the end, the film was very predictable. I was constantly watching if it went anywhere. <br /> <br /> First we have a widowed young father. Cliché # 1 / TV always kills a parent when the child is a girl or a boy, so the only father can get to his dead wife and looks completely out of his childcare element. Starting with my 3 sons up to 2 1/2 dad. These films are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 When a woman in hand has a video camera in her hand, she will play a big role in the movie. And he will always have a solution, even if he is the head of the air. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If a person is in danger, foreigners must be of Latin origin. And it must be illegal. There are obviously no legal Latin and illegal Europeans, unless it is an IRA element. Cliché # 4 The Latino must be highly educated in his native land. In this case, he was a teacher who did 200 per month. And this highly educated Latino must now behave as if he did not have a brain in his head and let his flip side flip over. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 The crime that man actually committed was not a crime, but an accident. But because he lost all the sense he had when he crossed the border, he now acts like a vicious idiot, and now he puts his daughter in danger by taking her on the unsuccessful journey to the border with the idiot kick. <br /> <br /> Slender # 6 Nobody ever runs through a hoodlum running from a crime, but some poor little cute baby. The reason is that parents of the child have to play a large part of the film and because a person who accidentally kills a child can have a ridiculous interaction with their parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7 Name me a movie in which one policeman is not an angry vet and they are joining a newcomer. Even if they are killer detectives who must be the most experienced cops for police force. Sev7n and Copy Cat, Right and Order are coming to your mind right now. And the vet, even though it has a broken heart on the outside of gold. <br /> <br /> Kliché # 8 Let's get rounded some unemployed soap stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. Susan Haskell However, IMO can not come out of a paper bag, and when she used to be on One Life To Live like Marty, she rocked from right to left each time she opened her mouth. He uses me to get to the sea. It could be anchored better on the ground, but it still can not act. The film could be more credible if it were not cliché. I do not think the movie has to be expensive or brain to be good. But that was simply wrong. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm not going to ruin the end. Oh, it's for me because I think it's going to be a bad service to mankind to let a man waste time so he never returns to see this movie. Includes Cliché # 6 and # 7. If you've never seen a movie before you have to see what's coming. Father makes even a stupid mistake running from the cops at the end and is shot by an angry veteran who is suddenly very upset. She would think she thought the poor guy was innocent of the whole movie, and she accidentally shot him. If not. Now for the little girl Dad brought him to him. Guess what happens to her? The times when he ends up living with a family whose child was killed by his father! Come on! You all knew it would happen because it is a replacement child! That's why he did not come and live with the character of Lindey Price. <br /> <br /> This movie was an insult to me. Because there were so many ways to explore this movie and go down, but he decided that the cliché would come. 2 stars are for 2 stars, a little girl I thought was very good, and Lindsey Price, who was annoying, but she did what she could do. My advice is to take the bad habits and fry your head instead of looking at it
