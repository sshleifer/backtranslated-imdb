This movie was totally disappointed. I read some other reviews and I had much higher expectations. I expected drama with more intense character development. But in the movie it never happens. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers should believe. I thought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 moves in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Act: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I videotape from my video recorder was deleted in 70 minutes. into the movie. Much better movies than this ...
