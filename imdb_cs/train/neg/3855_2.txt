The only redemption was a small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the film was too hard to be "Something about Mary", but I did not like this movie and still did not meet these standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair stayed in the stupidity of her character of cruel intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father looked as though he was trying too hard for Randy Quaid to be a National Lampoon's Vacation.
