We are not in a fairy tale about a naked emperor. We can admit the truth of what we see without being stupid to admit that this show is incomprehensible in many ways, and that it is clear that much of it was made of pure intuition without a real conception. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, many people like such things. I do not. I prefer well-thought out and planned exhibitions. And I also admit that the show is very serious for my taste and boring ... the love and stories about drugs ... There are so many exciting soap with great tension (like Dallas), but Twin Peaks can not capture my attention. I do not care about those people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
