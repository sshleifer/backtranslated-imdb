"Wrinkle in Time" series is my favorite childhood series. I read them and read them more than I could count for the past 35 years. Characters with all their virtues and flaws are close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained only a few of the wonderful, magical, spiritual stories I love so much about. To say I was disappointed with this movie, it would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you've never read the book (s) I'm imagining, you'll be looking forward to the movie. Action is successful, special effects are well done for TV movie and the story is interesting. But if you like books, avoid this movie at any cost. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on Wikipedia's novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle introduced the film," I expected it to be bad, and it is. "" I, like another reviewer here, I feel the need to read the book again to dissolve this film from my mind.
