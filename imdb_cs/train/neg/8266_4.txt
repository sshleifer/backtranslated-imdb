What is * bliep * in this movie? Could not they better script? Overall, it's a "nice" movie, but ... it's been done more than once ... Until the end I thought it was ok but ... to go back to the past ... * barf * So it she looks ... She was waiting for Mommy to appear ... but wow, that did not happen ... which is good. I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but I saw such a new movie with another guy who wished he was older / bigger; it's just grazing <br /> <br /> Just watch it coming out on TV. Do not get me wrong, but it's not all
