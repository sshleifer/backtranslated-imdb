I do not know ... Maybe it's because I'm Brazilian, but all these things were too. Too much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters (come, not so sad) and the aspect of the city that shows the director. Everything seems to me too fake: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It simply sells a small taste of fake Latin culture. I have to be honest: I was seduced a little, but who would not be seduced by this fake life of nice music, sex and parties? I'm not so stupid: what kind of world is the one in which people do not suffer diarrhea, deep sorrow and STD? I liked the scene with Caridad's phone and talk of a contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
