This film has such a small class compared to the Aliens on the train, or even, the Random Meeting for this thing that despite fictitious similarities I would not feel right in real comparison with any of them. The character of Yancy Butler appeared like a sound that I was too shy to keep the writer and director watching. I do not like a lot of life movies, but I feel compelled to watch everywhere and there to promote harmony at home. Often I moaned silently, but this film forced me to say loud, stepped out of the room and walked around the house, muttering before me before I returned to my normally popular armchair to be subjected to torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
