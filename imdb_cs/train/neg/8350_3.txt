I just came back from "El Otro" playing in Buenos Aires and I must say that I was very disappointed. The film is a very slow motion (do not do me wrong, I enjoy slow moving movies!), Slowly to fool you. All you hear is that Julio Chavez is breathing heavily throughout the movie. This is a badly created film, but more importantly, it's a film without inspiration, I did not feel anything about the story or its insights. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" was made just to make a movie ... making it forgetful. I'd like to give it to you, if you want to see good Argentine films, check out Sorina movies.
