... for choosing the Lt. First, the movie was not horrible, it was just Hollywood. The worst case when we need this scenario: If Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but she was stubborn that her "people" brought him out of the mission, he would put it on the first helicopter, and without them, these refugees would marched on the border. The refugee package would not be compromised. This is not how it works. But as I have emphasized, it's Hollywood, we have to have a drama. That's why we make movies because reality is not so complicated. But I thought Willis and a good doctor had a functional chemistry. This means there are also some well-done combat scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth renting dvd. Look at the rainy day and you'll be happy.
