I saw this movie in the middle of the night as I walked through the channels and there was nothing else to watch. It's one of those movies where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but after twenty minutes you realize that you can not turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that are somewhere between so bad is good and so bad is it, well, just simply BAD, it's worth seeing just experiencing the confusion to realize that it's both! Big medium-term fare when it comes to a wonderful tennis trail. Do not even bother asking yourself why nobody can say Chad Lowe is of course male, because logic does not apply.
