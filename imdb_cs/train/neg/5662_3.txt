When I read MOST of the other comments, I felt they were too bright for this film. I found out that she had completely lost the spark that had appeared in older movies Zatoichi, and only proves that after a long absence from the screen, it is often best to let things be. I fully agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the FIRST Star Trek with the original series - millions of enthusiastic fans waited, waiting for the show to return and being forced to watch the stationary and sterile approach of the original. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes incomprehensible, it's terribly cruel (although the recent New Zatoichi from Beat Takeshi is much more bloodier) and lacks the hearts of the originals. I did not mind the blood, but some can turn it off (especially nose-cut scenes and broken heads). Besides, it was not good for Ichi - it looks like a malicious and sad man in this movie (much, much more than usual) - and that's something the fans of the show really do not want to see. <br /> <br /> It was a very nice return for Zatoichi. If you are not like me and want to see every movie Zatoichi, it's very simple. See one of previous versions or ALL-NEW 2003.
