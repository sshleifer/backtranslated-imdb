Direction must be a problem here. I recently heard that John Cleese talks about working for Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car branch. The first branch was too delicate and not fun. The second branch was too rigid to be funny. The third was just fragile to be funny. This type of attention detail is missing "Corky Romano". It does not matter how comical the battle was unpleasant, but it was not solid and not left on the floor. One of the values ​​I can find in this film is the study of a very bad film that somehow escaped to distribution without being repaired. <br /> <br /> I've reviewed dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews that praise this absolute waste of time undermines my suspicion that some people get paid to support titles. I can not understand how anyone older than 9 could rate this title more than 4, MAX. I mean, come, 5 is average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money out of it, to evaluate it even as an average. <br /> <br /> This is my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. And hey, I'm actually Three Stoogs, and I can even tolerate Ed Wood!
