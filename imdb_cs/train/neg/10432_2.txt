The horrible end - and I can not believe Moore spent the year with it. The death of L. Ron Hubbard and the Dianetitte, which Hubbard declared to be a pen in just three weeks. It was really disappointing for me to throw my disks from the first 3.5 years. Now the first 1.5 hours of full action, though absurd in assumptions, then worsened on the slow, painful, sophomoric dissolution of the series. Unbelievable how slow and pulling the last hour. Should we think deeper? If I wanted a lesson in materialism, I would read Ismael Daniel Quinn. Absurd thought that 38K people would give up everything for a "new start". It's ridiculous to throw a fading Kara and Baltar and Six appear again. Absurd to throw into the Mitochondrial. Just absurd.
