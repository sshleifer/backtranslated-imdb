Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a turbulent past that gets more than she negotiated when she goes to a pool party with a nice associate. When her date and her jokingly friends say she belongs to a "murder club," Maddy takes it seriously and moves straight to "Level 3" by pushing a woman into a parking garage (behind her car's teeth!). But Maddy is also the one who puts on a plastic mask and kills the other members of the group, or has someone else lost it? The story of the movie (originally called MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly conceived, full of holes and spirals that are totally out of control before an absurd shift from the left field ends. Some of the dialogues are totally ridiculous. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the supporting song was terrible. However, I managed to sit down in this full moon. There's plenty of skin and blood, and it's the perfect type of motion that you can sit with a group of your friends and divide. Horror fans can also look forward to Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (the early victim). Score: 4 out of 10
