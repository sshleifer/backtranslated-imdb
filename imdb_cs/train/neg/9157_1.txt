Your first mention of being a movie is that it was shot on a video, not on a movie. The story is intricate and the production is surprisingly negligent. Note, for example, that if the titles are on a plane seemingly landing in Vermont where they are about to celebrate their relationship at a civic association ceremony, the plane is shown to be coming to an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in the garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which should not last for five minutes in the climate of New England. The FedEx Freight Fly Detector will take the next flight on the airplane. Probably they could only afford to travel in the proceedings. As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, the godly Christian brother Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation finds out that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor will eventually build Victor with an assaulting man to Ben and Arthur to kill "purify their souls of sin". Apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. It was not Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this film has no redemption at all.
