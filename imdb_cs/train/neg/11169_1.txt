Are you kidding me?! A show that warns anyone opening cans and food envelopes? How talented do you have to do it? She may have been able to cook, but she is not shown in this half-hour stomach that causes painful production. I know he has a Martha-Stewart-esquire empire. So is Warren Buffett, but I do not see it with the fake flaps opening the cream corn cans and Alpo. My nephew named ... Bryce. Brycer? Stop talking about anyone who is stupid. <br /> <br /> You spend more time on "tables" than real cooking. Who has such a time ?! Silicone should be on the spit, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
