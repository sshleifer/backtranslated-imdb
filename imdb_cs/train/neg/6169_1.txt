As a huge fan of horror films, especially J-horror and also gore I thought that the Burdade did not sound quite good. I've explored the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it looks like a good bloody and frightening movie to watch before it's downloaded. It was so excited that it was over and she was ready to be frightened and horrified by the amazing gore I had expected to be terribly disappointed. This story was ridiculous, meaningless and incomprehensible, the gore was cheerful, rather scary, and what was the sound effect in cartoon style? The deal was probably the only thing that terrified me. I did not understand the idea of ​​a cactus, and the way a mother's husband disappeared into the middle of the sea after a flashing light had left them both unexplained or I did not want to, because my mind could not understand what I was seeing. I appreciate the way it should be; shocking and a few scenes (strange cannibalism and my own kissing mother?) definitely were, I think they went a little far, and not even scary, they made it unconvincing, making it more credible to be a comedy than I think. But it's a very funny movie and I and a few of my friends laughed a lot, but unfortunately we were expecting a horror comedy, so it's worth watching entertainment, but we do not expect a dark, deep, spooky and frightening film; you'll just be disappointed. If it was a horror comedy / spoof, I would probably rate her about nine, the peak was a strange scene when a husband stepped into a woman's stomach and closed her wounds but painfully sadly gave me one.
