After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece all my life for 37 years, but I have never read a book, I am completely confused with what I have just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts contained in the novel, as I'm sure most of them are, but only through hearings and quotes. Without this limited consciousness, this film would be a complete mystery and even with him I was not even more informed about the story of 1984 than I was before watching him. On the plus side. .. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton offers gentle performances and the overall feeling of the movie is amazingly cruel and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark part of the film. <br /> <br /> Now for the bottom, and there are plenty ... <br /> <br /> War is going on (at least in terms of propaganda) but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are several names for Eurysia, but without any explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what does? where is she from? Where he works? why is it changing the message? why not on the queue? Why eat food in the dining room? What is the drink that drinks the whole movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why is not brainwashing like others? What's the deal with your mother and sister? What happened to his father? The little story would be nice, no crunch, which is essential for those like me who did not read the book. Without it, it's just a confused and hard-to-follow film that keeps the riddles of what's really going on. The soundtrack was spread out and badly edited, and a constant conversation from the Big Brother screen makes dialogue in places where it's even harder to solve what's going on. I admit it may be an artistic choice, but it is very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I also know it was mentioned earlier, but why is it nudity? It seemed totally unreasonable and felt as if it were thrown there to avoid the lack of coverage of the plot. I personally can not follow the way Hollywood feels he has to explain stories of words for the word these days. We are not all brainwashed, but it's a few steps too far to the other side. I can only imagine that he relies entirely on the fact that you read the book because if this movie is really a "literal translation" I've seen many people say, it would be very difficult to understand why 1984 is being invited as a classic Yippee. There is no denying that it was light years ago and, to a large extent, predicted every change of our society to date (perhaps it was some sort of scripture for many sci-fi writers did the same without having to leave the holes in the story. I have to do what I had to do from the beginning and buy a copy of the book as long as I have it all meaning. Overall, I'm very disappointed in what I've been waiting for years to watch.
