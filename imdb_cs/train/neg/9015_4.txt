The first 45 minutes of the Dragon Fighter is quite acceptable and surprisingly observable. Characters are believable and interesting. The Cloning Laboratory looks really top-notch. Then everything will collapse. Characters begin to behave in an idiotic way, and there is no fusion reactor from anywhere (and this is supposedly "today's day"), which is the only reason why killing is needed - it's not all. The goal is incredibly weak. One wonders what caused the movie that started so well to be so bad. <br /> <br /> All the characters except Dean Caine play the Russians. This has resulted in some strange situations and details, such as the figure of Vesel Dimitrova, which is called "Bailey Kent" despite its great accent (and despite it, on one occasion, unexplainably going to * Spanish *!) Br /> Because of the decent I thought the rating of this movie was 5, but it was really more disappointed than that and I just give it to him.
