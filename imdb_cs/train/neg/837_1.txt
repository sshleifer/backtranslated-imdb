I saw the first two very much, really. Especially because the other is not just an effort to make another as good as the first. And it's a story that stands alone. You do not have to know the first movie. I also enjoyed it in the films "Free Willy". But ... third, here is absolutely useless! I tried with my friend because we both liked the first two. After half an hour we decided to stop. The movie is fine, there are funny parts. But why? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is a tough attempt to get more fun from the first film than it already was, plus telling the story from their perspective. But why? I really would like to know. You know, the idea that two of them sit in the cinema watching the first one is really nice. But what is coming is mostly unnecessary. I think many people like Timon and Pumba, and so really. Still, for me, many parts were very much built to try to be funny. No chance, most of it was not funny, at least for me. By the way. How was the movie? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) trying to get more fun out of the first movie? I tend to choose option b and am very disappointed. If you like to see stories like "the story of xy," you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" by Tom Stop with Tim Rot and Gary Oldman. This is really funny and try to get more of the "Hamlet" then it has it.
