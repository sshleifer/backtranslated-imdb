CHA! So this is the movie that got into the "Next Action Stars". I'm glad I did not participate and did not get ... It's not funny how can you just look at the first 10 seconds (!) Of the movie? I mean, come on! Just look at the titles! I have seen this movie (or part of this "teleplay" since it was made for television and we could not bear the whole thing) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was a typical mix-podge average guy who long ago they watched serials like Las Vegas just for girls in the show. so the bar was not really tall, the most watched movie in my band was Girl Next Door (and that was not because of the great script, D. But this film is completely lacking in originality, playing, scripting, and almost everything else makes it a good movie, it was pretty easy to switch channel to Las Vegas (or it was CSI?
