The story can be seen before, but it does not matter if you can figure out the right storyboard. Obviously, the director did not work on the storyboards. Apart from that, the cameraman spent too much time inclining angles that do not match the message of the film. What's funnier is that if you look at the film's web site, you can read that it was advisable for the director to make a movie with bad camera angles. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is fine. It's a shame that Ti West did not spend more time rethinking his story. It's as if the movie was more important than planning. Because you have a camera, it does not mean you should make a movie right now ... come on. Everybody can shoot a movie, but not all will be just as good. So the advice of Ti West is: advise and mark what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until the storyboard goes away. You surely have the ability and desire - so do not abuse your talent.
