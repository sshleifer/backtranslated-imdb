This movie was the worst I've ever seen. It does not seem to have a conspiracy, but the time you realize is far beyond the start of the movie, so you have to watch the shutdown for a long time to realize the director's total incompetence, aka the chaos that plays the tampon cub in the movie, and we do not believe to Willem Dafoe in this film, it's a clone, because the real Dafoe, as we know from the "apocalypse now" and the "saint boon dock," would never agree to such a script. The Spirit (Da) declared this account closed for twenty years without a child. This film starts with the credits of two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then two writers, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then director, Colagrande. Bottomline (story); The widow meets the guy, the widow's fellow, the widow smashes the windshield with the guy who banged her. Name in the Netherlands; Black widow (another title, the same bull). <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE THIS FILM !!! It's a total pass of time !!!
