I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. The little girl was a writer, their characters were not pleasant and the plot was soaky. Moreover, it was not a gator, because the film would like to believe. If you look at a complete reptile guide, you will find it really a crocodile, not a gator. Obviously, they did not hire a real wildlife expert, or they knew that the creature was a crocodile. It's a sad excuse for the movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this one.
