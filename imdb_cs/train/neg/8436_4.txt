David Mamet is a very interesting and very unequal director. His first film "The House of Games" was the one I liked best and set up a series of movies with characters whose looks for life change when they get into complicated situations as well as the perspective of the viewer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So it's "Murder," which tries to set the viewer's idea of ​​the usual crime. The main figures are two police officers, one Jewish and one Irish, dealing with racially charged areas. The murder of an old Jewish business owner who turned out to be an old veteran of the Israeli Independence War triggers Jewish identity in the mind and heart of a Jewish detective. The errors of the film are more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, a group of Jewish militants is opera, and the way the detective finally goes into the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is intelligent Mamet but disappointed with the emotional perspective of man. Joe Mantegna and William Macy provide powerful performances, but story errors are too obvious to be easily compensated.
