OK, I'm not an American, but in my modest Scottish view Steve Martin is not, he never was, and will never be a funny person until our posters are heading south. Phil Silvers, as Sergeant Bilko, was a funny guy, no doubt because of the experienced writers and director and all the other gifted team teams in the series who made perfect contributions to one of America's most entertaining and longest comedy comedies ever produced. How could anyone have the courage to even try to replicate the figure of Silversa is behind me. To the combined issues, the exercise was repeated in Martin's unsuccessful attempt to make Peter Inspector Clouseau the next, unsuccessful attempt, in my opinion, to revive a demonstrably dysfunctional career. Some of your contributors say that "Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the figure," I would say "balderdash," his portraits will be long forgotten when Silvers and Sellars will be appreciated for generations
