What a waste of time and money! My guy and I saw this movie - when I saw the previews and I thought it might be "funny". POORLY! This movie is too long about 90 minutes. Actors are trapped in a badly written script and can not get out. The jokes are weak and tired and they can not even see that Wilson is naked behind him, he can not redeem any part of the movie. Special effects ... are not. I expected to see that harness and wires hold Uma in her flying scenes. And when the effects people could not handle the superhero faster than a bullet or fight the scenes, they covered everything with the swirling whirl of the blurry screen - which hid the terrible effects quite nicely. Wilson's helper was a kind apology for man, and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office. The sexual scenes were not sexy and the fun scenes were not fun. I think I've been waiting too much for these actors. None of the characters were really sympathetic, so I did not really care about any flying figs about any of them. The only unforgettable performance was the children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. Overall, Super Stinko - I would not recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
