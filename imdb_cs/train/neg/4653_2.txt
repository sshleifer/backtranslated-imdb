Vampire is a girlfriend she wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar fool in this extremely low-budget horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments about this movie. I'm going to mass hallucinations, but that's still worrying. The only redemption factor (and this is very generous here) can be the Grandfather, who is the only half-corrected character in this whole mess. Do not waste money or time. In fact, it's a good idea if Troma does the DVD, but it does not do it on its own, probably it's crap. Three DVD Extras: Commentary with Omar and Kirk; the second commentary with the scenes of the occupied and the crew; bloopers; throma interactivity; radiation process; Clip from "Terror Firmer"; Teenage Trailer, Trailers for "Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My class: D
