According to many critics he is one of the greatest desperate of all time (certainly the biggest smell for the career of director Brian De Palma). Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a silly, wealthy boy whose life falls apart when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) take part in the hit-and-run. His story is recorded by another humorous guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). Well, as I said in my summary ... What does this movie suppose? be? It looks like it combines comedy, drama and satire, but it certainly does not add much. It is undermined by unimaginably disgusting, one-dimensional characters that you would never want to have dissatisfaction with encounters in real life. I'm not a big fan of the novel (I read it once but could not finish it because it was not in my opinion), but I know that those who did / do the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many talented actors, trying hard to put some kind of quality and failure in the under-film. What waste. <br /> <br /> Problems start with the determination of the handsome guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly incomprehensible. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was Brit. Bruce Willis is a bad, BADLY miscast in the role. What is thinking? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even Morgan Freeman can not save his dignity with the film intact, he is obliged to deliver a bold, heavy lecture on "grace" after climax. /> <br /> This movie will eventually turn into an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I like the gathering of talent; I'll give it to four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that a much better film from the source material could be made.
