I was very excited to see this film and anticipate a visual trip about the relationship of artistic beauty and nature that includes wisdom as "Rivers and Tides." However, it was not what I got. Instead I get a relatively innocuous film about how the human industry is bad for nature. Which is clearly a completely unorthodox statement. The photographer appears to be at odds with the aesthetic qualities of his paintings and the presumed "ethical" duty he has on workers who sometimes look at the paintings on the perimeter. And frankly, the paintings were not as impressive in general. And according to this "artist" the scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's a silly movie in every respect. For people who would like to feel better in their environmental consciousness ... but no one who wants to think about the complexity of the questions that surround him.
