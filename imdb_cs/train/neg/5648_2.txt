The Boston Law turned his tail and headed for the barn door and the pig he had created! When this show first broadcast nearly four seasons for the first time, it was a funny slap in the legal system, which seems to be proud of all actors. It was funny, diversified and, to a certain extent, factual. Expressed figures were acceptable and, to a large extent, real in their imagination. Sexual comments and activities were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as she did in other series, but she is now drawn to the lower depths of media programming of sex and violence. Julie is a great actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Ren√© Adjurdubois is an outstanding actor who has kept his own in the field of entertainment since "Benson", always showing humor and respect for production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and must be admired for her continued production and she is a good actress. James Spader, no doubt that he has an acting ability, but he should return to the XXX, such as "Crash," because he seems to have a lot of talent and affection in this respect. We ask for this series to be thrown out as it is, and it really starts to feel!
