I knew this movie would not be amazing, but I thought I'd make it a chance. I'm a fan of Luck Wilson so I thought he had the potential. Unfortunately, many dialogues of the film were very fake and cheesy. I think Aquafresh gave some money to make a film, because a lot of ideas fell seriously. There's a shot at which the Aquafresh brand appears to you that you can not miss it. Perhaps they should concentrate on writing and playing more than once in the film to lose Aquafresh products without making people angry. The film had moments, but I'm glad I did not know I did not see him in the theater.
