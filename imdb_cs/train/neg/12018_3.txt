- Little time hockey tricks local boss crowd out of a lot of money. Of course, the mob boss wants to roll back the money and it does not matter who has to kill to get it. Punk will meet his friend and old gangster to help save his life. <br /> <br /> - If it sounds ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that jazz jazz jazz jazz jazz jazz Izod could hold one of the most powerful crowds in Rome is simply stupid. His friend may be good with a gun, but he's against a group of trained murderers. An old gangster is no more than a comic relief and no real help in terms of face with crowd. There is also a subchapter on how the friend's father was killed by the boss of the crowd years ago, but there is little and the film does not help at all. <br /> <br /> - Dave boss, Mr. Scarface, plays Jack Palance. I suppose he got his name because he has a look on his face like a shaving machine. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, doing what it needs to get a paycheck. <br /> <br /> - I have seen a good Italian crime / cop lately, but Mr. Scarface is not one of them. Look at the Sadist Syndicate or Revolver instead.
