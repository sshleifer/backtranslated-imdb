University student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is concerned about the nightmare ghoul, based in Alcatraz. He tries to cut off his own hand, spit the worm, the ghoul tears his chest and is baked over the open fire. After his friends see how he levitates "6 feet" above the bed, the teacher is obsessively obsessed (Donna Denton) that they will get to Alcatraz to face fear. Of course they are going in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand! The group is pulling in, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) becomes obsessed and starts killing everyone. Toni Basil of "Mickey" glory appears as a useful ghost Sammy Mitchell, lead singer of the bodybag group. He teaches Alexi how to levitate his body and makes dance rock music with a recurring nightmare to knock out the run. All the victims appear as spiritual spirits and figures of Griffin Dunn in the American Werewolf in London. The script is full of hole holes, cheese dialogues and humble attempts at comedy. Good FX work and amazing opening credits (both Ernest D. Farino) are the only thing that gets some credit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
