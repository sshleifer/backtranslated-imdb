It is true that Parsifal is not an opera that could appeal to all, although it is my favorite, especially Knappertsbusch, 1951. Syberberg's approach is so static. Whenever music suddenly starts to swing ... Syberberg keeps casting at the same pace. Wearing Amforta and Klingsora are endless. What happened to the film adaptation? The result is physically exhaustive tracking. The viewer is not spiritually transported. Your impulse is to hurry home and play again to confirm that Wagner is right, Syberberg was wrong. And this setting of decoration with those "clever" remarks of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will it ever be the viewer of this film without Wagner's prior awareness?
