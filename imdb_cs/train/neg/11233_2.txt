If I can tell you, despite the earlier comments of other commentators, this movie is currently available on DVD. I found it just weeks ago. It's on the Value DVD label and I paid a total of 98 cents plus a tax for it. I found out that it was in a 98 cents store between plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now do not you think that people who dared to get rich money for the super-duper Swedish version limited version release feel like you'd ?? I thought so. The film was really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I can start arguing with you. But it is clearly worth 98 cents. And remember what you're saying about what you've paid. Only for youngsters.
