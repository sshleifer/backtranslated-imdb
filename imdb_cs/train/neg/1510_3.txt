Reasons to look at this discouragement ... err ... honoring the great movie Se7en: - It's when your channel is surfing and there is nothing else. - Someone will pay you to look at them. Divide your favor and pop the DVD at Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes, or insert it into your Netflix bible and skip The Flock completely. Flock the same story with a few changes. Additionally, this is the adjustment that Se7en is doing and actually takes you out of the story several times. The worst is probably flying over desert helicopters, with the sounds of people scattering over radio, except that there is no police helicopter in this. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: I call it a flashy go. If you want to be dear, you can call it a movie of honor, go ahead, but look Se7en.
