This movie was quite absurd. There were few funny parts. It goes directly to the movie cage in my memory where I think, "Hmm ..... the movie had some fun parts, but overall, a pretty ridiculous plot (or lack)." <br /> <br /> I thought it seemed that Ben was a bit difficult to be a chef of humor. And I did not understand how he became a multimillionaire who is alone, and he is still such an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. She does a little bullshit, but hey, I can forgive him. I think Jersey Girl liked me, I did not think Gigli was his fault, overall I like it. I think it's like a kid you like because you just can not seem to be right. My advice would be to avoid this movie. It really did not develop into a functional conspiracy, and Catherine O'Hara and Jimmy G. were not as well used as they could be. They deserved better. Overall, this movie is not home alone, it's not the Christmas story, its Christmas holiday or some of the other classic. Forever Forgettable.
