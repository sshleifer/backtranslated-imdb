I do not know about you, but what I love about cartoons Tom and Jerry is (often violent) interaction between these two characters. The Manhattan Mouse sees that Jerry leaves Tom for an adventure in New York, and as for me, this guy is definitely suffering from a cat lacking! As magical as Jerry explores, "Big Apple" can be for other T & J fans who have been commenting on IMDb here. I could not wait for this self-service waste to end so I could watch another cartoon on my DVD. <br /> <br /> The only part of the whole episode I really enjoyed was the fact that Jerry had almost "bought a farm" and hanged unexpectedly at the end of a broken candle hundreds of meters above the busy road.
