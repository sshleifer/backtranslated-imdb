Baldwin made enough to make such films. Script, music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , because these gadgets really did not sound such loud sounds. Natural sounds like traces do not exist, giving it an empty atmosphere. Direction seems to be fine for such a low budget (I certainly hope it was a low budget production), although it seems quite amateurish at times. <br /> <br /> Most characters look empty and fake, they simply did not castard this movie very well. I imagine it would be better if Baldwin spoke Spanish than the Spanish actors would speak English, when we all know their language is more alive and livelier, and therefore actors can suffer if a specific language is used. Do I think that somebody will finally realize how stupid it is for international actors to speak English with a bad accent? It has long since been buried in the film production of a corpse. Has the production team ever heard about the subtitles? This film can once again show the European police as lazy and spoiled, societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if it happens again like "Interpol can not make a jack, let's just call one American to lose this international syndicate," or whatever. Sony Pictures is moving along the same path as Columbia, it's just making films for hell. I would imagine they have confidence too. Are buyers obliged to buy every dirty title, just because Sony something good several times a year ?! Perhaps they should use the same team as those who do Di Que Si - Say I Do. This is spoken in Spanish, and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job of keeping the film above water. It looks and sounds much better! Come on, Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
