Usually, when a movie gets the voice of one, it's because someone just does not like it and is angry that it does not have a lower rating, and so decides to drag as much as it can, instead of giving it a small rating. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of the movie 0/10. He will not do anything right and has no chance because he does not really try to do anything. There are sources of a bad Romanesque kind of D & D that can not be combined and a complete lack of any kind of negotiation. It is clear that no one involved in this project made any serious effort, because even the obviously uninterested hard work of people would mean more. Great movie.
