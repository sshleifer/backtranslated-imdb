I am among the millions of people who consider themselves to be Cary Grant fans, but I do not think I could recommend this movie. I do not understand Betsy Drake and it seems that no one else did it if we had a judge from a small number of movies in which he played later. Most fans agree that Katharine Hepburn was great in hunting and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby. Here the director or writers try to revisit the idea, but unluckyly fails. I read comments on how "dear" Drake was, but I thought it was too mildly descriptive. Franchot Tone went through this as if he were a hungover. A casting disaster is one thing. This film is a complete disaster. This one does not deserve 10 lines of comments and I do not know why it's a requirement. It was so bad that it was so much that so much movie was worth nesting in the vaults. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to torture someone, make it a wide berth.
