I watched the whole movie until the shameful end, though I felt so angry that I saw. I felt the director screaming for attention, and the only way he could do it was as repulsive as possible. Since I lived in the UK, I loved this country, but this film depicts British young people in the worst possible conception. There is nothing to say, but avoid being angry and sick. Interested people should be ashamed.
