Do not get me wrong, I love action and vengeance, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's last "The Mechanik," which is quite good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use the camera, and even can be a brilliant shooting and editing of movies. But with "Man on Fire" (and even more with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of smartly using his "genius" ability to make films, he uses it with care to show off and compensate for the lack of substance his material does not offer. The "Fiery Man" is approaching two and a half hours, when it really should be an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott made and edited this movie also tells you if he really wants you (audience) to sit in his movie because his constant camera moves and flashes is really tortuous for the eye and let you leave the theater or turn it off in 5 minutes. MPAA and studio have dubious attitudes about rating, violence, and PG-13 movies, but it is also suspicious that $ 70 million is a film made from a B-movie screenplay with a character shooting through fingers, putting a bomb in his ass and throwing a guy's hand a shotgun, it all avenes the death of a little girl who is not even dead! So, why the studio delivers a better script due to tongue or violence ... So he said ...
