I wanted to like Magnolia. The story reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that eventually merged, but Magnolia was wrong in the movie and was lost during the game. I almost turned it off and there, but I felt I should hang there until the end, I knew a bit tiring about 1 1/2 hours. Thank God I rented instead to see it in the theater. I almost cried for disappointment after 2 hours. The biggest football in the trousers was the ultimate frog. My DVD player still does not forgive me and I do not even blame him. It was a unique film, but a bad, boring and unnecessary film.
