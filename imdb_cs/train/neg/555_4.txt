The film is quite confusing and ridiculous. The plot is awful ... but on the plus side, acting is pretty good, with some good shouts and wounds. Sharon's stone is fine this time ... it's not as good as the original one. Murders are not as horrible as the first, which is a pity. It's not an unpredictable mess that everyone says is wrong. Gender is sometimes very graphic while others are clear that they are fake (they are fully dressed). The script is mostly weak, but the scenes with doubts and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlighted. The plot is shortened several times, but the end is terrible. The tension is always constant with the huge throwing "God of mine!". The sequences of the pursuit are greatly directed and the camera's shots and angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to another gloomy movie. Sharon Stone is also a bit old. The bits, where we can see that her breasts are at first, are nice. This time they are too proud to describe. Movie films are rather average, but they are worth it. Mainly because the movie deserves some good humming ... with an initial order. It will not be critical, but if you liked the first - leave this one. Do not ruin the run. You will be glad you left this stone.
