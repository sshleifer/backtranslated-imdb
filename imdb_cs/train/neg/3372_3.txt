The pale shadow of a great musical, this film suffers from the fact that director Richard Attenborough is totally lacking in a musical point, unnecessarily "opens" him and waves the game. The show is about a group of dancers who bid for work in a B'way musical and explore their pursuit and desire to work in this challenging and not always rewarding direction of work. Attenborough gives us a fresh touch of hopeful people, assuming they are trying to get their "big break" in show business, rather than introducing a sandy mix of stage-built characters as a group of living "gypsies" along with some newcomers. The movie has one advantage over the game and it's the opening scene that shows the size of the original bankruptcy and the actual shrinking range up to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, which is stupidly held out of the line in the movie). Anyone who can capture the local civilian light production of the game will have a much richer experience than to see this badly conceived film.
