I agree with most Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary format change. Columbo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This film looks like a remake of other current detective dramas from the past. And that's a disturbing point because Columbo is not a regular detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this movie that made me interesting. First of all, I can not figure out the title of this movie. It's misleading. Perhaps a better title would be "The Blind Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo conceals the evidence without giving them reason (at least for the audience) why it does. I do not feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk has returned to the usual Columba. <br /> <br />
