The time spent watching this film was time forgiven. I do not like science fiction. I do not deny any genre in itself, because good work can be done in any genre. But this movie is not a good job. I can not mistake the visual (unless it includes foreign makeups), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not out-and-out BAD, for a trekkish comic. But fx visuals were of course where all the creators were interested / attention / money went. The direction was alternating between slow and confusing (he was not sure who exactly did what and what and with whom in at least one critical point). "Acting" was mostly very bad. On most of the bar frequencies, there was no basis, except for the hint "It was so on the page and the director told me I was going to be crazy / sad / afraid / whatever." Well, that was the pilot from the SF series since when is the justification for the repairable losses in areas that should be considered necessary for a dramatic medium. Am I amwildered that the pilot sold the series or is the money also in the hands of technerd?
