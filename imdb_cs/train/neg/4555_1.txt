This film does not capture any secrets and intrigue that the book offers. The main point of the book, thumbnails, hardly touches, so the viewer wonders why everyone is so keen on them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Personality development is not good at all. No backdrop or personal development leaves the viewers at all dependent on what happens to them, so the action sequences are lost. Finding the manuscripts ends suddenly, and without a real explanation, it is not all sense of satisfaction with what the whole search is. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst edits of a book I've ever seen. It's terrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you read the book, skip the movie and read it. <br /> <br /> It's almost like having a movie make a discredit book, it's a bad and ridiculous movie. It's also a shame, because it might be good if they were on top of their success and probably would be able to get good screenwriters and some good actors. do not waste time, READ THE LIBRARY !!!
