He needed an excuse to get out of the house while the paint dried - he left the film in an hour to come back and watch the color dry. I do not ever remember going to the movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the cast and simply just "went and went" wrong - come on! Uma Thurman doing this? Relatively lame special effects. They were older characters and actors make superficial horny 20ths of life - just a little annoying and bad feeling. This review is a base just in the first hour - it could be better. I had to go back home to find out if the color had dried a darker shade than if it were going on.
