If you are looking for a movie that portrays the absurd and boring existence of middle-class lives caught in a network of non-communication and false ideals, then that is the film for you. If you also have what you want the movie to take and keep your interest, you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that make it much better. Try some of the darker films by Bergman for example. The film director felt that in order to show middle-class spiritual poverty, the audience should be subjected to one anxiously boring and empty incident after another, until the film eventually arrives at its sad and feeble end. If you appreciate your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, such as cleaning your home.
