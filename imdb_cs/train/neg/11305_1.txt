This is a very bad west, especially because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like it was shot down on California's back, where Jack Slade, Idaho, Colorado Territories and Montana lived and died. It fictifies everything that is known about this mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is terrible; there is very little direction and dirty acting. Dorothy Malone is completely useless as his wife. Mark Steven never knows how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life Jack Slade was a very good supervisor. He was afraid of his local burghers because of his hard drink. When he was drunk, he started fighting and caused further problems at Virginia City in Montana. To make sure he would never be able to terrorize, Jack Slade warned cautiously, ignoring the warning that he would immediately leave the city. That's a terrible movie. I can not recommend anyone watching this movie other than seeing how Hollywood makes history as it pleases, even today.
