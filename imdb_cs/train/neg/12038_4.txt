There's something going on in this movie. There are just bizarre short scenes where I did not know what the hell is going on, so it does not count. This movie is so bad that it hurts, and it comes from the guy he likes when the movies are about filming movies. Confused? Well, I was watching these bulls. What Donald Sutherland was because he escaped with it. And what about the "pedophile" scene at the beginning of the movie. Can somebody sleep? 4/10
