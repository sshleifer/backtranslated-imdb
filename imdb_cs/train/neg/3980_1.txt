I am not joking. If they ever design a movie idea, they should be dropped out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in all, and they are just about traveling to foreign places that have a problem they can easily solve, hoping they'll be popular and get new friends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie in which you're playing a different conspiracy, contact me and tell me your name. These "movies" are bad excuses to be on TV and go to other countries. There is a reason that movies never go to theaters. I'm sure that when they were really young and did some O.K. movies, some studio boss bought all rights in 15 years or something, so now that they are 17, they can shoot movies in other countries whenever they want to use the money of studying. Allow me to advise you, stay out of MARY-KATE and ASHLEY! It's for your own time!
