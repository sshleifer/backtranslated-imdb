OK, the story - a simple dick gets into life with a boredom to the death of a young cat and her baby brother and makes a trigger in her life - is a little interesting. Anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has some ...) - execution is everything. <br /> <br /> I was worried by this step. And it bothered me a lot. Rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven, and climax was expected. We saw the burning highways five, six, seven times - why? Norton's character problems were considered a childish play, it is not enough to grasp his problems / soul / blah and roots for or against him / her. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a nanny? Links to "taxi drivers" were ridiculous and unnecessary, and certainly not for this interest (or for E.N.). And IMHO is executed cowardly at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for adolescent lovers somewhere in Central America. The guy should kill the child, blame his father, cause real confusion. Or the boy was supposed to kill his father at the end, etc. But no, we got cheese when the kids are missing, and his father is confused over his own life and relationship with them and of course he will die. The happy dysfunctional family remains undamaged, safe and happily bored to enjoy our pop-corns, undisturbed. And the scene where the loop gets into the movie, oh God, I have to think long and hard to find something more stupid than that! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden crew. The creators of this movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you're a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas or anywhere, and where you dream of having sex with a crazy man twice at your age, well, then you could enjoy this movie and his "message".
