I read Reaper Ben Mezrich a few years ago and last night I happened to see this adaptation. Although it was years since I read the story for the first time, the differences between the novel and the film are humongous. Very important elements that have made the whole thing plausible are simply written down or changed to the wrong. If it's interesting for you: go out and get a novel. Its much, much, much better. Still 4 out of 10 because it was hard to stop watching because of the big conspiracy by Ben Mezrichem.
