Victor Vargas's victory is getting worse in what he's most trying to do: to be real. Unfortunately, this movie has no reality. Characters and situations are totally artificial and fake. Reason? Poor Direction. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollet somewhere read that his illumination does not allow his authentic feeling. Poorly! It just makes it a bad feeling. Similarly, camera tracing does not give the film a documentary style, but it only gives viewers headaches and worsens what's on the screen instead of improving it. Of course, what is on the screen is as painfully fake as Mr. Sollett wrote his screenplay for the sole purpose of trying to look "hip" to his friends in Sundance and show what a "sharp" filmmaker is. Overall, the only lasting impression of this film leaving you is what is a bad director, Mr. Sollett. Next time with several written and overhead classes?
