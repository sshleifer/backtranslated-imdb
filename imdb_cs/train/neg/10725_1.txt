Just as I do not like to say "I too" in response to other comments - it is quite true that the first 30 minutes of this movie has nothing to do with an infinite dirge that consists of the following 90. <br /> <br /> When it is somewhere banned, the film is not traceable. Just because it does not look like a Hollywood product, it does not give you credibility. <br /> <br /> Even worse is that there is no recognizable conspiracy (except that there are lots of muddy places in Russia and many people, old women drink plenty of vodka) a lot of visuals are so unnecessarily furious I am in my second pack of rolls. As for spoilers - the film is so deprived of narrative fiber When I tried, I could not write it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money and do not confuse it with a good Russian cinema.
