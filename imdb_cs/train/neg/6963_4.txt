The Japanese always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy films. They were always ready to destroy cities with huge plastic monsters coming from space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never had the money to succeed in gaining convincing special effects. This film, which was released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures from a huge octopus to a huge lobster that tries to keep the people up. It is extremely unpleasant and ridiculous, but also quite pleasant. After all, we like these creatures and these films, after all, do we?
