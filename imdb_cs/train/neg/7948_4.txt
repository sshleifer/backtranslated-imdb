"Seventh Mark" borrows a lot from "Rosemary's Child" and "Rumors" (actually consists of both stories). Even his name reminds Bergman's "seventh seal". However, it starts well, with all the things scattered throughout the country and in parallel with a significantly different conspiracy with Moore's husband, who is trying to save the poor boy (who killed his parents who were brothers and sisters) from the death penalty. (although a Jewish Jew is involved), which makes the lines sometimes inadvertently entertaining (You were sometimes on Sunday school but taught me that God is love!) The best IMHO scene is a brief dialogue between priest John Heard - who does not seem to take matters seriously, too badly given him no more important role because his carefree attitude is invaluable - and the young Jew. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore is likely to experience the same desire as the former husband Bruce Willis: to save the world. movie for all.
