First of all, I would like to emphasize that even though I am not an expert, the way the process was conducted will offend your intelligence. First, prosecution has never proven that "light learning" really works. Irresponsible both for prosecution (because they can get an appeal) and for defense for not doing so. As another commentator said, facilitated learning was proven untrue. Second, they used Terry as a translator who has a personal interest, and even testifies, in a process that is simply stupid. If the court allowed him to testify, they would bring someone neutral, otherwise they would just ask for an appeal. Thirdly, this child has never been asked by the prosecution to ask specific questions about prosecution (maternal sign, details of the event, etc.). And even if he asked the questions of defense as he started, he could not answer. If there is no reasonable doubt, I do not know what it is and a competent lawyer would get tax exemptions. Getting Started, starts well with the pressures that you are the child's autistic parent, but the exam makes this movie absolutely incredible.
