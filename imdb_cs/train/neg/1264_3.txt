This movie does not have much to do with his predecessor "Robot Jox". That's why it's the most common name of "Robot Wars," and not the replacement name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". Robot Jox was basically a fun movie to watch because it was a good idea of ​​giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this film, and instead it has a totally boring story, which, moreover, is not too original or cleverly written. It is a shame that he really tried to be so different from his predecessor, because otherwise it might be a more entertaining film to watch. Just like "Robot Jox" it's a B-movie, but with the big difference it's just not very good. Perhaps it is also that "Robot Jox" originated in the 1980s, when B-movies still had a bit of magic and class, even though the film was released in 1990. It really can not be about this movie. They are just lame, poorly rendered, bad looking and not quite exciting. It's also the end that lets you think "that's it? It's all?" What the movie that misses the story is a really clear story. Perhaps a good good villain would be a good idea and some other things like a real point to the story, some action or sympathetic main characters. Seriously, what they thought when they selected actors for this film. Everyone is simply not pleased with their roles and Don Michael Paul is unpleasant as the main character who acts as God's gift to a woman and to Mr. Perfekt who can compete with someone. Can not they even be able to get actors from the first movie? For such a futuristic film with the concept of big combat droids in it, this film is definitely lacking in its activities. If the film were more and more actionable, the film would be fun, at least. Instead, we now have a movie that does not imply the impression that there are basically every way you think. <br /> <br /> You can better watch the episode "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" for more action and likeness. <br /> </ p> <p> 3/10
