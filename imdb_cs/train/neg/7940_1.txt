Guy de Maupassant was a writer who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without any moral qualities. It just wants success in a society where all people, politicians, businessmen, journalists and women are spoiled. The only king is MONEY. The Maupassant hero, Charles Forestier, will, on account of his seduction, make himself socially taller and taller. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his performance on the rise of society. At the end of the novel, he married the greatest daughter of the daily paper owner at the largest church in Paris: La Madeleine. "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has wealth and more, becomes a member of parliament and later a minister. "Unnecessary" women are out of his mind but always in touch with nice and useful women. The painting "BEL AMI PRIVATE IMPORTANCE" is a story of MORALITY. It's all, but it's not a story in the thoughts of Maupassant. Why did they give the title "BEL AMI"?
