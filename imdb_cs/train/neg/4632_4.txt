Maria Bello does not matter what people think of their choices in film roles. Again he chooses a very difficult and not very popular film to play in the movie. Perhaps she needs the movies to jump out of sugar coated (aka "Hollywood") what he does here and there (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3). /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> This combined with a weird theme almost made a trick for me. But in the end (although I try to overlook some mistakes, such as bad stimulation and dramaturgy), the film is still too long
