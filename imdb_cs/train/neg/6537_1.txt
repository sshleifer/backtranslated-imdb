Let me first warn you that I saw this movie on TV and dub English - which can make the atmosphere completely corrupted. But I'm going to see what I've seen, and I hope he'll take people out of this version. I found this movie unbearably boring. All the atmosphere of the film is lost with the dabing leaving the frustration of the stalker film. I'm sorry, but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow, except for the film about philosophy. In this film I did not see any deep philosophical significance. Perhaps I miss something, but I have to say it as if I saw it. I rated it as "1". What can I say, tastes oriented to the US, maybe.
