I do not want to get a rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was really glad I gave her 4 out of 10. What else could be a wonderful story, in fact, a set of more or less decent actors has become my full-fledged eyes. There's so much clich√© in the movie, female hair is just horrible, and most scenes are more than unrealistic or fake. There is no real passion in this movie, but a lot of actors cross the border that hurts. It's not so strange that it's a comedy, it's sadly sad that it really touches, so in my eyes it's just not good. I watched that I could not believe how it came to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But ... maybe it was still fine and just lost in translation? Who knows. Surely one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen, and it certainly is not in the good sense! Excuse me.
