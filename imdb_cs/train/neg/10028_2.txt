I had a lot of expectations from this movie, and even more, because it was the Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs a call center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach his boss Lakhan Singh, English. They both fall in love and decide to flee, but Pooja tells Jimmy that he can not do that because he owes the debtor Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and his only one that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji hires men, Bachchan Pandey, to trace Jimmy and Pooja. Cast: Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, directed by Via Krishna Acharya and produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. "Tashan" must be one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Yes! The landscape is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her very famous weight loss) looks good. But the story is extremely thin for the story and sometimes makes no sense from one scene to the other - so I said at first that I expected more of this movie because it was Yashraj production. Unfortunately, with reference to songs, there is no song I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are times when one can laugh and it is mainly thanks to Akshay Kumar and Saif that could definitely do it better while Kareena Kapoor played its role well. But it can not be said to Anil Kapoor - he was not defective. Finally, do not mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good movies like "Mohabbatein," what Yash Chopra does by producing such a waste film? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, do not waste time and this is my first and last impression.
