This is the worst show I've seen in years. I think he should be removed from TV because of his delay. It's so stupid that if I can watch, I can fade. (though I never see it because it's SOOOOO poor) Goofs: When mac says he can not eat sugar, in another episode he gets sugar. Almost everything in the world has sugar in it! In the episode "Eddie Monster," when the whirling screams at Terrance fall into the crate twice PLUS after the time when it falls, it does not fall, it sinks to the side. What stupidity. I can not even say the word Fosters Home. I even made a song with the band about how this show is slowing down. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
