What a terrible movie. This was also a mature tomato. do not be fooled by positive remarks; It was not scary. It was not funny. It was not smart. It will not even hold your attention. I just lost 2 hours of my life when I saw this fucking fest. A computer-created monster was interesting to see the first couple of times. after about 15 minutes it's fun. the dialogue was terrible, it must be a translation. Another negative that excelled was an idiot of Americans. 3 were rendered and all lacked character, intelligence, and judgment. Now I'm gonna write a couple of lines that should be because we have to have 10. The employees in the video rental shop would have to burn me that I brought this title to the counter.
