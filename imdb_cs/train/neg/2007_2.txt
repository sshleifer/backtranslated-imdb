The cast is okay. The script is sometimes embarrassing, and it takes a while before you find out what the point of the movie is. I found out that I was looking forward to the dishes. Battle Shehan is a cheese declaration of war. I think we should not have noticed it ... we did it. It's a house, you've done more than kill forty-five minutes. The shower ... yeah? What was it about? I literally have a client: "Ok, you can use a shower." Yawn. Angles are trying hard. There was a set of forests, suddenly it's gone because you can see exactly, then another is deep and the animals are dying. It's a terrible movie with boring proportions.
