I do not understand when I inform you that you see a woman who has sex with the goat in this movie. If it's your thing, then your movie has come. The woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in a family mansion in the woods. Her sister, last but not least, is a haunted lady, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family. A group of indecent characters appears on their side and they begin to accept all kinds of pagan rituals. The rendering is relatively weak and the characters are pretty stupid. The woman sticks to her after her husband begins to turn into sadness and talks to the pagans and even continues to have sex with him. On the exploitative side of things there is a much-exposed body and a few loop connections, but nothing that would be better anywhere else. Oh and the above-mentioned goat sex scene. Most viewers can not finish it. They come from exploitation fans, but they do not want to leave more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
