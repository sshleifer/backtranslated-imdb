Weak and unnecessary piece of fluff (bloody blur but fluffy). Badly sketched, with a careless and wooden dialogue. You do not care if the characters (even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, a small point on the whole thing. Perhaps some of the sets and settings will be interested - the gaps between the charts of all buildings may be true to life. The meeting is unnecessary and disturbing, and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy himself is boring and awkward.
