Bela Lugosi as a creepy crazy scientist who uses orchids to marry brides to steal the essence of an aging woman. Tiny in this movie is cheerful !! Lots of freaks, plus lots of padding and no plot make this film a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces eventually agreed in a typical Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interested and you feel helpless when you look. I usually get score as if it were one, but the pacifier added just enough shyness and fun to get a few more points.
