The game was terrible, just like the screenplay. It was badly connected and almost wanted to laugh at some scary murder scenes. The end was even worse. They all died, but the end made it look like everything is fine! They did not get enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The film needed more time to make a better story. The only reason I'm giving this 3/10 is that I feel bad about young actors. They needed better coaching. They could really do a good movie, but the script and acting failed.
