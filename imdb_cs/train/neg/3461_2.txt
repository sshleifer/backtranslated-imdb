Slasher films are often considered derivatives, repeated and frankly non-original. I become a fan of horror films, but this movie was just so poor, words are failing me. The script is really missing, the story is ridiculous and horrific. It's just an arson that I've lost my life. It had all the entertainment value of 15. the sequel to the film that was the first. <br /> <br /> Who has failed this mess? <br /> <br /> I had only two things in this movie. The first was the killer's mask - which was pretty. The second was Austrail affinity with humorous grace. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this nasty disorder.
