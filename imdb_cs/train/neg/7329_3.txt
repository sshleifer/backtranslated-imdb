After watching this movie, I felt compelled to suppress my frustration. Selma Blair is a wonderful, currently underestimated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, though not entirely original, has certainly made a promise. None of that mattered. I do not know what her agreement is, but director Dana Lustig has no talent at all as a director. She slowed down shots, shot the shots, turned the tracks, used the camera's unpleasant angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion of rapid cuts, jumped up and down in the timeline, and upgraded it with an incomprehensible "modern" soundtrack of drummer junkies. I can not remember the last time I've seen such an incompetent work on the film. Her ego must be enormous to cast off the acting and story and give her a forward and center direction to make the audience aware. It's the entangled throat. There are some good scenes in "Kill Me Later," which show what could and should be. Unfortunately, just as things began to make a promise, Mrs Lustig would start digging into a bag of film school tricks and lots of things. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had a good chemistry and you could say the movie really had a good heart. 3/10
