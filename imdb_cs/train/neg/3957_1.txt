The original Boogeyman was a stupid but fun supernatural movie slasher. In any case, it was not a great movie but fun in the true spirit. The third part of this series, Return Boogeyman, on the other hand, is just cruel. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless new recordings. Secondly, the loading of recycled bits from the first film. The new material is incredibly amateur, but not amusingly awkward, just incredibly boring. These shots were clearly knocked quickly and effortlessly. It serves as a framing device for endless clips from the first (and maybe even second) movies. And the boy, they milk these clips from earlier films; sometimes repeatedly use sequences. The only new addition to these works is the voice over which unnecessarily describes exactly what we see in our own eyes. The whole experience with this tracking is really mind-boggling. <br /> <br /> The return of Boogeyman is an example of the worst kind of exploitation; which exploits the audience in a highly cynical way. I would like this review to be brief and to the extent that this film is no longer deserving. There is nothing of value here at all. That's worthless.
