"They are among us" is at best bad science fiction. Medium-advanced actor film consists of this film. The punches are numerous. Aliens who somehow have come to the ground for a meteorite and have been hiding among us for more than 100 years but need a plastic surgeon to look like a human. In their extraterrestrial form they are supposedly exo-skeletons (therefore they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. The hero's father "vanished" after he closed the Project Blue Book but was reportedly the F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see the movie about an alien invasion, select "Invasion of Body Hijackers" and see how it is done right.
