A boring, predictable and uninteresting story about a chemical-contaminated man (Weller), who continues throughout the country just to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, everything kills in the way with just one touch of his hands. In a dangerous way, the doctor (Hurt) and the young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film does not have an original premise, but it could still be much better. The end result is just a movie without moments of strain or rigidity. Even a good cast is totally outraged. I give it 4 (four).
