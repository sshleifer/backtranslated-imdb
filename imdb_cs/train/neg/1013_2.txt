If you watched this movie, you know why I said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Each time they said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ..." I laughed, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent the film?" I can not believe how Oscars appeared in the background like Freeman and Spacey, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Common acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could do a much better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I'm not a great fan of it ... but I really prefer actors, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and uncomfortable like hell. I was happy when they both got to the street. The story was fine, and I think Dylan Mc Dermott has done a very good job. The movie was fun, but I think Timberlake destroyed everything. It would be much more enjoyable without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was fine, but suddenly every time the music appeared, the movie turned into an MTV video with lightning, low motion, and the like. Something bad for this film of cops I thought. Maybe they wanted to create a MTV video for Timberlake.
