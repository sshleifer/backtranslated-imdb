<br /> <br /> I am a big fan of horror / sci-fi regardless of budget, but after watching many horror movies late at night on cable and video, it must be the worst of all the movies. With bloody special effects (which looked like roasted with fake blood or ketchup that had been repeatedly displayed) and the people running around screamed from the left, then right and then back. He had to stay at the beginning of the department store and stopped there and it was 15 minutes. Instead, he took it very long. It's a very, very x5 low budget. Many scenes were caused, too long. The narrator was very amateurish as a random junior high. This is the only film that I think reduces me than Manos, the Red Zone of Cuba, Benji and Godzilla. Megalon despite their higher budget. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake the whole movie in one or even better state, avoid being as if you were a dead brain crowd.
