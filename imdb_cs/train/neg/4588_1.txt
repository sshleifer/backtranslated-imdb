I created my own reality by going out of the theater where my girlfriend came to go with her mom to this section. We (my friend and I) set off for about an hour. What burden of pseudo-scientific new jargon. Under atomic particles are thoughts? By sticking the labels on bottles of water and blessing the Buddhist monk, only a few nice crystals grew up? The fall of 25% in the murder rate in DC happened when a lot of people were contemplating. What a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone was eating cheerios for four days straight at the same time. Can we assume that eating cheerios has caused a drop in murder rates? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bull pukka! <br /> <br /> BTW - It was funded by the Ramtha culture, whose leader was one of the "experts" who was interviewed by the creators. There are no other motives, right?
