Well, I must admit that this was one of my favorite boys when I saw them on the home projector as super-8 cylinders. Now there is not much to recommend, except the inherent value of actors who are "scared" replicas of human skulls. Special effects are quite stupid, mostly consisting of wire skulls and overlapping images of "ghosts". But there is something to be said about the sets. The big castle in which it is held is quite horrifying, especially because it is mostly unfurnished (probably for budget reasons?). It certainly inspires more laughter than cries. Just try not to catch up when a wife (who does more than her share of screaming) goes to the greenhouse and is confronted with her husband's ex-husband.
