At least I was looking forward to the mocking of the film, which is surprising because I barely managed to sit down. Overall, I believed that the DVD case case costs more than the whole movie. And to say he's the same director as The Boogeyman when the new version that just appeared ... pretty touch guys, it was pretty misguided to bring me. The only thing that made me more frustrated than the unbearable copcat deal was his hairstyle. You usually see that type of hair for only a ten-year-old boy and the character looks like this. The movie looks like it was shot dead by a D + grad student of some film school, excited to use every film technique she's ever learned while studying ... sometimes less is more a friend. I just lost my chance of unpleasant hangings that have never been explained or explained. Everything makes a bad movie, but when the end does not work together, this is an exceptionally bad movie. No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and that includes the final video of my friends for the high school year, but maybe I'm a little bit interested, I think I played extra. P.S. I do not think he deserves a star ... not even half. NONE FOR YOU !!
