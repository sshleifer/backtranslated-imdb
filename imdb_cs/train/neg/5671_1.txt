If you like live animals, their heads were broken, the throat dogs were crushed, my men fell on them, then it's for you! But if you're a bit normal and you do not need to see real shots about the cruelty of the animals, pass this. This movie is trying to shock the viewer and it certainly does. With a broken animal trick at the beginning and killing of children in the movie (at least fake) it was enough to shut it down. I've seen movies like this before shots from the slaughterhouse (BTK movie) and this kind of shot should not be allowed in a horror movie. We look at gore and horror because we know its simple make-up and special effects, so we should not sit watching the movie and see the actual killing of animals, it's not what we rented the film. If there was anything, a large warning sticker should appear on these types of garbage to win people; Like a very hot horror fan, this stomach turned around. The entire movie and the crew need to check their heads.
