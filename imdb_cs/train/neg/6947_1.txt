No doubt it is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women that lead to bank robberies, with which we should somehow sympathize. It's hard to sympathize with the characters who still make such a stupid decision. Oh, no, the cops are on us, they know who we are, what we do ... Make one more bank, then we're out here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it is easy to tell who will end up dead.
