Well, what I can say about this movie is that it's great to see as many Asian faces. What I did not like in the movie was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. Asian girl without self-confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead, the white guy lingered in Asian culture and decided to leave his white world behind the yellow ground and "keep it" the real "black cab driver." Moreover, all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts were so obvious The story of the plot itself was fun but quite a lot as I thought the story would melt And then when you look at romantic comedies you can not wait too much but then I would like to be at least once Parents are the best part of the film.
