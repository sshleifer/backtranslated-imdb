Jeremy Northam is fighting the clone script "Total Recall" and a one-time romantic game to bring life to a confused character. Lucy Liu takes her acting from a wooden start to a worker. You can not laugh when you look at DVD conversations when it uses the terms "Femme fatal" and "Romance". French film noir actress is not missing chemistry altogether. This film fails, not in conspiracy or action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in film photography and ham-fisted performances of world technology around major protagonists. A small attempt at dressing a scenery is any contiguous film landscape or period. Cars are very 1990s and architecture barely modern with open plans that suggest a rather limited budget than a conscious way of dressing. Technology is positively cheerful. Massive "2001: Space Odyssey" mainframes powered by portable CD-ROMs with data gathered for some inexplicable reasons, despite an expanding communications network that would obviously be aware of the most dangerous technician. There is a clear lack of research that has taken place here, and given the open nature of the cybernetic community, research would not be too costly than a message board and personal time. Interviews with DVD also revealed the original name of the film was "human company", but it probably jumped to make money in Matrix a hype. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest relationship to the movie. Terry Gilliam would do miracles with this concept; and completely overwritten the Decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is the quality of telefilm and is very disappointing in the length of the movie. It could have done a good subgroup for "Alias".
