That's the kind of movie I'm most afraid of. Arrogant and irresponsible, the sketch of the Colombian conflict is so cliché and stupid that it is an insult to all Colombian people. The performances are godawul, Grisales (her naked scene is utterly poor), Bjeran, Fanny Mickey (which looks right out of the nightmare of Tim Burton), Díaz, who is trying to bring the life of the personality to life, - large and cliché and so badly written , with whom he has a job, is a mustache. Not to mention the free end, gore fest so cheese that it would do Ed Wood's neck. Jorge Alí Triana's film was always a poor filmmaker, but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, except that Colombian creators will learn the lessons of honesty, integrity and accountability of this intended fiasco.
