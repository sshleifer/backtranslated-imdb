Most of the edits of the books are bad, but this movie skipped the key parts of the story and changed the description and some characters. They revived storyline and combined scenes and changed the order. They added to him ridiculous things that never happened in the book and will never happen. If I did not read the book in advance, it would be an incredibly boring film, it did not work on attitudes just as it is or does not like it. The characters disappear on the jokes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br />
