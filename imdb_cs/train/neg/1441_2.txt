I chose this film on the envelope myself and thought I was in an adventure on the level of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". Unfortunately I was for virtual yawning. Not like the yawn I had before. This yawn was so great that in this movie I barely found something of a quality. The wrapper described amazing special effects. None was there. The film was so light that even stereotypes were terribly portrayed. This gives you the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your children. I do not. Stay away from this. If you are looking for family fun, you can find something else that is inspirational.
