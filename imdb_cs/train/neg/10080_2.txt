I had to look for actresses to find a record of this film because the title is now an unexpected love. It's not really good to look for it, but I was not familiar with both potential customers and I was wondering why they talked about a lesbian film on Lifetime. Everything is quite restrained and you do not really have an idea of ​​who these characters are, as a spectator, I have been unable to invest emotionally into the story. I think I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who he is. Everything is muted and the soft focus and the tones of the earth ... is nothing interesting. I had a huge interest in seeing two women who are out of the way, but it's so discreetly resolved that I'm disappointed. Rent Personal Personal instead.
