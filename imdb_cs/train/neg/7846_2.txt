You know, I went to see that "Hills have eyes 2" they like. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was really fun. Apparently they had more money than Wes Craven made special effects for the second time. Although I still prefer the original film, the remake was successful, and it was something to blame for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for horror fans. <br /> <br /> Who brings us to "The Hills Have eyes 2". Man, where do I start from? Drawing, or lack of one, is a thin paper. We are not exactly broken by new bases. The army decided to follow the area and all of these people were lost. So what are we gonna do now? We send the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion, we have to make them the stupidest and worst soldiers they've ever seen. I've never seen it before. To make the long story short, you have mutants who kill war soldiers one by one in the graphic fashion. Again, the special effects of Nicotero are great, but they kill no matter how graphics become boring and predictable. I honestly thought this was done just to get a quick buck. It was bloody and graphic, but it was predictable, boring and not scary at all. For me, it would be nice if this film contained one original idea. Wes Craven and his son shared written duties and engaged in many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately this is not one of them.
