I can not believe that this film even got to the video and that the video rental stores are willing to put on the shelves. Literature I asked for a refund. Eliminate the fact that the film has no historical truth and it is becoming a worse film ever found in a video rental company. It's not good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste money or your time on this movie. All I have to do is cry out and scary music makes me sick. Everyone interested in this movie should be pulled out of the union, giving the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this film I really do not think any of them would be a member of an association.
