OK, I followed the original French version. But I can not imagine it would be better with subtitles. All I have to say is the most distorted movie I've ever seen. This film has almost no redemption. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. This could be realistic in a sense, but some real stories are best left unmistakable. I usually like the slow pace of movies if it serves the purpose of the film. Tarkovsky Solaris is very slow, but it allows introspection and adjusts the mood of the film, for example. But in this case, the film is simply served with a soulless dialogue that tells us a little about the characters. None of them can identify or take care of it. In a lot of scenes, I realized, "When will they watch?" The game was pretty bad. Not in a revolutionary, obvious way. But it seems that none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most scenes. It could be because of the impersonal dialogue they have been given. The entire film flow was also quite mechanical. Switching from one scene to another. It seems that this movie was just written (wrong), but it was never directed. This is one of the few films I can say that did not trigger any emotional response from any scene. No tension, no fear, no anticipation, no grief, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest what ever. A perfect example of what I call antifilm.
