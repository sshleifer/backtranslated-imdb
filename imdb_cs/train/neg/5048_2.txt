I tried. I really did. I thought that when I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his film. I know that when I saw about FANTASY, I felt bad and almost disgusted with the core, but some reviews were pretty good and beneficial, so I was glad: "What the hell, Quad, make a shot." Sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of such pain. I often wonder if it would be better not to return to my childhood and ask my former bullies to really let me. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat and that when I venture far away, not only do I get rid of it, but it falls clearly, and that some evil Lovecraftian thing catches me with my 9000 tentacles and compress my life - and some French French fries since 1995, which are still in my esophagus - from me. Is there reason for Odete? I would not say at all ... just that her Creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness (the one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake) looks not only scary, but flat-bones. First, she decides to leave her current friend (screaming hysterics) because she wants a baby and believes she is too young. Later she encountered the homosexual funeral and - to get it - to approach him, she pretends to be pregnant while initiating herself into the life of a mother and a lover of the dead in the worst ways. Oh, of course, he screams like a banshee and does not suit himself, but he's three times good on the grave. And there is such a ridiculous job that gradually becomes "Pedro", which summarizes the explanation of the weak and bad tea that love does not know a gender. Or something. I think it's like nuts like a can of cashew, unleavened. But then again, so is the director. And me, for the chance. At least men look good. Other than it ... is not much to be seen here.
