What is a simple generic mysterious conspiracy involving a dead philanthropist is in fact a headache that is a story of a lot of characters (the only big actor is Ginger Rogers in a very early role) who are all trying to find a murderer among the small occupation of the people in a block of flats. These characters range from stupid to clear. As a cheap and low-cost production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and her supervisor (some guy, I do not care who it is because he really was getting in) talking about his various ways of dealing with this crime while he is constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in ass. Frankly, I've never had a bad time looking at an old movie of this type, and I've seen some real slappers. Oh, and the valet did not do it because there was no valet. But pay attention to the person closest to the valet. Go there. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
