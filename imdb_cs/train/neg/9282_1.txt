This film is not worth the title of Omen. It is so bad that it really damaged the classic nature of the first three. It should never be done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They do not even mention the name of Damien Thorne !!!! There are no daggers, the most important element of all Omen movies. Pull it out of the shelf and fire it.
