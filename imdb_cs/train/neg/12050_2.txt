I read several positive reviews of this movie and was really surprised at how terrible the whole thing was. Placed like a cross between the AIDS-related story and some "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit," this film can not always think about what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are gay couples who have an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon are no longer sex life. When Mark dies, Simon - who wont turn off his emotions after he rejected his father years ago, tries to erase his memory and simply continue to be a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns in a haunted form and foils his various trysts, while Simon gets to open and admit his true feelings. Unfortunately, Simon is so selfish SOB, it's impossible to feel any empathy with him for most of the movie. At a time when he should be more sympathetic, it is too late to care for him. Mark, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore of the "Spirit" as she cried abundantly throughout the film. <br /> <br /> After Mark, a bizarre tone returns. Suddenly we will get some humorous humorous attempts, and on the "Bewitched" TV show. But it does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes more mawkish, with amateur attempts to tear your heart. The finale with a gold-plated angelic muscular boy who drives the tear-up to heaven, while Stephen, who was pious sorrow, is just good-natured, especially because it's not deliberately funny.
