Oh ... my ... god ... this is undoubtedly the absolute most dramatic movie I've ever seen. The game is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole movie simply does not make sense. Pair it in the middle direction, really weird scenes (like the one in which the kid reaches the valley and mysteriously falls) and deeply fallen dialogs ("Look!" "You must climb your pants!") And you get one complete failure. Not to mention that the only thing Mr Atlas seems to be able to beat is the case of chocolate. But this is part of the magic of the movie. Sit down and watch it with some of your friends for good laughter. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's so simple!
