Every year, I look at hundreds of movies, including many low-budget amateur abominations directly on DVD that nobody in the right mind ever wanted to see. In my time I have seen thousands of films, many excellent, many forgotten. Zombie Nation Do I remember forever as one of the most hopelessly ridiculous "horror" films I've ever seen? in fact, I have not yet recovered from the experience of watching it. The following day seems to be a strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work from the warehouse? Voodoo priestesses really recommend that "zombies" eat cheeseburgers? It is safe? It is safe? It is safe? <br /> <br /> I do not intend to recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a "good" movie and I would not recommend it as "so bad good". However, if you enjoy the prospect of watching the most dangerous non-noise movie ever? it's for you. Now, whenever someone asks me what is the worst movie I've ever seen, I'll say Zombie Nation. Seriously? I think it's a bigger crime when you're doing a boring movie than a bad movie, and Ulli Lommel deserves you to have created a movie that will really impress you with your ignorance. In fact, Ed Wood Jr. digital age, and I can not wait to see if he has made another movie as always ridiculous as this movie.
