I am grateful for one thing and one thing - that this woman will now be a thousand kilometers on a completely different continent! Yay !!! This program perfectly summed up how obsessed Victoria Beckham stood with her belly and her family in the media in the name of her own promotion and "Brand f * cking Beckham." A few years ago I really liked Posh and Becks, I still admire David's talent, but I have no respect for him. How can you respect someone who has the hand of his wife stuck in the back of his work as a puppet. It was clear that Victoria was all over Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened in Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he could earn pounds - selling his soul to American Buck and ending his days when he plays a team that would try to get support from Division One in England (without breaking America - but you reign on baseball and basketball - soccer will not do it!) Anyway - turn. It's been a few years since I saw such a top-notch, totally false performance from "Posh" - it was only completed during her cringe of powerful red carpet appearances after the debut Rebecca Loos' when instead of throwing all the cr David deserved, she desperately pressed on his arm and trying to save millions of dollars from the money that had become her marriage. This entire PR piece was pathetic. Why can not she just go out there, support her husband with the biggest mistake of her professional career and keep her head down? When did she become so confident that she felt that the move to America should be surrounded by a huge fan? <br /> <br /> By the way, last night I saw the documentary David Beckham. At least he has preserved the source of grace and humility. Two things his wife could teach. <br /> <br /> Another Victoria thing - you complain about being constantly on the move. A little hint - stop them from tipping over where you are a silly woman. Good luck America !!
