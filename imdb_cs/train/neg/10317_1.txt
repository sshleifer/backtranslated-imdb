Until this new season I was a big fan of "Little Mosque." The new season, however, totally relieved it. A new Christian vicar has destroyed the whole show's intention. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudices. New Vicar ruins, which assumptions and shows Christians in very bad light. I'm not a Christian or a Muslim, but he loved watching the show and saw a friendship between Amar and the Reverend. No longer. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and make it with it. It's no longer worth watching. <br /> <br /> It could still be saved, but a lot of changes have to be made. <br /> <br /> Return the old format back.
