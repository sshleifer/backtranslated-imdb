This film is about a woman who has been the victim of a rape / comic book writer from New York City who has decided to flee from all the terrible big cities and look into the dirty city to run into a small town where she finds shelter in a wide trailer on the dirt a lot in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. Urban residents are mentally ill, yet it is for inviting crazy men to their trailer. Uncomfortable is the fact that he has the ability to do exactly the right thing to get into dangerous situations after dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was at best at high school. She is one of those cute young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career was not kind and the maternal nature was fine. I agree with the previous commentator who said that acting is "so real". Actually it did not work. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and unable to arrive at sound and healthy decisions. In short, this film is upset like no one else, letting him laugh at him. The real crime scene? Striped wooden lining in a trailer - so much so that the ME did murder. And eventually she is an artist / writer so she could not afford a double trailer and something other than the sunny yellow Chevy Chevette for the love of God!
