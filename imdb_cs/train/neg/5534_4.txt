I work in the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack and REVOLT ZOMBIES is one of the films in the set. I look at them with my early daughter, a seven-year-old daughter, who makes most of these films laugh. <br /> <br /> I had great hopes for REVOLT ZOMBI, following the White Zombie, which is really the forerunner of so much the basis of the zombies in the cinema (think of Clive Barker, Serpent and Rainbow and James Bonda Live and Let Die Funeral Scene , NOT Night of the Living Dead. <br /> <br /> However, although the name contains the word "zombie," it's a bit more than a love triangle, including the anthropologist Armand Louque, defeated by Claire Duval; who is then accepted with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a yawn-fest, my daughter slept halfway. <br /> <br /> I really had a hard time figuring out who these people were working for - allies or axes; but I think it does not matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Belo Lugosi in credits for this film; but of course it was his eyes (from White Zombie) serving as a zombie control device.
