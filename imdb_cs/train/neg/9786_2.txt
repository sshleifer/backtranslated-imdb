OK, I bought this movie from Woolworth for my friend for the joke that appeared on his birthday because the front envelope had a sexual cue inside. But we decided to keep track of it. Just for fun. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but it must be one of the worst movies in history. It started well and we thought "Ok it may be okay". But after about 10 minutes we were sadly wrong. It started when the "mysterious painter" turned out to be the most prominent figure, Scouser / Australian (I say it because he had an unidentifiable accent) who is acting, I could just say that it is totally unpleasant. Then it ended and at that time we all lost the will to live. Finish paint ball. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've allowed about this conspiracy is that they did not actually win, but they won quite annoyingly by default. And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name that was given to him was terrible. Critical damage. I mean, they could choose a much more amazing name, such as "The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ" or something like that. Or the movie should be called.
