The only redeeming features of this film are quite original death scenes. Besides, this film is a great DUD. We have Kim Basinger, a home-grown woman, is slowly going through a local shopping mall during the first 30 minutes. from a movie that did not add anything. Then the film rises a little because it has a confrontation with 4 punks who have taken 2 parking spaces on this busy Xmas dinner. She starts pursuing her after the local security guard who tried to help her leaves. From there, this film gets worse, the worse. I know his only film and you have to go with the flow, but it's about 5 minutes. head and she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, it leads to half the division alongside the forest. In typical fashion, she does everything she can to keep track of her followers. But now it turns into one heavy mofu. You will get it. Do not buy or rent this movie under any circumstances, no matter how much you like this type. It's so illogical that you will question every scene. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and for the rest of the cast as well as for the consumer.
