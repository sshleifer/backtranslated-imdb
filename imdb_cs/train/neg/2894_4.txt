I admit that the problem I have with the much-celebrated Ealing movies I have seen so far can be mine. To my taste, they are either black and distractedly funny or so light that they are unsatisfactory like comedies or stories. This is a self-important way of saying that I wanted to like "The Man In The White Suit," but I found myself trying to sit in his short time. Textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be a pragmatic way, but he is determined to advance in the form of his attempts to invent a fabric that can not be broken or dirty. Using a factory laboratory for his latest experiment, he faces both material and human constraints - these are disagreeing bosses who do not understand what he has, then he finds out and becomes even more determined to stop him. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> tell him. One problem with "Man in a White Suit" is that Sidney's idea of ​​progress is terribly mischievous, and even more so than bosses or workers who also do not like his work. My problem is more elementary: For comedy, the "white suit" is not funny. It's a rather serious scenario, which too often attempts to invent its faint humorous attempts on drinkers, double shots, triple shots, and dizzying shots. The best joke is the sound of the Sidney machine that moves and releases the "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" infinitely and attracts a strange look from every visitor until Sidney either pulls his miracle out of it or avoids it. Like any other crazy humor that works well in this movie, it's too long. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Guinness's minor influence in the movie, although he looks immature young and serious in fact in the mid-1930s). He seems to be without blood, even more than the general who played in "Doctor Zhivago". It is the same cold fish, to ignore the sad affection of the girl who struck him, offering her life savings when she loses her job (Mrs. Vida Hope's face as Bertha) or the more sad charm of young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his only a real ally in the fight against "dullness and dirt" as he does, so these words sound like impossible sexy just Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Support for players makes "White Suit" just as it does. Ernest Thesinger from the fame of "Bride Frankenstein" plays a particularly dirty captain of the industry, who looks like Nosferatu and makes laughter like a death. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory leader is so memorable that he plays a crazy doctor in "Lawrence Of Arabia". Then there is the undeniable spell of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her for just a few moments at the camera right below everyone else. But most of the scenes are played so straight that one would not think that director Alexander Mackendrick ever worked on a comedy before (his previous Ealing comedy "Whiskey Galore" does not render this impression, unfortunately). The game of Roger MacDougalla represents the concept of scientific progress as a potential disaster, but it does not make Sidney's boring in anything other than the most pleasant light. Ealing comedies are remembered to capture the human side of the comedy. Still, the Ealing I've seen never seems to be doing, working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathy. "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and "Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again, go to the picture) are classic in this way. "White suit" is, on the other hand, a senseless obstacle that collapses when it's supposed to happen, just like the unfortunate suit.
