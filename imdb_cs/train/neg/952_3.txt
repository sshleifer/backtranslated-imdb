Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent for everyone, including the audience. The lightness of old hats of mistaken identity and the faux scandal of plot plot is very forgiven. Very few people watched these films on their land. But they usually had some interesting smaller characters who were involved in subplots - not here. They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dance and catchy songs. No. And Vera-Ellen, as a female lead, played the film as a second banana, desperately looking for a star to play it-and instead was prompted to shoot a movie and could not do it. The Scottish national was unnecessary. Usually there is an ubiquitous Scottish jewel. The photograph was pedestrian. The music numbers were pedestrianized. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performances and chews sceneries because no one else has done his role in the type of producer role that was often used by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine and no one can do David Niven as David Niven. At the end of the day, if you admired Niven just like me, that's enough reason why you should miss 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip.
