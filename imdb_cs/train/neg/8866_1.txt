Theoretically, the "commentary of the director" should work. Talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director who talks about his camera experiences. The programs he allegedly worked include Bonanza, Flambards, Duchess of Duke Street and The Bounder. His comments are not a bit informative because of his habit of wandering at the tip. But in practice it failed unsatisfactorily. It's a show with one joke, and the joke is not particularly fun. Scenarios are totally lacking in joke, and Bryden can not convince himself of being an old man. Whenever he gets stuck in something fun to say, which is like every five seconds, he gives a sigh of laughter. Instead of having fun with DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old people find you cheerful then it's for you. It did not help the shows mocking, except "Mr & Mrs." and "Crossroads", rather good. To make a joke, they had to be really terrible, such as "Charlie's Angels," "OTT," "Dependent Tales," "Neighbors," and "New Faces." time, so fortunately we are spared the horror of future releases. Would not it be delightfully ironic if the "commentary of the director" was sometimes the subject of spoofing?
