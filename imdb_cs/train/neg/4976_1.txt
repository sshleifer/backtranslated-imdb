I watched Grendel at night and I was forced to compile the Public Service Notification. Grendel is another version of Beowulf, a thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem. SciFi Channel has a growing catalog of non-threatening and uninteresting films, and the previews promised a non-authentic low-budget mini epic film, but he refused to allow me to switch channels. It was stunning, tremendously bad. With fascination and horror, the wreck watched the wreck from which you could not take your eyes off. I got to my notebook and managed to capture part of what I saw. The following articles may contain spoilers or you could save your mental health. You were warned. <br /> <br /> - Just to get it, Beowulf's warriors had hooded helmets. A trivial problem compared to what came later. It also appears that the helmets were in the basket and handed over to any acting story. Fit, looks and features were clearly irrelevant. Marina Sirtis was obviously blackmailed in the movie Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey Circus. He managed to avoid the red rubber nose, but the clowns had already made the rest of the makeup. Ben Cross pretended not to be a king as embarrassment. His character, Hrothgar, must become king of the Danes just minutes before the film opened and did not have the chance to get a crown to fit him. <br /> <br /> - To ease the return of actors to daily work waiting tables, no one was obliged to change their hairstyles at all. The variety of hair included cornrows, chops, buzzers and plums, and at least served to avert dialogue. To prove that it was more national, all were encouraged to leave any accent. <br /> <br /> - As is typical of this type of movie (at least from Mad Max), leather armor was a prerequisite. In this case, it was weird, bad and totally new. Ingrid's feminine interest, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume down completely. <br /> <br /> - The unintentional focus of the film was a repeating, combined crossbow with explosive screws. It was never necessary to load it, and even hit it. He succeeded in destroying the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, the historical fact, and the plot in its own right. <br /> <br /> Hrothgar Palace Heorot, rather than a polite long hall, was probably designed and built by craftsmen who sank with Atlantis. Beowulf arrived in the home of the Danes in a double-walled boat that was originally part of the set, the other two were Santa Maria and Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth was watching the Beowulf ship's approach using a telescope. Before you come back from this stunning innovation, you have to see the boat from his perspective. According to the corner, the prince was in a plane. <br /> <br /> - Fun Facts 1: In Bulgaria, fire creates (like a fireplace) light without heat. This explains why you could see breathing actors, whether inside or outside. - Fun 2: Dance of dark age in Denmark looks like slow dance that I went to the 8th year. <br /> </ p> <p> - Fun Facts 3: You can also make a catapult with a timed release explosive spray. But do not expect it to actually damage anything. By the way, Beowulf was probably a veteran of the Second World War and shouted "Incoming!" to get rid of any remaining suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so excited and always took off because he could not leave the cogs completely like a CGI creature. Even in the snow. Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in complete mood because she was a single mother and younger did not inherit her wings. Recessive gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now get to know that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. Grendel and mom decided to accidentally kill, fly or take off their booty based on reading on the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - Fun Health Facts: Being killed by a mythical animal that was so heavy that it is worth fifty feet on a stone causes a faint scratch on the face that does not bloom. /> <br /> - The legend used by Beowulf to send Hagu was as long as he was tall and contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, wobbling scattered all fear of his weight. The best line of film: Prince Unferth was dismayed by Hagem and spat blood from blood tens of meters. Princess Ingrid gently laid him and said, "You will be fine, my prince." So much for this job at a classified clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
