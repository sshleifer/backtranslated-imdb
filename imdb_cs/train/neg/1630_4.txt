Mary Pickford becomes Chief of the Scottish Clan after the death of her father and then has a romance. As noted by colleague Snow Leopard, the film is rather episodic to begin with. Some of them are fun, like Pickford, who kneels clans to the church, while some of them are right there. Overall, this story is a faint, especially recycled, fanciful romantic fence and its culmination. The transmission is so dark that it is difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even if it is not, it seems to be the best work of director Maurice Tourneura. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated again in the slightly more accessible "The Poor Little Rich Girl," which portrayed Pickford as a child figure.
