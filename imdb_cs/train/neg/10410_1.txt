It is a confused and disconcerting disorder of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. This is not exaggerated: you have to make a huge effort to even try to get involved. I honestly thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira suicide at the end, but instead someone was trying to explain: "when he was young, it happened ..." and "he just came back from Casablanca and he said in an interview with Erwin / Elvira in the slaughterhouse where he talks to a prostitute girlfriend (surely this is the best place for a pleasant conversation) and when telling her story about Elvira's life, Fassbinder shows killing one cow after another. It is difficult to choose between alerting to distracting images or what the transvestite says. Of course, we get to a very forced and crude symbolism: "In my life I suffered a lot and I will die." In one of the slightest moments when something really happens, Erwin / Elvira meets with a former lover, that after doing an extremely homosexual choreography with two other people (as if it were a necessary level of homosexuality) is that he knows Elvira. There are some interesting shots and ideas I have to admit (for example, when my wife tells the story of young Erwin), but everything on the film is useless due to Fassbinder's self-worth.
