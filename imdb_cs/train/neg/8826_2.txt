This (extremely) low-budget movie is compared to the classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" because it is referred to as Slasher Flick. First, let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this one (it was filled with back-searching of the original for more than half of the film). "Christmas Evil" tries to get psychologically by introducing the main character as someone who goes crazy (strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not have the real meaning of Christmas and can not withstand the way the manufactured toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Dress up as Santa eventually goes to killing. Also a strong word, because only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no excitement, no gore, no occupation. The only exception is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic "The Green Mile". He still has to dig in these days to always accept this role. He is the only one who really can act, his supporting role is better than the main one. (who is also not that bad, but if you are overshadowed by a small supporting figure, you are not even great.) What about the strange ending? (you have to see it, believe it). "Christmas Evil" is totally boring, nothing happens and artwork is misleading. It's not slasher. You want to see real Christmas clothes, look at all the biggest ones: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
