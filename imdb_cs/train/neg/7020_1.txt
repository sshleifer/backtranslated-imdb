Watching Smother was perhaps the longest non-quite-90-minute of my life. There was no laughter to be; in fact, I do not remember that I have never met a smile. Diane Keaton was terribly unhappy like a middle-aged nesting stork, textbook over her mother, a tirelessly irritating woman who apparently suffers from a personality disorder. She is manipulative, captivating, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and worst of all boring. I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long string of movie cliches - a small, socially inept distant relative, who is trying to break into the "Industry", tiresome and long suffering, but still a decent father, mild wives, (but eventually moves beyond disagreement and resigned to return home ), a herd of unsystatic dogs who want to chew pillows when they're all gone, etc. God, what snoring. I have never been a fan of Diane Keaton and Smother reminded me why. Crossing is exaggerated, no matter how many pictures you have made in your chance. Her attempts at physical comedy were particularly degrading. What did the director say? While I like Daxa Shepard and sometimes even tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so bland and boring that it was clear that not one actor on this movie did not care. It was all right, because I. Keaton's infinite self-closing was not intolerable, and sometimes Shepard's resentment seemed to her to be true. By the end of the movie I wanted to paint myself. <br /> <br /> Amazing.
