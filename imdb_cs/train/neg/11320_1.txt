someone needs to pay a car ... it's really terrible ... doing a cyborg of Jean Claude look like gone with the wind ... that's the hour I want to sue to come back ... fortunately it caused a lot of drowsiness ... from what I fell asleep. how can actors of this caliber create this dog? I'd rather spend time watching algae growing on the side of the fish pond before participating in this terrible preparation of several genres. Now I use the DVD as a runway on my coffee table. $ 5.99 per walmart is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really need it, wait until you're out for a few years to show up on the inventory and you'll be frustrated that it's not being sold. br /> <br /> Please, for the love of God, let this film die from the darkness.
