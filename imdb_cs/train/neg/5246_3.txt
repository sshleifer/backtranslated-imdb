Wow, the worst thing about this episode was the home price 40 years ago. I predict that I'm not a fan of narrative episodes. If the story / actors / etc they are worth their salt, they should be able to convey most of the narrative without having to read them, remind me of people who can not invent a cuff but rely on teleprompter. The psychobulb was boring and boring, but some enjoy such things, it's not just my cup About tea. They could keep the narrative, but at least it was much more believable and more interesting if it came from a psychiatrist, a journalist, or something like that. Damn small places such as Peugeot near a house that has a unique driveway in the middle of the ring, but it seems to have parked its car in a tree that stood under because it is nowhere to be seen on the road or on the land. Weak editing, as it stretches on the driveway (for what seems 100th time), exactly who are the two guys you see at 24m30s when you walk towards the car as it stretches on the driveway of a deserted house? Double up close was also exaggerated, like some highly dramatic student who first discovered the zoom function on his camera. I could still say goodbye, but it could be almost as boring as this episode. He was constantly pulling and the real goal was that he was absolutely using all the pictures shot by Elaine who was driving the Newport convertible. I was fully expecting to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle of the game, while the voice told us about 8 tracks, an automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it will end up suddenly. No loose ends are bound, nothing explained or terminated. Not that many would have noticed, I suspect most have already changed the channel or finished.
