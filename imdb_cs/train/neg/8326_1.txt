This is the hottest and funniest thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start ... Plot (what's little): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, desperately needs a transplant with a bad heart. Clay was secretly packed into his mother PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. The night when these two marry secretly happens to occur a heart-donor with the same rare type of blood. Go and think about this chance! Once Clay finds out that anesthesia is not working, Clay finds out everything and listens to everything. Fortunately, Clay seems to be able to filter the pain of the sharp scalpel open his chest by simply focusing on his memories of Samantha, which he tells us to do through an unpleasant voice that never stops. If you have not lost your laugh, you will certainly start to see surgical scenes. How could a young billionaire agree to a heart transplant performed by one surgeon, one nurse, a treating physician, and a drunken anesthetist? There were more people in my room when my wisdom was gritty. Not to mention health behaviors that are too stupid to take seriously ... the operating room is not even sterile ... people are virtually able to just walk in and out of the room without getting washed. During the operation, the viewer hears Clay's thoughts, none of which are too fascinating. Oh ... but here's it all ... the doctors try to kill him to take the money. To believe he is unconscious, the villains speak freely. Damn! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has four disputes of unlawful behavior against him performs a major heart operation. Even Clay's mother does not seem to be able to check his status. The only one who is interested in updating is Samantha ... but no no ... it could be sweet Sam to it ... You will quickly learn some Scooby Doo ... <br /> <br /> Finally, it did not matter whether Clay had undergone anesthesia, as it would have ended in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of patients who have become victims of anesthetic awareness, maybe there is some stupid fun to be ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
