We should congratulate Bashki for trying to convert one of the great pieces of English fiction into the film and then we are stupidly stupid for this attempt. The animation was bad, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was tremendously crazy and the movie was a devastating blitz through the first book and half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I even remember when I first saw that I was completely disappointed and despised. Now I realize that any attempt to convert a book to a movie is in many ways unsuccessful, simply because of the media, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is simply pathetic. Bashki is able to do much more.
