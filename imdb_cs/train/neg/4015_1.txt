a friend gave me that's another classic like "Debbie does Dallas". Nowhere near. I think my main complaint is the most unattractive leading actress in the porn industry at all. Even worse, it's on the screen practically all the time. But somewhere I read that in those days, porn had to have some "artistic" value. But I could not find it. See it only if you are interested in the history of the development of porn in the main stream, or appreciate art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the director of the film seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they refused.
