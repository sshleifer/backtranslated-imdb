It did not make sense and it was so terrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of such a movie ... you do not have to watch it. people, cutters or eaters, what should I say ... that made me sick! Oh my god! the film is about people we do not know, but we live with people! have teeth blah blah blah ... is not that familiar? I can bet you saw it in another movie. cast was so big, but I think the script was really terrible. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely amazing ... he is so talented ... actually I was terrible, but I think it's because of terrible scenes ... let me explain. when did you eat your tongue? but in the movie, man did it! it was really horrible ... anyway, I think the movie would be so good without the horrible human eddies or milling scenes ...
