A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15 year old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all bound to some stupid plot or something. Simply one of the most disturbing sexual comedies at all. Does anyone realize that the film makes light child harassment? I suppose it's okay because it's a teenage boy - if we had one with a man who betrayed a teenage girl, he would be (rightfully) outraged. I'm sorry, but making you boys does not justify it. He's still sick. I realize that Brown was aged (in fact it was 18 when it was done) but LOOKS 15. I do not understand that some people will find it. - but he can not act, Brown is easily one of the worst children's actors I've ever seen) and constant nudity is boring and not even distantly erotic. theater in 1981. I was 19 years old and my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily pass 18). He wanted to see - I did not, but I decided what the hell? We went in and bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously young. My cousin thought he was boring and the other three kids were leaving in the middle! Let me clarify this - three teenage men have left a movie with nudity toys! This should give an idea of ​​how bad it is. I am surprised that it was sometimes released. And 1 all the way.
