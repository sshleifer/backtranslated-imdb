Spoilers ahead, but is it really one? Have you ever read a show of a movie composed exclusively of questions? It might be? Why did old civilization buried artifacts around the world? Why has this question never been answered? Why was the introductory text crawling inconsistent? Why could a nun (she thinks it is nice!) To hand over more than 20 orphans crazy? Was there always a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the golden mine shafts appear in the front yard of the orphanage? Why is Tara Reid's character suddenly appearing in Chris Slate's apartment for sex? (Or did I answer just my own question?) Why would a non-archaeologist's bang open an obviously strong golden chest with a hammer? Why would modern computers still display green contours of objects before Trona, complete with small "beeps"? And all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Why NEVER in this movie makes no sense?
