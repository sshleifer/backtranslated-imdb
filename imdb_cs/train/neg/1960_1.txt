I tried to finish this movie three times, but it's a terrible god. The case: Mother and daughter went to bed with breakfast, Mom stopped at the gas station, a crazy station of a witch upset at her motherfucker, whose run B is trying to rape. She runs away, goes to the B & B, and instead of ballistically talking and wanting to call the cops, the story continues with lukewarm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> There are other shortcomings in the logic of action. The act is also lukewarm, and the neighbor's neighbor's warning is delivered to a really dirty moment. <br /> <br /> Moments of intense gore / death are unevenly intertwined with lukewarm scenes of time-filling interplay between characters. br /> <br /> Less focus on gore, more focus on mood and the story would be appreciated.
