In the introductory scene of "Little Story," Mr. Guinness had such a wonderful resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be "Some women need regularly - like gongs, or some kind of world-exhausted bon mot. a hardly bleak prose, and even a master would have difficulty putting into life. While Mr. Guinness goes through the picture as if he was looking for an outbreak and could not find one. And there lies the lethal weakness of the whole film. Mr. J. Hawkins is similarly giving up early and eventually awarding "Jack Hawkins" without being a personality of individuality. It could be linked to one of twelve British military films. Many in the early 1950s are accustomed to suspecting and doing their schtick for a very small purpose. The Luftwaffe could not bombe Malta in a way similar to the fact that he could not bring London to his knees. The commitment of the Maltese people to face the constant danger was recognized by the King and the island was won by George Cross. A good subject you may think about the film, but "Malta Story" does not even apply to the term "worthy" in its most compelling sense. He indicates that he is spontaneously paved to meet the deadline, perhaps before the actors have lost their lives.
