There are a few exciting things we can say about this, but I can mention that Matt Dillon is doing everything he can to make use of the useless and many divided screens and graphics that are worth it. Since most racing films suffer from the premise that car lovers are not so intelligent, we will end up with such films. Lindsay Lohan, who was so surprised by the middle parts, has to make better decisions about it. Here he can only disappoint. Children will just have some fun because they are trying to reach more adults than children (though still quite stupid). Those I've seen in the theater have not really had a real interest after a few minutes. And as a family sports movie it's terrible. Better moments are at the beginning of the wreck, which create some sentiment and later create a certain tension in the car-bash fest. If you develop the car as a central character, you need to develop it better than here. After a few mandatory racial scenes, you are in the best part: you can leave the multiplex in your own car.
