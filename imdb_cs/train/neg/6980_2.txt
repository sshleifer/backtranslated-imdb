Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you think and light on the subject just so - so. Core accuracy, however, is no compensation for unsatisfactory, disorganized and inconsistent conspiracies, talks about cardboard dialogue, and unsatisfactory conclusion. The main features are only characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes ranging from "enigmatic and noble" American Indians to "dull but sadistic" British officers. A terrible and insubstantial representation of a fascinating period in American history. I want my money back.
