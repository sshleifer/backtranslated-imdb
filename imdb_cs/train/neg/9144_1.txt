This movie is really terrible, the eye-candy that plays Ben can only make up for everything that's wrong in this movie. Writer / director / producer / actor, etc. The idea of ​​creating a film that would address important issues of homosexual marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and almost everything about homosexual man in these times, but trying to pack each a matter of such a poorly conceived film of little fairness for some of these reasons. The script is poor, casting very common, but dialogue and acting is just sorrow. The homosexual brother plays most of the camp actor, and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two leading actors (I think I've seen more passion in the advertising of cornflakes). The act is stiff and the dialogue is forced (the scene where the brother feeds the detective with his lines). I'm just looking forward to the fact that the creator of this train wreck has pushed some other waste into the distribution, and if he thinks so, I have some advice - you CAN NOT do that.
