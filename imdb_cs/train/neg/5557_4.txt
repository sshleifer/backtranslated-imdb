OK, but does that make a good movie? Okay, not really, in my opinion.there is not much to recommend it.i found it very slow, caution, in fact.it is also predictable almost over and over. One and two were somewhat predictable, but not so much. I also felt that this movie was sometimes quite huge, which I did not really think fit into this series and character. Jeff Fahey plays the main villain in this repayment. he is a decent actor, but I felt he played his character too over the top. I think it will fit the tone of the movie, which would be great if I liked film.plus, there were some pretty bad outfitters. Arlold Vosloo is back in the title role, but there's very little work in this movie. The character did not really develop as I had hoped. Good. That's just my opinion. By the way, for me, while this movie is not scary, it's pretty bad. I have a voice for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
