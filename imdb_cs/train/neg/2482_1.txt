(Spoilers galore) This is a terrible movie. First of all, he has the guy out of the media. I think he was out of his career from super tiny fathers. It was all right when he first tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later he did it again! And so it goes, this movie is moving in unbearable real time. At one point I began to imagine that it was a few days later until I was reminded that the story line was only the next day ... early in the afternoon! I'm not sure who this couple should be in real life. Above all, they are presented as a married couple from Manhattan who grew up and had a baby. But he controls the old blue Volvo. These types have stopped driving Volvo a decade ago. Today he is directing Priuses. But in 2002, I was sure they did not do Volvos yet. OK, then Wendigo. The "mysterious Indian man" gives the boys a small magic statue of Wendigo and tells him of his mighty magic. C'mon ... we're still doing an ancient Indian secret. Just to take them home, across every Indian statue in their hiking trap in the middle of New York City. American Indians are portrayed in a way that can not be seen in this movie for decades! A Wendigo. It's not the cause of horror. It does not kill the father of the child, which is the worst thing in the movie ... It's just killed by an ordinary guy with a hatred and a high-performance rifle. Wendigo appears late in the movie to avenge the guy who killed my dad ... oh, but wait, it seemed Wendigo was a little mad at his father, maybe because he killed a deer ... so Wendigo had to be happy, that his father was killed ... but ... and so it is ... insulting, boring and meaningless. There is no reason to watch this movie at all.
