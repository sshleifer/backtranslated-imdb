One soldier is on the side of the road, making sure everybody sticks to the speed limit (doing his job); he then stretches over a woman who seems to be a mother (there is a child in the backseat); then tells her what is wrong and BAM ... kills her. Well, it's the beginning of what I personally thought was a good movie. When I watched this movie in the theater, I was with some friends. It was our first night after the summer, so we wanted to go and see a good movie. We all decided to see a thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... it was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Not only did I lose $ 7.oo on the movie, but I had to torture my brain. This movie started with mystery and tension and I seriously thought that "it can not be bad" ... I was so bad. The whole problem with this movie is that it does not make sense; Even if you could go through a bad acting, horrifying storyline and over all the terrible mischiefs of this movie, you'll still be confused. It's not because you are not smart enough to understand this, because no one with a brain can understand what this silly movie is about. Right now you may think, "Oh, man, I have to look at the movie just to find out if it's as bad as the man says." FIND YOU THINKING THAT HEAD NOW! I'm trying to save you the trouble watching this movie by telling you that it's so bad that it makes no sense even when we see it. Please people do not make the same mistake, I thought this movie has the potential ... it is not. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I could give zero that I would) and I do not recommend anyone seeing this movie, you will save a lot of sleepless nights and try to think about w.t.f. that movie about the freak is about.
