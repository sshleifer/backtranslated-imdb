Do not waste time watching this! If you would like to study about all the bad things you should not do to make a good movie. I'm not someone who would normally see the movie, but this is personal. I've spent the precious time that they can not go back. I feel compelled to write this message to warn others not to waste their time tracking these bulls. If it were a student project, I would have to say wrong, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that it became annoying. shout, bad sound, bad video (good friend could do much better). and yes, what is the effect of Blair-Witch? no budget? I hoped it would be better, but no. So how the hell does it deserve? 2 is fairer, but 1 for a waste of time! I said my peace.
