Nacho Vigalondo is very well known in Spain. It's such a bad showman that can make you feel bad ... Very embarrassing. Nacho made some commercials on TV, I remember Nacho searching for Paul McCain around Madrid (the ad was about CD McCartney's collection). <br /> <br /> This small movie is like a commercial Nacho: bad storyline, bad direction and awesome performances. I can not believe that such a disgusting movie was in the Kodak Theater. Bad Oscar ... Nacho could make this film for his wife, a producer of 7:35, a woman very well connected with Spanish television business men.
