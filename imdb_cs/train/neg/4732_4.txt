When I write a movie review, maybe he will stick with me ... but generally I expect I forgot to have seen this for just two weeks. So why bother? Because I found myself again watching a low-value movie that was fun. I did not expect to be able to stay in the room when it was. <br /> <br /> It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... it is not a comedy of mistakes which always makes me more tame. It was just sweet fluff ... and if you can not take it, stay with the boys in the cloakroom. I agree with those who advocate this film because they will surely please their target demographic situation and will not have total effort for adults. <br /> <br /> It offers some good sighs here and there, but the nary side divider. Sure it's stupid and just fun, but at least it does not saturate (as many have said). Maybe people worry about their sensitive parties? <br /> <br /> I tend to classify on a curved curve, so 4.5 or 6 is really fine in my book. It makes 4 sense and will strengthen its assessment at the time of writing. Providing 1 or 10, as the majority did, makes the rating numbers insignificant. I can not believe how strongly people feel one or the other way to forget the fluff (or I am bothering to write it). Is something wrong with me? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it should be noted that Emma Roberts plays Clairedyc's role quite convincingly. Ariel Kebbel often does not fail to play in her blues when her character gets her maturity. You can also recognize that Bruce Spence plays Leonard, although his role is secondary. <br /> <br /> You can certainly omit this if you are an adult. But if there is a girl in pre-school age in your life, the film will be for her ... and be ready to NEJNOVEJETE (maybe you would enjoy it).
