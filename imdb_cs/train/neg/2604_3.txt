Doppelganger has its moments, but they are very little and far. <br /> <br /> Basically it's a mix of B-tria pop-psych thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is being chased by the demons of her past (most of her family were murdered and at least one of the main suspects) or has only a really bad case of personality disorder? George Newbern is her new friend and most of them focus on him. <br /> <br /> Newbern's character is quite sympathetic and he and Barrymore do a decent job (though not so good). Spacious (sometimes) utterly terrible scenario and unintentional overhead seemed to have merged to make the rest of the power fall into oblivion. The nature of Leslie Hope is unforgettable, but so irritating that you will want to forget her. The conspiracy eventually breaks apart (one arc story is psychological realism, the second supernatural horror), an extraordinary summit that is so poorly conceived, acting and photographed that it effectively counters against the value previously achieved by the film. Overall, the film has a sense of what might be the result of the first M. Knight Shamalyan class of college films. The acting and screenplay for the two races are so good that they care a little for them - at least until the film is derailed completely. My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid the first - meeting with the person.
