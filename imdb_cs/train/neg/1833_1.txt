Please, someone stops Ben Stiller from acting in any movie. Write your studies, write to hell, write to the local congressman. I already laughed at the funeral, then I watched any Stiller movie. Jack Black will try to do something about a comedy about missing a dog bitch, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the biggest actors of his generation, just looks embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unfortunate self, but even now with someone who bail him, he proves he's overrated as a comedian. No wonder why this film was badly shuffled and available for dollar movies for just a few weeks. I'm warning you and you have to warn your friends, do not look at it, it's terrible, the worst is Gothika (personally, I never thought I'd say that), the worst is Plan 9, Worst the Ishtar, the worst then the Golden Child. Please, Hollywood, stop giving Ben Stiller in your movies, it's not funny, he's a terrible actor, and he brings another one with him. The following movie was rated 1 because no negative results are allowed, so while the board says one, I'll give it a zero.
