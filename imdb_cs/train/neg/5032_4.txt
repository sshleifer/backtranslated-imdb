This film was in a science fiction 50-pack my friend got me at Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozilla movie and like the movie has scenes with American actors inserted without a real reason. One interesting thing about the scenes is that there is tension in the cold war between America and Russia. As in Godzilla, Gamer is awakened by an atomic explosion and a ramp all over the world to pay much attention to Tokyo, because no big monster movie is complete until Tokyo is thrashed. Overall, it's a good movie. Some scenes involving Gamer, especially the scenes in Tol, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were decent at that time. If you love Japanese huge monster movies, you'll really get a kick out of this. I give it 4 out of 10. If it was the Japanese unadjusted version I followed, it would probably be 5.
