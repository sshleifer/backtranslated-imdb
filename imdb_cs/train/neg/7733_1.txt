What shame! I was researching it and I was hoping it would be James Garner's recent gem and how it happened! Production quality was fine, but the conspiracy was undoubtedly lame and I can honestly say that I am only a few hours older and a lot stupid. The film really did not have any redemption, and if such things still happen, Hallmark will give a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it's about, it's nothing, and in this case it's not a good thing. We are exposed to the sight of an old thirsty woman who is one of the stupidest creators who sometimes wander around the land that happens to have married a real darling who is probably the only lively person to hold her with. She pulls him through one mess after another, gets him into one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of himself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief it was! Do not forget that it will take you to look at it, so do yourself a favor and leave it out, you will be glad you did it if you knew how bad it was.
