Spike Lee has been out of a slight success in the downturn, and this mess will not help. I looked at my watch, I often hope the movie ends or we get to the point. Lee's first full-length cast is a big disappointment. What makes sense? That the Italians swear and enjoy funny sex, but not with their women? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to Scorsese. The incredibly vague camouflage character just adds stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired several Lee's films, especially "To the Right Age". This movie is a waste of time.
