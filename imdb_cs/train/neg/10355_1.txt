I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it in our class many years ago. And I read it to each of my 3rd and 5th grade classes during the last 18 years of teaching. It is supposed to have been filmed in the past, but I have never been able to find it. My students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline Engle's excellent book on screen. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I had the highest hope. As the film continued, I became more and more desperate. They did not get it wrong! I've never been such a favorite book-film adaptation. I understand movies can not stick to a book, but they do not have to change things because of it! Most, if not all, leaving the book was totally useless! <br /> <br /> I first gave my opinion and just listened to my students to discuss the movie. Well, it was not just me. Almost everyone felt the same - cheating on the big story Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created! <br /> <br /> Why did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why could not Calvin's hair be red? Why a lady who does not have the right dress "witch" that was such a smart game in her name? Basically, we were all thinking - why must every detail change? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book will do. I'm still waiting for the movie. This was the Wisdom in time only in its widest sense. I'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take over the task!
