Return to Walking on the Lake will never become an original one. With the only main hero (Stanley) who returns for the sequel, the film is not in two hours of time. I'm a huge fan of the first film, story line and acting were really good, but it's one movie I will never watch again. This is basically the same as what happened to Urban Legends and Blair Witch but with much worse gaming. I personally saw better acting in soap operas, it's so sorry you just have to laugh. I am by no means responding to this film to anyone, and I think it will only aggravate the first.
