When I watched this film on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this film was created by a group of amateurs who had never seen a movie in their life. The film is an endless series of bizarre occurrences or "pleasure," as my girlfriend tells me to read over her shoulder. The conspiracy is not really worth commenting, but basically a plane carrying footballers crashes in Yeti. Before the movie ended, we dealt with heart bleeding, Yetis exhausted in an effort to run before jumping 50 yards, yetis pulled the male legs and beat him with him, the woman killed the rabbit at a distance of 30 meters with a javelin, yeti survived several rounds and was a fire without apparent hurt, yeti hung from the cliff by holding a male boot, but then leaped and the whole collection of other, bizarre occurrences. Basically, if you are not on Saturday for the purpose of watching the worst SciFi channel original movies, avoid this movie as a plague. Or, as my friend reads over his shoulder he says, "It's the best movie I've ever seen." A friend on my right says: "Only techno techno fighting would do better."
