Before writing this review, I went back and read reviews of others. This movie has been a major disappointment for me, because she has two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, boasting a cast of often surprising Michel LeGrand ("The Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra," "The Thomas Crowne Affair"). Dance was tempered, unmotivated and non-original, the songs forgotten, the story of a joke. Even costume was not particularly flattering. Only the photos correctly captured the right mood and spirit. I'm glad that other people enjoy the "Young Rochefort Girls", though I certainly did not.
