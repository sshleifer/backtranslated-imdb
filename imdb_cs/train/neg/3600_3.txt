Question to all girls: If you've never met before you accidentally called up and continued in the most distrustful moments, would you be interested or so scared that you phoned the police? Yeah, that's what I thought so I could not swallow the idea that Marti Gerrard's with unwavering attention Connora Hill ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> This is really stupid story. Connor Hill's wife is murdered and the plot turns around the question that Connor calls Marti to have an alibi? But there is a massive gap in logic, could not Connor employ a person? something that the prosecution apparently ignored. And there was no forensics at the murder scene? So why the whole process is that Connor says Marti at the time of the murder? Dirty. Dirty. Dirty. And that is as predictable as it is insignificant. My memory of this film is that for someone who did the Winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is really a dirty downhill skier
