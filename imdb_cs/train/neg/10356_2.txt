(it may be a bit on the spoiler side) I would like to start by not seeing the whole movie, I could not, because it was from the first hour that I would be incredibly disappointed. This, of course, is a problem with accepting what many believe is an amazing book and turning it into Disney Made for TV. <br /> <br /> Wrinkle in Time should become a wonderful movie long ago. It has a great story that could hurt children and adults alike. In addition, a good quality sequel has been built. But Disney-fying was no way to go. The problem with this film is that all the things that changed to change into a visual story destroyed what was so great in the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason why Charles Wallace was purely "psychic," because it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason for a struggle to be struck between the three ladies in the fight, as if there was another tension in the story, there was enough tension in the story without it. He had no reason to remove Meg's glasses ... that deprived us of what could be a very pleasant scene between Calvin and Meg, what's going on in the book. <br /> <br /> But I also think that bigger things, like arts, have been turned off. Take, for example, the way Camazotz looked, with his strangely dark sky. The stress that appears in the book is that Camazotz can be Earth. It looks like a country. It has people who look like people. The sky is blue, the grass is green and the children play. But something is a bit off. The directors decided to make Camazotz a completely different place to take a lesson in the book and use it for the overall direction of the film. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could be very good Earth, that is, when we forget how to love. It would be much worse if you had a beautiful afternoon as you walk down the street, with children reflecting balls at the same rhythm. Unfortunately, I did not follow the end. Perhaps someone tells me how Disney has come to an end. <br /> <br /> Overall artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
