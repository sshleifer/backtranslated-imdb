A decent continuation, but does not bother the original strike. Murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still reckless killing, but the film seems very speech-stricken. Any humor is not funny. The overall project seems to have the quality of an express train and sometimes Nelson outperforms. This movie is about overwriting the script before you go to the screen ... this script should happen.
