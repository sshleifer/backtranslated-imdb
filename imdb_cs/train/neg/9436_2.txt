Unhinged follows a typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend. Pretty young girl in danger. I have to give up the film that used the helicopter on some early road exits, you really think for a while that quality will be production. Watching "Unhinged" was like seeing the amateur classroom go through it's warm-up. Some of the most unpleasant, illuminated, long scenes are played with the taste of overdosing with Valium. I wondered why they did not send the cards to the camera so the actresses would not have to keep moving their eyes. The two main girls were, of course, chosen for their T & A factor rather than talent. Laurel Munson as the main pussy of Terry is as exciting as watching a dry color. Two naked scenes make teenage excitement. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as a crazy / creepy daughter and mother, youngsters find themselves in stranded competitions on The Worst Actor Impact. Long pauses, weird expressions, emphasis on the bad word, it's all, and it's a pleasure for those of us who love bad movies. The scenes suddenly shifted with long outages if you could drive through Mack. Drawn lightning strikes over shots without bothering to show the sky. Eighty-eight eye shadows attack the viewer. But you know she was growing up for me. I'm sorry. I wanted to embrace her, kiss boo-boos and do better. The end does not compensate for the damage he caused, but I grinned the same way. I have my own theories about the whole "forbidden" hype, and I hope that anyone who opts for viewing this movie will do so with a considerable abuse of habits and a sense of humor. Otherwise go through.
