I could not wait to see the DVD after I heard so much about the movie. What a disappointment! It has become one of the most confused movies I've ever seen. There were so many characters, some reminding others that it was impossible to follow the story. I could not understand how George Clooney won the film's actor's prize because he played hard with him, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I surrendered for about an hour of suffering and stopped the DVD. Maybe I was considering a quick redirect to see if the end is better, but after so much confusion it was decided that the chances of improvement were weak. The co-worker told me that a lot of the film "gathers" in the last minute or less. I was glad I did not lose another hour and waited. I give the DVD the next day.
