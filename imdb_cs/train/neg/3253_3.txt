I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw the original China O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = more fun! And more fun = better. If you're a bad movie fan like me, it's great material. However, if you are looking for any meaningful plot, acting ability or ability to create a movie, it is best to avoid it. Best is how they drew all the combat sequences in a quick step. Merry Evil. Look at this laugh, check out this hopeless fun, but what are you doing, check it out for free on TV.
