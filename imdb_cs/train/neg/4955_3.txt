In the light of the recent and quite good Batman, courageous and courageous, now is the time to put a deadly blow on the bug in the life of Batman. Being a huge fan since the first animation by Tim Burton 20 years ago, I was able to accept different tonalities in character, dark or campy. This is simply untrustworthy: too many effects, bad intrigues, and so few questions. What's great for Batman is the variety of his skills and aspects of his personality: detective, criminal warrior, playboy, philanthropist, etc. Batman shows him only in his karate. And by the way, how is Penguin capable of such virtuosity when he jumps in the air, regardless of his belly? And look at Joker, a blend of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae, what kind of fan of Batman could take such betrayal? Me neither. Batman is much better without the "The" before his name.
