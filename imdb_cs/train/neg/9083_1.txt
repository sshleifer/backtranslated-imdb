It was so terrible. It was not fun to watch at all. Even the scene where a girl uses a vibrator is not even fun to watch in this movie. I say again, the scene where a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not fun. Or maybe if it was the only part of the movie you watched, just the girl on the couch using a vibrator. Perhaps they would have just released one scene in the theaters, perhaps the film would be enjoyable at a certain level. My advice, fast forward to this point, watch it, take the film back, watch it again, back, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy that time for 2 hours. This film stands side by side and spits on the grave and the Doom generation in the worst movies category I've ever seen.
