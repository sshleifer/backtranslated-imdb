John Wayne and Albert Dekker are competing for oil rights in the Indian territory, and Martha Scott's attention in this Republic Pictures film fired from Utah in the US. An interesting Western species is due to its characters and its more modern environment, where Wayne & Dekker plays old and new factions of the West. It is based on the story of Thomson Burtis, who co-wrote the screenplay alongside Eleanor Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs how he works as best to his career. Pretty nice story is actually saved by its last third, where fortunately the stock will pick up and we will deal with something resembling a pulse. The luminous approach to the romantic springs is not going well, and the famous fist battle between these two protagonists is ruined by Rogell not being able to mask the stunt work. But hey, stuntmen always deserve their moment of glory. Strong support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual has many charisma on the screen, especially when he screamed from the gun. But although his budget is better than ordinary, he remains a film that is only interested in 19th-century Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10
