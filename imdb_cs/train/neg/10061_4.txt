"The Curse of Frankenstein" faithfully holds Mary Shelley's story about one word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were good. The tragedy of the creature that destroyed the Frankenstein family was completely settled and replaced ... by nothing. The heart and moral center of the story is gone. This does not help Frankenstein as a shabby, frantic murderer; deserves everything he gets. This plot is essentially a shallow checklist of Frankenstein's clich√©s. Even in his own terms, it is a litter: a fearless, restless film that looks like a sinful creature with a pudding hairstyle. As the first of the horror films Hammer, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in horror history is safe. But it's stupid.
