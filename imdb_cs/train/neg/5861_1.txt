I saw this movie when I first came out in 1978 when I was in high school in high school. I took the time to see it. I was not "no," no need to say because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' career has never failed as badly as she deserved after the horrible, unfortunate crap. In fact, unfunny is not a sufficiently serious term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You come out of the feeling that any laugh that might come up has been rid of you before it could happen. It is not worth watching for curiosity or in any sense that it is "so-bad-is-good." Even the MST3K gang could not track it! The fact that Billy Crystal's career has survived this suicide attempt is a miracle.
