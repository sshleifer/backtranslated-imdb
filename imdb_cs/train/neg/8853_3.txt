In the first Howling we are introduced into a world where there are werewolves and somewhat organized. The story in this movie made some sense; a TV reporter is investigating and trying to reveal the truth. She will end up having to kill many of them, including her boyfriend who will become one. It then shows the world that they exist by transforming them into live television. The special effects were just ridiculous in the first movie and nothing better in this one. Whether they are transformations or bad puppets or cheese computer graphics that show superpower. <br /> <br /> The land line is not so bad; he must for some reason kill the leader of the werewolves. It does not destroy all the werewolves, and it really does not endanger the threat of the werewolves because ... they just want to kill her. I think it was a frightened reason, but it's really lost in the movie. After the movie, we have a 10 minute movie from the movie we have just watched, and every other scene is one where the leading werewolf tears from the top and exposes his big boobs while some Devo-esquire is playing a werewolf. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie even observable is Christopher Lee.
