I did not like the movie at all! I do not know why, but everyone here says Clémence Poesa is excellent, which is, in my opinion, absolutely bad! It's not like Natasha: another look, another character ... What's worse, she's a very inexperienced actress, so she could not play this role! She completely disfigured the heroine! It was really disgusting to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to the Russian actress, because it would be much easier to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunken man who did not look for two weeks and beat the battle he lost his eye ... (Thank God, there are some actors in this movie whose game was amazing! That Alessio Boni did with her job very well! I'm a little surprised! She's one of the few people who have read a book that is very important to the game, besides, I liked the plays of our Russian actors, it was really great to watch them)) The only thing I liked in this work, there were beautiful looks and wonderful dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the real meaning, the goal with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps become aware of the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
