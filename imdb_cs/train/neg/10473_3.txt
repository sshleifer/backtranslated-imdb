I went to see the Omega code with a group of other Christians in a total of about 15 people. We all expected a good Christian film. What we got was an extremely painful, exhausted and pretty boring attempt on the film. It has good production value but it also has a bad deal, a weak script with a miserable conversation and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes we knew it would be a long night. We all hated it and some people in our group placed this film as a cheeser more than Anaconda. None of us believed that the film lasted less than 2 hours. Dazzling effects and a sharp view of cinema can not save this bad, bad film. I would give him 3 out of 10 and the rating is just as high because I hired the Werewolf movie (1996) the night before I saw this movie.
