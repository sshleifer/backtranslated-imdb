Maybe. As Francis Veber, one of the best comedic directors in the world (at least when he resorted to his native France), he managed to make a film that is totally impregnable beyond the limits of a deadly man to recognize him. It's not just that the characters are so insurmountable, or that the film is so completely rid of even the smallest forms of joke: it's really physically painful to watch, such an endless show of stupid writing, acting and shooting a movie that you do not believe is the work of experienced and talented - Creators. When he once lived near eternity in the cutting room and on the shelf before he flashed - and - you will miss it - the theatrical release tells the whole story. What did they think?
