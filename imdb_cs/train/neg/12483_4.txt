This movie is like Conan Barbaric but with more sex, rape and murder. There's a plot somewhere underneath all this sickness, but the creators do a good job of showing it, which is a shame because it could 'be a decent story. Richard Hill gives solid performance in the lead role, as well as the villain - who sadly did not appear in anything else. Also, the fighting scenes are not too bad - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword "drink" the blood of his victims - and there is plenty of nudity and sex to make the overall level of machismo slow down. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not good - but not necessarily so bad ...
