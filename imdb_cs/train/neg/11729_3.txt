Mrs. Virgin is chosen to marry a rich guy. The rich man urinates. A woman on a boat likes a sailor. The sailor is urinating. Virgo attends a common dinner. The man urinates for dinner. Boatwoman does a little for boys. The man who pretends to be child's urine. There is a basic topic here. Makaveev is trying to say that it is needed in the world. To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement. To justify the title is a scene where Laure, who barely speaks ten lines of the film, bathes in chocolate syrup. It's a really sweet scene, but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth if it is not appropriate to share the directorial fetish.
