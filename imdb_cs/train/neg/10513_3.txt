This movie was quite a waste of hours and half of my time. I generally like cheap movies about the horror type, but this movie was disappointing. The main drawback is the lack of explanation by the creators. When they entered the house and found a man who could explain them. They do not say anything about them but that they killed their parents, and if I missed something, he did not say how he managed to escape ... Not to mention the fact that it does not even have the reason why only the survivor remains and basically nourishes the creature your own life. She would have the opportunity to leave after a "cross incident."
