1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi occupied Poland, recorded by German cameramen with naive cooperation of the Jewish community, is combined with archive footage, clips from international news magazines, and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the Jews of the world as scammers and parasites. This document documents Jewish life in terms of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. An amazing, film-unique expression of racial hatred. Personally, I find this film terrifying and offensive. One can only hope that such images as this one will never get back to the screen again.
