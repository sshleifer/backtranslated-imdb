I was hoping to have some in-depth information about the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was a nice conversation with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, coupled with an overwhelming disaster - in the worst tradition of television production. <br /> <br /> If you could drop the voice and change the program change to a positive testimony of how people can overcome obstacles to achieving the goal beyond the ordinary then it could be great - but I feel I've lost about 45 minutes of my life while watching a 60 minute program. I want those minutes back.
