Yeah, well, I certainly felt sorry I was giving up watching this strange little but very long film on Saturday night. Probably not the main character for stealing two hours of my life. Here's the incarnation of the anti-hero in 'No Regrets.' We have this stink, so crazy, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unbiased, that it was extremely difficult to overcome the attraction of a preferred entrepreneur, Jaemina, if not only physical attraction. Otherwise they say it's love. But after watching it, it's like Charles Manson's love because you're digging a beard. (Well, it is not so bad, but still no real interchangeable characteristics.) I never managed to overcome the reason why Jaemin infinite Sumin stalks. It has never been shown, he just said Jaemin loves Sumin. Perhaps it is the thing of culture that has passed over my head: madness / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. It must be because more than half the film is one another, and the last part moves back and forth to the point I thought it turned into a comic book. I'm waiting for a tiger named "baby" to appear. Okay, so Sumin works two times when he goes to school, so good at someone who tries better by himself. But after the first taste of his stalker's attraction he gives up his daily work for a prostitution ring. What? Okay, well, as mentioned above, the obsession will not stop due to changes in your career / career, and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters, you get one confused movie where it seems that incredible events can happen without accumulation. Basic film, not 100% horrible, but you can get better with alien gay-themed movies.
