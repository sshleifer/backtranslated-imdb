* SPOILS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> Named "Bleed" you know that creative juices were not high when this puppy was conceived. Movie is your basic low budget slasher movie. Sure, trying to be creative with the premise of a "murderous club", but we learn that it was just a joke everywhere. Well, for those who really deal with these things, it's a basic story that a new girl in the city starts going with her coworkers. She invites her to her circle of friends and tells her at the party how they have a "murdering club" and murdering people, blah blah blah. Well, we learn that it's all a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. Now the "members" of Murder Club are killed one by one. Oh, and those dudes will win and the movie ends in a splinter. Then you will not really care. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first ten minutes of this movie do not make sense. Motivation for killing at the beginning of the movie is never explained. I think it was a way for the director to release a movie, but the scenes are deleted on the DVD! I'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the full-length version of "Bleed," but it seems that people behind the DVD thought that audiences would be trying to make another. The box says there are easter eggs, but why I want to waste hell, looking for extra for this movie, is behind me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and on this front I went "Bleed". But it was not a bad movie fun. Everyone in the movie looks good and there's a lot of nudity, but acting is just horrible. My favorite thing is the one who ends up with the killer ... I think it should be fun and fun, but it ends up as a tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage in a terrible, unconvincing death. Heroin pulls the women into the cement mast in the parking garage, and the woman seems to barely strike, spitting out with blood and "dying." <br /> <br /> For those who think film making is a complicated, creative process performed by professionals, look for "Bleed". This will change your mind and see any hack can get a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise do not waste your time or money.
