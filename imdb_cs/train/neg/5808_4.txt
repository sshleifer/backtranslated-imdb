Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a living, temperamental and powerful Hollywood couple, they made this (almost) scene behind the scene of the remake of the action thriller Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw of 1972 on a fugitive couple. It was almost for the first time, because McQueen was so important on the screen - even a stone quiet and tired, sensing his tick, his kneeling magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's squad, but he's got his charm and is probably a more versatile actor - if he is, this is not a demonstration of his attributes. Basinger takes good care and looks good, but James Woods is artificially insect in a silly crowd magnet. The envelope, which included another couple who was taken hostage by Baldwin's former partner, was unbearable in the film '72 and played even worse. As for action scenes, it's a pretty old hat that makes you wonder: why even remake the original? ** z ****
