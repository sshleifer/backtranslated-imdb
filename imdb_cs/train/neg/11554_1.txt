This film is embarrassment in the movie. I can not believe it was even mentioned as a comedy - not fun. Not only was the script cruel, but shot dead people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but for that ... 99% of the cast ... ouch. Much of everyone else ... wow is hard even ... wow. Here's rule number one about comedy "DO NOT TEST THE FUNNY". There are a lot of talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them have been used in this movie. Canadian journalists and casting directors help keep a bad film in Canada. I realize that this is a technical "American" movie, but look at the director, the actor, the location, etc. I just saw it on Bravo - they should be ashamed to buy the right to show it. Again there are plenty of great movies that can not get the radio and show this bullshit.
