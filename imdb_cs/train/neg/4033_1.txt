I love to write such an ugly review, but if I do not, I only encourage these people. Firstly, just because the film is made with a small budget, it does not automatically mean that it is good or unfriendly. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only success of the film in that it prevented large amounts of money from being missed on a single-horse racing horse with shit. Have you ever seen a comedy in the theater? Have you ever heard people laughing and thinking, "What are you up to?" Even the pieces did not interfere. Things were so bad that my cats took their first bath. It's not a movie, these are kids ... no monkeys that create images that will leave you feeling that they are moving to France. I have to go, there is a clown on my door .............
