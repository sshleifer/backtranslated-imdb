Lorenzo Lamas plays like a CIA agent who captures some exotic beauty named Alex, kidnapping her daughter and forcing her to fight her former employers. O.J. Simpson is also on board to provide a fairly strong credibility for a less talented ensemble. I have to admit that I am not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his films. Smrd√≠. However, compared to O.J. Simpson and Lamas comatose wife Kinmont look Lamas as ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I saw only the CIA due to the renewed interest in the OJ exam. Simpson, you see, because if your parents had cable and other channels, you can not escape this movie. in 1994 you could go to the Amish community and some moron should play it on your portable television. The movie itself is a collection of identical action sequences, and it would be intriguing, even if the OJ Simpson's shock value jumped over the fiery balls, and the exchange would have been one inlay to give some unintentional humor. Also where Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant were to make a complete classic camp? <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
