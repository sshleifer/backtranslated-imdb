The First Power (1990) was a terrible film that came out in the late 1980s and early nineties of cheaply made horror films. I found this movie very boring, but extremely cheerful in some parts. This film lacks the sense and credibility that it is not funny. The fast system of justice in this movie makes Texas a weaker comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips plays his part in this role (playing a hard-boiled cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays a psyche. Do not waste time with this because it's bad. How long, take it back. This movie makes a great movie for the party. Look at my belly in the cross, my most beautiful legs I've ever seen on a nun who was not in Jesus' Frank Nunspot. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This meant the end of the era for L.D.P. His star was damaged and could not attract flies into a pile of manure. It was D.T.V. for him until his "ressurection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended if you are desperate.
