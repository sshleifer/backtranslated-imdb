The story is great. Unfortunately, the execution leaves her. <br /> <br /> The film lacks tempo, one thing. It should be an exciting ride, but it's slow and more boring. I think the problem is mainly in the scenario and edits. There are not enough obstacles and reversals that could disrupt tensions, and there are scenes that do not fit very efficiently. Producers should see it in the script and insist on the main overwriting. Unfortunately, when the producer is also a writer and director, it obviously will not happen. <br /> <br /> Much of the acting seems a bit flat and it's just a director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a pity because with better writing, editing and directioning it could be a really good thriller.
