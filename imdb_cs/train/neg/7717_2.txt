When I heard the plot of the film I just had to see it, I think all the cities are destroyed by murderous tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is about as fun as it gets. Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of soldiers and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never uses his SCUBA suit and Lieutenant Finletter, who is never pictured without a parachute behind him) "Attack of Murder Tomatoes" is a parody of B-movie, the fifties of the last century. The film begins with the standard tomato size that women wash in the kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of the crime, because the tomato has reportedly murdered this lady and let me tell you how the film progresses! To be fair, there are a few moments of fun, for example, when a Japanese scientist, Dr. Nokitofa, says that his voice is dubbed by the American accent, or when the infamous expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomato hey, can someone give the ketchup? "Likewise, this movie was probably much more entertaining in 1978 with so bad a good concept. Unfortunately," Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes "such as the" Airplane "and" Naked Gun "have since been released and </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> seems to be useless, and ads for furniture stores flashing on the screen are damn bizarre for this movie, but you can see why this movie is culturally, I do not see many people who are indifferent to it, unfortunately, as I would summarize.
