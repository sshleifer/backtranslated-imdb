Crazy Shotgun Toting-incest Shotgun Seeks Truck Drivers And Obsession Of Control Disorder "Dad Rape Me Up When I Was 12" Tie Bearing, All Latex Wearing Prostitutes There Are Few Of The Character That You Will Become Aware Of In This Complete Denial Of The Movie That Can Easily (IE: Skinemax) on Sunday night at 4 pm (And yes, I know it was a whole sentence, but with these people it's a girl, it's a long-lasting show of a short, insignificant film.) in a "somewhere" of Canada, with almost no budget, the conspiracy of this strange exhibition is sad, the police of course never heard of "state jurisdiction" because they are both pursuing both Miya (Hookers) and Trent (idiot, Anal Retentive, Generic , an uncertain college student) USA (and I thought the FBI could do it). The camera is restless, sexual scenes are average, and acting is so bad that it could cause unintentional memories of movies such as "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". As for Skin Go scenes (which is the only reason why you can even rent the movie or even think about buying it), there are two of them. The first one is the only one that is worth seeing, though it is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (insert unknown actors, it is obvious that nothing else is forgotten) in a complicated, nasty motel room dropper and a soda machine that has only blue tonic water in it). It's all S & M (equestrian fruits, handcuffs, hot wax and licking underwear) and eventually gets into a motel room where money and cops are waiting on his doorstep (that's what the boys will show you, do not let the bastock bind to the motel room " in the middle of nowhere "). Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin that would merit memorization, and that in itself can cause deep experiences for some gentlemen, so it is definitely the direction of this defeat. <br /> <br /> As for the end, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you would not mind if I revealed it, but I will not, you should spend the hard earned money for this. Overall, I give 1/5 action, 3/5 for skin (see last paragraph) and 0/0 for playing, character development or complicated fence plotting. <br /> <br /> - Laughing man
