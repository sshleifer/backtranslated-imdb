What can I say about seven pounds ... well, I watched the flight from Seattle to Tokyo, and because the flight was long and boring, the movie certainly did not help. Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas, is almost totally unattainable even with his redemption at the end. The two-hour and movie run time loses most of the time on a random waste screen, which takes the conspiracy as slow as possible. In the defense film, the character of native Dawson gives the film a little life, though not much. I do not understand how someone could cry during this film if I just wanted to turn it off. Will Smith also kills jellyfish at the end proving that killing jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
