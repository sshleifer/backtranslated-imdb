For the filmed movie "Horror," the film began to be very interesting. I was really interested in the story and the secret of the film. But the end ended with total disappointment. The film was moving at a rapid pace, building on the fact that it seemed like it was a very climatic end. But guess what is not over. The movie is over, and after almost one and a half hours the audience just lets think about what happened. Why were not all the unanswered questions in the movie unanswered? There was no explanation of any of the key points of the plot. This movie is like watching the mystery of the murder and then never figure out who did it. Very disappointed. This film looks like the producers have just run out of money and never finished the movie. Great BOMB!
