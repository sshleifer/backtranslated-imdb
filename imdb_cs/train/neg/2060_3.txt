Damaged housewife (Angie Dickinson's unpleasant haircut, whose double body treats / scares us with the extreme detail of her delicacies) is sexually boring by her husband and decides to turn away. This results in a series of murders that soon involve a highly prostituted prostitute (Nancy Allen, I'm obviously bad if she gives her $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you want to look at De Palma (to excuse me, "pay tribute") to Hitchcock, watch instead "Sisters". "Dressed to Kill," although he is packed with style and technical skills, is one of the most thrilling thrillers I have had dissatisfaction with sitting. The story is absurd and tired. It has some surprisingly effective jump jumps and ugly graphic sequel murders that would delight every fan of horror if they can pass a silly story of a line that must be dated even in 1980.
