This movie is so bad that it's good - inadvertently entertaining. I could not stop watching I laughed so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except that it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the oppressed wife of a preacher who fits hard on Luke (Corey Sevier), the nasty and mysterious drifter he finally learned was in jail; the only thing Sevier has done is a bad acting! I do not think he's worse than the other actors. You will feel that actors have no idea they are in a really horrible movie; they play it straight. All about the movie is bad: acting, script, love scenes, stepping, plotting, music selection. The climate scene is so ridiculous - the first shootout in the church, then the last words of Luke on Emily - I screamed laughing. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Luke has done a lot of jailbreak and ab, and we see a lot of naked hull. That's probably the pinnacle of the movie.
