I'm sorry to say that, in my opinion, there is no way Enzo could really keep up with Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power advantage of S7 would be too great. S7 has power: a weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp, while Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. S7s low end is much better. Excuse the fans of Ferrari, but Saleen just does it much better. As for the other parts of this film, I must say that it is so unusual that it is pathetic. The story is too weak. The effect in this lemon is worse than the daily soap. I can say that when it comes to discussing negative psychology, it's a gem. This film is nothing, if not a clear definition of narcissism and sociopathy. It's all about these rich punks getting their stones gone when they show only traces of pretentious remorse for all innocent road users to cause injuries or death too. I can not give the movie "1 star" because it does not force me to really leave the theater. I also think that having an incredibly beautiful brunette with murderous blue eyes as a front woman will save her from being totally unnatural ... though her singing will not allow her to be a "Variety" blanket. <br /> </ p> <p> The one who plays Jason's SOOOOO is a stacked version of James Vanderbeek.
