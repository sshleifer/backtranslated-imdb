This film is an attempt at an idea of ​​the theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel" by Jared Diamonds, which explains how Europeans dominated most of the world. The version I saw from this document came in 2 disks covering 3 hours. I think the information could be submitted in 20 minutes. There are completely unnecessary scenes: Professor Jared Diamond follows binoculars through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond does not use a bow and arrow properly, Professor Jared Diamond mistakes the bowl. Should this document from the hero release "Professor Jared diamond"? This part of the document was so bad, it could be a spoof. The worst was when Diamond turned out to cry and cry during a trip to the Malaria Department at an African hospital. None of this allows me to understand his theory of "Weapons, Feed, and Steel." BTW, "Weapons, Feed, and Steel" is about 100 times. "Can European weapons, bacteria, and steel bring out of this desperate situation? Stay tuned and find out!" When he finally gets to business, his theory is the same part interesting and absolutely boring. Europeans conquered native peoples of other countries because they had weapons and fine blades against stone and wood weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me? Parts of his theory, which explain how Europeans have come to the benefits of conquering, are interesting, but the coverage is paper. please make sure that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans. If I'm not a racist, I know that. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond does not convince me that he uses native tools. I do not think adults are the intended audience for this document. Children can enjoy it more than I do. I read that book from which this document is much better than a document.
