I think it's pretty safe to say that's the worst movie he ever did. When I saw a trailer on TV, I knew from the second one that it would be a piece **** and it would be best if he avoided it But somehow I was attracted to see some friends, I went to the cinema with little expectation, but I hoped that a couple of laughing laughs will wake up during this film. The so-called "jokes" in this movie bring a face, mostly consisting of people looking at the face and balls, the baby looks strange and acts like a horny gangsta and the typical races we see so often in today's garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible but also predictable and boring. Characters are extremely annoying and strongly stereotyped. I never wanted to see this **** movie again, I'd rather take a bullet to my feet than to be exposed again. If someone I see says they like it, they physically hit them in the face
