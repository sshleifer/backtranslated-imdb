When I found out that the movie, which had both my favorite actresses, Meryl Streep and Wynon Ryder, appeared, I went through the roof! But after watching this lame movie, I had a hard fall and I still have a bruise. Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire after this disappointment) played just awfully. He was acting like a bitch with his family, especially his sister played by Glenn Close. I could not approach or sympathize with any character and I was not violent, but sexual scenes were really useless or could be relaxed. The characters of Wynony and Antonio could be developed much more, and their romance could be far more passionate. And what about Meryl's character and her "mystical powers"? Why did not they get involved? This movie has a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that it's really a bad movie and there were a lot of unnecessary talent.
