I have to admit that I do not remember the characters or the story for too long, although I'm not sure it's one, I was so irritated by this film that I was a bit annoyed. How can you name the movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then shoot it in Texas? The flat desert landscape around Arlington (I think it is a place) is by no means like the green hilly mountain range around Tulsa, and the celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in. Apparently no one in the movie was Tulsa, otherwise they would realize how nothing in the movie resembles. Has not anyone seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know it looks smart, but I can not help you. I looked at it because I like James Spader and I usually care about Eric Stotza. But even these two mysterious actors could not revive this meandering and serious story of self-involved people who are NOT IN FAIR !! I'm sorry, it can not be a more expensive movie in Oklahoma. What if "Live and Die in LA" was shot in Toronto? Would it suck? That's what he's doing.
