Apart from recognizing some nice cinematography, I can hardly say something positive about this movie. The only real problem is the protagonist's dilemma of staying with their childhood friends in the world of poverty or leaving them and taking their own lives. The rich "emotionally strong" scene does not go with this conspicuity, and because of the bad behavior they can not create the intended atmosphere. The director can only imagine Anthony's dilemma and ultimately bring about an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve, even if it's hard to talk about any characters ... except for Sonny. Besides him, the actors do not get to play and when some of them have to, they act as self-realizing amateurs. I wonder what the film has destroyed more: a superficial scenario that discards all the potential of a plot or misconduct cancels any appeal that might remain.
