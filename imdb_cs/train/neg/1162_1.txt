I went to see this movie at our university theater thirty years ago, because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To date (I'm sorry for Jack Nicholson), it's still the most precious film I've ever seen. It just went on without any recognizable point and then - it was over. The lights came and I noticed everyone was looking around. If the projectors missed the reel? I never had the desire to find out. All I remember about the film is that it was a non-drama about some annoying basketball races and their coaches. The most enjoyable part of the film was watched by an entirely thoughtful audience. Fortunately, it was an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
