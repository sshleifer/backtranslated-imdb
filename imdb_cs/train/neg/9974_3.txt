I have to admit that I have captured this message several times in the US network. There is something about the stupidity of the stupidity of this film, which made me see it whenever it is. Yes, you are right about what could be done, which is just a seven-year-old actor you'd like, etc. But I can not help sympathy with some actors. And again, several of these actors made an even more horrible sequel.
