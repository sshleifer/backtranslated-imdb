it seemed to me a special connection with the town of Withnail and I with the room with a view .. sometimes it worked, sometimes it was not. the tragedy that they changed the name for the US release ... Leave Apidistra Flying is much better than nothing title Cheerful War. the acting was fine, the screenplay was fine ... overall it was an average film.
