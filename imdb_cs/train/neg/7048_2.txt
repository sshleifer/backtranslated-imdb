I chose this film as a cover that was a bad move. It was not funny at all, and the main characters were uncomfortable. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the acting were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. A horror film with a surf "theme" that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Kate≈ôina Zeta Jones was beautiful and the film is likely to see a revival because she is now behind the scenes, married to Gordon Gekek and everyone, but if you have not seen, do not waste your time. A bad film with great surfing, REAL surfers and AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL cinematography were in God's hands.
