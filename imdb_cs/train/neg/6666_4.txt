I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to pamper this movie - you do not have to worry at first, you know that something bad will happen - but there is an example of how this movie was associated. Cowboy and Twig go along the ridge. Cowboy has a mustache. Cowboy and Twig get into the shot and race in the middle of the ridge. Cowboy is clean shaved by the rest of the film. Sometimes between gunfire and mountain riding, the cowboy has time to shave in the dark, horseback. To be fair, there are four main characters, it is solid.
