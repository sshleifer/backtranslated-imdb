I remember when this piece of waste came out, all the newspapers talked about how Barbra Streisand's taking years to shoot the movie. Well it could not take so many years; the game opened in 1975, eight years ago. She made the Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, which should probably be cast in the movie, but NOOOOO ... Big STAR BARBRA THIS IS IT IS IT. AND THE BEST MUSIC! This film is a complete disaster from beginning to end. One thing, Barbra was sixty years old when she did, and she looked every minute. There was no way anyone could swallow her like a young girl looking to study the Torah. And then, when he dresses like a boy, he gets to the camp. I feel that Streisand could not be unattractive, so she played with makeup; she is prettier than a boy than she is like a girl. And as if it is not bad enough, he will join with his classmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is a shot of his naked back end) And his fianc√© (Amy Irving, who does the usual sleep routine, a little schizophrenic poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and does not know what she is doing). Yentl even goes so far as to marry a girl; I will not even bother to mention the "wedding night". <br /> <br /> Then there is music. Nine completely forgotten songs, all sung by Streisand (convincingly as a look inside her mind), and each one as disturbing and irritating as nails on the board. I will not say that Streisand does not make a glimpse of the promise as a director; some of the images are beautiful (Patinkin's backside in particular) and have a good eye for balance. The problem with this film is that it does not get out of its own way. I did not believe her for one second in the title role; She should never add songs, and the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes. After sixty-five minutes, I was sick with all the nasty disorder. <br /> <br /> Amazing, terrible, terrible.
