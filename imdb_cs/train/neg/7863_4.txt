THHE2 is fun to laugh and laugh a lot and you will probably say "oh sh * t!" and "tear your face from the damn hole you're stupid or things that are in that direction but I do not know if it's really worth seeing - I was very angry in the whole body with terrible military figures to know the first thing about the fight Yes, there was more violence, gore and a higher number of bodies than the first one, but I still talk about whether it will ruin my feelings around the movie about how ridiculous it is (and not good ridicule like Dead Alive or a holiday). he was better spent fifth watching Aj's remake. <br /> <br /> So go for some laughter or go to a gore, but do not hope to get out of it.
