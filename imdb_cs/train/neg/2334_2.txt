This had a high intellectual endowment. The main intention is to provide a "profound" "meaningful" rendering (with a natural voice to its mind frames) and was certainly influenced by the fifties and sixties (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here the story is profound. In addition to moving too slowly, you can adjust at least 20 minutes - including unnecessary flashes - and the conspiracy line would not be. At that time it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his "uncle" character and his portrait often goes on parody. An interesting point is just a stain: the relationship young boy / hero - we admit that the hero is the kind of child itself - When he tells a young boy to let anyone hurt him, there will be some welcome tenderness. But it is bad and only the last scene will return. Words for the Wise: Take Foley "close to you" instead: he has two great actors (Christoph er Walken and Sean Penn together!), It's also an unconventional movie, but it's breathtaking, thrilling. Here's my hitchcockometer pointing boldly to zero.
