This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see tonight .. the first day, because the expectations and the hype was too much for me to handle. But in the first half hour we knew it was a disaster. It not only does not match the created hype, it also offends the original blockbuster. The script had gaps, editing was unordered several times. Mohanlal, who is a great actor, did a good job. Amitabh was fine .. The director wanted to portray how bad his character was, but he went a little overboard, which led to being strong. Ajay, who is particularly smooth in these roles, was also disappointing. Do not even start with the new guy Prashant .. man would not be proud if he started with a career like that. Rajpal Yadav, who was worthy of a few laughs, could not smile at anyone even because of his strong humor and sharp voice. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. Overall, RGV, which I thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors, has been disappointed with India. He has taken such a huge challenge and responsibility for rebuilding what is known as the best Hindu film at all, and making a mess of it.
