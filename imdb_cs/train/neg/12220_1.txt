This movie is actually worse than most of the movies I've ever had, and I have suffered many times. Absolute nonsense. It is a terrible, forced dialogue; unnecessary fence development; he actually drew out scenes from "spooky pictures" that look more like a project of artificial art than a horror film; 5/10 in the best attractive women; long boring sexual scenes involving those women (forget what you know about virgins, especially those who have huge false breasts); mumble, misunderstood speech from some characters; and in fact they used Killer Klowns masks from space during the masturbation scene, which should be a rescue milestone, because the movie was quite fun, but it is not. Led Fell is the weakest villain in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely leave this mistake.
