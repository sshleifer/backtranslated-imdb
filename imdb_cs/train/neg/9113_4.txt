They had such a potential for this film and they all fall apart. In the first harsh intentions we wonder what motivated the characters to do as they are and act the way they do. There is almost no development of the nature at all in this prequel. It's a very sad story, but this movie did not do me anything. It was like leaving out good writing instead of unnecessary f-words. And the end has absolutely no meaning and does not explain anything. Writing was terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used 3 lines of EXACT SAME in the rental, which were in the original. Such as a "boy down" or a kissing scene, and a few others can not remember. I did not experience Robin, but Amy did a great job. That's the only thing that made this film come true.
