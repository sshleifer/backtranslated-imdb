I am a great fan of David Lynch and has everything he has written on DVD, with the exception of Hotel Rooms and the two-hour film Twin Peaks. When I heard about it, I immediately caught him and ... and what is this? It's a heap of roughly cartoon black-and-white cartoons that are loud and dirty and unhappy. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe it's just a bunch of crap that was under the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks. Let me make it clear that I did not care about the malicious language part, but she had to constantly adjust the sound because my neighbors could have. Overall, it's a very disappointed release and maybe it's just been left in the deluxe box as curiosity. I strongly recommend that you do not waste it. 2 out of 10.
