Horror spoofs are not just a matter of the 21st century. On the way before the series "Scary Movie" there were several examples of this genre, mostly in the 1980s. But as a franchise, most of these films are hit or miss. Some like "Elvira, Lady of Darkness" are mostly rising above it, but others like "Saturday 14th" and his continuation fails to add laughter. But of all these types of films there is one particularly big delinquent, and that is Transylvania 6-5000, which for many reasons is a great waste of time. <br /> <br /> Benefits: Great cast that does the best. Some humorous experiences are fun. Ominous, but catch the headline. Some good Transylvanian sites. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Threaded thread. Mostly a lengthy pacing. Most humor just does not cut. Monsters have little to do and have little time on the screen. I thought this was a monster spoof? The end of the end, which is likely to disturb viewers. <br /> <br /> Ultimate Thoughts: Is It Comedy? So why is it really funny bits so little and far between them? Comedies are waiting for us to roll us on the floor, we do not bend our eyes and yawns, we're afraid they'll end up. I can not believe Anchor Bay has released this tired junk. I admit it's not one of the worst movies ever shot, but it's not time or money for anyone, even if you're a fan of an actor. See 'Transylvania Twist'. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
