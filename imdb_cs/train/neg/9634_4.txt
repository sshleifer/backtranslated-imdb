Any ratings I give to BOOM are only due to excellent photography in Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, it is only a hardcore dependent on ELIZABETH TAYLOR (its descending stage) and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote that "The Milk Train will not stop here" and should adapt very much to this adaptation of its game - but apparently it was the only one. Taylor allegedly hated and Burton needed money. Whether it was something that happened to a bean hill, when Taylor posed and eagerly pursued, he burst out on the servants and exchanged bad children's talks as NOEL COWARD, who seems to be a visitor to another film when he finally appears. It's so huge that Taylor's fans are probably considered to "have to see" something. But if you can sit here without a drink in your hand, you are in front of yourself. Unfortunately, it is a movie that meant that Taylor was considered a film actress, even though he won two Oscars. It was equally disastrous for Burton, and critics called him BOMB. Decide for yourself if you dare.
