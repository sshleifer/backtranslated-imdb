I have never seen any of the previous films by Spike Lee because their trailers have never been interested in me. I saw and admired Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster's work, and I had some of their DVDs. But I was completely disappointed with this film. If this film is a hint of Spike Lee's ability as a director, I advise that "I get the job" and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some other IMDb commentators were watching the same movie I saw. I can only assume that from their noble lovelen reviews that their worship of Spike Lee has blinded the banality of this work. I only paid $ 2.50 in the "Second Run" theater and I still felt I had lost my money. The IMDb "Trivia" page says that everything ....... <br /> * "39 Days Shot" - How can you expect to make a big budget "Blockbuster" in such a short time (as promised media humbuk)? No wonder everyone is so weak. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard first shot a movie ..." - Perhaps this project has done some kind of justice, of course. Although the writing was unfortunate, the assumption had some merit. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. Sorry! This film was so full of pathetic clich√©s, unpredictable scenes, and miserable characterization that he might not even have done much of it. (Hey Ron, do not forget to thank Russell ... Well, call!) "Jodie Foster shot her part in three weeks." - And it turned out! Her portrait of "Fixer", which makes people's problems gone, was as incredible as the script he had received. Would she even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: How many bank robbers would have bothered to come to the door and inform the uniformed police officer that they were taking the bank inside and would rather stay on ... or otherwise? When Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) comes to the bank to verify that they are not dead, how many bank robbers, without weapons, would "lead" the policeman, much less "leave" the policeman) back to the front door, allowing the policeman to walk behind him ? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later declared that he had given "every reason to shoot me". So why did not they even try to expose the robber's face in their short fight? It could get the answer he was looking for ... the robber would shoot him to prevent later identification. And why did it take so long to come and help? "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (robber's accomplice) <br /> <br /> * I understand that this is not your typical bank robber. They had another program and did not want anyone to hurt. But the police had no reason to think they would not. It was a desperate situation for them. Why then, when two of the bad guys went out to pick up the pizza? They were not taken off. (first, how many robbers would go out without using a hostage like a shield - is it a version of Spike Lee of NY City or SNL?). Get rid of them would reduce the number of evil people, destroy their plans and the remaining robbers would most likely give up. If it is not, at least it would be fewer criminals inside. (Give SWAT something to do or send home!) * Which police department in this country would allow Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to just join the bank and discuss the matter with the thugs that she will not tell them first? She had no authority, no government certificate; and besides, it was after all "already" hostage situation ... add one more? <br /> <br /> * Why would CEO of the bank (Christopher Plummer) just destroy the documents in question long ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds he could sell. Who was "schmuck" (a character, not an actor) with the accent of Jersey, who comfortably admitted voluntarily and said he knew the recording was "100% Albanian", but he could not talk ..... SIR! MOVE YOU! And his ex-wife! What "schlump" was! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * When questioning suspects, why Det. Frazier, constantly bothering those people who apparently were not part of the robbery? (Say - tell the older woman she could go and then she could not, then she could, then could not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, when he saw bank robbers demanding that the hostages get to the jump suite, could not conclude that their escape plan was expelled from a bank that pretended to be some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * Near the end of the film, there was a fake wall that was built in the storage room behind which Clive Owens was hiding for a "week" ... where did the materials come from? (plasterboard and railing). It was also possible to assume that they got into the sewer to get rid of them. Did the employees of the bank complain about the scent all week? Hi! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; because the documents were "falling" in hostage hands, what kind of "references" Mrs White expected from the CEO of the bank when she saw that she should now be the target of extortion due to her failure? > <br /> * And finally, but certainly as to what Denzel did? HOW MUCH! Should it indicate his "determination" to show justice to these boys? He looked more like a man jumping out on a shopping cart and trying to prevent the intestines moving! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than average conspiracy; miserable scenario; bad behavior; and generally pitiful director ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that it will give you enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not! <br /> <br />
