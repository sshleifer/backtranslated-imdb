This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I look at all the original movies that play on it. I really do not know if this movie can be called original. The opening of the zoo / amusement park on the remote island sounds pretty good. What was it, yeah, Jurassic Park. But that place has Sabertooth tigers. The film begins with several stereotypical college children on an island that makes some kind of treasure. One of them ends up with the death of a rather ghastly death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked like ketchup. Also at the beginning is a scientist who wants as many daggers as possible so that people can enjoy. 3 of them have run away and go around to eat tourists or people invited to the island to see tigers firsthand. It sounds like Jurassic Park again. Probably the best thing was a 1000 lb saber tooth that intertwined on the front legs and killed a mad scientist with a tooth sculpture that somehow diminished and passed through the neck of the boys. The deadliest death I've seen on television. The performance is extremely deep, the special effects are terrible. CG tigers could almost go on clay models and even some sounds were turned off. For example, when one of the undergraduates tries to escape, he uses the ax to break the door, the ax goes to the door, and in about 2 seconds you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. But the cheese of death was quite funny.
