This movie was extremely stupid when things started to do. I could not care for any figure; Susan Walters was so uncomfortable, and the main actor (I forgot his name) was also nervous. I can not remember how it ended and so on, but the whole idea that strangers have a human body and everyone just looked stupid in this movie did not quite get things done. My father told me it was a stupid movie ... I had to listen to him.
