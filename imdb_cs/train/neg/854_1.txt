Ladies and gentlemen, do not be fooled by the film label "Stanley Kubrick". It is a very bad film, unfortunately considered to be one of the most deadly horror films ever shot. Hot films should create such a fear that during the night people should shake their hearts while thinking of a real horror movie. There is no real horror in Shining, but what we find instead is a naive, stupid attempt to create a cold horror. Everyone knows how well the experiments are if they differ from reality. All that is good in the movie is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where the majority of the actors are located also seems good. One word about actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul who is never sure what to do. There is not much about a bald, color actor who is mostly busy to spoil a guy actor. There is no need to blame bad weather for tragedy. He can not avoid it because the movie was made and the poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
