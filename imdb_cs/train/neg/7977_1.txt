Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically a smart film. The actors are really good and the technical side of the movie is fine. But even though I was interested in a subject and I liked to think and discuss religion (I was an atheist), it was hard to get myself to watch the film of bitterness and, in my opinion, some subconsciously witty ending. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It's just, and that's why it's not recommended.
