It's rare that I came across this awful movie, this annoying and irritating. It's undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A conspiracy, if it is not a blur of thoughtful and unnecessary over crazy adjustments, is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a bad tip? Because her goldfish died when she was a child, and this "traumatic" event left her emotionally stingy and hated all. When the dialogue is not clich√© or banal, it is full of laughter, such as: "There are three kinds of people in this world: rich ... poor ... and everyone else." At one point, the reward hunters have some guy bound at the back of his bus, which has a combined tattoo on his arm. Because of misleading mobile telephony, instead of lifting his sleeve and just reading the number, he threw his hands with a shotgun. At another moment, the reward hunters take the bomb at an appointment agreed with the Mafia and threaten to discard it until the Mafia leaves! Of course, you do not go to a meeting, it would be too easy. Keira Knightley is unconvincing and terribly wrong. Mickey Rourke managed to save some credibility from this mess. I liked some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance is one, but all I thought when I suffered this disgrace was that it had to be made of a complete idiot.
