Now that Che (2008) has completed its relatively short Australian cinematographic run (an extremely limited edition: 1 screen in Sydney after sixteen years), I can unceremoniously join both hosts of the movie "On Movies," Steven Soderberg. > <br /> It is usually satisfying to see that the film director has changed his style / subject, but the last story of Soderbergh, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also missed the story, so the story (and editing?) seems to be Suddenly the main challenge. Special, after 20 years of business. Probably he was never very good at the story, he was just hiding inside the "nervous" projects. None of this mentions the present, almost diabolic failure. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che are not sent." <br /> <br /> Epic biopic in title, Che (2008) barely qualifies as a feature film! She certainly has no legs, because with the exception of her extraordinary end-to-end solution, Soderbergh's 4.5-hour dirge will not come anywhere. Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving Australian films "On the Films" duo, remarked about Soderbergh's recurring loss (digital HD storage): "you're in the woods ... you're in the woods ... you're in the woods ..." I'm also surprised that Soderbergh did not give us 2.5 hours that he would be somewhere between his current two parts because he still left huge pieces of Cheo's "revolutionary" life! For biopic significant but infamous historical characters, Soderbergh inappropriately alienates, if not deliberately insulting, his audience by failing to provide most of Chea's story; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2. <br /> <br /> 3. ignoring both true back view and event narration; <br /> <br /> 4. barely developing an idea or character; <br /> <br /> 5. The remaining claustrophobic episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignoring the right context for scenes --- everything we do is involved in disturbing timeshifts; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistic dispersion of all viewers (even Spanish speakers will be confused with unsuccessful expositions in English); <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8. Why, at this later stage? T-shirt franchise was successful! <br /> <br /> Our feeling of claustrophobia is certainly due to the fact that Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen based their script exclusively on the memoirs of Guevara. So, as a poor student who has read only one of his assigned texts, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited. "revolutionaries," but that does not make us feel sympathetic. Instead, it sounds to us that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to shake the audience just like the Latin peasants of that time." But these are the same illiterate Latin peasants who sold their good doctor to their enemies. Why did Soderbergh feel the need to cope with them and keep us equally mentally captured? Such straitjacketing of the audience must have some purpose. Part 2 is more chronological than Part 1, but it is literally denying, with repetitive bush-bashing, suffering the outlook and lack of varied or characteristic arcs. Che DelToro has no opportunity to become a man while fighting for the education of his poorly disciplined units. The only tenant is humor, as Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignored "revolutionaries," some of whom are forcibly lacking self-control over local peasants or food. We certainly do not know what caused the conditions or the strategic analyzes of their guerrilla insurgents, as it was. <br /> <br /> Inspirational countdown to Part 2 remains terribly episodic: nothing is done telegraphed or contextualized again. So scenes with Fidel Castro (Demian Bichir) are unexpected and disturbing. All selected events are at least plotted and latino-centric, Part1 interviews are replaced by time-shifting meetings between Joaquim de Almeida, the corrupt Bolivian president, and US government officials who promised CIA intervention (!). the rest of Part2 is a "forest," and the blue night filter just spoils the audience while you look at the exits. Perhaps DelToro felt too vividly frustrated by many non-American Latinos about the never-true, undisputable history of Che's explosions in their own countries. If foreign governments still do not give their people a free press - for whatever reason - then it is possible to see how a popular American independent producer could go out to attract readings not so well read ("I do not have to be able to read or write, but I am NOT an ANALUTER!" - cf. General Inspector (1949) outside to their local cinemas. The film is obviously neglected, and gross over-simplification strongly suggests that it focuses only on understanding the less-informed WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English. If they did, they would read it on the subject and criticize the relevant social problems - learning the lessons of history as they should. Such findings are exactly what society still needs - and not just the remaining illiterate Latins from Central and South America - yet Che (2008) is not happy to deliver. Soderbergh takes the lead because he is weak on the narrative. I'm furious why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderberg for this project if he knew it. It's been 44 years, the look back on Guevara was very much wanted: it was what I went to see this movie, but the director diabolically crazy us. David Stratton, written in Australian (October 3, 2009) noted that while part 1 was "unequal," Part2 actually "goes downhill" from there, "maps Cheo's final campaign in Bolivia into unbearable details," " almost unbearably slow and turgid ". <br /> <br /> Che: Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly not a travelogue for Bolivia, it paints a picture of poverty and atavism. The other half is redeemed only by the above-mentioned humor and the dramatic - but tragic - capture and realization of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this endless movie is just a confused, irritating misery - for Soderbergh, to avoid at all costs. He is bound to break the hearts of all those who know even a shudder about this topic (2/10)
