Herculis Puaro is a well-known "hero", well known from books and films. This movie or this story does not work and I felt it was not his Agatha error. The cast is not good, the actors are exaggerating and they are making stupid gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even the Arabic clothes) looks fake and for a serious viewer who thinks this movie can be seen twice as a mysterious drama comedy. The actor, playing Herculis Puaro, does a nice job, but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as has been said, perfect and look fake. The story is not too charming even though the mystery of murder, but who cares for the death of blond and blond blond 45+ women in the desert of iraqi? The "victim" is not pleasant.
