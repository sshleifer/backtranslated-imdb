I have read some of the other comments and I have to agree with those that have not finished. I thought it would be pretty good ... until the end. It kept your mind running and then your palm. I do not know what happened in the last few minutes of the movie, except for a complete mess. It's as if they have run out of money to come up with a good end to improvise. At first, they had a mysterious thing that people had disappeared, and they had a guy who talks about Area 51 (which makes you think about aliens), and after they went to shit. I thought acting actors and actresses were doing fine, it was just a script that worsened. Anyway, if you look at this movie, be prepared to be disappointed at the end.
