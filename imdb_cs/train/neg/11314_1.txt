This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad behavior, bad script, bad everything. It's an interesting comparison with two other movies in the same genre and at about the same time. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and look much more robust in both storytelling and direction, and it's still Albert Pyun, who also directed those two! <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, probably due to an environmental disaster or nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special cyborgs breed of human blood, and there's a story ... Cyborg needs to get a bunch of people to fill the "prophecy" and people need someone to stop them. One girl together with the robot (Kris Kristofferson) created by the cyborg creator was named fate to save mankind. In this film the director tries some of the Hong-Kong stylish combat scenes with participants flying high and jumping away. The film is getting worse in this attempt. I recommend this film with the only reason why most people get a new "worst" movie. And fans of this genre I recommend "Cyborg" because I think it's a very underestimated movie with a very fun factor. And if you can not build Van Damme, look for "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> This movie I rated 1/10.
