Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie that plays with some volunteer I've never seen before or since I play as a man from the neighborhood trying to be an actor. He has a heavy jones for the Taxi driver as he tries to use the shtick to make it big. When they learn the hard facts of life, doing what everyone does is changing their image! He leaves a good man to the surf guy overnight. His friend can not believe this change (but he wins with Faith Ford and gets into a cool concert). Can this young punk keep his street faith as he does that big? <br /> <br /> This is a true misleading film that tries too hard to build too many things at once. An interesting idea that breaks down due to poor performance. Who knows, maybe someone picks up the ball and runs, because the movie players this time woo the ball. <br /> <br /> Do not collect your time with this movie. If you do not want to see the hot Faith Ford and the young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br />
