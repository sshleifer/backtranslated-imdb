We rented a DVD with hope for a good west. The film was nice and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. In the first part, why exactly did the thief kill the owner? It's not really related to the movie, except to find out how bad it is and to have a shelter. The bank employee worsened, just acting too badly to convincingly decide to hire employees. At least let us guess. No emblem developed at all for bank owners or bank employees. A very long delay in much of what's going on. The absurd assumption that Martin still needed to see judges after the gang admitted to killing in-laws. Even more absurd that he admits to judges and judges, he will not listen to the sheriff. even more ridiculous that Martin hung up and the rope was broken, then the sheriff would take him to the gun to finally go back to his city and save his wife from a bad employee of the bank. Could he not come back after sending a gang to rescue a woman and arrest a bad banker? Just send judges a remark that the gang confessed before being killed on the route ???? !!! Overall very sad acting and no movie.
