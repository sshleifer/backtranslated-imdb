I saw this movie when I was much younger and I thought it was funny. I saw it again last week and you can guess the outcome. Some funny parts, very few and too long. Beginning is the only thing that's fun if you ask me. If you want a total b-movie, it's a good choice, but do not expect too much from dwarf-sized aliens
