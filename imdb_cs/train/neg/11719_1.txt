According to Charles Dance's words in this film "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development, and absolutely unbelievable. The full stuff that will not happen in the real world (since British police inspectors were armed with weapons in their shoulder bags)? Errors (Bulgarian Trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial dialogue. And the direction / editing is terrible - ripples of hand-held camera shots that add nothing to the movie except for the vague sense of morphology; confusing jumps; no structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snips is totally indecent - why should we care about what happens to him? Direct to the video? Directly to the trash bin!
