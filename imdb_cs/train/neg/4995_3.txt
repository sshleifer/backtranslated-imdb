I found out that it is a real challenge to sit this film. The soundtrack was not the best and some of the accents made it harder to understand what was said. There was little to move the conspiracy, and often the action just stopped and the long period of interviews seemed to be out for the movie. These conversations have changed between family groups and the observer has been left to try to collect together what the common thread was that they are tied together. It's rare to rate this film so low, so in this case, because the whole viewing experience let me think "so what" and "why I wasted time tracking this."
