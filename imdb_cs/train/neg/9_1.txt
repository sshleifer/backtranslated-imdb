This is one of the deepest movies I've ever seen. It removes almost a sort of thriller and manages to destroy everything. <br /> <br /> There is no good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a conspiracy, it was an idea, and when it comes to acting, there is nothing good to say, so I say nothing. Frankly, I can not understand how this type of nonsense is being produced and actually released, someone somewhere at some point does not think: "Oh, my God, it really is a damn thing and say it a day, their bulls that have people illegally downloading, look like a whole another movie, at least if you downloaded them, you did not waste any time or money. Do not waste your time, that's painful.
