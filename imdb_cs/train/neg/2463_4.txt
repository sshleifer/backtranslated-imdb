I do not know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Sometimes it is very disturbing, but also boring in other places. Scenarios of dental torture are very complicated and can attract anyone who is in gore and spraying. During some of the above mentioned scenes I found myself holding my teeth. The clever thing about the film is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is quite disturbing. The humor of the film is somehow hidden and does not have to be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of strange and strange fun and teeth are dripping into the dust, it's just the movie you've been looking for. If you read a comment and feel somehow attracts this kind of fun, try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too strange for my tastes)
