Recently, I was able to catch up with Marilyn Miller because they are not shown on TCM at the UK. I was very interested over the years because it was one of the superstars 20. That was really sorry. Some of the stars of this time, like Jolson, some spells are still shining, but unfortunately not for Miller. His dance seems embarrassing and poorly choreographed, her singing is somewhat limited, and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler as Hepburn. this movie as a public was tired of musicals virtually all music numbers were deleted. So we stayed with the comedy of this period with little real appeal. It was paid for $ 500,000! So I have only two conclusions. Either the cinema was poorly served or not at all talented. I think the truth is closer to the later than the first one.
