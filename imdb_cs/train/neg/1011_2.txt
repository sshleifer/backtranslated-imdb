LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And is that a star? I should have known better than rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But at the moment of absolute weakness I leased this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in STV, you know it's one of two things: indie or dog. Just like in sat-on-a-shelf. Who did it. And with good reason. The conspiracy as such includes a group of corrupt killer police officers and la MAGNUM FORCE, and Timberlake's "journalist" is the only one who is courageous to reveal them. He's focused on his efforts - or maybe I should say for his terrible talk. I turned him off after one of those bad guys was shot over his forehead, yet he had the premise to turn to his shooter and smile before he collapsed. Just terrible. The real tip of how bad it is that you see Freeman on the envelope and all over the movie a sporty, disorganized beard that looks like nothing but a hobo. Just know that the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly declining.
