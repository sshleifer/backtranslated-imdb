John Carradine, John Ireland, and Faith Domergue, who, like all the players, have seen better days in better movies have gathered for this horror film Grade G about life imitating art in a mysterious manor. For Carradine it was in the last two decades of his career that he appeared in any theory, it was better to work no matter what you did, and get those payouts coming in. With his magnificent, loud voice, Carradine has always been a great demand for horror pictures, and the man has not at all distinguished himself in what he has come to. He plays the old gothic estate manager, which film director John Ireland rented for his latest low-budget movie. He even has a cemetery, but a missing person. Faith Domergue is an Irish aging star, and Carole Wells is a young inventor. In the last twenty minutes, most filming will reject the dead who are no longer dead. The script is so disjointed that I'm still trying to figure out what it is. I will not bury other gray things on her.
