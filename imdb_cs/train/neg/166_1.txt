Well, first I sat down to look at the Star Trek series premiere to see the cowboy flying in space. this is how a normal business episode works <br /> <br /> 1 archer finds a nebula or something like this that will please and want a closer look but it could destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 sends a shuttle into the nebula and the shuttle gets damaged ... in all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are due to Archer's stupid mistakes. And did you see a preview of an episode that shows that Archer and T'pol kiss?!?!?!? !! !!?!! ?? I was about to watch this episode, but after that I totally surrendered the Enterprise and turned to the TV right now. Come on! This is a star trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also what was with the banana? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug, but he had to leave it for some stupid reason. All right, a little stupid to bring you a cat in the universe, but whatever. Well, that was what I thought until they left her on the desert planet !!!!! BANANA SLUG CAN NOT CHANGE TO DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid these writers are <br /> <br /> Any way, just to say if the Enterprise is to DO NOT SELF it !!!!!
