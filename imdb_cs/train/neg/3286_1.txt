I do not understand why remakes become a trend. Every remake I've ever seen is terrible, and that's no exception. If any of you saw a quote from Ben Jones that it's "dirty" waste, he's right. Why would they have the awesome TV show I loved, never missed the episode and my own season 1-4 on the DVD and destroyed it, I will never know. The TV show was a family show, and though Daisy's body was a real deal, or even solved in the show, to save his clothes. The family show was turned into dirty waste and I would not recommend anyone to see. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are great actors (along with other original casts) and they are also extremely cute. New Bo and Luke are not even cute. It was one of the showers for the show. Casting is terrible. They could have at least Daisy's brunette. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified boss of Hogg. Every other role he has ever played is totally the opposite. The only role they have taken halfway through is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but it is not a comparison. Denver Pyle is actually all the actors, and it made him a perfect role. I think the casting is terrible, the story is horrible and everything has destroyed the wonderful show and turned it into a filthy and horrifying movie. I would not recommend anyone see it. I just saw it out of curiosity and there was a free ticket in Season 4 DVD. I would never have to pay to see this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY YOU TO SEE THIS FILM.
