He hated it. If you think everyone in the south is a stupid, moral bankruptcy, silly, violent, religious walnut or child cripple, then this movie can be for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly unconscious. In one scene, two elderly men speak in a general store, and one mentions that he bothered a series of nurses before they could bind their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life. Very nice. A teenage girl walks through the back paths looking for her sister and no one can help her - despite the obvious limp and lack of food or water (without a backpack, etc.). The figure of Strathairn is not only thoroughly disgusting and slim, but it turns out to be a believer who (typical of Hollywood) reflects the nasty nature of Christians. The movie scene is very much like the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNire) - the biblical verses burned by the bad guy. I'm from the Great Northwest, but I found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN etc.
