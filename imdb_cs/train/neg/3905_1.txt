Forget Schedule 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, costume drama, unattended direction, script, acting, etc. This film is based on the not-so-much better novel by Isabel Allende. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in films other than Spanish), and other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are struggling to overcome such a terrible scenario. A lot of mistakes (for example, when they are snowing in Christmas in Chile) and very cruel, with lots of evil called "magical realism," it is the worst film of all time. She's completely upset!
