STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal history, he has problems with alcohol and now creates a drug addiction that makes him paranoid and susceptible to domestic violence by his wife, Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep the family together but eventually ends up more like a mat. Meanwhile, her mother, Janet (Laila Morse), is aware of son Raya, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles), and his escalating habit, which sends him out of the dorm. The film follows these desperate figures when they get along with their lives. It is said that the British seem to be miserable, and that could include watching movies that are so enjoyable. Movies like Nil by Mouth highlight this fact. It's a story about a broken family, ripped with crime, poverty, booze, and drugs, that kind of Jeremy Kyle would bend like a three-hour meal. It's also basically a story about self-destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing up the family and the woman trying to keep her together even if they are not strong enough. If you choose a little of what's happening from the offset, you can see that it promises that it will not be merry watching from the start and it will certainly not fail to do so. <br /> <br /> True, what they all said about the show, and the star leaders, Winstone and Burke, bring some great acting. We see that Winstone lost to his wife, beating powerless after some extra coke sparked paranoia, smashing during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of a word when she refuses to see his child. Likewise, at a private moment we see that Burke skillfully loses his peace on the stairs, full of the night's impact before he kicks her. This is another of those films where there is no "plot" as such, just a feeling of the real life of these hopeless lives that go from one day to the next. It was recognized by many (including Baftas!) But it was really terrible and gloomy for me. I have no right to criticize it because I knew what I knew about the offset, but I found it sad. **
