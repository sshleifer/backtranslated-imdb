So I know I voted 1 out of 10, but it really deserves not more than half the star. I hated it. It was so silly and unrealistic, I can not believe any of the stars who signed up to this absurdly absurd project. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were outstanding in their characters, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story of the Hall and I encourage everyone who sees it in a video rental shop to not even bother collecting and reading the back cover, ... I do not even want to get into what the movie is because it's too stupid to pontiff. Do not get it! That's horrible! Grapes!
