This movie is quite possibly one of the most terrible horrors I've ever seen. The length was not long enough to include a good story. The way her parents died was just ridiculous. Does my mother die suddenly when she drops over the shower after shutting down the action figure and her dad is fired by a cop? I see where originality might be what it is, but it could have been better. It was also all I wanted to stop before it was over. After listening to Lucy's name and finding it to be 'Lucifer', I wanted to wander. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer is a woman, but look at the name. It's a male name. It should be given a male character. Overall, the film was boring and could use a better story.
