God, I was bored when I watched this pilot. I was expecting a lot because I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just because "Titanic", I could supply) and his credit name, which I thought was a guarantee of quality, also wrote Lead Strange Days ..). But the thing failed miserably when it caught my attention at almost every two hours. All this time it barely exceeded my two-line overview and I would be very hard to try to find out a coherent conspiracy of all the clutter of springs they did not do anywhere. Moreover, I do not think the acrobatic has overcome even the regular episodes of "A-Team". As for Alba, yes, of course, it is wonderful, but the fact that she shows only one face expression of the whole film (loops and grubs) also bored me that she would soon be bored. Can you count on this, Mr. Cameron!
