It is a dry and sterile film that shoots one of the most interesting events in the Second World War and the history of the war behind the front. Bad drama is worst about this movie, as the plot of Hitler's assassination assumes that it will be quite a dramatic event. There is no development of character, and the idea that Tom Cruise assumes that he will play a high rank commander who casts doubt on his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and betrayal is totally insane. I believe Mr. Bin will play better. Generally speaking, the 2004 film looks like a top copy of the good German TV film "Stauffenberg," but can not approach this film in any film aspect. However, the film apparently gets its financial target with a pop-corn audience who values ​​Hollywood's quick moods of blood and shallow artistic value.
