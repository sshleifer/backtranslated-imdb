This movie upset me! When I think of a cat in a hat. I mean, cat in hats. You know, the years back that your parents were reading to their children. I think this movie will be that much! But to my surprise there was nothing like books! Insted is more like a young humorous adult film. In one part the cat talks with a garden tool (hoe) cat talking to him as if it was his hoe (agin adult humor). naming his car I did it all, even though it was a bit untastful for a kid's movie. Under review, you'll find: mild cude humor and some double entenders. I think it just means adult humor. I wish I could get this movie back! wal-mart said not because the movie was open. If you are thinking of buying this, I suggest that you might borrow before buying.
