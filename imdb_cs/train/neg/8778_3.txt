"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most talked about movies ever since the "Exorcist" I think. Because the EVP is supposedly true, it was really easy to pass, so the dreaded true fact. There are not many films that really bring fear to people's minds. As I said, this movie may have, but not. The film collapsed into a low-grade PG-13 scenario. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense" is no way. Somebody really just needs to take over the horror film industry and just shoot a movie that not only thinks about us, it makes us jump, shout, everything should make a horror film. I am genuinely disappointed with the genre of PG-13 Horror because it became his genre. We need the old days back, bloody and bloody days, Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Myers. Few films can think about this mentality, which is not so scary. So why try? A few good jumps in this movie is nothing but one of the stupidest endings in a movie without a solution at all ... do not waste money on this movie.
