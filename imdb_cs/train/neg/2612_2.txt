The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was nominations for the original composition and costumes for the Oscars. I have to admit that I was amazed by this film. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (by the way, Glen Close takes this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behavior. She likes all kinds of animals and locks all fur. From this moment on, we only wait for it to start a crisis. Soon, she tries to make the best coat of the fashion world, of course for herself and fine Dalmatian fur. In addition to Glen Close, I found all the cast quite stupid but funny from the child's eye. This is fair enough because the target market is, I suppose, children under 12 years of age. Pretty good fun for kids and families, but she did not do much for me. * outside *****
