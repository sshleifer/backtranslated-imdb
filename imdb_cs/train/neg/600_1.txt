...... in a horror film that is. All right, start with Kate. Her main goals include putting George Clooney on, looking good, and last but not least, with all of them. I have to love her. She had about a surprisingly good chance to finish this sick man, but ... instead run away. I thought he did not want Guy to take 10 minutes, and when she did it was too late. I think the guy tried to rape her. I can not get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly will have some sympathy with a guy who ends up with everyone he meets at night. The film went on. As a result, she lost all her credibility.
