This movie has such an inexorable class B left-hand side for all its scenes, effects, etc. To think that they have spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It's like watching the Wing Commander after star wars (completely out of content). The story can be described in one word: FLAT. And my God, I could not remember a villain so uninteresting long ago. We are not given any reason why he is so naughty (a birth defect, we intend to think :), nor any real convincing or kindness to his impiety. <br /> <br /> If you are for Connery, rent 'Love Forrester'.
