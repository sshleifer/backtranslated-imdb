Please do not lose +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just not. Especially when someone is lucky to be diverted from you. Damn if you ask me. I was waiting for something to happen - it never was. I'm not one of those people who stop watching the movie. I always have to see it all the way. What a huge mistake. Do a favor and go and paint the wall and watch it dry - much more fun. Please do not lose +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just not.
