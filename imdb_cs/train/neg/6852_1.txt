This movie is really incredible. I've seen so many cheap movies, especially a lot of "Full Moon" - Pictures, but "Dollman" is really hard. So much so: a mixed story, actors always on the edge of parody and special effects! How long can I talk about them? It's really a bad movie, but one of the funniest. If you are a fan of bad movies you want to laugh, you have to see it. And do not miss "Dollman vs. Demonic Toys". It's really fun and worse.
