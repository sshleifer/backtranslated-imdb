Designing nothing less than the movie length of the 70s television hit "Love, American Style", carved with lightning of nakedness, "Superchick" (1973) is a fresh piece of fluff that somehow manage to have fun. And the main actor, Tara B. Pravda, really is a superchick. A flightmanship (not a stewardess), which is so pretty that even the autopilot of her plane has succeeded (!) And with a cozy friend in every port, this wing, the swinging gal is actually given "laici" in a "break". What about her geraphobic surgeon in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami and her creative rock star in LA, Tara is sure to be busy. And when she does not pump these guys of all her masculine energies as the audience learns, she is likely to have a karate class, a mile-high clubbing, avert flickering and violent, attending the groovy sweat of the party and stop the kidnapping attempt on her plane. As I said, cheerful fun and sure good night when you feel somewhat brain dead and just want to go out before the trumpet. Future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings some irresistible glamor to her role of Tara, and the movie looks so nice to be delighted. The disappointment is that girls from the '70s catch up with the very small roles of Ushi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples), but they can still do what they do best - showcase their cupboards! Though the picture is never laff-out-loud humorous and does not really have many ideas in its metaphoric head, it succeeds in being constantly fun, and I think it's something. It is special that the end credits should point twice to Mrs Jillson's body; I do not think I've ever seen this!
