I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed. I did not feel anything about this movie. I felt bad because the gore itself was shocking. Several times I desperately went out of my living room to make something happen to this movie. Did not we see it before? I did not like any of the guy's barrels in the canal. I felt bad about him. But I could not think again why he was still alive and not being murdered by Creep? You have to answer so many questions. Someone mentioned the links to PS2 Silent Hill and I see the similarities vaguely. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, not a good one. to judge for yourself.
