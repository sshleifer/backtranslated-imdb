Unbelievably horrible movie. I have watched on TV recently. My jaw dropped as I watched a horribly conceived conspiracy and listened to nervous nervousness. No line from the disposable boat would be able to get closer to something like a taste. It was so bad that I wanted to exhale Rodney Dangerfield's body, slap him and shout, "How could you?" I know that many movies are made in the grove, hoping to show the popularity of the actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show some respect for your audience. It's sad and frightening that people should pay for it, the bottom of the cesspool, even Sunday afternoon TV standards.
