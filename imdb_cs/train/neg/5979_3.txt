Pokemon 3 is just over three or four episodes of TV series that are associated with no regular ads. The story is typical of the Pokémon (conflict, struggle and solution, where ultimately everyone is happy) and animation is nothing original or unusual. Some holes on the plot are filled (without final credits!) No explanation and everything is just a little sweet. Why do you see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be a part of your child's world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokémon and my interest in what they like is closer. Seeing the movie in the theater is still different than seeing the tube, and my sons enjoy a full movie experience. I gave the film 4, mostly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
