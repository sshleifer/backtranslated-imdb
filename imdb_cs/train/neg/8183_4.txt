This is a rather tricky piece of fluff that involves breaking, stolen codes of World War II, etc. It's about what I expected from this actor of MGM actors "B." One big caution. Jean Rogers, who did such a great job, plays the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two series of Flash Gordon, is horrible in this movie. Her character is extremely annoying. Absolutely never forsaken her with surviving her. We should believe that at the time of World War II, which would, of course, be a secret code device, she would have been able to simply enter and leave any office she chose, although she did not have an official function. From this perspective, I'm sorry I've ever watched this movie. This forever changed my perception of Mrs. Rogers. Talent is extremely light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his usual self, which means he is just adequate. <br /> <br />
