I bought this movie because it was Shah rukh khans Debut.And I also liked to see how it would do it. I have to say he is excellent in his role.Divya Bharathi is excellent in this film.Rishi does a great job.Susham Seth supported well.Alok nath was good in his role.Amrish and Mohnish made their parts well too.Dalip also was good in his small role.Actors shine in Mediocre film.The direction is average.Reporting is poor.Right is boring. This tells us of Ravi the famous pop singer. She has a lot of female fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and marry. Ravi's killing his cousins. Kaajal becoems ​​widow .. To escape from Ravis cousins.They go to Bombay.She encounters Raja.She falls in love with him and married.Ravi returns. The story is predictable.Klimax is predictable.The first half bores. It also pulls a lot. But it is a rescued actor and music. The other half is having fun. Music is catchy with some nice songs. Cinematography looks obsolete, but it looks insignificant. The paintings are boring, with the exception of "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and one rain song. Costumes are obsolete. Anyway, watch it only for actors and music Rating-4/10
