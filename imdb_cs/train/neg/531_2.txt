With a game list like this, I've been waiting a lot better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the movie lying in bed. The best actresses in the world can not do anything very interesting when their playing is limited to falling asleep and falling asleep throughout the movie. A summary of the summary says the daughters are revealed to be secrets because their mother approaches death. The thing is, he never tells his daughters nothing but secret advice to be happy. All the relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that back and forth between the past and the present was useless. The thought seemed to have been stolen either from the Da Vinci code in which the device was used to increase the strain, or from the laptop in which it was used to create an endless romance of the story's main characters. In any case, it was a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create anything. It was a way to try the tension in a movie that has no one. I wondered why good movies could not be written for women. It was really disappointing.
