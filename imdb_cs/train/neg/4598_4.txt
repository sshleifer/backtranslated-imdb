She is hoping to make sure that the American singer and dancer performs in her latest husband's show with a well-known American girl who models her life in social circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met with the fact that the girl thinks that the guy is actually a producer who has married her boyfriend (the fact that she does not have a wedding ring should discourage her from misunderstanding!). The Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical is eventually dragged back to the land of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott is an idiotic script that is full of teenage behavior. Astaire and Rogers not only "meet cute" - they meet ridiculously (dancing like a fool in a hotel suite above her and she complains). The audience of 1935 probably did not care about how the two of them wanted to gather - as long as they did, and happily. They have seen today that the central characters seem to have no motivation to end in mutual arms: he is creeping through flowers (after telling his friend that he wants to remain "merciful" in love) and she gives him a brush. Nothing that little dance could cure! These charming couples are just as deliberately unrealistic as in London and Venice, but we just notice that they are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy that you do not ... you do not mind. The musical moments divide the monotony of the contrived scenario, but they can not overcome the surrounding stupidity. ** z ****
