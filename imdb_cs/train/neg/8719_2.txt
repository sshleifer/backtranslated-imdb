So here I go with the next B movie industry. It's so sad that I see some badly shot movies, but I do not care if it produces film B industry or C industry. Show some effort at work. The characters are really bad. Efficiency is not on this issue (surprise), but the conspiracy is. How can a dignified team testify to two classmates and then continue as if nothing has happened? What worried me how the writer even threw the remaining members of the scene in which they were arguing about how good a medical ass was. Give me a break.
