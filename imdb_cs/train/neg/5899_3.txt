All the miserable people do over Miike and his work. I was sitting tonight. I thought if it was as good as Ringu, as I expected from these comments, it could be before it's worth my time. <br /> <br /> No such luck. I think I'll find another great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is the only one. I do not have NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I know it very much: horror film has to move. It also has to give the audience more insight than this movie does. <br /> <br /> This movie made me shake my head. Some scenes near the end stretched so badly, I went into the refrigerator and stayed there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for an apparently long minute, his eyes wide and his mouth agape. One famous director once claimed and I paraphrase a movie that could be filmed by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting her roll. Kou is not such a good actress to do this job. He looks at the paralyzed girls on more scenes than I remember. And it is not the only one that makes the impersonation of deer in the headlights; other members of the cast seem to feel the need to imitate this inefficiency. The script gives them little space to do much more time. I love Asian cinema. Hong Kong action flicks of the last 30 years, Korean horror as "Phone" and "Koma", Ang Lee's work, some of the fun but fun filipino movies with free sex and fighting as well as others. Chakushin Ari could do without.
