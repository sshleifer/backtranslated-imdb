Slim romanticism of the sexual exploitation of black women by NewOrleans white men with power and privilege. Ooh. Does this mean your appetite? Well, then, belly up to VHS or DVD and ravine on this blatant trolling through the thin segment of history. For good measure it's made from a book celebrated by hacker Anne Rice. Direction is as sweet and melodramatic as the cheese dialogue. Most acting is amateur. The only valuable note of the production is that practically a dozen black actors are hardly employed on the market today (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces barely seen at all (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell ). It's also, in spite of herself, sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and lean James Earl Jones is also at your fingertips. So it's late Ossie Davis, the minimal talent that owes his success to being associated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This movie should be labeled "T" for the tripe.
