Nowadays, torture is being talked about. That's the whole movie. It's a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. Since then, he has attacked him. I do not know at what point you're doing something about it. There is a woman and a child there; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. But it should have been when he could act. The film looks like someone's joke. I think after the murders of Manson we had a little fixation on the two. However, why would anyone shoot such a movie? What appeal does it have besides sadism? The conclusion is totally unsatisfactory, but it could have been removed with an obvious conspiracy. Oh, okay. Another hour and a half of life.
