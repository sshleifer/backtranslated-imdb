I have seen this film many times (and recently I read the book on which the film is based), and every time I see it, I want to cover all four of them. The fact that they do not know that the character Tom Hank falls into his D & D (oops M & M) :) persona ("Oh, just acting in character") outside the game. This and the fact that after three months of therapy we eliminate all this and feed its delusions! These people are what give the RPG a bad name. Also the loving ballad love and the music that will make the "piano cat" and "stop us if we are too unpleasant" are almost to set your teeth to the edge!
