Compared to other Columbo films it can be rated only 1 (terribly). I really do not understand what other evaluators have seen in this terrible film crash. It was just a morbid fascination that I kept looking at myself to see what a bizarre or stupid decision the director would do next. Another reviewer suggested that it was the only director's trip to Falk because it interfered with his acting role. In fact, I think the real reason lies with students who had to be horrified when they saw what they did with their money. It's a wonder he did not kill him.
