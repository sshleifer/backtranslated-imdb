This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events in it are completely random and have no point. The fact that this is a sequel is so terrifying that I can come up with a case of fever in the cabin (JSEM SORRY). I deny this as a mistake that is smothered in the newspapers because it seems to be the different parts of the thing that mingle with each other. eg Kevin's loving karate boy is simply strange in himself, then he's a strange and perverse policeman, then a drug addict, then there's the fact that they're attacking a random guy who obviously needs help. then suddenly the main character has sex with his girlfriend friend just because he says something silly about the plane. then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit acting on Kevin's young karate. It's really quite contemptible that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There is no reason why anyone could enjoy this movie if you do not love Eli Roth, not even the fact that I did not like this movie. Hate is a strong word, but I see, because that's the only word I can use that will have to do. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
