I spent eight years in cinemas in the 80s and 90s. This was by far the worst movie I've ever shown to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that she was trying to be a great and inspiring film. Even the magnificent Gregory Peck could not save this terrible piece of drizzle from being far less than the average. Jamie Lee Curtis, in an early role that is not a horror film, has clearly shown she has not learned to act yet (she is still trying but not much better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, and here's a spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will never happen just because kids are afraid to play a small baseball league! Even shows on Nick and the Disney Channel are not stupid enough to make us believe it is happening. <br /> <br /> It's not worth it if you would watch it on cable TV. They are not worth the rent of the film; Your dollar would be better spent on the next microwave popcorn package to go with the second movie you chose (because it may be better).
