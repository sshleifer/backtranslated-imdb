After reading a lot of comments I'm surprised that no one has seen it as a remarkably long remake of the 1960 Twilight Zone episode, "Mirror Image," starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective creepy story in 24 minutes before Sean Ellis did 88 minutes with that dull snooze. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained end, but there should be a little more stuff in the film, and the story would make sense. It is sad that the essence and purpose are two things that are missing from "The Broken". Yes, it has a few moments, but it is not enough to justify your time. Some other comments: Although this is clearly the current story, not one person in the movie has a cell phone! And although a car accident is an event that comes with a story, there is never any mention of the insurer, the person who was driving the second car, or the police that would be required to report. My advice: Skip this hole and watch the original instead!
