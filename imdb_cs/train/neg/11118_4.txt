It was a favorite movie, probably because of the humor in him, a fast-moving story, a non-commissioned officer who turns off all the loudmouths etc. The funny thing is that you probably could not make a movie with that name if you represented someone but "white" police PCs considered racist. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson as a white guy who turns out to be good, if not better than any black basketball player, is as interesting as his main counterpart, Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had a lot of fun gold-plated lines that provide a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not bother a lot of people - is the extreme nausea and stupidity of all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend played by Rosie Perez. This movie is not really clean people. For this reason, I can not frankly recommend a film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by lotto
