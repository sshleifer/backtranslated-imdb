This "dirty comedy" seems to be very compelling. And really, actors TRUE very hardly do a basically inoperative script. And as a result, it really is not going anywhere. The idea that a woman found she was pregnant after she had divorced quickly is not all that funny. And then, when Cooper and his baby crash because he does not want it to be accepted, it looks terribly unfortunate and it's really hard to make it a comedy. It's really a shame because the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored with the whole mess. Since Cooper made so many volunteer comedies, I recommend seeing them instead.
