Imagine that the real Hitler, who was the champion of propaganda and speech, would be such a mumbling as Carlyle portrayed in this film. No one would follow him, nor a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just the Hollywood carton of propaganda itself, dressed as "true history." <br /> <br /> People who really believed they really believed in this show, I'm sorry. Carlyle and the producers had nothing to do with it. Why was Hitler able to win so many people, the whole country for his ideas if we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By making him as lost, they made their own film absolutely incredibly. This film is a mixture of the old propaganda of the Second World War and the urban myths of MTV about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill, where the director shows him as a drunk for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a shame and I wonder how they could speak as an actor like Carlyle on this matter.
