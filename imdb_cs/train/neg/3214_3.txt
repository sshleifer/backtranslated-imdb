First of all, I'd like to say that I'm on comics, anime, animation and stuff. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me to this movie. I'll be objective. Start with the story - it's okay. He follows a comic strip of comics if I get to know them. But animation ... Well, that's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and average. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate anime style and cling to original comic-book drawings. If we pretend that we will not see rare effects, such as fire and lightning, you can say that the film is made 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D since 1985. Look at the Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, for example - four years ago they made a movie that looks much better! In addition, voice talents will not do anything remarkable, music is nothing special. So in all - it lacks the atmosphere. I was looking at it, but I can not say I really enjoyed it. It just will not catch you. There's a lot of blood and violence, but it will not do me anymore. It may be shocking for someone who has never been followed by more mature oriented animations and seeing animated blood for the first time (is there someone around?) But I do not think this is the audience of this movie. They could add some nudes and spices. The chickens around Lucifer were pretty tasty and damn, we have Lady Death herself! There's only a little sexy look, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. Overall - the movie is not that bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
