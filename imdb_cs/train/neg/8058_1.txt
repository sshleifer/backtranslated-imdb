When I saw the hot Eliza Dushka in a fairly good Wrong Turn, I decided instead to visit the Return of the Living Dead, all the movies. Once again, I did not see it, but because it is one of the most acclaimed horror films ever, it's certain I made the wrong choice. There's just nothing to recommend this movie, and I'm talking about an allegedly top killer. She did not even have the young sexual attraction of average to poor films, as I knew what you did last summer or Valentine's day or city legend. It just did not make sense, had no excitement, had very little acting or compelling writing. The publication date was apparently postponed several times throughout the year and the reason is obvious. The entire movie acts as a lot of insignificant scenes that coincided randomly and insignificantly. If you want to look at Dushka, get it instead. I'd like to see the movie with her and the super-hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I do not think it would make this movie observable. Casey Affleck, so promising in volunteer hunting, is terribly terrible - he seems to lack both intelligence and guts. That's enough for this.
