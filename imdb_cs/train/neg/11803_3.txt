When someone recreates a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorable compared to the original. There is also a chance that the remake is so radically different that it's just too unknown to the audience. Well, the television version of the 1973 "Double Indemnity" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. The main difference is that the remake seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as a crazy, glacial insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna seems to be tired and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, seems to be almost bored with the steering. Samantha Eggara is all wrong, like Phislis Dietrichson, while Barbara Stanwyck was great in this bad role, Eggar is too polite and conquered and seems to be out of place. Robert Webber, in the old role of Richard Gaines as Robinson's boss Norton and John Fiedler, plays Porter's role as the lead witness, bringing some life into the movie. Webber especially re-creates the role of Norton in the context of the 70's. However, after the movie's start, the whole thing lies there, without life and electricity. It's a movie that should never be done.
