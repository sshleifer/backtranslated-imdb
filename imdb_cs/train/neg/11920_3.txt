Oscar Wilde's comedy of behavior, perhaps the most sad song ever written, is basically destroyed by the hands of the second cast. Sanders is, as one might expect, accidentally indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the film makes the whole process a waste of time. Jean Crain is attempting a phase of accent in alternative sentences, and the other cast members seem to be convinced that it's a melodrama, not a comedy; In fact, the whole production has folds that reduce it to a tragedy - Hays insisted. It seems that Preminger's direction lies mainly in ensuring that there are a lot of servants and even music is banal. Stick with a visually perfect silent farce according to Lubitsche's instructions or even a 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try reading the game for the joy of words. But skip this version.
