This is the worst piece of crap I've seen recently. There's nothing good about this movie. The plot is simply stupid, dialogues do not make sense, funny scenes have never heard of real humor. Actors simply do not play, the worse it will not even try. The script itself is somewhat the same as Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. In this view, the struggles, there is only one good thing. They are well choreographed, as could be expected from boys from Hong Kong, and they are the only reason to watch the Sun Prince. Though I think the games should simply fill the empty space, so the screenwriter did not have to bother thinking about the story. However, this weak and absurd conspiracy can prevent you from watching him until the end. Avoid unless you are a fan of Dragon Lady Cynthia Rothrock.
