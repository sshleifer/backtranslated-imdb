This rather formal sword and flying fist film is a decent early demonstration of John Woo's talent. Cinematography is excellent and some swords are really remarkable. Unfortunately, the film works under the burden of a boring story and a clearly low budget (look at some of the combat scenes that I have started if I doubt it). However, it is worth seeing, especially if you can catch in the letterboxed.
