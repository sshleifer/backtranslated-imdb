This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be mean and shocking; but feeding flesh comes from chickens because some zombies with stiff legs penetrate the streets. On Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic, known as the Lazarus virus, plays out of government-manipulated newspapers and television stations. Several bold, but stupid souls on Channel 5 TV News believe that audiences have false hopes and no idea of ​​real dangers. The girl's reporter (Rachel Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk life and limbs to present a "live" broadcast that would prove to be a hand. Do yourself a favor and do not look. This thing is, of course, a very low budget, and it hits the feeling of bad game in high school. The effects are unfortunate and the massive zombies are almost comic. Also appearing: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. LIQUID MEANS should be left to starve.
