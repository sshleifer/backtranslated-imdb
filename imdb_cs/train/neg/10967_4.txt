Trust me, I love horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent movies. And I like low-budget B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even like bad acting, fruitful scripts, wooden lines, unlikely situations, and so on. But I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on so many levels. For all the reasons mentioned earlier and many others. This involves the absurd, obvious use of images of female genitalia. And many cues about male genitals, in a very freudian way. I am convinced that this is purely misunderstanding. Unlike some attempt to do something really different. I think every film that takes years to film can simply not keep the level of consensus and focus demanded by modern audiences. I was hoping the whole movie was just a dream or a hallucination of the main person. Unfortunately, it happened that we did because we saw things unfolding on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only kindness I can say is that the picture at the end was huge. If it was used at the beginning, instead of the end it could allow the movie to take off when the 2001 year ended ... <br /> <br /> Badly tried. I simply do not understand what was so important about this movie that it had to be even done. Was it a conspiracy? It certainly could not be. Were those characters? I doubt; I mean, I could live without knowing Ed 15. Was it a dialogue? Strikingly, no. Music? Perhaps, but much more likely to have to caress the insignificant ego principles. <br /> <br /> Much better effort died on the floor of the chopping area.
