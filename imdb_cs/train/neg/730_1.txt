I did not see the first movie, and if it did not have such a great desire. <br /> <br /> When I watched him a few hours ago, I must remember. <br /> <br /> From what I remember is a major story, it seems to be a group of very poisonous people who have stayed at the house with that nasty old woman since Friday 13th and are stalked with a wooden board. <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I'm starting a lawsuit against the person who sold me this movie because I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /> <br /> I'm going to pay Â£ 1 to take this movie out of my hands ... oh, wait, I've already given him a "friend".
