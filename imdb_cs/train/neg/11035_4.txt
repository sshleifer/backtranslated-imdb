This is the most sacred romance I've ever been to. A perfect movie for an intimate housewife in a dress, housedress, and ostrich-adorned high-heel mussels watching in the afternoon, lying on a couch eating candy. In fact, candy plays a prominent role in the film. The only reason I could keep an eye on the end is that I finally managed to look at Keane Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. In most movies, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as solid as wood. Unfortunately, no tips are broken - the hero is shamelessly perfect and little. The aristocratic warm-blooded family clich√© of the old world is as old as the hills. What is important if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale. I knew that before the titles were over, it would not be the movie I was hoping for. The hot grapes looked like a sign of all food advertisements in Women's Journal. I did not see his name mentioned, but the artistic director was definitely Thomas Kinkade, who draws millions of dollar billboards of Irish cottages that pressed into fuchsia. This movie was literally seen through pink glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (Candy looked really good!)
