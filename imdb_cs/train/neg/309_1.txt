Hi. I'm Paul Raddick, aka Panic Attack from WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this terrible movie that worked on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short while. Going across the deck is about the aspirational comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler encounters children who resembled world history 1 and rebound. The girls were to be betrothed, but in reality, they were executed by Sawtooth, the worst cannibal who had ever known the world. Adam Sandler had bad results in Going Overboard, but had a better score on Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish's red hot, going overboard is not Dooley squat! End of file.
