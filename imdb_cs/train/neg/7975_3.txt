When I was sitting in front of the TV and watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what would Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, do?" Chances are, you will. It starts to make intrigues. Colin Firth, a British park referent, marries a pretty brunette (Lisa Zane), whom he met recently in the park. Then one day she disappeared. The police are unable to find any documentation that ever existed, and Firth performs their own search. So far so good. As he is going to give up, he turns to his best feminine friend (Billy Zane), and they encounter their former life in LA's sordid drug underground, nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking, and then on its history of mental instability. At that moment, Firth's life is threatened and the film crumbles. No character from Lisa Zane's past is interesting. The film moves slowly and there is very little. There is a subplot about missing money for drugs, but it's just a trip. No pursuit, no reef sequences, no strains. Just some dull beatings and lots of chatting with boring characters. One thing worth mentioning is Lisa Zane and Billy Zane brothers and sisters, but they will never appear on the scene. By the end of the movie you are torn between being interested in what could have been and trying to stay awake.
