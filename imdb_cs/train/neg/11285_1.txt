I read James Hawes' book. It was quite neat, not great, but fun enough. Without reading a book, I would have no idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch of this knowledge. Virtually every element of this movie is incredible in the way I have the ability to describe. Half a fish could make a better match with matches and daily lipstick. Never before or since, in the movie, I felt so angry. The mattresses continued first, but they had never reached the depth of utterly mutilated dull shakes that he had done that. Since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this epidemic on a human species, I am now able to look at any James Hawse book without feeling annoyed. That's the depth of hatred that I have for this piece sh * t. No, that's unfair. Let me apologize to all the fictitious affairs to put you in a different world with the evil that is Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Simply and simply in the world of cinema.
