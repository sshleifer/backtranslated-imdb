This terrible movie collects every Asian stereotype you can imagine in one awful package. Violating money, the frantic Japanese business men sent a hoarse but tempting cop Pat Morita to restore the industrial secret in Detroit. This is where Jay Lena falls, who immediately refers to a murder victim like Japa and calls Morita Tojo. It's all downhill.
