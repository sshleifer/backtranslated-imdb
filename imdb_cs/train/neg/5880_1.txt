The movie starts slowly when we got to the cinema that we thought was pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we got up from our mind and we wondered what movie we came to see I did not like this movie and would not recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was when the alarm and the lights came back because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home. it must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen that we were all boring or mind and most people in the cinema actually RAN out of the door at the end because it was so waste. I am surprised that no one has gone before this. if you go and see, make sure you have something that makes you busier, even better Do not go and you will not see it at all.
