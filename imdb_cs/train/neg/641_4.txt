According to my knowledge, the reel Largo was a famous Belgian comic (never read) who told about playboy adventures, like James Bond with no espionage life! So, when I had to select a movie for a 5-year-old baby, I picked it up because that kid was a big fan of James Bond. But right after the opening credits, I have a lot of doubts: when American movies offer a great start, here, no action and a cruel sexual scene? Then is the story very complicated with financial steps? I thought I lost the baby. But it was strangely captured by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it an excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? Largo's heavy relationship with his father? A multiple boxing story in which friends are bad are bad guys friends? Exotic Locations Honk-Kong, Ygoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but really does Largo take care of ("Will get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
