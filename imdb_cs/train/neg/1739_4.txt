Watch the Lady in Ermine I wonder what Betty Grable is doing in a project that Marlene Dietrich wanted to do. Someone else in the 20th century Fox may have decided that one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck was supposed to know better. Betty plays an Italian Countess of the 19th Century, whose domain was attacked by a Hungarian hussar troop won by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her spooky predecessor, whose portrait hangs the palace hall along with the remnants of her remarkable pedigree, sees no small resemblance to Doug and another assailant 300 years earlier with whom she dealt with when the army failed. In addition, the current Betty was just married to Cesar Romer and the invasion took place at the most unfavorable moment before things were completed. This will mean someone will have a bad attitude. I guarantee. Fresh, healthy American Betty NIKDY is not an actress who should be seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich could put it together, but Betty's dropped out of yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch. However, Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote scores for this film and Oscar's "This Is The Moment" nomination for Best Song. The fact that Lady In Ermine has one chance for Oscar glory has been knocked down by knobs and bows. Ernest Lubitsch died in the middle of the film and Otto Preminger finished this lady in Ermine. I can not believe that Lubitsch meant Grable. You will not do that when you see this lady in Ermine.
