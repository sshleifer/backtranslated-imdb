Tony Scott will destroy something that might be interesting in Richard Kelly's clich√©, a distracting, revolutionary script. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model that dropped out and became a reward hunter. That's her story ... "sort of". The problem with this waste is that it's not a story at all, and Scott's extreme graphic stylization of each shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Haro's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays it as an unpleasant, cynical brat who did nothing to give our respect. She scares people she does not like and gets rid of her dresses and restraints when the situation demands it, but it's not a little true, and Knightly is not a little convincing. <br /> <br /> The film is boring. It's also loud and tied up with one of the most unpleasant source music tracks I've heard for a long time. The last twenty minutes is a bad re-run Scott's "True Romance" top with the gang domino meets with two sets of feuding evil guys who are - surprise! surprise! - designed to shoot at the top of the Las Vegas casino. Unfortunately, this potentially exciting explosion is totally distorted by Scott and becomes a confusing, demanding, unnecessary practice of celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure at every level because it does not give us any entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters. Mickey Roarke looks good like a rewarded reward hunter, but disappears into the background as a "story" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassing portrait, and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is not sufficiently exhausted. Do not be fooled by the fact that the film is a multi-layered, trick troubled surface. It's still a manure, no matter how hard you pour it.
