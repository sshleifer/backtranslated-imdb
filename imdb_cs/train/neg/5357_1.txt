I do not know where to start. This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday children who show they are back in the late 1980s. Some Captain or Power Rangers. It is full of bad digital overlays and really beguiled "secret agencies" and villains. The game is so bad that it's not funny either. Direction is terrible and there is little continuity. It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot to be a conspiracy there. Perhaps one of the funniest scenes in the film comes early when several villains plant explosive devices in the automobile agents. For some reason, even if the device is clearly stated to be "remotely detonated", bad guys decide to chase her on their motorcycles as they leave. This persecution continues. all the time with bad boys do absurd and completely insignificant stunt motocycles. He's standing on wheels, doing bicycles, and so on. At one point a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown off the motorcycle, we see the engine (clearly cgi) wounded over a car agent but the rider disappears. Then, after a few seconds, the rider and wheel ... apparently undamaged by the crash. At this point, even if the car has an explosive device, the attackers decide to shoot the agent while driving, then blow up their car. Which was also clearly done with cgi. Did the sound get mad? It is, and so it is the rest of the movie. I would point out that when I say cgi, we are not talking about the type of Lord of the rings type cgi. We're talking about cheap Cherokee Power Rangers type cgi, actually, I think it would be better for the Power Rangers. Why Savini and Todd have made this movie, which I will never know, I can only assume that they were doing for money, for someone, or for being blackmailed into it ... probably the last one.
