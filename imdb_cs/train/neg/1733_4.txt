SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> Ollie, who suffers from "hornofobie," sets off on a "quiet" boat trip, but he and Stan are confronted with escaped convict (Rapard Cramer). Chaos. <br /> <br /> This d√©cka comedy - OK, which, however, comes from just mimicking Laurel and Hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. Episodic in the structure, the film culminates in an unforgettable ocean sailing after The Boys are taken hostage by the vile Cramer (who shoots the seagull to prove how heavy it is!). The gags are fine, but the inspiration is missing, perhaps due to the recruitment of actor-directed director Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for Ollie's first solo effort in the sound era (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939) but whose work lacks pazazz. Just, but nothing special. L & H regulars Charlie Hall and James Finlayson perform guests.
