This movie has recently appeared on a local television broadcast in South Africa and I thought I would warn even those who love to watch bad B movies (which I do) that it's not even fun. The plot concerns a couple to visit the house in the country. Some strangers appear and ... The problem is that most of the movie, apparently shot at the beginning of the 1970s, consists of extremely broad footage of people walking in real time and terribly slow from A to B. This makes the movie boring in Extreme and expected blood and gore payouts will never happen. I'm really curious - how many people really watched from start to finish?
