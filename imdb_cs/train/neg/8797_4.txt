The infinite madness of clever visual irony does not necessarily create a pilgrimage film. Half of the movie "Blonde Wig" has never apparently failed due to the very self-worth of its creators. Wong Faye half (with very playful looks as Karen Carpenter, Faye Wong) has much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however the story element of the girl meets the back seat with artistic cleverness. Character development is uneven. Emotions are missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Wung Faye "Mung Jung Yun" (Canton's version of Cranberry's "Dreams") is effectively used in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a version of Mandarin called "Zhen Tuo". Both are on the CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" can be found on the official CD soundtrack.
