Not that the "Ulli Lommel film" has filled my hopes, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER has managed to fall below my least expectation. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers to use digital video for their initial projects, which is all good and good for making these children work without spending all the money on expensive film materials. But many of these young filmmakers have also seized the concept of filtering the finished film, so it seems to be qualitatively more similar to celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. The unfiltered digital video really works only in the "mockumentary" style, because it never looks like anything other than a video. Here's the primary problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie is similar to watching the killer's daily toll. He does not feel like watching the movie. And even less unforgivable is that Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. He must know that it is virtually impossible to create horror (or even tension!) On the video. For the love of the god that this guy has been driving since the 1960s! He may be the only director who has not improved his business for over 40 years. And luck, wrote a script! So you can expect complicated actions that do not mean anything, unwarranted behavior, and at least one really demanding plot that leaves you totally unhappy. Please, please skip this movie. Later, thank you.
