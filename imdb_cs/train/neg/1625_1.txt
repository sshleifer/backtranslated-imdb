When I was at school, I made a film about a couple who was walking down the trees and talking, and I realized that it had happened in the middle of his editorial that it was not just a missing aesthetic strategy, but the cliches of the Canadian film: crushed lyricism he married an empty metaphor, loaded with stems for social commentary. But no matter how my own movies got worse, I feel much better when I saw ... this ... thing. First, my ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content on it: every nonsensical piece of business here is flooded for four, five, six inexorable minutes. Men's leadership is simply an incredible, terrifying and noisy fad that has come into blasts of dramatic improvisation between philosophical perceptions that have been expelled from the U of T publication and has been given a lot of space to hate us. It is true that if it were not so, then the third step would have been even less meaningful as a couple of joker guys appeared to provide a distant and thoroughly unnecessary echo of the values ​​of "exploitation"; but it's not easier to watch the kneeling pliers "please" in a detailed view until the magazine exhausts. I remember what I was saying about AUTUMNI BORNA, who had at least the courage of her own incomprehensible lechery: this film crater is and remains the worst Canadian film of all time. At least I really hope.
