TOTAL PERFORMANCE: - Finally long AAG waiting on screen. Unfortunately, the audience could not set a progressive fire. The first best thing to talk about is the idea of ​​transforming the powerful SHOLAY. A Varma made a nice selection of changes to the overall background of the film. If he repeated the same backdrop, people would once again say that there was nothing new about it. Different backgrounds are appealing, but the way they are presented is not worthwhile. Since the beginning of his career in SIVA in Telugu he used the same lighting and kind of background. I really do not know that guy Varma is considering lighting or not, or he can have a different lighting technique than gordon willis GODFATHER. It's all a Dutch Dutch girl. Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme close-ups !!!!!!! Shooting is a lame. Characters could not have emotions, performances are not in their mark, Storytelling is worse, Background is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz was given preference for his work. VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he did not carve all the best figures of Hindi Cinema. There is no comparison between Gabbar and Babban. Babban is more a psycho rather than a villain, but he has a slight corner for his brother (it's a gift in this movie). Amitabhz's performance is not his mark. His appearance is pathetic. The scar on the nose symbolizes the forgotten black and white cinema villains. What has ever worked on Babban is not successful. Babban is not a comparison with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first best thing about this character is not to bring the audience into the eyes of his hands. If it had done so, it would have been the Bachelor's degree as an ABCD teachings. It's good that he soon opened a secret. The flash is pathetic. Varma could not use a great actor as he could to his mark. Durga: The only character with the better. This character was improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body is bothering or at least consider this character. The complete failure of the movie begins when the director can not work on close friendship between our heroes. These characters have nothing in this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is humiliating, falling. AAG can be considered a C class movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge, a city problem, which means true friendship and highly prized harassment and fun from Dharmendra. AAG never had emotions with her characters. Story recognition is too weak for the audience to feel sympathetic to the characters. Do not compare AAG with shola, it will still not like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare watch this movie. You will be burned alive by RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
