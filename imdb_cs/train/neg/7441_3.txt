To quote the film, "It's better to know, even better to forget, the best of all to be abandoned." Oh, irony. The Story of Ghosts with all the technical improvements of Hollywood horror, but a terribly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie and you feel as if you were preaching the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's as if the cumulative character of the writers' dialogue could be summed up by the bad police TV and Jerry Springer's show. Perhaps fit for a film such as The Hitcher, is not a film horror film in Russia. As a result, potentially great settings and some potentially large gore scenes are wasting and become just stupid, not spooky and meaningful.
