A terrible amateur film director (no, not Todd Sheets), his new girlfriend and sister explore the cave. Friend and sister fall and rescue. Meanwhile, a gang of horribly-bred girls is defending their "lawn." Let it mean what it means. This movie and I use the term VERY freely, it's so bad that it's .. well wrong. Humor is painfully dysfunctional, "action" is just sad. Now I've seen some terribly horrible "horror" movies in my time, and I have not been able to grow up in my approach to watching low-budget movies, yet I've still opened up crying for anyone who chooses to go. ONLY for the hardest masochists among you. but the rest escapes away! <br /> <br /> My rating: F
