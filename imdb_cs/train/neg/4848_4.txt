I love a good war movie and fall into the category "there was, I did it". So I'd like to think my reviews are accurate (IMHO). When I just watched this movie on DVD, I can safely say it was a pile of rubbish. There is no way I could recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> It started with my screams on TV, saying "you would not do it" etc ... but I soon realized that a little work experience would be an obstacle, so I cooled a bit. But on the opening scene when the trailer rolled down, I felt unhappy that this movie would be predictable mud ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic of EOD scenes. I just know the army team had some of the most patient insurgents on the other end of the command wire or the remote trigger. So much for letting me scratch my head. Then, when you think you know where the story goes, boys from Humvee are out of their wandering around the desert. One of the most precious things in the theater, which cheerfully turned into some SAS contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was so ridiculous. It made no sense at all, and made me turn myself off and on. Then, to stretch them for so long, they really tried their patience. He started with "Contact Law" and quickly went down. If you had a British accent, then you would be shot, but if you were part of the EOD team, you were a great shot and saved that day. Then, as you thought it had happened, it extended for an inexplicably long period, without adding anything to the story. You just stay watching and wonder why it's not over yet? Then we had a taste scene where they hit each other to laugh ... another scene where you just wanted to end it. He did not add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, as it seemed, my life was very boring, the main star went outside the wire to catch up with someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever watched. It eliminated all the logic and ability to write a good story ... it was pointless and terrible. I still do not understand why they lost time. Then he stared at him as he walked through the busy streets that headed back to the camp when I laughed at the floor. Pure comedy :) The sad fact is that this story is throughout the show without actually deciding what it wants to be. I thought it would be silly illogical scenes from EOD, but then it still happens on the touch that is trying to be something else. But how hard she tried, it just bored me. All I wanted was to finish. It was a filthy compilation of silly scenes that were mixed up in piles of stupid, senseless, action (ish) scenes. <br /> <br /> There is no way I can recommend it. Maybe my work experience has threatened the fun, but even the naive must realize that it does not make sense. The only thing that is stupid than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which must be work 24 hours a week and 7 days a week where this website seems to be used as a means to everyone thinking, that's good. I apologize to the people ... it just is not! <br /> <br /> It is not recommended ... it just bored you.
