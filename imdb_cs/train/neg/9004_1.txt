Nothing could save this movie, nor Superman. Ten years ago, the special effects would have been amazing. Better directing may have gotten some feelings and better performances from the actors. But nothing else than feeding the dragon script could fix it. Plot holes, bad lines, terrible pacing, infinite playback of the same images of the CGI dragon running through the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
