There is an interesting discussion in this movie. Is this a moral person good enough or need something more? The film tells us that without God's leadership the moral good person is not enough. There is a series of films in the film: "You and I can look at a person who is morally good, but they both know he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> While I'm not a Christian, the discussion about this throughout the movie was fascinating, but not the kind the movie intended. I left the movie with a greater sense of being morally good * enough * enough. The arguments and discussions that were presented were heavily concerned that they were breaking the weight of their own ignorance. Fanatism can be a powerful thing, especially when it is in the minds of ignorant and uneducated. As a character, George Carlin in dogma says: "Hook them when they are young". The basic assumption is also very interesting. A biblical teacher from the nineties attempts to publish a book that says morality without God is all right if morale is meaningful. Are you telling the child not to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal because God tells you? (does not worry about saying that the child does not steal because how would it feel if it were his pieces that were stolen?) Author Carlisle wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book (spread the world). However, he needs unanimous approval and one of the teachers refuses to do so. It invokes a very interesting discussion in the film about morality due to morality and the arguments of God's words. To prove his opinion, he produces a time machine (inserted into the film exclusively for the storytelling work that suits me), and sends Carlisle to 2002 to find out where God taught morality without God. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As it should be obvious, he has his / her opinion, is changed by what he sees, and turned back at his / her return (because he's coming back, it's not really a spoiler, that's a bible movie after all. it is about the film itself, it's quite slow and quite wrong. Something that was not needed in this movie is that it produces two "bad boys" who want to try to find out who Carlisle is, even if he did not hurt anyone, commit a crime or anything else. What is wrong with the film showing Carlisle's view, showed his view of this "sinful world" and returned it with a new perspective? <br /> <br /> There are also several points in the movie that confirm that I am happy that I am not a Christian or at least someone who says, "It is God or nothing." The three closest end of the movie made me worry ... first, when two "bad guys" of Carlisle corner just before the jump, Carlisle does his * just * really a contemptuous act .. he fake as his time-jump is Jesus coming, that "evil people" (who are also Christians btw, weird enough) think that they simply lacked exaltation. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after returning, Carlisle finds a boy in which he shouted at the beginning of the movie that he did not steal (but did not mention God holding the balls and escaped) and tells him that theft it's wrong, because God is driving it. Just like Carlina's citation, scary children in religion, my book is a faux pas. <br /> <br /> And eventually an epilogue. Another terrible tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future he could go and he says he does not know .. The epilogue shows that he is trying to tame the Bible into a distant future (starting in 2100), and it fails .. he keeps decrementing years into ten years, and trying again, and due to fading, it is in 2030 or so. Throughout the film, Carlisle mentions that he felt that the end of the world was coming, for the world was full of sin and the loss of the name of God. Thrilling tactics have been used for thousands of years. Enlightened times the church would also be enlightened. <br /> <br /> I am glad to see this movie. While I was pretty sure it was morally good, I know it right now. It is worth noting, if you are not a Christian, and confirming how happy he is not to be as ignorant as the people in this movie.
