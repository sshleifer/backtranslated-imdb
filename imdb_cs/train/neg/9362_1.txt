It seemed to be a promise. To be honest, I did not follow the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie, I had to decide. Is this movie worth watching, until the conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not get a transplant of another kind without rejecting it. Neither the presumption that the secret government authorities persecuted him for human / wolf transplantation. It was because the film was badly written, the behavior lacked emotions and I did not understand a few dreams with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran into the zoo with his dog and left them in front of the zoo, he said, "If you can not run with big dogs, do not leave the porch", it was going through my bored mind. Save time and skip this movie. I can guarantee that if you dare to look at it, you will sit there when you stop, because I was wondering why someone is losing money, time, energy, and effort to do this insulting outrage at American cinematography.
