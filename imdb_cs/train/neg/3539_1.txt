Ritchie's first two films were elegant, stylish fun. Here, does he come up with two recent classics? "Common Suspects" and "Combat Club"? and yet he comes out empty-handed. Despite the fact that he himself portrayed himself as a secret (with the sub-chapter of "Similar Suspects"), the greatest proof you ever gained persuaded you to be "or whatever it was ...) and tried to" Fight-Club "twist about which characters are real and what are the inner speeches, the film is trying to keep the interest of your other half.Without the last third you know that you are guided by a blind alley and slowly it slowly. <br /> <br / > Disadvantages, chess and game theory are all great things, but Ritchie throws them too superficially, and I use the material too many times. The only thing that keeps the film (almost) observable is Ritchie's courageous path with the Maurice-Jones dynamic scene .If Ritchie joined a more satisfactory plot and made a more rigid adaptation, there is no reason why he could not make another nice gangster kapar. <br /> <br /> As it is, Revolver is a loss If you want to see a great movie that does not have the logical meaning but it does its virtue (and by the way, including an inexplicable escape from an isolated retention), watch the "lost highway".
