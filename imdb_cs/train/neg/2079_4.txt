I'm a huge fan of Ivan Reitman - I Loved Evolution and who did not like Ghostbusters? From the trailer you already know that Uma has the character Luke's.That's the construction obviously to the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him.But the payout is just not there.The shark toss managed to get (gentle) giggling but again it was all in a trailer. No one is breathtaking like Uma and Luke is Owen's diet in his good days. If for Rianna Wilson you will not be sitting there with a smile until your faces start to swing. It's a comedy, is not it? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible - it just sits like an old-fashioned cracker behind the fridge. It could have been such a brilliant send-up of superhero movies and feminism, but it fails on both counts. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the surname.
