Since the "Rugrats", falling from the category of good and fun cartoon series to the average and truly terrible ride for two years old in the last three or four years, of course the tyrants in Klaska-Csupo should not be ideas. After I blocked all the characters, I added even more silly new ones, replacing some voices (even though I like Nancy Cartwright, she is not Chucky Finster!) And they do not have a sense of continuity (eg in Kimi's episode I watched the second day, Tommy and Chucky got a new puppy, but in the next episode the above dogs never appear), you think the creators can kill a show for mercy. But noooo. <br /> <br /> The only thing I'm going to say about this strange thing is that it sucks! While it's not as bad as Kimi's episodes, everyone is even more stupid than they were, including a grandfather (my god, he was the best figure in the show but now he has no real intention). The end is unnecessarily fluffy and the only thing that is different from this and other dirty new episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can communicate with adults. Hello, what fun! <br /> <br /> No stars at all for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please SAVE this show before it gets worse.
