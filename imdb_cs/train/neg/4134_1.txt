I must honestly say that I could not stop watching this movie from the other one that started. Just for how bad it was! It's just like watching a dry color just a lot more confusing. I mean, you're sitting and waiting for something to happen, anything in reality, best for something that makes the movie meaningful! At the end of the movie, I actually sat there and wondered if there was any chance I had probably forgotten the first hour that explained everything to me, or whether I could inadvertently go through the movie and missed the parts, there was actually one) together! The main thing that really made me feel about this movie is almost the end of the main girl (if there was really the main girl) was in some alternative reality, I mean what the hell is going on at this moment? she suddenly woke up and was in a mental institution connected with a bed that the doctors apologized or something, then faster than it would make me cut my wrist, overturn, and she came from some random vampire! it did not make any sense! I'm tempted to send an e-mail creator and request my time back, I mean by losing 2 hours of my life watching this waste! I have a little interest in knowing if the filmmakers really knew what it was all about! it seemed to me that someone edited all the bits that could make sense even though I think the movie would take 4 hours to make it happen! She misses the second person who wrote the second review, I was royalist with this title and that alone. I'm just so grateful that I did not actually buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw it in a local pound shop. Would you like to think that it would give me the idea that the film is a complete stack of smoke, but to be honest, I think Â£ 1 is too much money to spend this movie !!!! what happened to a huge waste of time and a good shaving machine, I mean, I would like to be less willing to watch this movie !!!!
