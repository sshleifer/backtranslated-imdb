This is a really horrible clone of 'LOCK STOCK' with a stellar cast and horrible script. I have no idea why so many top British actors have signed up for this unsolicited trading had to be remembered. The missing story goes forever and forever, and if I did not pay for it, I had to turn it off after 10 minutes. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen that honor goes into a really pathetic, used bogla movie "(I use the term loosely)" GUMMO "(I feel she sues the so-called" Director "for the lost hour and half of my life) this waste is almost down to him, definitely one of the worst 5 films I've ever seen, such things remind Hollywood that they do not have a monopoly on really horrible movies.
