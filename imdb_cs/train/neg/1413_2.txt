I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure it would be a good movie if something happened in it. Nothing is. It is short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I searched for the remaining 20 minutes. Excruciating. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor - who did not work unnecessarily - researching the part he could play as a cashier at a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where he works. Nothing happens. He will definitely give him a ride home and go to Arby, Target, washing the car. Nothing happens. He talks about his lives. Nothing happens. Sometimes. <br /> <br /> I do not understand. But I also do not have Bill Murray flicks "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you like these movies, you may like it. Lots of people find movies like this moody, charming, or - for the reasons that escape me - find a fascinating dialogue. The usual equipment in the films of this film is to have a long moment of peace / silence after the actor delivers a series that makes sense. We know it's meaningful because it's two minutes on the screen. Excuse me, I have to be merciful. I do not get it. For me, those movies are not fun, charming or thoughtful. They're just boring. Why? Because it's not a comedy. No drama. No tension. No laughter. No tension. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, none of the things I've ever experienced in movies. I can get bored for free. In real life I see oddball / quirky characters. I'm going to Target and fast food restaurants and car washing. These elements do not create a movie, even though the stars do these things. I pay to have fun. If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman and you just want to hear him go mad, have fun. If you want to overwhelm Paz Vega, you can listen to it and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. Total snoozefest.
