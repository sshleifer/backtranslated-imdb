Whilst William Shater always smiles at me in whatever he appears to (and I love him especially like Denny Crane in Boston Legal), it's all about glitter and dance and screaming and jumping up and down. > <br /> He has no Millionaire intelligence, nothing of what is happening or not. <br /> <br /> This show is about dances and silly things to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I just saw it, of course, just to look at it. I looked at him for more than 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. The best part was that William Shatner danced on the stage. It's a horn! unfortunately this show will NOT do it. <br /> <br /> This is given
