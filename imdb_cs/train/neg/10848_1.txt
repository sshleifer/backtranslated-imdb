It seems to be an interesting movie. With the score of the powerful cradle of the movie, playing with their frontman Dani and being hyped like "The Future of British Horror," I expected Alex Chandon's gore fest to live up to hype. poorly. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is either cliché or awkward. The set of anthology was fatal (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. It is true that the idea of ​​a "sick room" sent a frost on my spine, but like most film it was a bad writing and playing. Chandon can not write a dialogue. Every sentence with the chief investigator of the police is full of insults and insolence (a typical policeman on the edge.) Funny, I've definitely seen it before ...) No Chandon, you are not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. Sounds like BAD. Add a ridiculous OTT that has a very nasty casting (do not listen to me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but the actor is not) and performances are out of the laughs with veins that buzzle. Give me Bruce Campbell every day. The visual effects are on everything poor, with some cruel CGI, terrible gore effects (for good, Peter Jackson did better, and it was more than a decade ago with less budget) and editing the filters that scream OVER-USE! As for the often mistaken use of the Cradle Of Filth ... human, they should sue. The basic problem with Cradle Of Fear is to take it seriously, trying to create an atmosphere and incite terror and rejection within your audience. too many good horror films from the seventies and eighties are much better with far better gore effects (eg maniac, zombie meat eaters, outside, suspiria, etc.), making my mind Cradle of Fear, obsolete. I hope Chandon can learn from this terrible ghoul of the movie and go on to make some kind of horror that really feels. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky next time.
