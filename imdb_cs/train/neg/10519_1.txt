I've seen a lot of movies and I rarely rate the movie "1", but this movie was out of horror. The game was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were uncomfortable. Usually when I look at scary movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear the noise in the house / forest / school / etc .. And then they scream "hello there someone there?" - but at least they are credible when they do it. This movie could not even get that. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make other B-horror films like Venom and fog appear to be Academy Award-winning masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind when watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment to anyone else watching the movie again. THAT'S HORRIBLE!
