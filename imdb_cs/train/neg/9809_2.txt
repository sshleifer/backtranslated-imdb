Some are wondering why this was no longer Mrs. Murphy's movies. This is because this movie has completely exploded. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they're the property of Disney, but it'll be more grown up). The movie is too small because the book is not. Casting is bad for those characters. The characters do not even do as they do in the books. And why did Tucker turn into a guy? She's a girl in books! Was it done to make movies appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, a gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is missing from this dirt. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but she let it out that her work was bad. An animated feature film, perhaps in the painting of Don Bluth, would suit the better Murphy movie. Overall, I'm doing 2 because at least Disney shot the movie from an underestimated series of books. But I wish they were better. Either way, I still have books to have fun.
