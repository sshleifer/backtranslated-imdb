It could have been an amazing story based on old cat races, but it was not. This work could be just that; amazing and full of mythological references that kept my fascination powered. The character's lead (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause, and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) had been done, had no depth of personality and was hard to sympathize or draw. Even MÃ¤dchen Amick (played by Tanya Robertson) does not fit into this description. <br /> <br /> However, as I have said many times, when you adapt Stephen King's novel to television, you just have to take into account the fact that his books are not written for television and his scenario talents patiently lacks the fire and depth he exposes as a writer. <br /> <br /> This is another distorted attempt to take the magic of Stephen King's script, whether it be his novels or the original script. Simply cut and paste your work into a small screen. His novels are totally intimidated and everything you create is a nice movie; nothing less, but definitely nothing more. His scripts are hit and miss. Unfortunately, this translation of the script was missing. <br /> <br /> We are sorry, sorry, but I like the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1.0 / 10 from ... <br /> <br />
