This is the second British Rank movie that adapted Sommerset Maugham's stories to the film. The only story of the Quartet does not belong to the contemplation period; and the actor's speech is definitely "cut" because it can only be the British predecessor of the 1950s. In any case, "Trio" seems to be tighter and filmier than the first film adaptation. One of the problems that these two films can not overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before movies. As a result, in the 1950s, Maughm's (pre-war) populist "little morale" narrative seemed to be rather quaint, if not straightforward.
