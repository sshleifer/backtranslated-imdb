This is not a movie. It's a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and ill-assembled scenes that look like pending 10-year-olds with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have the theory that an extremely abrasive girl on the train corridor - the one with greasy hair, dead man, ipod, and nervous silence - probably shot her in the creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you have done that for more than ten minutes I did, do not bother to try to adapt to what you have seen in the context of the European artistic mentality I praised above. This is the true and complete loss of time, money, and film that would make William One-Shot Beaudine confront. The unfortunate part lies in the fact that the endless series of vacuum-packed figures is representative of what is now going on for a lot of humanity. What will be next? Six directors firing social contact on the Wal-Mart refresh counter?
