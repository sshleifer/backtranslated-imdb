Rich Ditzy Joan Winfield (Bette Davis) is betrothed to marry the silly, selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looks lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and has been kidnapped by a pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney, seriously). The country is in the desert and hates each other, but (sighing) begins to fall in love. It seems that the reviewers are getting high ratings just because they are Cagney and Davis. They were both brilliant actors, but they were known for dramas NOT COMEDY and this film shows why! The script is terrible - there is no real laugh in the whole movie. The running joke in this one causes Cagney and Davis to fall first into a cactus (this is happening THREE TIMES!). Only their tremendous talent will save them from being completely humiliated. Because they both do the best with a messy material. Cagney is trying his best and Davis every turn of full strength, but that does not work. Carson has this "what the hell" looks on his face throughout the movie (probably because his characters are changing in seconds). Only the Palette with its distinctive voice and above the top reader is disappointed to make some smiles. Overall, however, it was boring and laughing - it was the real job they could sit down. It gets two stars for Cagney and Davis' acting and some beautiful cinematography, but it really is not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this movie in later years and you can see why.
