Heather Graham could not play a persuasive lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do filmmakers think they are? THE ABSOLUTE BEST, THE MOST NERALISTICS movie I've seen as long as I remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to register for IMDb, and I made sure that the rating of this movie drops. Omg I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunken chick so while she's gone I'm really going to walk around my room for the HOURS to ask frantically "What have I done?" Jesus' heather, to cross it and grow up ... and I'd like to give the same sentiment to idiot producers ... and when I'm concerned, instead of making this film a pathetic apology for a narrative story, maybe it would be better to focus the conspiracy on a figure that is mentally unstable. .. like your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know that for the first time I had homosexual sex when I left the next morning, jumped up to the sky excitedly in the middle of the street ... honestly, getting in my hand. <br /> <br /> WHAT'S JOKE! and realize that there are many other mistakes and shocking aspects in this lame film, but I'm so sorry to think about it already. if you are a smart person, you will hate this movie and if you are not a smart person then you will love it ... it's so simple.
