This movie is really bad. The game is just terrible except for Michael Ironside. I do not have a story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor of the battle between the two gangs. He comes to the city and suddenly is chosen to fight the bad people who want India. On the cover he said he was an Indian himself, who also returned to his home town, I heard it in the movie, if it was not clear. Richard Grieco was one hell of a bad actor. Hard and ugly. He said he liked it. And we should not talk about Sean Young, she was not one of my favorite actors, but in this film there are Indian women who fall in love with Bolt (Grieco). It's scary. When I rented it, I chose between this and the refuge with Amanda Pays. I chose it because Michael Ironside was in the movie. Maybe I should take Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> You do not see it if you think Richard Grieco looks hard on motorcycles with sunglasses. I got it at home. I wrote it after I saw the movie.
