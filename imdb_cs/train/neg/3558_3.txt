Based on the dark bestseller Ray Russell, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-driven bust is not enough for it. <br /> <br /> Although it does not lack blood pressure, it lacks narrative feelings and "characters". <br /> <br /> "Incubus" title is a mammoth penis d√©mon that shoots red sperm into the vagina during sexual intercourse - or more accurately rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, the moonlight of his successful directorial career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of bizarre attacks on young women. The terrible possibilities of the victims that reproduce demonic offspring are not considered - nor is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage. The reluctance of the script to explore the dramatic consequences of a fertile assumption is an example of the major problems with this Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.
