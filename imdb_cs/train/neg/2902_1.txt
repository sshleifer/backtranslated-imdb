Spoiler: A group of passively aggressive people who meet the family. The script tells them and does things people would never do, at least anyone who has modest decency. The hero falls on a woman she sees as her soul in a bookstore on a day of meeting without knowing she will appear as her brother's girlfriend during a meeting. She tries to reject her brother's assertion, but she knows our hero is clearly in love with her, she is ruthlessly stiffening her by wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper and shaking through her brother in an apologized apology to show him how to stretch with. At one point, he actually gets rid of it and gets his showers. She tries to cover her eyes. His heart is broken. He thinks it's funny until he suddenly decides he does not want his brother and leaves. The movie really stretches. The audience shuffled and stretched the long way. The scripture is unintelligible and unbelievable. We almost went out, but they still thought things would happen, but nooooo. All the beautiful reviews had to be written in paid roots to sink poor people like me to see this bullshit. Comparison with Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, writers, actors, producers and theaters for doing something so bad doing on the screen!
