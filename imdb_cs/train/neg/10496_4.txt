Gday Mates! he just watched Croc Hunter. it was okay, but the show seems to be real. it looked like a longer episode of AnimalPlanet with lots of lines and more characters. Several Things: Steve described Snakes Squats as hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for realsy you know it hurts. and exceeded high? everyone is catching their tail and so on. In this film, two MAJOR images were split. when Terry finds out that baby joey goes like "We have to raise them like a child". Woah! I thought he was going to feed the kid. that would have done PG-13. While on Terry, someone noticed the movie and much of Terry's knowledge of ritual mating. knows her sexual things. The film takes place in Queensland, Australia. I want koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. even though it is small, which proved to be useless against the dynamite-hooking hottie. Oh, and if someone else follows it, try and agree with me in saying that the country fat fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in the shotgun. he ate his sheep! I would also be crazy!
