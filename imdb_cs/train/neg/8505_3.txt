"Semana Santa" or "Angel of Death" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in humans. Mira has an Italian accent that has faded from time to time. She could not just speak English? All other characters have a forced Mexican-English accent that scatters them. Dialogue is very bad and delivery is wooden. Cinematography looks nice, but it's not enough to save this rumble. THIS FOLLOWING PART OF THE OVERVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax, the villain seems to have gone away, but then he goes down the stairs to be shot and make a great piece on the railing. It just shows that this script has no originality at all. AVOID!
