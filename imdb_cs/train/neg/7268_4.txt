Boring, long, demanding, repetitive, involved in yourself? this step had a bad date. Worse yet, the boring direction of the art school - with the heavy use of a whirling shot, which was so overwhelming that it almost pushed me into command - is constantly screaming to see it. Add the thinnest of the plots and practically no dialogue, and the movie will feel like a four-hour epic about 30 minutes. It's getting worse: instead of dialogue, poorly written voice transcripts and quotes and songs that comment very clearly on the characters. Really loud opera music. Tell all to the director. The actors are all pretty good. Leading actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is especially suited for movie stars. He and the other actors have some pretty erotic moments. Even these begin to be boring after 5 minutes, and one is wondering if the director is auditioning for Bel Ami porn. The stunning college campus as a place in Mexico City is inspiring. How are universities in the US so insignificant (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this movie. Would you like to use the Quick Scan button? many.
