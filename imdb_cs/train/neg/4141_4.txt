Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this film is the fact that it goes against everything most vampire myths adhere to. Like vampires who walk in the sun. Although there are parts that just make you accustomed to how society makes movies. A scene where the vampire gets stung and yells, "It hurts ... It's really stuck." Then it seems that the scenes are missing, but you get used to it after a while. And there are random sequences of dreams that really help with the story. Think about it, nothing really makes sense, but I just got a lot of friends and twice watching them to get the full effect. Think about the battle scenes being charming and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly, when I write more of this I like this movie more. But you know, in all you can not expect Schindlers List, but it's a fun watch.
