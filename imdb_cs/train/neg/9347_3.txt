This film is based on a self-assessment moment into a self-worth moment that promises to develop into something worthwhile. But not. It's flat, confident, unthinkable, and lengthy. A series of set pictures and backdrops do not create a movie, they make a calendar. This kind of pitiful socialist pseudo-dramatic document ("It's really true that happened") not only does not work but does not convince, so it does not even work as a social history. Clich√©s that mix with bad acting make this movie very difficult to complete, with the entertainment factor slowly falling apart. The characters are one-dimensional and never evolve to the extent that they feel. The ego of the director is the greatest character of this film.
