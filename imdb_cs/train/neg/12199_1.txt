-me and my sister are watching the movie right now. we laughed at the deaf. can I imagine the Oscar nominations on the packaging? - the first, the musician mixes about 4-5 different styles of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and moves the character ... <br /> <br /> --- the main character of the New Year's Eve does not fit in there. he looks like a Mexican Tarzan. ---- Russian soldiers are everything, but not Russian faces :-) ----- ok, main points: 1. The plane called charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What is thought when Rambo go jump out of the plane but get stuck? rope mix 3. Girl? the best scene is when she dies. It means a lot to him. has it known for ages? he calls for her, ... about my god samurai 4. How many arrows do he have? his arrow bag is always full of arrows? I did not notice the scene where they are collecting - but I saw the scene where the arrow is located in the Vietnamese soldering head - it's very important 5. how many helicopter rockets can hold ??? (real) I saw 4th, but Rambos hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6th part. what Russian special army helicopters do in Vietnam ????????? after war? The first scene when he entered the Vietnamese camp ... his first thought was to free the shelter that stands in the tree in the open space. "Wow, what kind of thought than before: 1. With a knife at you can cut iron wire - maybe only in Vietnam? 2. Malta - using one boy? My god, the Americans really have to learn about the weapons! You do know how much the need to calibrate the mortar (I think the writer looked at many films from World War II)
