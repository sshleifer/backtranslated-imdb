Sorry, this movie has no original. Nicholas Cage, relatively wooden in terms of actors, brings the screen with a whole host of skills, ranging from unspoiled to the top. Support for cast is not better. The conspiracy remains the same as the original in terms of the progress of the scene, but it is much worse. There is not enough detail to allow viewers to get into what they are selling. It turned out to be just a bad merchandise. Injustice can not be suspended, nor can it be doubted. The only economical aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and who would explore location, we should praise. There was a lot of laughter and more boos in the audience, literally at the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to appear on TV, pour whiskey and enjoy.
