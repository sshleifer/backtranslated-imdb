I do not believe all the praise of this film. The play and the movie were intricate Sleuth. Michael Caine wishes to be Olivier, and Reeves wishes he is Caine. Caine even had the courage to make a remake of Sleuth with Judge Law playing his original part. Jude Law? Do you mean by the Alfie remake? <br /> <br /> This movie was created during Caine's career when it was obvious that she needed to repay debt from gambling. He will do anything for the money. He will play in such award-winning movies as this one and "The Adventure of Poseidon". It seems like it's a taste for this movie, Reeves's death. He deserves better than remembering this filthy movie. And so is Caine. You will find this movie in a $ 5.97 trash on Walmart. Together with gems such as "Island" and "Blame it on Rio".
