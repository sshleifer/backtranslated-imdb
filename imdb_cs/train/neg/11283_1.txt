I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a complete loss of two hours, the conspiracy line was thin and confusing, the prestigious set of players had a terrible dialogue and extremely controversial accents. Working with the camera was somewhat experimental, although it was to see what the director was trying to pass, it made it even harder to watch. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of narrative throughout the movie almost as the whole story is dictated by the audience. Best performances have nothing to do with playing. In fact, probably the most convincing performance comes from Dani Behr of all people, although certainly a Stereotypical secretary office plays. NEVER you go and you do not see this movie if you do not need reason to catch up with some lost sleep, certainly there are better ways to spend your hard earned money.
