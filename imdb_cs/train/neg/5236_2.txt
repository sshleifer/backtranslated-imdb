my friends and we saw this movie about a week ago and I feel it is absolutely necessary to tell all the world (or at least to those who read it) that this film is not just the first five worst movies I've ever seen but really has it honor to be the first. I've seen a lot of movies, but none of them hate when it's stupid. you could say I suffered when I watched ... the only excuse is that we waited a few hours and were unable to go anywhere without freezing our buttocks. I do not recommend anyone. at first I thought we were watching some really bad porn movies, but it came after 10 minutes, which is not the case. it's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not an action, it's not scary, it's terrible!
