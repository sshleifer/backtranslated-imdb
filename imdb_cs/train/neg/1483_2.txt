I just gave this ridiculously called comic horror and 2 because there are some famous porn stars in the past. A group of tourists, probably on vacation in Ireland, but actually in Canada, notes the cannibalistic inbred mutant, something else and the conspiracy is more or less correct from HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN. The only problem is, if I have not changed, there is only one mutant on the display and it is not that impressive. Something like a mummy that's been in the home movie for about five years. Some horrific but silly deaths help, but the movie is a strictly amateur night and boring faith. The end is predictable and was at the end of death. No word toy was determined
