Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it's upsetting for a long time. I remember the day I first saw at MST. The sun shone, it looked like a good day. then I saw this product Rick Sloane, which consisted of terrible plush dolls that triggered the trigger in the embarrassing 80s festival. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, drive the assistant's job, fight toys, and lots of other things in this very bad series of pictures. No plot or story is needed. Obviously, no film is necessary, as the film shows. The Army boy and his sex crazy girl will want to jump out of the cliff, and your friend Dorka, who gets his phone calls from a sex phone, will say, "She has some pretty red shorts." Besides, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident at his supermarket. Just when you think it's over, wait for the Club Scum scene. Ask a rash on the road. I encourage you to have a good month after watching this movie to get your senses and mental health. And when you see Rick Sloane, give him a good trench to show how much we value this crawler Hobgoblins.
