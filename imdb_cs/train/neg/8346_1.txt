The title was to be a pedestrian. The guy spent 90% of the film walking. She does not know what she wants or what it is. Go through life for theft of people's identity for nothing. He has no advantage, no money, no pretending to be another person. No body was able to understand why it pretended to be someone else. The only thing that was clear in this film was that he loved his father and was a good son. But the rest was crap. He may be a director who wants to be someone else. But what he really has to do is get a real job, because after his film I do not think he has a chance to become a film producer.
