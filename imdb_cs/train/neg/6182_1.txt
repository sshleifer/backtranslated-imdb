This film makes Peter the elf in Robin Hood's costume instead of a human guy in a probably non-Robin-Hood-costume and ignores all the persona features in it that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a crazy idiot. And poor Captain Hook put together a TOTAL clown. And of course, because every Disney cartoon has a character that has too many hits in the head, it's one of those lost guys. The only character that was not exploited in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? Darling parents do not even have time to notice that their children are gone! Probably one of the most important points in the original story and destroyed it! The well-known children's scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece - no thimbles and no acorns - one of the few things that makes the original story so unique. It is surprising that he even lost his shadow and helped him hold him. (Although it's on the shoes and it does not make sense to me.) <br /> <br /> Destroy a great story like this just to entertain kids, it should be illegal. So you know if you did not know about it - this version of Disney has nothing to do with the original story - which is not really a story for children, but just a great and great story. <br /> <br /> It just makes me uneasy.
