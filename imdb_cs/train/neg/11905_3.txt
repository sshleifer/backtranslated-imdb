With a tendency to repeat itself, Wenders is still disappointed since he came to Paris with "Paris Texas". <br /> <br /> "Country full" is no exception. Since I expected an average average film before I entered, it seems that Wenders' ambitions always get the best of it. It is considered that his films are heavy and bombastic. I was not sure if I was watching a comedy that is ridiculed by Central America or a thriller. The result of Diehl's character is completely predictable. Wender's insistence on layering many scenes with some rock song is also very unpleasant. He covered holes in his script and directed through the scenes. I'm sure many people will find this film important and resonant, but honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort speaks only the wrong direction. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Wenders claimed that Sam Scapard had a great deal of help with the script when shooting "Texas Texas". Yes, it was Wenders' best and he should understand that he needed a good screenwriter. His films of the last fifteen years have been a complete mess.
