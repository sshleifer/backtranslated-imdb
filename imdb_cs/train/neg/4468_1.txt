OK, simple and simple, if you are a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), stay out of legends. It is without a doubt the most disappointing TR game ever. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it's totally unplayable and I have surrendered. I feel like I was robbed of Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a computer game earlier than anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games, standards were standard. The AODs were "tiny" but still the same control sequences. In the legend, they have completely changed their methods of movement and control and are totally uncontrollable. Everywhere I've seen comments from people who say "Use Mouse". No, why should I? Others say "Use gamepad". No, why should I? Others say, "But that was the standard for third-party control over the years." Well, I do not care, it's not the standard for any other TR game, so why are they wrong with it. I know because they do not like their original, loyal fan base, they want to invest in new kids who have never heard of the series until the film has come out and has not earned a lot of money. Pathetic. My advice to some serious TR fan is out of the game, and if you buy it, complains about Eidos. I've seen a lot of other places, especially in the Eidos forums, from the people who told them what waste they are, they might be listening.
