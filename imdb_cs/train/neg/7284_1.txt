Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so terribly I had to see it and my god, feeling it in St. Petersburg. Louis. Where should I start? National Lampoons attempted the success of Animal House 5 years later, but completely missed the brand. I'm going with these short films chronologically. Short Film # 1 Bad Peter Riegert (Boon of the Animal House). Obviously he did not work then, so the boys at the National Lampoons probably called and said, "Hey, we're making a cmppy movie, do we want to be in it?" Peter was like, "Well, I will not do much today, why not?" He was a great elderly figure in the Animal House, but he could not carry this shy short flop for 5 minutes. POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is fun enough when Jason Cooper (Riegert) tells his wife to leave him, he needs to find. It is too strange that they are really in a happy marriage. So he pursues her, goes there and Cooper is in charge of the children. This, of course, leads to burning a house, losing several children, and sleeping with a selection of New York bimbos (including young Diane Lane). Then the woman returns, wants the children and the film ends with a coin that decides on the fate of the children. The idea was a little smarter, but the director was gone. All the characters look as if they hear, they have to do it. We apologize for Boon, your legacy was destroyed by this flop. <br /> <br /> Short film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILS <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. Nice girl, a recently completed college, is not sure what to do with her. So she gets a bitch, starts sleeping with some mega-rich boys, takes the money when she dies, and she will not stop until she sends the strongest man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the president of the United States). Once again, it was funny, and although I was happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) was not afraid to get rid of everything, her acting was terrible. What to waste time on. <br /> <br /> Short film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe I've done so far. Here's newcomer Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, thinks he can really help people, although he becomes cynical after being shot several times. Nagurski has just given up his care. He looks at dusk, attacks, naming them, and never interferes. He states that the world is injustice and is likely to be sued if he does something. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the Taxi run) got into action, got the police to call him, commit a crime, but had his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Again, it could have been funny, the show was deliberately Tambourine, but good, no energy at all. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed of having their names on this record. I think the writing was not bad, the thoughts were there, but the executions were cut off as well as the attempt to rescue the Iraqi hostage. If I were part of this movie, I would like my name removed, it is terrible. Then again, so I watched it. The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr. John made a movie score (repeats "Going to the movies" again and again) and the movie is not "for a long time and a half. Show it in movies titled" What You Should Never Do in movie. "This script should be left on the shelf, because yes, it's so bad.
