Really terrible, demanding, endless film. Director Bellocchio seems to be blinded by the beautiful face and character of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But perhaps, perhaps, he should focus his attention a little more on being a good, engaging film. I hate it when sex movies pose as an "artistic film" just to become more "decent". Frequent, sometimes horrible sexual scenes are the only reason for the existence of this film. Whether it's worth sitting in other areas is strictly a matter of taste. (*)
