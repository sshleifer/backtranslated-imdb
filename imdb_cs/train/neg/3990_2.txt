Jungle Fever is too highly stylized, stereotypical and strikes as dishonest. Wesley Snipes was a bad guy, and there was no chemistry between him and Annabell Sciorra. Although there are plenty of talents in this movie, it's mostly unnecessary because the parts are limited to a little more than decorative ornaments. Also, instead of simply showing racism for an ugly and stupid thing, Lee had decided he would wave it like the flag in the most whining and irritating way. I got it over most of the movie, but I could not finish it, and it's rare for me.
