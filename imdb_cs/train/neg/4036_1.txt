Almost from this word, this film is poor and unconvinced, but again, most people will try to show the commitment to the script as rigid as this one. The dialog does not actually run, and sometimes there is (or should be) less in this case. It is also backed up by special scenes (such as Cemetry slow-motion walking) that you think might lead somewhere, but it seems they are losing a few more seconds of your life. The plot is a strange combination of gangster / sitcom that I certainly thought was a good idea at the time, but if there ever was a case where someone had to be honest with the scriptwriter then it was. Martin Freeman is fine, but then he seems to have one character that always plays, so I'm starting to wonder if he was given a script or just shot and told to react as normal. Finally - humor. It reminds me of "Python (I think) quote about Shakespeare, about his" comedians "- If he wanted to be humorous, he would have a joke. Well, I did not see it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time - that I watched with a friend and hoped it would improve. <br /> <br /> It was not possible.
