The message of this film is "a personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be a "ugly duckling", but funny it is not ugly (it's actually much more attractive than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now this movie would work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? In my opinion, despite the message he wants to explain, this film is just ridiculous. <br /> <br />
