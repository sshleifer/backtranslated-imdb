The fact that this movie was up for rent in Norway is bizarre. This movie is terrible. This image quality is just one teen a little better than you get from your mobile phone and the plot is so bad. The main character is just unpleasant and the rest is just jerking. Everyone associated with this movie should be ashamed. The fact that people from whom this film made their name is extraordinary. Distributors; have they even seen it? This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. To denote this comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this film by buying or renting it.
