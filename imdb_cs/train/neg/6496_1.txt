This film was disappointing. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I'm the type of person who starts the film and does not turn it off until the end, but I forced myself to shut it down. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not turn it off was because I was a huge fan of Christian Slater and wanted to see him working in him. When I finished watching the movie, I was totally immobile. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Thanks for letting Christian Slater add some humor. If you were not in this movie, I would have to bore it. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins must act. At the time the movie ended, I did not even experience it. I was confused and anxious.
