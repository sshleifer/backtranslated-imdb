30 seconds into introductory credits I felt like it would be a bad movie but I did not know how bad. Then an actor who plays a bad Nazi scientist opens my mouth and my friend and I decided that in order to survive this movie we will have to lower the volume, create our own dialogue and double the speed on DVD. But it did not help. About halfway we switched it off. Now I've been through some bad movies, both with and without the assistant "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie," but there are only some films I doubt even Bots can save. The biggest part of the film that worried me most was that people hypnotized that they were green-colored zombies. I think they were all hypnotized to death, then hypnotized to drive. Stay true to classical classics of B-film like "Plan Nine From Outer Space."
