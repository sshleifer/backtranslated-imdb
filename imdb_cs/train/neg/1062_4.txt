Ouch! This was a bit painful to sit. She has a cute and fun premise, but from here everything goes to hell. Matthew Modine is almost always a pedestrian and unpleasant and will not disappoint. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned in surprisingly good performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among other things, played their way through the top. I know that's the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame the actors when the screenplay and the director make their lock. If you have stupid characters, it's okay, but you must have good material to make it work. He was not here. If possible, get out of this movie.
