Well, it's good first: Cher's performance and cinema. Even though I'm not a Cher fan, it gives excellent performance and its part was well written. Cinematography has been well done and captures the feeling of romance. The rest: a thin plot, the performance of Nicholas Cage, and an utterly fearless and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First, whenever Cage opened his mouth, I stopped. I do not know what the accent is trying to use. Honestly, there was certainly no New York or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite unreal. And it was not because I was a holder of precision, his voice was right in his ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Secondly, and it is purely unofficial, but in New York I have many Italian relationships, friends and acquaintances, and sincerely I was more laughing and I felt more joy to appreciate the Italian ethnic family than the film. And that would be a boring night at the house. What he left.
