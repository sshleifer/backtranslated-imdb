He has seen this movie in the early perspective and I can not emphasize enough how badly I thought this movie was. From the very beginning, the audience moaned over Pacino's terrible southern accent. Poor Al looked serious, really hideous, and I can not decide whether he's deliberately part of his role as a drug addict, or maybe he just could not sleep before he came to the set. Much worse than Pacino, but it's an unfortunate justification for the plot. Soon, in the film, we get hints that the character of Pacino is homosexual, and I suspect it was originally planned by a screenwriter. Later, however, we must stop our distrust and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both of them are helpful in lame roles) long for this older, half-dead, female man with a senseless accent. The worst part of the whole was the main plot of the fence, which involved a company espionage that was never completely explanable, and we never really cared about it. Because it was a preview, I reserve my final judgment for the possibility of re-filming and editing, but you can bet that they will not pay a penny to see it in theaters.
