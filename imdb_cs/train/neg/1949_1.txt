Animation looks like it's in 30 seconds, and looks more like cartoons rather than characters. I was a fan of Scooby Doo since the series premiered in 1969. I did not have much to think about Scooby Doo animated films (I'm talking about TV series, not feature films). But some of them were pretty nice and I like most people , that Scrappy Doo is irritating, but this series is pure waste. Once I saw the animation and listened to the characters (and I use this term freely) I'm talking, I crouched. Also, Mystery Inc. it was a team and without the crew to make each other compliments, it seems like she would open a box of chocolates to find someone who had already eaten the best, and the only thing left was the one that nobody wants. What's new Scooby Doo was better than this. If you have a Scooby Doo TV series, include the elements that have been doing the series for so long. Full cast of characters and quality animation. He has to come back to the rock where it came from.
