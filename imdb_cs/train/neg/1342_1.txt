This film is the first effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from some problems like any low-budget production, it is a good start for Mrs Beaton and her company. The story is not terribly new because it was performed in The Burning films and every Friday thirteen since the second. But the performances are sincere. So many big budget movies just have actors to go through the moves, it's always nice to see the actors really trying to perfect their craft. The story deals with murder (and perhaps return) of a disfigured classmate. Others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are murdered one by one with a terrible stalker known as The Bagman. Survivor? You have to watch. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or some arrogant critics, you probably should not bother. But if your taste is approaching Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people who chase their craft, then look at "The Bagman".
