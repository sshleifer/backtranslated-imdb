The basic movie premise of slasher, 3 young ladies destroyed the car and eventually stayed with a ghostly family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Watching 36 minutes of premonition driving a OJ with a white sedan instead of bronco. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... YAWN 23 minutes watching actors eat - YAWN Trying to find out what the hell is eating ... OK there can be a drinking game ... nope - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... OK I'm interested in a couple of seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random and unknowing murders ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The ultimate ... buddy! that the psycho is upset - why the rest of the film could not look like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately it is - My advice - fast forward in the last five minutes and watch it and then put something good on the player - I'm going to sleep for myself.
