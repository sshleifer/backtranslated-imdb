When exploring some caves with your wife, the doctor is biting a bat that causes some alarming side effects ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes the scary atmosphere and some decent (though under the used makeup effects) will not save B horrible movement from it that he is the subject of a human being's creation. Bat people, aka Living at night, suffer from an absurd story that is flippantly rendered and disorganized. It does not seem to be anywhere else, and the film never provides an explanation of what will happen or even a satisfying conclusion about it all. Cast is fairly media in their performances. <br /> <br /> Still, I give the film a few points for my terrible dark song and nice shooting. The work done by late Stan Winston is also good, but I do not see much here. A completely missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Surely one of the smaller people-creature moves outdoors. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
