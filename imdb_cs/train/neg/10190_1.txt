After watching this event on the MST3K episode, I have to wonder how many movies this movie lends. It seems to combine the Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least a few others. At one point I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea of ​​how many holes a plot is. as well as the fact that even if the gas is unavailable, there is plenty in the abandoned filling stations and stations are close enough to keep the F1 racing car all over the country.
