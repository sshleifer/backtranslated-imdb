As a big fan of movies and games, David Mamet, especially his first House of Games, who also starred Joe Mantegno, I was expecting great things from this movie. Instead, I felt disturbed by the superficiality of the film and the lack of credibility. Race harassment is thrown away without any sensations or senses behind them, in the hope of creating a racial tension that has never happened to me. Identity is completely reevaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of swearing as a policeman, the senior figure firmly refuses to take one relatively small action that would not hurt anyone and save lives, and yet performs another action that is very violent and very illegal, but still refuses action. In addition, a very sublime subplot involving the man who killed his family was introduced only because of the plot that was only advertised on the rock side, and the police's response to this occurrence extends credibility beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed when I said the smallest of them after expecting another exciting thriller by David Mamet. 3 out of 10.
