I watched this movie based on the fact that Amber Benson stones and Nick Stahl are generally pretty cool - I thought every film featuring two actors that I love and respect can not be all bad. And in this sense, I was right - given that they managed to get the dialogue they received, both of them function quite well. It's not good enough for the film to stop, but understand, but pretty good that I managed to overcome 75 minutes of the film (and that's the main symptom of the horror film: when, in 40 minutes, you're praying for it's over. <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start with the problems in "Taboo." The dialogue as mentioned is terrifying, wooden and completely unnatural, and ice-cold Jones acting is unbelievably bad and because he's the figure we spend most time around the house, it's an unforgivable defect It does not seem to be so meaningful when it's so clich√© that it's completely predictable (literally, none of the main "twists" in this film will surprise anyone except the toddler). aside, the director tries too hard with too little success, unpleasant viewing of shots and nervous work with a camera that scatters out of what has a small element of the story. <br /> <br /> Three of the stars of the movie are awarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson and the last one is worthy of the fact that one of the jokes me a little snigger. I would never have given this film to anyone under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
