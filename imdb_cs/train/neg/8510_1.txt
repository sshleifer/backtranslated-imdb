When we were in junior high school, some of us boys would sometimes leave the dead. It was considered fun. But the producers, directors and the cast of "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they are STILL preparing them. Just like the previous reviewer who was interested in whether the cast would try to get out of the set and home, I doubt that more than one was made for some of the scenes. Mira Sorvino, hot in "Mighty Aphrodite" rated films, seemed to have succumbed to this project. Her acting does not exist, it is mainly confined to sad views that should indicate how "sensitive" it is to the situation of the various victims of the film. But let me warn you - do not be another victim! If you are on DVD, get off the DVD. There are not many good Mira footphots (the only high points I would find in the film) and the support cast is of poor quality, and it brings mishmash of a badly conducted dialogue with embarrassing "Spanish" accents worthy of the best middle school theater production.
