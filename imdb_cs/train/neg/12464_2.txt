This movie, probably a thriller, had about five sub-parcels that developed simultaneously to culminate at the end, but eventually it ended more like a yawn. The writing was trite, the pace was slow and disjointed, and the characters were boring. George Clooney seems to need to get to the gym, Matt Damon did it, and others probably read a line from the teleprompter. The worst part of the film was that it was carefully created to be politically correct, and so nothing ultimately says about big trade, oil and the Middle East. I have seen documentaries that provide more excitement. Watch it only when there is nothing else to do.
