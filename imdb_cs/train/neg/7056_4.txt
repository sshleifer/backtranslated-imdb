This movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can be terribly wrong. I really expected at least something from this movie after I saw it was funny like hell, but the movie was not half as good. The strange part is that jokes are really funny, spoofs smoking bans, Jo Bole ... etc are really good jokes, but I do not know who the movie flop could blame. The main candidates can be: - 1) hammers and hammeresses (actresses) and even funny kind 2) director 3) guy who casts actresses and / or director Anyway, if you really are really bored and I really do see this movie, or get a copy of every ad or show of this movie and laugh your ass, because you will be much more fun than the movie. ps only austerity of this film is mahesh manjrekar and funny chappu bhai
