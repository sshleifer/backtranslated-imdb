Nobody but anyone could chew the scenery as Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" is a great example. Although she sometimes plays a part, look at her when she thinks Raliegh writes the lyrics to the song the ladies are waiting for: at that moment, she understood how Elizabeth was able to reign and rule completely! In other words, she is done by the script being sappiness. When Elizabeth must be vulnerable, she'll be weak and crappy. This has the additional effect of undermining its authority: when it blows out its stack and threatens to omit justice, it is difficult to take it seriously. Flynn radiates the spell and realizes how Essex can make his way to Elizabeth's heart, but he is utterly incomprehensible when he tells the complexity and the utter evil of man. It will also not help that Essex is badly enrolled. Why is this hot head who wants to overthrow her queen - even if she swears faithfulness - except that it is more bloody and therefore "good" rule? And why Raliegh betrays Elizabeth by capturing her with Essex's letters? There is no risk of falling out of favor, and we know where Essex (and his head) is heading. So why risk your own head by speeding up the inevitable? What did Curtiz do with all the $ he had received? He does not even bother trying to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on the sound stage. He had to end her with Elizabeth for the first time alone at the tower; everything that follows (especially the last scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. Costumes are fantastic. And is it me, or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
