This budget starving the Italian action / sci-fi hybrid includes David Warbeck as Miami reporter who chose the ghosts of Atlantis (!) To stop the evil trader (John Ireland's Oscar nominee) from using the telepathic fetus of an adult using asteroid spirits to rule the world. Do you have it all? In spite of such a complicated conspiracy, it's really quite boring, and the ATLANTIS RAIDERS scorn him with contempt. Frankly, the most (intentionally) creative thing on this film is a slight overhaul of the theme of Herbie Hancock BEVERLY HILLS COP for the initial titles. The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a laboratory that is unexplainably displayed twice in the back. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted us to get all the avant-garde in the twilight of his career? I wanted to declare the worst film Ireland on his biography, but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS were listed there. I would also like to say safely that I am probably the only person in the history of the world who makes the double feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
