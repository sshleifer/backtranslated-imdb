Interestingly, the novel without a conspiracy has become the basis for two films. While the heiress was a good, if not completely accurate, adaptation, Washington Square is hard and wrong, except for Dr. Sloca, a movie that could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Director's attempts to create "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I really took it. She has no underestimated and simple beauty that a movie can have without stories like Onegin. I agree with other remarks that Leigh introduced Catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy; she forced me not to feel it. Catherine's transition from childhood trust to adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, was internalized as well as in the novel. But we do not have the advantage of a narrative voice that tells us that in the movie! I think somebody missed the adaptation class in movies. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempts to create a moving and beautiful movie from the difficult text, but it just did not work.
