Usually I'm a bit of a fan of the 1980s and early 1990s, but now this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was a real test of perseverance that sat down. Boys dressing as girls were death-but never so pathetic. Corey Haim's performance was as unusual as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. It has no redemption even if you are a fan of acting / actress in this piece of waste - stay away!
