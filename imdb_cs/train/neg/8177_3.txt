90 minutes from Mindy ... Mindy is a crazy boyfriend Bill ... Mindy's pranks in high school dance ... Mindy a hitchhiker to Big Sur, shoplifts a loaf of "pastoral bread," Mindy almost gets a gang-rape .. "Oh, You have to remember that these films have never been designed to be watched on DVD players, made like a 90-minute atmosphere, so teens from the 70s would have soundtracks as they got it in their Pintos and Citations Insufficient stimulation and structure did not matter to the original audience - they were probably just tuned in when the T & A screen coincided with what was happening in the parking lot, the film is really irritating when viewed as a story It's much more fun to talk about my favorite infertility: 1) Bill and his friend are accompanying teachers to find Mindy.Without luggage or lingerie, spend 2 nights sharing motels room with a teacher, just like in real life. 2) After nearly abduction and rape of the missing cyclists after their innocent friend "Pan" is savagely beaten, Mindy and her friend find a bike on the road unattended. Mindy immediately brightens and whispers, "I'm going to Big Sur!" But again, it is much more fun to talk / read than to sit down.
