I like this show! I think it was nothing wrong with that! Only Spidey will not hurt anyone, but only because the show can not! Some people just think that this show is bad about it. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared as X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Bad Sandman will never appear, but I like it! Best Spidey show ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. Alien Costum 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really really bad like Rocket Racer and The Place, which was unpleasant to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. The first Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And it irritates me that he is almost the second villain in Season 2. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! He was terrible! I'd rather see Sandman! His last performance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey like a human spider! But I think all this was wrong!
