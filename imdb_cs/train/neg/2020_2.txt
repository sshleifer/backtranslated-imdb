It looks like two movies: one terrible, demanding, lengthy saga about an actor taken from the parts he plays; the second brilliant social note about divorce in the middle age, which is picked up by the waitress. Shelley Winters is awesome as a waitress with another activity on the side. There is a heavy hint of the need for a connection, a massage certificate and her desire to enter the modeling game. I like the glimpse of her distracted apartment with the kitchen corner behind the curtain, and her horrible seductive outfit with the deep-rooted hook tip revealing. Although the actors get the Oscars for Shakespeare? We know the Oscars to portray people with disabilities, wear a lot of prosthetics or pretend to be mad. The Shakespearean scenes (which go ON and ON) are embarrassing and dated. And they're also "crazy" scenes where Tony looks scattered while listening to his own voice. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not an aristocrat. In the early stage, it is clear that he was a chorus. When he cites the advice of his father, he slides into Cockney's accent.
