My words fail. <br /> <br /> And that's not normal. <br /> <br /> Correctly done it could be a great, funny spoof of B-movie sci-fi, but unfortunately it was not. Rarely in the field of drama so many competent actors so vainly fought with such dogs - the breakfast of the screenplay. I can only agree with the comments of the previous reviewer - clean the bathroom. In fact, EVERYONE is NOT watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Positive: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negatives: Everything else. <br /> <br /> The most appropriate line: "It's not going anywhere." <br /> <br /> If such a fate could only meet with every plastic surgeon.
