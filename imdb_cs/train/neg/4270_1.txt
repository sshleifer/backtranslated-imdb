This is another typical incredible and non-sensual piece of the Hollywood dragon. Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a suit, convinced me he was better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual sticker and does little to make a convincing sacrifice. Every scene in this peripetize is completely predictable until the end of Kurt's pulling Ray with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. Kurt and Madeline then make their compulsory end of the movie and everyone - except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta is going back and threatening the couple again. , of course, and Russell trained him ten times with his 9mm, which was NOT needed. This movie could end up with the bludgeoning scene as well - except Hollywood dotes to unnecessary violence, and the more they can add or "improve" the more slobbery they get.
