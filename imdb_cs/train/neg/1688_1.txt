What is a filthy movie? I do not understand what people find terrible about "The Grudge". The director plays one trick (I must admit it is very good that it is stylized live) and then repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a result, I was surprised several times in the first quarter of the film, but as soon as I knew I had practically missed the exercise because The Grudge was becoming more predictable in a minute. Finally, I can say that there are much better movies in the genre that the so-called precursor "Ring" is more scary and that buying the "The Grudge" ticket is a waste of money.
