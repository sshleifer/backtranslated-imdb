Why me? Why should I be subjected to such a defeat of what could make an interesting plot? At least if I can warn other people, it will be useful. I had to watch this horrible movie on the dorm. Otherwise, I would look at the synopsis on the back of things and follow it clearly. The film was slow, PAINFULLY had a small character of development and focused on the idea that a spooky white man might be fine when he was hanging out with a black man's LA style. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note, however, that this film does not exclude what we thought was a "LA lifestyle", it's a wonderful example of the products that come out of it.
