I do not see enough television games to understand the attraction SHOW ME WOMAN, but I think she has a challenge for an undemanding audience. The seemingly quiz show, offers contestants huge sums of money to answer a few simple questions. His quizzes, however, only play a small role in management, which I find complicated. For example, before answering a question, the competitor chooses which question should be chosen from the selection of random "A", "B" or "C". Does it serve a purpose other than slowing the game? It would be much faster to simply start with "A." Competitors can submit questions but must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering the question, the contestant is asked to block the answer - another delayed tactic. Another task of the competition is to name a woman of about ten go-go dancers in cages to reveal a card indicating how much the question is. The correct answer adds the card's dollar number to the total number of contestants; the wrong answer subtracts the same amount. This time-consuming step has in fact a certain value of entertainment, as it allows viewers to look closer at swirly-dressed and uniformly gorgeous dancers. Meanwhile, the contestant recalls that the unfortunate selection of the "murder card" immediately terminates the game. This, of course, casts doubt on the competitor and causes further delay, as the nervous competitor considers the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of a sudden disaster is a major opportunity for the audience. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the process slows even more with a lot of empty skin between host William Shatner and the competitor, along with the occasional routine of dancing cages. All these delays burn enough time so that viewers can forget what the original question is when the correct answer is revealed. A typical 30-minute episode of JEOPARDS often goes through up to 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of the SMTM I watched went through only six questions (many of which related to other TV shows). No one in their true mind will watch this show because it's fun to play the answers to questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons why you look at the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how the contestant responds to being on the brink of winning up to $ 1 million, just lose everything in one shot. <br /> <br /> B. Look at gorgeous young women who perform sexually suggestive dance routines. <br /> <br /> C. Enjoy the screening of William Shatner's teasing. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B," but women are not on the camera long enough to justify suffering over an hour of this show.
