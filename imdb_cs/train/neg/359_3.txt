I have seen my fair share of poorly thought out lands and finishes in movies, but I do not remember a movie that has committed total suicide like this one. The filmmakers clearly hoped that the big turn would "surprise" us all ... and it was, but perhaps not as the directors hoped. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw are dealing with this step individually or collectively. The film up to the last thirty minutes was rather nice and I like the way the story unfolds and the nature of the film overall. But once the intervention, holes and inconsistency of the plot were remarkable, the grounding motive for revenge was misplaced, and the ways Bobby Earl had so neatly resolved were ridiculously distant. What's worse is that once the procedure has occurred, the rest of the movie has become unbearably predictable. Harris gave a terrific performance, and Connery is like Morgan Freeman because he never performs poorly, even though the movie is not so great! Overall, it is starting well and developing keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable dives in cinema history.
