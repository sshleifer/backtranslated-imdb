Feh. This movie began in an interesting way, but quickly got from confusing to boring. The confused parts were mostly at the beginning where the scenes are shot so much that it's hard to tell what's going on in the first twenty minutes or so. Boring comes later, with warm romance between two living people (cats both). The courageous spirit of a dead girl is actually the liveliest person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the cast was up to its caliber, the movie could be better. Maybe. Because the story is really interesting for a moment because it seems that the mad priestess of the mother of a dead sixteen-year-old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead with a decidedly unfortunate side effect that all the other dead people will come back Also take a solid human form and most likely, you will start killing everyone. Some type of Japanese mystical night about living dead type. But it did not happen. Although this hairy, unruly priest with a small basket attached to his head tells uninteresting young people that this will happen if the priestess finishes his ritual, he does it and the only dead person to manifest is her daughter. No mass rise of the dead, no foot soldiers of corpses, nothing. The priest only makes the ghost of the girl back to the land of the dead, taking the empty taste of a friend with her crushing spine like a crispy peanut (at that moment I was tempted to lighten loudly because this idiot went to kiss and loved the girl DEAD, ewwww! !!). Robitussen's tolerant, unmanned best friend has a long, introspective shot when he leaves the village for the last time, and that's all. No real horror, no real craze that the Japanese usually do much better than American movie makers, with the emphasis on enthusiastic make-up of cheese, without mimis screaming. I was very disappointed.
