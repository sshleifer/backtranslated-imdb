Many months ago, when I was seven years old, I can vaguely remember that I saw a trailer for this film. It seemed to me naive educational curiosity, and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this film. They are wise adults who are, they said to me, "Absolutely not, it's a lot of waste." Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first child on my block to see "The incredible melting of a man." Less time has passed - perhaps a few days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment has vanished. Twenty-five years have passed until they come back to the forefront of their thoughts. When surfing through channels on a digital cable, I found this long lost movie memory. My curiosity was piqued and I decided to finally look at this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. "Incredible Melting Man" is perhaps the worst film known to man. The movie "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" look like an Oscar nominee. I feel violated by having lost nearly two hours of my life when I was watching this dirty dirt. brutal even for 1977. As someone convinced the film company to produce this film for me. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as I did. Listen to your parents if they banned you from watching this movie. They were right.
