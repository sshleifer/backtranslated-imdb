I think I agree that many comments must be fake. Even if the film is not necessarily bad, it is definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a Spiritual movie with the premise of your spirits and the bad emotions that chase you. The film starts with two stories that are loosely linked and are not even linked later. A couple lose their child in the bed. They move into a country house to escape their past and guess what ... the house is terribly haunted. From there Dark Remains start very slowly with some scary moments (The first ghost spirits are nice and the sequence of the flashlight also worked very well). OK, then ... The woman sees the spirit of her daughter, other spirits of people die in accidents or suicides appear, the man tries to solve the secrets of the past houses, the woman is depressed, strange neighbors appear. Her almost all were there, but the assumption that they are their own emotions is nice, so wait for them to spin. There is no intervention, you are just confused by the spooky story of the house's history, a strange neighbor, a totally useless spooky prison, and a dead daughter worthy of a photo shoot that reminds me of a lot of "shutter." The end is ridiculous, because when you start and end the movie, this slow and piano music is pretty nice to contain piles of ghosts at once that look like zombies, of course just to return to slow stimulation and piano music. <br /> <br /> If you want to ... Dark Remains could be a nice story of a spooky spirit if the script did not try to go everywhere and come in nowhere. Many stories have collapsed together, which simply does not make any sense and contradiction in the basic atmosphere of the film. And besides ... please, never use abandoned prisons again. It is so worn out, and in this case it does not make any sense at all. "Hey, there's a scary prison in the hill, let's shoot there." I think a lot of ingredients in Dark Remains were mixed into a mix like this.
