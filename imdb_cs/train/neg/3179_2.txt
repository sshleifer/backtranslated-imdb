I saw this film happening yesterday at the cinema. I had some hope for the movie because I really like Spoorloos and his book. The movie is getting okay because it seems to be a thriller first. Fast, even if the movie becomes messy with uninteresting phrases, characters that are never exhausted and no one in the audience is interested (like Marjoke) and horrible editing. The film is lost to black bits that are just too long, a chaotic chronological jump that jumps back and forth, and lots of scenes that add nothing to the story and could easily be released. After suffering the story, you get to one of the worst endings I've ever seen. We should also mention that the film has a lot of explicit sexual scenes that you are likely to be accustomed to when watching a lot of Dutch films. It's hard to mention some good stuff about this movie. About a third of the audience has already left the theater in the middle of the film, and after the end of the film, I have heard no good words. Avoid this movie at any cost. it really destroyed the belief I left in the Dutch film industry.
