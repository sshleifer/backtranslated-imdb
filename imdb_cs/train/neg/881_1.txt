Thanks to some notorious home video distributor who brought the so-called German independent series, four behind Venice are not just terrible but really terrible. So terribly I got it out of the second hand goods store for extra cash. Nick and Charlotte are married couples who have only reached agreement on sex on Tuesday because of their hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis are pairs of hand-to-mouth, where Eve works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eve to lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair between Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eve by lying to her that she was going to London to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is that he is flying to Venice and Charlotte for adultery. Eve kidnapped Nicka and dragged her two children to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends with both Nick and Eve falling down. The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eve marks the failure of the comedy. It looks not only absurd but also appealing. In the movie, Nick tries to find help in several ways, but eventually ends without success. It's either strangers around him who behave like fools, or they're just stupid. The comedy also tended to add unnecessary scenes to prolong the story. While some issues that can be solved by common sense, nobody in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They'd rather go through one big circle to solve the problem. It will not be so bad that even the beautiful scenery in Venice did not lose the reputation of the film.
