Every so often, there is a movie that knocks me down and reminds me that my taste in the movies I'm trying to watch is not always perfect. Normally I would stay away from such things, but I was undermined by some shining reviews and pedigree Rohmere. There is an introductory and fascinating novelty for production where Rohmer basically transforms actors into the painted (digital) back-drops of the revolution of the era of France. This quickly drops and becomes as interesting as observing the dry color on the color number scene. What we have left behind is a boring and exhausted film about a nobleman in the 18th century in France. None of the characters are attractive or compassionate. The pace is so scarce, the dialogue is so demanding, and the tension for Rohmer is clearly a strange concept that I did not care that his head was rolling, who was hiding who or what the devil would be about the revolution. The film would greatly benefit from some appearance of emotional growth and musical score (at the end there is some fine classical music). Despite being so "talky", the film plays more like a silent film and the worst kind of film, a boring and uninteresting film about endlessly interesting themes. Only the most popular French historians will find anything from this movie because it seems that the batch carries out well-known events from a new angle (Lady is English and royalist). Otherwise, avoid this yawn at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia (I have frozen twice).
