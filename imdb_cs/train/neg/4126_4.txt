Absolutely nothing happens in this famous, unpleasant, hopeless thriller, directed by Amenabar's usual collaborator, Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow deals with boredom and excitement, does not actually provide and seems like a practice in boredom. The only slightly thrilling moment is the climax of the movie, which takes about 30 seconds for 100 minutes, and is resolved too simply. The story lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary, and each rendering device or twisting is the result of external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without causing him to show any initiative or ingenuity. If you are a fan of the genre, look at the "Tesis" site.
