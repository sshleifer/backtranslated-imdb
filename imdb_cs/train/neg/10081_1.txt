I have read some comments on this movie and I can only assume that some people easily enjoy it. This movie is nothing. It's so badly written, controlled, and it's hardly an impression. Characters speak in a clickable dialog, and situations are unlikely. While it can do this camp and entertainment, it's not, because everything is so lifeless, the film is boring. It's as if Lee Rose has decided to write a drama about women who face her sexuality, but it was not even allowed by studio shouts to bring the story to life or to have no cohorts. This movie could be in the encyclopedia as a bad TV series biography.
