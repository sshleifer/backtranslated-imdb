I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all the icons in their own way. However, the wreck train, which was Suzy Parker, destroyed the whole experience for me. Her acting was so horrible I was sitting there with an open jaw, unbelieving my eyes and ears. I could barely see it, it's so terrible she's in it. Cary? Beautiful and gently dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, cute and of course ball. Supportive cast is fine and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its amazing, retro elegance. Then you can see that Suzy Parker has been trying to speak with her lines with wood, deadness, lethargy that just defies faith. Who told this creature that ACT could? Oy VEY, people.
