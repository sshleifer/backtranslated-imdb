Vampire cyclists rule the world and use blood as a man as fuel, but it will mean shifting power through renaissance android (Kris Kristofferson) and warrior (Kathly Long) when they oppose Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (who plays cyborg in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions that this terrible film left unanswered, is the worst Who is the idea that Kris Kristofferson countryman would interpret as a cyborg warrior who can give so much, No, do not make me sick that I saw Kristofferson as vigilance or something, but not like a cyborg. Particular suspicion is that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren had to have the wisdom to not do it. However, despite the disastrous casting, Kristofferson is the most enjoyable film. He gives the performance much more human than the insignificant Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays Robot) Despite miskasting, Kristofferson provides just a few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is forgiving and Gary Daniels is useless, but basically the knights are incomprehensible failure. You stand in horror and wonder who the hell thinks it's even a good idea on paper. (This is a movie where the broken Kristofferson battles with the robots in the backpack) The worst of all ends in what if the sequel, fortunately it still has to be done, although I still have nightmares about the likelihood of such an event. br /> <br /> * of 4- (bad)
