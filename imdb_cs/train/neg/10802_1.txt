Let me make a short film from the summer season: A rotten, gross boy named Max is struggling with a radio that includes Kazaam: an assault demon. Like all geniuses, he gives him three wishes, but as a good character he also helps Max with his personal life because he has to deal with bullying and fathers infested with organized crime. During all this, Kazaam turns from time to time whistling (also showing Shaq's modest rap ability). This film proves what we all know: Athletes have to keep up with the sport. I admit it never seemed like an Oscar movie, but ALL about this loss of film is terrible. Characters are either indestructible or stupid, it's not a plot, dialogue is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of a problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this movie would be a joke. I know the film just drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big at that time (without a pun). I honestly can not realize one positive thing that could say about this waste of time. Shaq should give time for this film to be a free throw practice.
