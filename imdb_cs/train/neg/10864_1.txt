The reason I wanted to give this film a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and hope to appreciate the Indian cinema. All I've ever seen is a few older films from S.Ray. By browsing IMDb I came across this and after seeing the 8.7 rating, I came to the conclusion that it must be the one that opens the door of the unknown and brings artistic pleasure. Oh, how bad I am! The only logical explanation for this 8.7 rating is that most of the 970 people who voted are Indians, and Adam Sandler's only risk outside of Bolliwood's production. <br /> <br /> This film will be ranked 9th at IMDb List of 250 Best Movies on Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I really do not have the mood to rate and criticize, because nothing that I think is appropriate remembers this painful experience. My only hope is that there are a lot of Hindus who find me this film as they are - just stupid, with lots of kits and cheese music.
