Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this well-thought out, but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau), who is trying to combine his scientific niece (Ryan) with a common guy Tim Robbins to rest her in the 1950s and enjoy life. To make Ryan look like Robbins, Einstein is trying to make Robbins look like a great scientist. The idea is cute, but the film becomes flat with dirty situations and a silly conversation. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and an amazingly supported actress are doing everything to make this stupid comedy over the water but unable to save the film. Her unhappiness that such talent has made such a faint film. I would not recommend anyone unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan.
