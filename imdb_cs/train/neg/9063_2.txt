The fact that most of the budget for this probably went to the list of heavy casts should not have been meant if it was staged with a touch and imagination and some sympathy for the original satirical intention. Instead, we get poorly bad song and dance sequences with picturesque beggars and bulls and the final theft is done by pulling back to show that the action took place on the music scene, which is well suited for production that is more of Lionel 'Oliver 'Blair than Brecht. Actor's talent is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good, but they do not have to do much: Migenes at least have a great voice and a certain sense of material. Julia looks perfect like Mack, but she struggles with the character, screamed from a fake plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is awkward and Polly is unhappy. The adaptation of texts, scripts, and music is often unpleasant: it was a bad step to set up a film on Mark Blitzstein's Broadway expedition, but at least his words were singing, unlike most of what was interpolated in gestures of fidelity. And trying to overcome the low budget by filming in claustrophobic angles on misty sets, he lit up in lush blues and oranges, as if a bargaining basement Vittorio Storaro had completely failed - the film just looks cheap, dirty and thoughtless. Shamefully.
