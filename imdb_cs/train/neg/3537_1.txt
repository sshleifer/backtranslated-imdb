It was convincing that it does not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that most people probably remember. It's from the usual suspects of course in relation to Kaiser Gold .. I think Sose .. I have another one like this: -The saddest trick the director sometimes pulled out trying to convince the audience he actually had a story - this movie is one of the saddest films I've long seen. It starts so well, with really fantastic cinematography, a great actor and a very smart premise. But unfortunately, the only way this film is directed is self-destruction. And it does so, not just a stroke, but with ugly little wrists. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here, which are surprised to find a way to explain this donut. With enough booze in my brain, I would probably be able to explain the very existence of humanity very likely. I saw and read about a dozen entirely different ways people explained it. And it differs from the story that somebody encounters in the head, playing chess with himself, except that the criminals play their enemies to resemble chess games. And that's all fun. But at the same time it is a painful determination that this story is terribly wrong. And besides, it's a blunt ripping off of movies and books like "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, the usual suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle." It's a spectacular robbery. <br /> <br /> What in this movie eventually happened is that the plot turns like a fast drunk bum If this movie was on a roller coaster, it would crash the attraction beside her shorty after the start.This is so many twists in this movie that will never be solved , that if it was a cocktail, you would need a stock of hurl-buckets to work on nausea after drinking it's nothing explained, and when you finally get a little bit in the direction you think you're going, you've gotten to another. , that this story was not going anywhere on the paper, and Ritchie had to think it was amazing to make a film of him as well as David Lynch or something or 1/10 f or totally break his own job (Ritchy: look for professional help). it could be easy a state of jewel, becomes an artwork, a pseudo-intellectual food that will be held on Sunday afternoon debating clubs. <br /> <br /> Replace your soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
