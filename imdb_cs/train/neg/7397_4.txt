I have seen this movie on various short film festivals and I always have the impression that I have seen a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> The school movie is very well produced and directed, but the story ... but he needed something else to be a bigger and more interesting film. The character called Tim Watcher needed some in-dept access. This is something he lacks in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (Congratulations!)
