Vodka Lemon is a charming but extremely uneven Arminic film that some enjoy and bore others. Despite the fact that the film is quite well done, it lacks real "zing" and relies on many scenes that will become a common viewer of the audience. The film contains several moments of pure cinematic brilliance, unfortunately deserves a film that is worthy of their genius. Dark comedy is too dark and light is a serious drama, so vodka Lemon leaves many opinions disoriented and eventually dissatisfied. You can laugh, but these moments will be very little and far between the sea of ​​empty snowy landscapes and the seemingly endless range of bus rides. A noble effort that eventually went through a lack of narrative coherence.
