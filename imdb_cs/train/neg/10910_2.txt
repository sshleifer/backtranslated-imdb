I have seen an interview with Rob Schneider (who plays the main character in this film, Marvin Mange). He said he wanted to emphasize the physical comedy here so much that if you had the volume switched off you laugh in this movie. Obviously, it must be a secret. I had a loud voice. Actually, I listened to this thing, and I thought it was a disaster and completely unfortunate - the main disappointment after Schneider's merry performance in "Deuce Bigalow, Man Gigolo." The story is stupid: Mange is losing control of his "animal instincts," which he thinks of as a policeman who, after a crash, is filled with crazy scientific type by the appropriate name of Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton). "It makes him a" supercop ", he can smell medicine hidden in body cavities and overtaking horses, of course he has a frantic habit of eating cows and trying to seduce his tits, but is it a small price to pay? It does not do anything to me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> in the inexplicably popular TV series Scrubs.) I was anxious to look at Colleen Haskell's first "serious" actor's work (can it be called "serious?") .Of course, she won her glory as the first Survivor contestant, what we knew: it's as cute as a button, and what he does not know is that he has a remarkable talent actress, and what about Ed Asner like Police Chief Wilson, I mean how old this guy is, the size of some Mange cows who tried to eat, and he seemed to be breathing the whole way. I'm surprised he shot it. There is a short story at the end of Adam Sandler (who also served as executive producer of this.) Anyway, I laughed twice: Mange playing with his whistle toy in a police car, and the Schneider scene with Haskell and the orangutan - the orangutan has more actor talent! So for two sighs - 2/10.
