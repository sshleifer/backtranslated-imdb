I missed this movie in the cinema, but I had some idea in the back of my head that it's worth seeing, so when I saw it on the DVD shelves, I thought it was time to "watch." Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey, certainly one of the worst movies ever. Incomprehensible land is poorly delivered and misrepresented. Perhaps it would be much more meaningful if I read Robbins' novel, but if the film is not altogether different from a novel, and when Robbins helps the screenplay, I doubt the novel will also have to be unbearable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> Save about 98 minutes of your life for something more useful, such as trimming your nail or sorting out your drawer Even if you see it in a "under $ 5" bin at your local store, hold on to the urge !
