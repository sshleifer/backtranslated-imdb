I saw it by chance in one lazy summer afternoon. He plays the HBO Family Channel. At first I was attracted to what I thought was Disney animation. But after a few minutes I found out that I was looking for a remote so I could find "INFO BUTTER" to find out what the world is on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy it in many movies, but one thing he is not is a voice artist. Sure he has one of several unique voices in Hollywood, but works only as part of a larger visual package. Connecting his voice to the cute duck looked somewhat difficult. As for the rest of the cast, not inspirational. I think the work on this film does not really relate to a good voice over talent. <br /> <br /> So weak voice talent, strong animation ... who was this movie focused? Homosexual teen ducks? I do not get it. Is there really such a lack of role models for young up and coming gay men that we have to resort to animated ducks? A cute story, and as a title, I loved this movie, like a ugly duckling.
