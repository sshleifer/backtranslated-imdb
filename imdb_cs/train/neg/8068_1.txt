I did not have a huge expectation for this movie for renting $ 1 in a video rental shop, but the box at least showed a small promise with a "murderous cut" of "more sex!" He can not go wrong! Well ... it's not necessary to say that the box is a scam. How in the snakes, actresses and actresses of this caliber have made the picture so low? Everything opens with the drunken drunk of a college girl out of a house or some other building and tells her to her friend (?) When she watches her camera on a bad steadicam. Then she is chasing a bastard in a clear plastic mask and grabbing another. They shoot their wrist for no real reason and you can see when they "cut" her that someone has drawn clippings with what looks like a crayon. From there, repeat the same theme girl hunting / killing the two guys for another 84 minutes. Add one frame. That's Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have a problem with this movie if the box did not make me rent a movie. If I borrow a bad movie that claims she has more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! One complete front shot in 85 minutes from the chickens, which is obviously androginous and gore, that does not fear the baby does not cut it. If it's Killer Cut, what is the Divine Cut ?! Of course, I doubt that this waste was actually put into the theaters. Damage to actors in this movie. I saw how the debut screens were doing here because they had not done anything before, but before they were released, they were all set up. I do not know if it was shot before they were all set up, and the studio was sitting on the movie until they were half-big names or not. But what I want to know is ... that they actually spent $ 14 million on this movie ?!
