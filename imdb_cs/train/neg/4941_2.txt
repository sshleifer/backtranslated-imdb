I actually did not mind the ads on Geico the first 50 of those times I've seen and even found them a little fragile and fun, but I GIVE YOU! Is this the best thing these people could come up with?!? This show is upset! It's unsettled and feels like watching an episode of "The Office" with characters masked like a cave (I know a lot of you hate me for saying it, but "Office" just does not do it for me). Okay, I'll get it: we have poor slob, we just try to keep our nose clean and have a dirty boss who hates him; a pseudo-intellectual who really has a barely functioning intellect; and the one who just wants to be accepted, but WHAT! I worked with these people, and in real life I was as annoying as I on TV ... why would I want to lose another 1 / 336th week to watch more of the nominees? Please call your parents to ask if they have dropped you, if you think about it, you are still sorry that you believe it is fun.
