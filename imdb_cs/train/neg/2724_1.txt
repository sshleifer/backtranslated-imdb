I would like to say that, unlike many people who did not like this movie and found it impossible to understand, I am fully able to understand what it is. A very incoherent attempt at plotting. <br /> <br /> I do not like this word, but in this case it fits very well. The director first presents the material in an extremely "arrogant" way and worse, extremely inconsistent. It's incoherent by presenting the material in an orderly order, so we think the director was too drunk to remember which scenes are the first and arrogant in that we expect the viewer in CARE to finish it in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story about more than a real world that is not connected with real life). But there is nothing unreal about putting the story in modern modern times and the modern environment of today's country, which is most important that it can not engage audiences, but in addition to a simply excluded series of unlikely events. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this movie is like viewing the story; maybe even a very good story, because it was based on a book, but be frustrated by the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the moments needed and brings together all the means of cohesion. stylistic cinema. Compare this with Gaspar Noem "Seul contre tous". He gave us a coherent, extremely intriguing and intellectually deep story. This film does not offer any intellectual study, and while it's very stylish in its fragmented presentation, the director eventually abandoned the basic art of good narration, and everything that remains to us is a mess of unlikely events. <br /> <br /> Yes, it really is possible to make sense ... to POINT. But as I said before, the audience reaches a stage where they simply say, "Who cares about it." It plays like watching the stupid story of a person who goes to a supermarket and buys food in a non-orderly order. Even in murders, it's totally uninteresting and uninterested. Too many people these days give high marks to something they can not understand and they just do not make sense because of fear of stupidity and in any case TRIES to make the viewer look silly. <br /> <br /> You have too much time on your hands, then look at this movie, taking into account what I said about it. It's a story based on a book that could be presented much more effectively, and that's my argument.
