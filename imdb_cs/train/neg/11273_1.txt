How can you collect this serious cast of young British actors and come up with such a pile of film dung? A horrible script, an unpleasantly hectic camera, amazingly modified, is terribly wrong. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fulfill his role of life. Another painful proof that "different" sometimes equals "load". Why money can not read scripts in advance? Make a favor: save yourself and do something else - like kissing your knee. It's less painful and fun than this movie!
