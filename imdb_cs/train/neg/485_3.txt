When I saw a preview, I thought: This will be a great movie. And it could really be. The actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of filming is undeniable. Dialogues, however, contain a dark shadow throughout the image. The level of the language was too familiar and too contemporary for the action that took place in 1610, and removed most of the movie's spells. But I have to congratulate the translators because the English subtitles were more sophisticated and more sophisticated than the original French hints, and it probably explains the good ratings that the film got on imbd!
