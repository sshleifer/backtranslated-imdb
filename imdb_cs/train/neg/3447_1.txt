It's simply one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It is not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot of the plot. This movie is terribly slow and I was bored almost all 98 minutes. While acting is at best media, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and fruitless without the actual direction. Occasionally, a spooky mood happens only to be broken by any unnecessary line or event. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and thrown between the shots, but eventually they had to try to spend a terrible script. As a huge fan of good horror films, I'm always irritated that something like that will happen. Save 98 minutes and never come back.
