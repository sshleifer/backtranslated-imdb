I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. Based on the novel by sci-fi writer Brian Aldiss, this film attempts to tell the story about Tom and Barry Howe, twin couples who are stripped of their family by an impresario to create a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately gimmicky, the movie is too smart for half (if you forgive the game). By mixing genres, styles and mood, directors (whose previous film was an excellent film Lost In La Mancha) have lost their way quite quickly. I was never sure whether they wanted to take me seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream sequences, it was just a little too much. Moreover, the promised rock role just did not move me. He reminded me a little too much at the time of Hedwig and Angry Inch, a movie I found original and moving. But in this case, the songs were not as good or sympathetic to the main characters. A more disadvantageous comparison would be the disappointment of Velvet Goldmine.
