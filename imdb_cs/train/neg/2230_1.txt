If you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert, beat a few crazy Mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hour, then it's the film for you. if not, then choose another DVD from the 20c basket, which is the only place in which this movie belongs. acting was so bad that I had to force myself to follow it all the way. The packaging looks so cool, but it's just another cheap, b-gangster film in the shape of 2 g and a key, a bloody streetz and a threat. I do not buy or I will not go to this movie unless you plan to stonely, and plotting, editing and playing really does not matter to you. this is really the worst film in human history !!!
