After the first one, you think the brothers out of the way can come up with new jokes. Though I do not think so. If the first one was not bad enough, it's so bad that it hurts to watch. With all the actors you have in this movie, you think they could come up with something a little smarter. Although they could not, they had to take all the same funny, not funny jokes from the first, and somehow put them in this movie because they thought people would laugh at it again. Though it is, I think it's the first time. They tried to make these films parody, although they failed at every level. In most cases, they are just randomly placed jokes that are so nasty and nasty that it's hard to watch and enjoy it. Then, when trying to make scenes that are movie parodies, it will end 20 minutes of fun scene with a possible joke throughout the scene. Also, for people who say it's not for an older and real young audience, it will fit well into the age category to make it funny. While people say that different people have different ideas about what is funny or not, if you find this funny, then you probably are not one of the more mature or intelligent people in the neighborhood. It does not require so much skill to write a kind of script, though if you want a smarter and more entertaining movie, check out Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that is really good and well done and does not require disgusting and unfortunate jokes to make it fun too.
