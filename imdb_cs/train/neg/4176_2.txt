Perhaps I missed a meeting when the meaning of "B-Movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good view of this film? Take the Aliens, replace the vampire xenomorphs and then remove everything that's good about it, and that's it. 5 minutes into the movie "V-SAN squad" (this is the stupidest abbreviation I've ever heard) checks the "base" that vampires massacre and then fall down (DOWN? What?) The ladder apparently attached to the billboard with the obvious today's train in the background . When is this to take place? 2210. Well ... (hold on, get back to it) <br /> <br /> Yeah. characters. Wow, there's so much a lesbian Asian chick, cowboy, redhead, weathered captain, ready-made goth treasurer, and part-time cashier and witty noob as commander. Everyone plays their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. I almost hurt when I saw Micheal Ironside in this movie. Is not enough money like Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? Quite the only thing that's original about Vampire Wars is about how bad it is. When I watched this late birth of the film, the only amusement I got was the poor set-making attempts. Since when do the PCI card cassettes on the wall count as a ready room on a space ship? The money needed for this film could be much better spent.
