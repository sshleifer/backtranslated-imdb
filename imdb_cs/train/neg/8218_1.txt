I've never finished this movie for some reason, it's terrible, and it's just acting. I was not sure what the film was about not doing much of it, and the violence was terrible. I mean ususally I like some naked in the movie (lol), but it was just sick due to what was happening. All the characters upset me and it was just full of loud screaming and the camera shuddered in parts and looked like a sequel to blair with the project but without good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time, and I would like to please your time. I do not intend to recommend this movie to anyone, nor do I think about it. (N)
