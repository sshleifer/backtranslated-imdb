Over the years, I've seen a lot of these movies right on the Segal video and everyone has the same amount of fun; unfortanetley, the level of fun is low. Sure, the action sequences were fun, but it was to a large extent. Seagal was really in his lead role when he made films; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision (at least on an action stand), but over the last ten years, these types of movies star Segal really do not meet his past. <br /> <br /> The more positive the movie took advantage of the time, like some steps and the use of a joke. Just when the film looked like it just stretched, the pretty cool action scene took her out of the trough. I sincerely believe that more Segal would be better if he were not the only fan in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current films have this known support of actors and actresses, perhaps the film will have more popular results.
