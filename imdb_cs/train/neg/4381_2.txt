Cut into pursuit, it's one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Not that it did not work. There was some decent writing with some elements of the structure out there, good casting, some good acting. I'm not sure where it did, but it was terribly wrong. Some elements could be bad structures and no significant story, much overhead (which is probably much better when it's reticent), bad overhead and editing. I had enough in an hour, I ripped my hair about an hour and a half and an hour, and half a dozen minutes I was upset. There was also uncertainty about this as I went with someone who was a heroin addict. He was excited to be enchanted by something that had nothing good for him. That was supported by a pretty 17-year-old girl who was in love with a 30-year-old addict. And the furious nature of the line was sufficient to turn off. These were attempts at structure, but the end result was seamless and endless (with uneven time lines). The characters were colorful but endless, which made me feel bad for the quality actors you have not seen before. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I supposed it was for the first time directed by a director who was fascinated by his own turds, but he had done it earlier. I'm confused how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who really gives him money.
