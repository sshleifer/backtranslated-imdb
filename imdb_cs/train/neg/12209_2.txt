Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person who chose the film should pay. And if I had never had to pay to see some of the stupid things that took me, I could not resist a free trip to the movies! So I came to see the bullshit as the second movie Conan and NEVER NEVER AGAIN! Now, though it's a poor film, it's fun to watch in the brain-dead way. And technically stunt and camera work is good, so it increases my rating to 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this has virtually no plot, Rambo himself says only about 3 words (except blinkers and screaming), it's useless and totally irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the film is a giant (and stupid) effect. And what special effects IMPORTANT. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo, none has no effect on it and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hit your mark! And while those bad people use AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all Rambo has bow and arrows with what they look like nuclear engines !! The scene where one bad guy shoots him when slowly and calmly releases one of these exploding arrows is especially designed for stupid viewers! It was greatly parodied in the UHF, where the Strange Al played. Plus HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a fun parody of this genre - not just this stupid scene. The whole movie is so stupid and unnecessary, it's almost like a self-parody!
