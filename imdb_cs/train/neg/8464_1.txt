I'm very tolerant of really bad sci-fi and horror films - I've been watching them since I was four or five years old, so I've seen some really bad things, but I'm getting along with it. I've even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies so I do not know what you're expecting - usually a promising film that is not being talked about at all. I hope the eternal sources spring - or a triumph of hope over the experience they say. Unfortunately, it's a dog from the very beginning and I knew it, but like a sea flame I still thought something, something interesting would happen. Not that. All actors give decent performance - because of the script, I do not know how they all held straight faces. It has something to do with the production of collagen-free parasite pests that slowly take over the human race, one body at a time. There is an evil plastic surgeon who works with the enemy by giving them the outer appearance of people ... do not worry, get what comes to him. Slug people do not know where they came from, they think they could go to a meteor who landed on the ground but somehow they know who among them have a blind royal kingdom - a slug princess has managed to behave with a human being , who knows she's a queen of worms and that she loves her ... oh, do I have to go on? Please do not miss 2 hours of your life and watch it ... something would be better ... think of the worst, least pleasant way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than this.
