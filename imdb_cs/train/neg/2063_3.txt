When I heard about how this movie is cheerful, I finally leased it to a video rental shop and laughed three times for 75 minutes. This movie <br /> <br />, a collection of skittles that make fun on TV is <br /> <br /> an incomprehensible disorder. Jokes fall apart, humor deals with questions from the 1970s that are no longer relevant and jokes are too long (almost like new SNL jumps over the past few years.) Yeah, Chevy Chase is in it but about all about 1 or 2 minutes. I think it was very nasty and that nudity was nice, but it could not have been funny. Get yourself a favor and rent the movie Kentucky Fried Movie, which is far away. <br /> <br />
