"Sleeping With The Enemy" is a predictable thriller "here before", which never seems to be an inspiration, no matter how desperate it is and the crew is trying. I can not believe that a lot of my friends talked about seeing me in movies sixteen years ago. The complete lack of originality of the Ronald Bass script (based on the Nancy Price novel) is not to be helped, neither to the unruly direction of Joseph Ruben, or to the very average performance of Julie Roberts. Supporting casts, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, help little. <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say. Just leave it. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
