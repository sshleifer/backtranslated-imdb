This movie was hard to get, and when I finally saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. This is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown person uses the unsuspecting aviation industry and GETS AWAY with millions in redemption without harming anyone or trying to kill. With all this built-in interest, how could one make such a faint, spoken film about this real life event. Whilst Williams is always interesting, the scriptwriters assumed that D.B. Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic as a movie star, and what we get is a type - without any eye-catching detail or insight into the mind of a man so brave and smart enough to pull him out. Harrold virtually steals the film with its bound and pure beauty, but the true flattening was in manipulation with the conspiracy and the fluffy direction. The damage to this movie even exists.
