I can hardly find words to express how horrible this movie is. I was sold for a promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft that usually make a fun action movie. I can honestly say that I would rather scare my eyes with a cocktail stick than to see this movie again. The game was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was madly weak and punches so wide that you could fly F117. The script was so poor when I found out that he had written that ten years, I should not be a little surprised. Direction and production are so amateur, I would not even have made these people bother to shoot my worst enemy wedding video. Utter Utter drivel. People responsible for making this film have made art cheaper and they should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never see his face again in public, I can not imagine what made him decide to play in this worst film I've seen all my life.
