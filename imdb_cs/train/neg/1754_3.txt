Why should the history of Mary and Rathe be so tenacious? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why is very little reference to the original shows and characters? The daughter figures were stupid and uninteresting. Why can not the daughters sometimes like their mother on TV? Does it make sense that Mary leaves Minneapolis and Rhoda returns to NYC, but why would Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens not be stars? It looks like it's just a bad way to remember such beautiful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there was the Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hope Mary will be better next time if she again visits her old Mary Richards stomping reasons.
