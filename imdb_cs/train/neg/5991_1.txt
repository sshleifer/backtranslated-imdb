ba ba ba ... ... it is beside the battlefield of the earth in science fiction sleep. genie francis (aura laura general hospital) has a small role as rapporteur and it should say that this film must be bad ... there is ben kingsley (academy award-winning actor) in this stinker and a few other decent actors. You have to wonder what it takes to decide to make this terrible movie. Music dramatically rises up and down, like the main dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the story can not be followed. The effects are also average and look really dated. All actors speak in a monotone voice and have no dialogue with reality. I could go on and on, as it is a bad film. At least with Battlefield Earth, it's so bad that it's funny, but it's just a good thing. Avoid if you do not want to sleep.
