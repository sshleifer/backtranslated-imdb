The first Cube film was an artistic film. He created a world in which all the great archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they were trying to achieve the sense of a hostile world they could not comprehend. On the non-verbal level, there was a conspiracy of "man vs. cruel nature," when a person who represented innocence and goodness eventually passed with a triumph to face a new, indefinable world that is out of human quarrels; a world where there was no more fighting, but peace. I rated Cube 10 of 10 and it's a movie that was never meant to go on. The second Hypercube movie was a great disappointment. Some of the ideas were a bit cold, but in the context of the original film, the story or setting did not make any sense, and they did not make sense. Still, because I was quite entertaining, I rated it 5 out of 10. The third film, Cube Zero, while ignoring the other, plays as a much worse commercial B-film rehash first, without a symbol. There is no "tribute" or "honor" here; there is just ripping off. The same kind of conspiracy, with some elements idiotally altered (like letters instead of primary numbers between dice - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that it is tearing apart without absolutely no originality and what to say). <br /> <br /> The fact that we see something behind the scenes does not mean anything because observers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment, architects we do not know about. And in this film, just those who get to the exit (just as Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where is the * beep * in that sense? It's just flippin 'stupid. I'm glad I did not see it. Production value and playing in Cube Zero are not too bad, but the story and thoughts are so totally free of any inspiration that this movie can only get me out of 3 out of 10 points.
