Finally, I watched the tenants with their close friends who rented the film only on the basis of the appearance of Snoop Dogg on the envelope. Of course I did not expect much. I thought the film would contain a typical spectrum of Snoop Dogg-related behavior and pictures that are often found in clique rap videos. However, my generalization was largely incorrect. Unfortunately, this movie did not improve. <br /> <br /> Most would describe the movie as a dark, serious scenario, while I would describe it as a dark, seriously filmed boring drama. The film tells the story of two fighting writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate works. Their polar opposite life style eventually forms an unlikely but very complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the movie as a wildlife - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of personality disorder. And although the film is drama, acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and society was much more comical than anything else. I would not want to make this film for those who are disturbed because this party has a lot of dialogue and much more dialogue after that. There are some average conflicts, but they are usually packed with more dialogue. The end, however, suddenly jumped to me. It was a little twisted, somewhat unexpected, and a perfect way to wrap a movie that had to end. I could not help tracking the end credits, but the director of thought thought, "God, how the hell is it?" By the way, the director has prepared the carefully crafted hints and subtleties that led to the climax - all of them are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street of little things wearing nothing but black sweaters.
