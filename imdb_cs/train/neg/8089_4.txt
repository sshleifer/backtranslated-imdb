I do not know what it is about Donald Sutherland's acting style or vocal style, but he always seems to be behind the massive mud of Soggy Kleenex. It's just ... I do not know, hut? Somnambulistic? Drugs? Odd. <br /> <br /> It was said that I saw the movie again for the first time since its original release and frankly, I do not remember that something like that ends. The bad end also because nothing happens. What about a dead husband? Annoying child (and was the child called?)? Scottish court and military pursuers? I would be happy if something was wrapped up and it could be dramatic to close, not just a big panoramic response. What about a woman sleeping with a man she knows she just killed her husband? Even if she tried to defeat Needle's suspicion to protect her child, she could always have headaches. This last encounter made me too prickly and uncomfortable ...
