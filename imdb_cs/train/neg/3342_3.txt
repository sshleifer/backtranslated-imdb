I did not expect much of Sidney J. Furie's movie and Dolph Lundgren to play, but I certainly expected more than enough. The one-user reminder - the second speed action - did not seem too depressing for Lundgren's film. On the other hand, I would not bother watching this movie if its rating was below 5.0, but hey, the film had 5.9 out of 10 points, which seemed acceptable to me for this kind of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of the people who rated this movie 10 (excellent) were clearly a piece of advertising because DETENTION is the normal Nu Image you've seen before, over and over again. <br /> <br /> Lundgren did not convince the former soldier that he had become a history teacher assigned to a rough school. His acting is simply terrible, emotionless and conceived. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in scenes with juvenile delinquent children. They are either great actors or, as compared to Lundgren, they look great actors - just because they seem natural and believable. DETENTION has some elements that could potentially be interesting for this low-budget movie - - for a high-security high school weekend, four teenage prisoners with a veteran war veteran and a group of ruthless criminals who are trying to get in - but a story (like CLUB CLUB DIE HARD, or PANIC ROOM?) is full of incredible situations, lots of clich√©s and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget he's the main actor Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dobo play Bonnie and Clyde couple in love and deliver the most acceptable performances of the film, although it seems a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, Milla Jovovich want to be. In the movie where everything went wrong, their crazyness and style delivered enough fresh air to prevent my interest dropping to zero.
