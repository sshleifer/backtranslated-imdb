Quite frankly, The Omega Code is the worst movie I have seen for a long time. During the first 30 minutes, I was stunned in the seat and tried to decide whether to demand a refund. But since I did not have to pay for seeing it in the first place, I had to stay. And I did not think it could get worse. I quickly pass through the lowest points (including some spoilers): The terrible miscasting Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. Characterization was inconsistent; For example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit. Then there is a glimpse of the fulfillment of Bible prophecy; we see lots of sensational news soundtracks accompanied by ridiculous computer printings of the translated Biblical Code. Also terrible "action" sequences: Lane escapes from the difficult situations without explanation, and once Lane in fact seems to be in danger, it turns out to be a dream come true! It's nice to write at grammar school, but it's an inexpressible fence in the movie. Moving was wrong: After a long opening, the first third of the movie's scene changes every 90 seconds. Later stimulation improves, but there are still too many unnecessary jumps. And as somebody else mentioned, no one (even Lane's young daughter) has ever lived for years. That was disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are some good things to do. Film quality (such as Insufficient Grainy) is high and very attractive. The outdoor footage was well made and the location on the spot gave a touch of realism. In the last part of the film, there are also a few moments when Lane calls on God (finally) to help him - it turned out to be totally exciting - even me, someone who did not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked it because it considered me the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, there was a great incomprehension. <br /> <br /> Characters, dialogue, direction, and acting have been badly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot became sharper and more focused and the characterization could be improved, the film would be much better. <br /> <br /> In short, the Omega code disappoints. You certainly do not pay to see it. I give it out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
