Someone might be able to make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictitious version managed to exhaust something authentic and interesting from the trash-TV phenomenon. There are dozens of great bad movies (like "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this awful, endless film waste. Seriously, why not the Jerry Springer Show's documentary film, which would start answering some real questions like: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How did the Mayor of Cincinatti get here? One good line: During the "orientation" for guests: "People, I can not emphasize so much: NO ISLANDS!"
