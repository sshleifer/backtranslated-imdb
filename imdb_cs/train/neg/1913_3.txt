"Welcome to Collinwood" is a bit of a disaster. When you look at the people involved, it should be several times better. Watching, if at least somehow connected with the belief that it will be better, will probably cry you. It's one of those movies that had the potential but was expelled from this potential through terrible script and bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary position of George Clooney and the fellow who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but who cares so little, I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The film is just a life-saving grace, it's the strange vocabulary it introduces. I found myself thinking again and again when I was watching other criminals. That's the only reason I made a movie. 3. The story is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and highly impervious. They are in the constant state of agonizing stress and they are all so irritating that I have celebrated their obstacles. They scream at each other and cruelly swear. The dialogue is at best inspiring and stupid stupid at its low points. I have found that this is what Steven "Traffic" is accusing Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney. They should be prosecuted for war crimes if someone really remembers those bulls that are long enough for them to take care of them.
