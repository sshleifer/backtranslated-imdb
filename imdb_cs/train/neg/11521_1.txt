This film is really one of the worst pieces of rubbish. It is really surprising that something so terrible could be done. But if you can stand in a mysterious conspiracy, in character development and in the direction, you can get a kick from a soundtrack that is so terrible that it's funny. The movie starts horribly and quickly becomes inconsistent. Someone should give somebody some consolation to this film because their career was probably destroyed because of the fact that she was involved in this film. If you end up seeing this movie or you've already seen it (I feel your pain), then those words came too late. For someone else, stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will lose 2 hours of your life. Then you can at least clean it or something like that when you look at it.
