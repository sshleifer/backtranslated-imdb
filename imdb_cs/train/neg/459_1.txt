I was looking for a cute and simple comedy that could have time, but the selection of this movie turned out to be a huge mistake. I can not write anything good about it. First, the screenplay is stupid and not funny at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a farting turtle laughing. My book is not fun, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low budget 'effects' (if I can even call their effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places, they feel almost like an indie movie shot out of money. Appearing ... I'm sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for some money that they have agreed to participate in it? (when we look at their recent filmography, it looks like that.) Despite the clothes, Pamela shows her age, and as a whole she does not even see her as sexy, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> The film is not even in such a bad-to-be-fun category. It's as bad as any of those involved in it was wrong. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
