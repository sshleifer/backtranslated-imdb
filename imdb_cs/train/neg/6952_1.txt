The worst story of a big series. It should not be called Battlestar Galactica, because it's just the name. Too many changes have changes. You have characters from male to female, from black to asian, so that you can "attract the female audience" when there are strong female figures that could be amplified. Gone is the Egyptian feeling. Gone are the desire for the earth. The lack of cubes that would get to deny terminators is removed from the movie, especially when a person is made fembot. He gave it an original show that had a lot of cheese, but it had a big effect. They tried to stick to it, but let the fans do nothing to work and basically spit on their faces, as they do "their own story." Changes are good when they do something better, not just to create them.
