I like westerns. I could watch them all day. "Good, bad and ugly" is my favorite time. I watched "Silverado" probably probably the eighth day just the other day because it was listed on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is undoubtedly the worst West I've ever watched. All the acting was terrible. Nothing at the end of a mysterious compass can see. The only good part I can think about is a pretty girl in the canteen. The very long long pauses between the interviews seemed deliberate only to make time for the film to be acceptable. This movie was not even at the price of the new rent that I paid at our local film store. I had the feeling that I was robbed and deserved to pay for the rent if that was the case. The only reason I finished it was because I hate the film to the end. I turned it half because it was so bad. Make the director work better if you decide to do more. This is a kind of movie that has the potential to turn people west.
