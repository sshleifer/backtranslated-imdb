It is not often that in the UK we have films about urban life from the perspective of the African Caribbean community, the last example I can remember is the Babylonian way that was underestimated already in 1980. That's why I had great expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a movie that was proclaimed as the British version of La Haine! No La Haine is not! I agree that using dialogue and the environment gives this film the authenticity that was late in other British films, but my interest is that the film predictably ends sadly. The film intelligently deals with the escalation of blacks on black violence, sadly sad in London, but I'm afraid filmmakers are now using type casting in contrast to characters that are just as damaging. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that would be fun and inspirational to us, but unfortunately he missed and created a movie that strengthens the idea that London is a young black man, the only future is violence and tragedy
