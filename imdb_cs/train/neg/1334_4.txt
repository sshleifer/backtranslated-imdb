So last night I saw the movie "My Left Foot" after years when my mother told me how wonderful it is ... Full Day-Lewis performance is really remarkable and amazing, but everyone with minimal exposure to other work should not wait nothing smaller. <br /> <br /> A fatal misconception in my eyes was that she became obsessed by showing the normalness of this man; the film decided to show him as a complete and complete blockbuster. On the one hand, I see that it is a logical correlation; humanity has always the ability to be reluctant, and disability should not obscure it. I just wish these impartial viewers were not so forgiven for aberrant behavior and assumed that the circumstances automatically made it impossible. They do not. Behavior is normal, and yes, people with disabilities act - but they do not because they are affected; they do it because they are disproportionate. Physical damage does not allow you the right to throw in the public because someone you love is rotating. There are certain things that are not reasonable to do if you are disabled or able - thwarted. Providing someone silent permission to start football right behind you for the sole purpose of installing is one of them. (I probably once imposed a fine from the star attacker of the school with my face, but I belonged, it was not the reception.) The involvement in the bar fight is another. Contemplating the fact that your father is expanding his company only after you have shown that you are able to jump over physical hoops metaphorically, masochism goes too far. All these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery does not mean they are hateful. <br /> <br /> So yes; just because you have overcome the obstacles to achieve great things does not mean that you are unnecessarily crazy ... Being a good person takes precedence; Setting up an inspirational example for people with disabilities should appear on the list.
