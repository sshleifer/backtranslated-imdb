I was looking at almost nothing about him, except for the short description I read here. After what I was looking at, I originally said the director promised but seemed amateur, then I looked at the other things he did to see if it was his first or second film but no, he did House on Haunted Hill Fear Dot Com. He lacks the mark on both of these films and it was the same with this one. The story was also terrible, could someone just fall in love with a girl because she is pretty but has a child's mind? I gave her 3 because there were some visuals I'd rather enjoy, but the whole movie is pretty awful.
