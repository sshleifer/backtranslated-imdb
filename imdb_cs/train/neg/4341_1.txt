It was so fragile I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway. It was so weak that I could not even pay enough attention to tell you how far I had done it. Although I really wanted to believe that the portrayal of the young Carlito would be a bit different, I just could not buy it. I really do not blame the actor because I think it was the script that may have worsened. I found myself laughing several times, but I do not think these lines were meant to be funny. It's just saving the grace is that I bought it in 2 DVD set and I would pay the price I made only for the original. This is one of those cases when they should have left the classic stand alone.
