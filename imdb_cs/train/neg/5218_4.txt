All the elements for the bad night in the movies are in place: a dialogue full of biological techno-blabbering, chintzy sets, balsa-wood action, horrible late-80s Casio scores, and the overall look that suggests something on Sci-Fi Channel's 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with a big promise, the film crumbles into no idiocytes and MST3K in the style of Clark Kent wannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is pushed into releasing information about his secret projects. But when he tests his indefinite experiment on himself, he transforms himself into a vaguely defined creature (which carries more than a complete resemblance to "Dr. Freudstein" of "The House at the Cemetery"). FX work is quite good for such a seemingly low production budget (although I suspect most of it is held in the shade for some reason), but overall, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro odor in your inner affairs, despite its hope of doing it to otherwise influence us. I can not help, but I agree with the final remark of one character: "(It was) a nightmare ... of the past!"
