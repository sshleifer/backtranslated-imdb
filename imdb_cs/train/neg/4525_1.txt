Some pretty scenery, but the story itself - in which a self-appointed egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt, and in the course of that egyptologist, things in the most non-egyptological ways (eg, Tomb photo in tombs, manipulation of old parchment, etc.) on a black market, and in some way (within two days, no less!), the military epicenter on your legs - is much more mysterious than any puzzle the Sphinx ever imagined. Below is just horrible when a visitor to a British scientist (he does not seem to know absolutely anything about Egyptian culture and even less about worries is certainly the fault of the writers, but it is annoying when they all get out, it's her own fault altogether) and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seem to be as clearly confused as I am. In short, not what you would expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and what. It is worth looking at the laughter scenario in which Down directs all masculine scholars and accuses them of failing as an academician as they bathe under the weakest light that Hollywood could get. At the beginning, he spends another hour of the film and screaming and running into the arms of every brother he finds. Wow, talk about your powerful irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to former Egyptologists: Take a year or two of Arabic in high school. In the long run it will really help ...
