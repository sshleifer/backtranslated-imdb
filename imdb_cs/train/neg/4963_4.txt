has proved to be another unsuccessful attempt at a mixing science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and interpreted a poem, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be amazing to have a focused crossbow in the movie. AAAAAAAH! when I saw that part, I lost hope. Then ... they went to heorot in what looks like a ship Christopher Columbus flooded! when it arrives at Heorot (which is supposed to be a rock room in Norway), the sci-fi idiot group has decided that the heroot looks like a big stone castle. when I saw that part ... I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi is not producing a good movie so far, so I do not know why I got my hopes. Oh, and Grendel and his mother are stupid too. (this comment is beyond the theme of "Grendel") If anyone in the science fiction channel reads this ... there is some good advice. A FILM THAT IS NEEDED MUST BE ANY MONSTER WHICH MAY REQUEST PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THE SCIENTIFIC QUESTION! AND SO, STOP THE NEXT STUPPES AND STEPHEN BALDWIN WHO ARE IN YOUR FILM! THE FILM IS NOT COMPLETE, YOU WILL !!!
