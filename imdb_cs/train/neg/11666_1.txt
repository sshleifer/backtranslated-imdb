Best of all, I sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time. I did not find this "warm, emotionally satisfying" film by others. I found it boring, with music that turned away from the movie. The story was thin, the figures pumped and pedestrian. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to write more info about this movie so I'm doing 10 line minimum. It really can not be said, and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minima, so here it goes. A young eager boy finds an emerging talent, looking for time with aging, poisoned mentor despite his father's cartoon homophobia. Aging, the frantic mentor turns out to drink a lot and teaches very little. a conflict arises. Even though I do not think it's a spoiler, I added a warning if someone feels that so much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly I just found the movie boring and demanding. Keeping my time. I honestly do not understand what a little uproar looks, especially on this website, about the transcendent quality of this film. I think it really is worth avoiding. But as Dennis Miller said: "Maybe I'm wrong."
