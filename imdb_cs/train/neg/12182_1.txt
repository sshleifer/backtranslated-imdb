Where to start? I think it's very insulting to Annie and Aileen Quimn. I love the film Annie and I expected it to be a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! the actress is horrible, Annie's original came out a couple of years before I was born, I'm 25 now and Annie is still one of my favorite movies so I was really excited to see Annie 2. Actor was horrible in the movie, original characters? very badly written, controlled and acted. It's not a movie I'd like to see again, and any lover Annie I recommend you do not watch this movie because it's very disappointing to you. Young singers are not bad, but they are still not recommended to compare with the original
