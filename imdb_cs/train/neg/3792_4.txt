I have seen many, many productions of The Nutcracker. Now I've seen this movie from the perspective of the theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people in a particular field of ballet choreography will find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective, I have found everything from design to choreography to make it a subtle and impersonal "film". None of the traditionally "strange" and impressive costumes looked like what they should be (that is, candy did not look like candy, rats did not look like rats, but more like chocolate kisses), acting was weak, maybe too subdued for screen and choreography. she did not do me. This makes the whole show very satisfactory (at best) as if it were not to be separated from any other production. But do not forget that this is from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a direct theater director.
