After watching this thing, read the summary on the back of the DVD and think back to the current movie .... I became a little dizzy. I thought I was asleep and dreaming that I was a disintegrating child through a never-ending forest where people were going 11 miles an hour and stopping for no reason than occasional carefree lesbianism. Where (zombies?) They come from nothing and (vampires?), Who (sweep?) Clean Citizens on their way to saving the world. Neither the zombie nor the vampire are particularly shy. The only fight I remember was that the poor Bonny Giroux trousers are off. Coo Coo as FAT! All! Maybe it was because we watched the widescreen stretch and was too lazy to turn it into a native resolution, but it actually made it more fun ... Finally, my final thought thesis had more continuity, conspiracy, character development, antagonism, the subject matter and the action of the whole film. Bloodrayne looked like Citizen F *** ING KANE
