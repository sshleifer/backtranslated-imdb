Dave (Devon Sawa) and his comrades Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) went to school. When the haunted Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers his secret, he extorts them to help him score a beautiful and good student Angela (James King). Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - much more grotesque - inducing than laughing. The film tries to attract its target audiences to their disgusting gags - but NEVER WORK. What's more, it's full of worthless, unwavering characters - and the Schwartzman's character is so repellent that it's a big turn. The film is even attempting a 50s / 60s sexpot / actress Mamie Van Doren in the film's most outrageous scene. YUCK! <br /> <br /> Another introduction to the game is its utter predictability and unnecessary talent for a young comedian actor Joe Flaherty - when this guy stops accepting every role that comes along and does something I like, James (aka Jaime) king , which was very attractive - and he deserved better. <br /> <br /> This is no more than one in ten from me.
