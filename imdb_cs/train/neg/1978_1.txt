Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, a pathetic screenplay, noisy dialogue and hip hop music and fashion ... what the hell was that? Directer of this movie is just as bad as the movie he did. If someone did some time and try to overhaul the whole thing, it could have a chance. Bet on studios who are still trying to figure out how they might be so wrong. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... Asian chickens were not too bad. These boys wore the whole movie. If it were not for them, I would destroy my copy of this movie. If any of those who have not seen and have no idea so far do not waste your time ... you will regret it later.
