This movie is an idiot attempt of an action thriller. The sightseeing bus on the way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white hijackers who run dune prams. They take them to the desert and then steal all their valuables. The plot is constantly changing. One minute they want to kidnap a rich rancher's daughter, others look for a $ 90,000 collector's mark. This dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie.
