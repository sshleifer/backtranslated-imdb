When people in Cinema Video gathered their fine collection of "Slapstick Encyclopedia," which is a multi-layered selection of silent comedies, someone decided to start the first installment of UNIQUE PEACE (1916), a hidden one-legged farce from Florida, a very young Oliver Hardy. As agreeable as the ensemble is above all, this decision was unfortunate, because ONE TOO MANY is a very poor film that almost discourages the viewer from looking further. Just like any typical farce, it is a deception inspired by greed, panic, when plans get worse, and complications exaggerated to the point of absurdity, but unlike those that are good, ONE MULTI is disjointed, inoperable and totally annoying. At this point, it is hard to tell whether a hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing shots or failed filming, but no matter the cause, in the middle of the journey, even the most difficult viewer has no idea what the relationship is or what is going on, and at the end it does not care. The only interesting point is to see 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, who seems to be much heavier than he would be ten years later when he got in touch with Stan Laurel but who is still full of youthful energy. At the opening scene, awake with a hangover, Babe performs a highly athletic backward movement from the bed. Trust me, it's as funny as the movie gets. If you read this before you see Kino's first "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I suggest that you quickly walk around this and skip to good things.
