The worst movie in the distribution right now! I love zombie movies and I saw it in the used rack, so I thought why not? Oh, my God, the shame of zombie movies and fans to the genre! Whoever shot this movie must remove your camcorder and go to the movie school! There are so many gore hounds out there who put the time and effort into their movies and they have something that this film does not have dignity. I know what it takes to shoot movies and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent on meat production, but none of that money and time did not make it good. You need an actor, scenario, real camera, invest in some books on how to create independent movies. I do not know how you got the DVD, but the one who did it is either a really good friend, or he's banging his head on the wall. In gorges, quality is not quantitative, the effects are weak! I was so angry that it was actually in stores and that I could not get the money back. Please, if you saw this movie, type here and close the shlock. I know I'm very rough, I only had 10 rows, so I'm trying to get to the point.
