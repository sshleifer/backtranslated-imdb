I'm a huge fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he thought when he made this film. Under normal circumstances, if he made a bad movie, I can blame him for a screenwriter or a director, but in this case it's all his. Rocking this movie is his fault. It proves that even Heston can not make an interesting story of Shakespeare. I lost two and a half hours of life on this snooze fest and I'll never ever get back. This is by far the worst film Heston I've ever seen. If you are a fan of Shakespeare's movie, maybe this movie is fun, but if you're not, do not waste your time, you'll fly in the long run.
