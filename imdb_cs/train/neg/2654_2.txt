Although the casting for this film was admirable, especially by Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, writing quality was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching. <br /> <br /> My wife and I have decided that the reason we watched the whole movie was that it was like a wreck on the train and it was almost impossible to turn away. Maybe it was that we "hoped" that the message would eventually emerge and that we could gather some meaning from this effort. Unfortunately it did not happen. Of course, the audience might be able to "make sense" of this intricate story, which is a merit of the ingenuity of the human brain that has a sense of absurdity. Writers, however, DO NOT RECOMMEND this inborn need, as it seems we have to find meaning. It was obvious that those who are involved simply went through the movements of their respective crafts and that every inner passion because of the characters or the story were either secondary or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the films from the television seemed to have been over the years. Since communicating to listeners can be the primary concern of writers in the past, contemporary writers and producers seem to be soothing to their listeners, concentrating above all on manipulating us to "stay tuned" by constant advertising, which seems to be the only one why movies like Surrender, Dorothy.
