I remember Devil's dog playing TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watched him and laughed all day. It's not that bad for a movie horror movie, but it's a derivative (mostly The Exorcist) and businesslike, due to the lack of a better word. It does not throw you away by artistic cinema or a great actor, but it's not a waste of time either. It's the kind of movie you watch when you kill a few hours when you're not in the mood to think too hard. But if you're looking for some laughter in the movie, you will not be disappointed. The initial scenes, with Lucky the devil's dog as a cute puppy with children's disappointed eyes, are the cheerful and unharmable and top blue effects of a huge black dog (with horns!) They are quite divided. And take care that the Satanist in Maverick shades starts from the beginning. It's not a fantastic horror film that could be some fantasy, but I wish they were still shooting similar things for television.
