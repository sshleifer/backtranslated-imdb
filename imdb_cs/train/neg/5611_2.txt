Personally, I considered this movie horrible, first it was barely objective and assuming one side of the debate. The only people who were presented as a side-by-word that there are many people coming from Billy Grahm Revival. Second, he deviates heavily from the assumed theme that Jesus existed (Yeshua), talked about how violent Christianity is, and shows the scenes of Mel Gibsons "The Passion". Eventually, the director has a former Conservative private school principal who is interviewed and tries to capture him when he teaches children there faith. Oh and Techno music just made the movie harder to watch.
