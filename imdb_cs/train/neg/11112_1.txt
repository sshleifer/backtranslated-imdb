Wow, how bad it can get. That was really bad. No, in terms of gore - which was mainly a ridiculous CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. The story was horrible - the character of the arc of the main line was a complete joke. Within a few nights when Vinnie Jones appeared, he becomes "creepy" to crying while photographing his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers this childish, submissive and weak? His evolution of the character has absolutely no justification or pointing to it - and in the end you will laugh loudly at the absolutely predictable and absolutely absurd twist his character takes. The bloody moments were clearly fair, low self-confident efforts to jump into the modern ant form of MTV - all cgi, blood, but no real emotions at all. These parts were inadvertently entertaining - and turned away by their self-confidence - the camera's angled angles, etc. Overall, this film committed the crime of another potential idea. What the atmosphere could have (up to the stupid monsters at the end) is destroyed in favor of a "view of the city of self-confidence overhead." This film was not produced and the audience - it was made for a biography - a deeply selfish motive.
