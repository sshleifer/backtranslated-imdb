This mess is so bad that it does not even feel like a horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is totally useless in this movie. She is not a villain. The rest of the actors look like porn wannabes and the conspiracy is so poor that I will not even mention it. Make a favor and skip to end credits to hear the upcoming band TwoMarlowe performing "Better Than Sex" is a total 80 year Disco Candy song. Nice Gamble and Gamble. Path more entertaining than "Bleed". Put it that way when you have the equipment to copy videos, but definitely just record a song at the end of the movie, you really have a "BAD" movie.
