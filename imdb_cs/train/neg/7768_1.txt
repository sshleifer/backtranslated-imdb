This abandoned film, God, is about three stupid millionaires who collect a lot of people who play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, acting is terrible and the movie does not make any sense. It's not scary in the slightest, it's so silly that it made me laugh, which is why she got the star. The film is not at all violent, but it's quite dirty and it's mostly focused on the breasts of women all the time, and some of the characters are very uncomfortable and whining. In addition, the monsters in this movie are so shabby and fake and they are not scary that they just want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, the end is terrible. I do not want to put it away if you were really strange enough to see the piece of junk mail. Avoid all expenses !!!!! <br /> Not rated (but it should be R) for nudity, profanity, and mild gore.
