This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. Script is bad !!! I think they just copy the first 15 pages to 90 pages. Producers must think that we will create a Hollywood film in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now in the third week he runs only in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or so. In the past, we had really good movies in Belgium, like Daens. Shading is a waste of time. Maybe you could get into the theater after seeing a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of shades, you've seen it all. He was declared to be killed in local radio and television. I hope he will soon disappear in the Shadows.
