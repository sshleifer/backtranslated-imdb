This is a very desperate production. The general consensus was always that while Princess Margaret was perhaps spoiled and pampered and perhaps revealed to her in excess of the luxury she was at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of production, the actress did not get it across. It also turned out that the budget for production could not apply to the hairdresser - from the very beginning of her hair on Princess Margaret's character, they had standing birds nesting in contradictory appearance and looking as if they were drawn by a bush. The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh seemed to be preparing for his role by watching Rory Bremner, who mimics Prince Charles and was fake. The production was poor, loose, a tedious garbage load. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
