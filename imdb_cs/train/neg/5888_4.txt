I saw it recently on a faded old VHS tape, and I thought it was slow. Looking at it now looks charming. When it was released for the first time, everyone recognized him as a spoof when he came out as a homosexual teenager. To tap a home, mother is seen reading a copy of the paper "1 Teenager In 10", the most popular book of the time. David Warner considers it to be a pursuer of a vampire hunter, which is, of course, a turbulent case case. The list of visible chips and jokes that were included to make sure no one misses a point would be too long to reach. The producers had some good fun and no doubt hoped to be illuminated and enlightened. But I have no idea how a teenage audience would be watching this movie. . In some places where education and culture are, the terrible suffering that homosexual teens have to go through is a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are plenty of dark, ugly corners of our continent where it's as bad as it always was.
