I just came to see that I saw this movie and decided to see what others thought. I was wondering if those people who gave glowing reviews were seeing the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it can not intervene. The script is very weak - the conspiracy has so many holes that it would mean a large submerged network for fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the story jumps so much that I found myself in the question, "How did we get here?" at least half a dozen times during the film. There was no chemistry among the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's disgust during filming. It was quite clear that everyone had appeared and did their job, but they did not commit to their role. It's not a movie that's worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice hot bath and save money for something worth it!
