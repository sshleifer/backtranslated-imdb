First of all, I can not be easily scared ... Anything but my several phobias, but this movie is totally terrible. It's not good for kids at all! I had an open mouth all the time that shocked me. I could not believe how horrifying it was for children's film that the hares were brutally murdered! It's simply useless to be so scary and to be rated G. I recommend to be more than 8 to see it. But do not do me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I was not a child like a child. I can not believe that the parent could afford to say that she would be a 4 year old child. It's just intense and complicated, let's not forget the neck, for the little ones. I'm over 4 and I'm shocked by violence. I do not recommend
