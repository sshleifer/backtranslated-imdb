I wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to turn it off. It seems that the character does not respond to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger walks the night (through the cemetery, as I believe) when he is attacked by spirits who are leaving. One time after this misery, he left and met a friend who had seen it all. When I asked what was happening, he told me they "attacked the demons, nothing serious" as if it were just a little more exciting than a flat tire. I closed it when they asked something - a demon or something I stopped taking care of - a question. The answer can be borrowed only to someone who has the energy of his death, and the priest looks at what seems to be vague annoyance when one is hanged and hung up and they are asking about his death, a dying body question. <br /> <br /> 0 of **** stars.
