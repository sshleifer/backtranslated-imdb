Spoilers forward if you want to tell them that ... <br /> <br /> I should almost recommend this movie just so people really see 1/10. Where to start, let's start from the top ... STORY: Do not believe this - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finally understand what the mysterious events are. It is draub, the basic, to go into the cabin movie without intensity or "effort". SCREENPLAY: Usually I give credit to indie scriptwriters, it's hard work when you start ... but this is crap. The story is flat - it leaves you the whole movie without emotion. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable, praising "Woah, you've been terrified of me" and "thinking, would you ... if you wanted ... would you come to the cabin with me?" It makes me want to rip all my hair, one element at a time and feeding it to myself. <br /> <br /> CHARACTERS: HOLY CRAP !! Some describe the characters as flat, they want to take one step further and say they have a real arc of character. In fact, they start to work on the parallel universe and almost begin to play back ... <br /> <br /> CURRENT: Worse than characters are actors. They will take badly written characters and deliver a dreadful dramatic actress. "That you absolutely scared me," was so monotonous and slow - as if it were. I could only complain about the clock on the actor. TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: Eight-year-old would be disappointed with lighting this film. Too shaded in areas too faded by others. The director should not use light as an emotion until he learns how to properly illuminate the basic scene. Baby steps! SOUND: How many sonic boys do it to really make a sounding movie? 9. With many sound boys it should sound amazing, but vice versa. This is above all one scene that really goes out, these guys are driving in the car and the sound of the vehicle varies with every angle of the camera .... WEAKNESS! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm exhausting my complaint ... Let's get it - I'll let you ... I rent it and learn from it ... and 1 rating .. it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Vote ...
