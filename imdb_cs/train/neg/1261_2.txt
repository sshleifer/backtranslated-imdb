I'm a fan of Jean Harlow because it was starry. I do not think her movies are good and I do not even think she's a good actress, but she's definitely great in comedies. A bit of a comedy in the Missouri Girl is very good. But this movie is perhaps more like a love story. Jean Harlow is in this amazing and you can forget the rest of the cast - their introduction to nothing new. It always works a lot when I think Harlow's beautiful body is a sick woman. Well, she looks beautiful in this movie.
