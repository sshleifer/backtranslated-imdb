!!!!! Perhaps you think the story that would include Archie Gray Owl - an Englishman who pictured himself as a red Indian man would have a huge amount of humor. In fact, I would say that the only way to treat this film, where a remarkable person is perceived by the public, is to consider it a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough committed a similar crime by making GRAY OWL a serious career. Even worse is that he also shot a very horrible film. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role, and the romantic subplot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the same wooden Annie Gaupeau) lacks any type of chemistry on the screen. But to be fair to cast, they do not help with a script that does not portray Archie as a ugly guy, it is in everyone's delusion to believe he is an indigenous American. Producers and screenwriters made the biggest mistake that the film center around Archie's drawing is English - That's why I wrote "A Possible Spoiler" that is not actually revealed until late in the film that the title character is English but it is obvious that everyone who saw this movie, he knew there was absolutely no surprise before. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the scenery is beautiful and that it has a deep ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major ecologist of the 20th century to be true. And you also have to realize that, with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and maybe even TWO TOWERS, if you want to mark it as a green message) that there was not really a big ecological movie there. In fact, most of the films that are environmentally conscious, and this includes GRAY OWL, a movie that undoubtedly had a serious trouble finding a distributor
