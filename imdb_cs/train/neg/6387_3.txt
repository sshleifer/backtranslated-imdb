When I first chose this film, I was interested in the basic idea and was eager to see what was going to happen. I'm a fan of animation and I love it when it is successfully merged with live shots. However, the animation in this movie was probably everything I enjoyed. Although it has to be said that the performances were excellent. The visual appearance - including animation - gave this work wonderful air. However, the quality of the riots was lost between the exaggerated images, both visual and in the scenario, that you were virtually dragged over your head. The most annoying thing was the relative lack of meaning for the plot. It seemed to be a shoe that was irregular at intervals, causing a stuttering that was massively tearing away from the flow of the piece. Felisert's voice disguises-particularly the one at the end-seemed to be a desperate attempt to fill up holes of holes that had been ignored in favor of side issues like the whole thing (and not even properly solved). I'm afraid the whole story has appeared as a "reasonable first attempt," at best, for a teenager who has long been read by DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from experienced film makers at all.
