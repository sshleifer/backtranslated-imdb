You know you have trouble when the introductory narrative basically tells who will survive. Everything goes down there. Unnecessary, "Matrix" -influenced bullet-time camera work. Unimportant cuts in video games. Cruel commanders of the old sea captains and savage sailors. Conflicts, who become experienced fighters at the moment of winking the eye. Even the zombies are boring. I was hoping that at least "so bad a good zombie movie", but this is "so bad that those involved in his creation should be excluded from it again." <br /> <br />
