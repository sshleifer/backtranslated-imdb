I'm going to spend so much time on this review as scripts wrote it. This is an easy continuation of EVER. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield performing GOD-AWFUL, so was every elses! Physical comedy was forced, flat, and predictable. The script seemed to be written by mongoloid monkeys using the tattoo names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to squeeze such an ugly film excrement is outside of me. They even managed to create veteran actor Ray Walston to look like a hopeless jester. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. I want to spend 96 minutes of my life watching this recollected memories of a great comedy so I can try and convict everyone who deals with this film atrocities.
