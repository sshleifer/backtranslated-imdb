Stephen King's adaptation (written by the King himself), in which a young family, newly arriving in rural Maine, learns of a home cemetery near his home. Father (Dale Midkiff) then learns of the burial site of Micmac behind the cemetery, which has the power of resurrection - of course, everything that is buried does not return quite right. The under-horror "horror" starts clumsy, insulting and awkward and goes on for a while, with the worst element being the worthless performance of Midkiffa. By the end it gets a little better, with a really disturbing final. In fact, the whole movie is really troubling, so I can not totally reject it - at least NEVER to make it memorable. A dignified supportive performance by Fred Gwynne, like a wise old, old neighbor and Brad Greenquist, as a distraught spirit by Victor Pascow, is not enough to really buy the movie. The King has his usual portraits as a minister. </ P> <p style = "font-weight: bold;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
