It was just a terrible movie. It hurt to watch me. Almost every action was not motivated in the context of the film, it was really bad (P.Diddy was the best actor who really said something about the film) and the plot was generally predictable. Some references to Carlit's way were fine, for example, a dream of one day moving to Carribien but overall weak. The love interest, in my opinion, was totally wrong, but hey, that's questionable. Anyway, I really did not expect much before watching the movie and I think you could say that even the expectations were not met. I feel bad about Jay Hernandez, because in fact he is a decent actor (Friday night lights). But he's lucky, because I'm sure there will not be too many people on this movie. Generally, I give movies a decent rating if they ever make my interest, so I'll go ahead and give it two stars. Better luck next time. And yes, I enjoyed Carlit's way.
