5 minutes into this film I was hyperventilated, shaking and the pain twirling. And not so well. The story is about a group of idiot kids who made funny phone calls on psycho, which is always a good idea. It turned out that the psycho does not like funny phone calls, because in two minutes at their door they kill the poor William mum and dad. Well skip 15 years and guess what? Still the phone called people. Yes, you think that a terrible murder would discourage them from doing it sometimes, but not. So after two hours later and too many shouts, I realized that this film gave me nothing but a terrible mouthfeel and a strong desire to take my own life. This piece of crap does not even fancy the stinking production, "acting" or "Rutger haurs" is declining career. I like dirty horror movies, but this is the most unsatisfactory work I've ever seen. Just not.
