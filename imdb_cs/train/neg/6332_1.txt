I look forward to seeing this movie when I came out because I was a huge fan of SNL. When I looked with my friend, the people who came out of the early show screamed, "Do not waste your money!" But of course we had to find out. <br /> <br /> While there were some fun pieces (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of them felt that it could be difficult to adapt to a fun 1 hour show. It was pretty bad. When the operatic singer came, many people got up and left. It made me laugh because I realized that O'Donoghue was pushing human buttons with this film. Otherwise he was just crazy. Whatever - you do not have to waste time tracking, it's so bad.
