Misleading advertising ... I saw an advertisement for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power, which says "From Scarface and Carlit's Producer" LETS GET TO STRAIGHT ... Michael Bergman did not make Scarface, in fact he was "Scarface's Local Assistant Editor". Not to take Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he should have a slightly larger class. I think I can talk about the masses when I say ... We hate to be obviously lying. As for the movie, it was at best bad. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzman is ashamed to be working on this film. Overall, this film did not perform a good job by filling in blank spaces for Carlit's journey. Obviously, this project was an attempt at a quick buck, a rather good film.
