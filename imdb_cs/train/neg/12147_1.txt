This is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie movie I've ever had a misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any report you find on this site is apparently the work of a filmmaker, a filmmaker's family, or a friend of the filmmaker. How to suck this movie? Let's look at the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Discontinuous. Dialogue? Atrocious. I do not want to kill effects / gore, because I understand it is a low budget. But was there also a zombie who was not obese? Come on! And for a movie in Rhode Island, why was this car sporting a Massachusetts plaque? Continuity, find some. The girl is dancing while the soldier "stands for attention". Please do not leave your ex-girlfriend or sister friend in your movie naked. It was an ugly film full of ugly people, and he has no affair about Romer on the cover. Next time you decide to shoot a movie, no.
