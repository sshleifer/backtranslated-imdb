It is considered fashionable to emphasize every social evil as a consequence of the patriarch and male dominance, whether it is an illogical "logic". However, there is no gray area in the movie's story and theme, and the woman, who should be called the film opponent, is "the villain of the story." Under no circumstances can it be justifiable. In this case, the sexual orientation of women is just humorous and has nothing to do with reality. It is a betrayal of a finite kind. The man ended up spending his money and time in the unnecessary lifting of another's offspring. At the top of this, the weakest arguments raised by the three "liberated" women at rest are pathetic. Female sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery, and she has always betrayed her husband and worse, that there are no other children. So basically his life was useless. In some societies where justice still exists, such situations lead to the unfairness.
