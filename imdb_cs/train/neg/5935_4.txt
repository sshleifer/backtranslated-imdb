The saddest thing about this "hood" is that almost all of the singers (including otherwise incredibly gifted Nick Cave) seem to have missed the whole point where Cohen's intensity lies: by delivering his lines in almost helpless poise, Cohen transmits the full range of his irony , his ubiquitous humanity, laughter and tears in one. To see that some of these singers become intrusive faces, launch your pitiful squeals in the patent effort to scream "I'm a singer!" Is a real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you have probably listened to with some scary opera versions of simple songs such as "Imagine" Lennon. Nothing, nothing simply comes close to the simplicity and straightness of the original. If there is any form of art that does not need decorating, it's Cohen's art. The decoration made it on the street and it looked like a perfect make-up sex for sale. In this Cohen's tribute, I found myself suffering and suffering from respectful tributes and terrible reinterpretations that all lacked the original irony of the master, and if it were true, some of these singers sounded as if they were admitted to a show. Cohen is honored to let them sing their material, really, not the other way around. They could be friends or his daughter, he could become very merciful and in a mood for a gift. It was a pity that it did not remain in the family. Fortunately, but only at the very end, Cohen himself introduced his majestic "song tower," but even the flower was spoiled by a totally disparate background from U2, all bearing the expression of boring children when they visit their poor grandfather in a nursing home. Sad show, really sad and sad if you really love Cohen like me.
