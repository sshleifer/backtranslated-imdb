It is interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film. But the problem is, it's not very good. There was nothing original in the movie, and when the plot was well presented, the main characters were a bit shallow and you did not bother anyone. Rather insignificant (and sometimes quite clear bad), the photo leaves a little desirable, but I think you can not wait so many people who just make low-budget movie for the heck. It's unfair to judge a movie and compare it to other high-budget films. But unfortunately, that's what you have to do. It is not very good in itself. And compared to the others, it's still not very good. But it is not without good points! I liked the conspiracy. It was built rather nicely and well connected at the end. Sometimes, in the really dark scenarios, even a scary feeling was created. Ultimately, however, the film does not work. The characters are largely non-existent, and we do not care for any of them. Anyone can die, but it is possible to determine the ultimate "survivor" from very early on.
