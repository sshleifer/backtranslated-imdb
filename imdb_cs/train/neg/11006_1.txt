This movie star, among other things, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (which also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly the names that shout "quality". And with such uplifting jumps like "Supermodels going to landfill" (that's exactly what it sounds like), a man who executes a sperm bank ("Rhymer"), necrophilia with rotting corpses, black market berries are among them spring), lots of funny jokes, skit about the huge phallus, which is a superhero and forced abortion. Jumps are painfully unfortunate (such as "Batman and Rhymer") that are not good enough to be considered amateur and the film is rough just because they are raw ... and silly. I really believe that a group of eight-year-olds could easily make a fun movie with the same budget easily. Apparently, this film resulted in Vince's "Slap Shot" lawsuit against Scientologists. Honestly, I do not know who was rooted in that case! He obviously claimed Scientologists had somehow destroyed his reputation and sank this film. Regardless of the fact that the film is a repellent waste from start to finish and 99% inoperative (compare, Ebola is more fun) ... and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie. that Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wears diapers and takes part in silly fake porn. It is amazing that his career could overcome this.
