Baba-Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused it to fall. He was released with great enthusiasm, but he was badly hit and suffered serious financial losses for his makers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally pay for the losses. Soon after his release, he tried to go into politics, but he failed unfortunately. It's a very bad movie with frightening gaming, poor quality makeup, and a pathetic screenplay. Throughout the film, Rajinikant looks like a person suffering from a disease. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba the first day of the first show in the theater. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I do not recommend anyone.
