.... because if I were, maybe I wish I was crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to figure out the plot of the movie - and I'm "generous" that there's still a plot. As mentioned earlier, on the front page of the DVD is the incorrect naming that Richard Dreyfuss is actually a star. Hardly in the movie. And if he was really "frustrated" when the back cover indicated it was, well, that's because he said yes, he's in this movie disaster and he could not get out of it! The film seemed to concentrate on Jared Martin, and his role in the film, except for extreme detail, was not as mysterious as what Gene Barry played - or was not. And he spoke of "big" ... who had a clear idea to adapt to Gene Barry in a suit Humpty Dumpty, who showed his pants literally on his chin, should be sentenced to heavy time watching this stoned film stoned. I could go on and on about how horrible this film is, from a dialogue that does not match the mouths of the "actors" (think of the Clutch Cargo) to an unrestrained jump from scene to stage (again generous even though we call snapshots of shots "scenes"), for lack of plot .... However, if you are in a bad early 70s genre and if you are in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of cats and cats, I recommend having a good bottle of wine before Take this strange ride to the movie because you will be grateful that you will not remember the next day!
