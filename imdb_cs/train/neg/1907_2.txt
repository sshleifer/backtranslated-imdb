This terribly bad piece of waste can be racist, sexist and homophobic at the same time, while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. An amazing performance, a clich√© screenplay, and a boring screenplay make this film one thing to avoid. The two scenes were particularly offensive - the one in which Schaech hides his tongue after kissing another man (it could be really rough) and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by his best friend Schaeche, who pretends to be Russian. After leaving the room, he screams "Alien from the King"! So much so that the artist is an artist who dreams of living in Paris !! Jonathon Schaech can be a nice actor on the screen and is awesome. It's a shame he did not know more than working with the latest gay director Gregg Araki on an earlier film and trying to save this film from falling into a series of homosexual stereotypes and homophobia.
