Slashers ..... Well, if you like horror, it's definitely going to see it, otherwise they do not even bother. It is obvious that this movie has an extremely low budget, for example, it looks as if the whole movie was shot in the warehouse somewhere, and in many cases you will see the shadow of the microphone and camera shadow mans, believe me that you will not have to look for them.Also try to ignore the cheese actors, if that's what you call them! The basic outline is a few people who decide to go to a game show where they have to survive the night in a big maze because there are three freelance killers and who lives at the end rich. Now there's something about this movie that keeps track of you and rarely you find that with a cheap budget horror these days, For example, when I watched that I thought of my own I would'nt mind to go in this game! especially for $ 12,000,000. so I would recommend you to follow it and create your own mind.
