"Sleepwalkers" is the first film Stephen King has written the script for. Because of the excellent Santo & Johnny song they used as a movie theme, you would expect a weird and fulfilled viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you would get. The point is, maybe they could do a good movie. It is interesting to see what a scary atmosphere is with its small town. But strange things happen about 20 minutes into the movie. The film becomes sad for no apparent reason! Since then, the whole Sleepwalkers atmosphere has been destroyed. For those of you who have seen who can ever forget the old Johnny who screams "COP KABOB !!" after a punch in the ear of a policeman? But do not do me wrong, humor does not have a lot of quality. Again, I rented it to find out if mabye had tried for the first time wrong, given the original conspiracy sounded, but I was right. Man, what's waste. I can not believe they have the rights to this song, Santo and Johnny. I gave it 2.
