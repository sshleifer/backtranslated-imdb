My friends and I went to this movie do not know what to expect, but I hope the best. When we went out, we were just a little more informed about what actually was the plot of the film. Although this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending the money to see it in the theaters. Maybe your friend will ask for it (it's not at the cost of the rent) if you really want to see it. When the film is so intricate that you have no idea what's going on in the last five minutes, it's really not much in your defense. The game was decent, much more than you would expect from this movie, and some of them were good, but it was all flooded with a bad plot and a bad script. This movie was so bad that as soon as he got out, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie just to clear my mind. I recommend that you all skip the first step and instead have a good movie.
