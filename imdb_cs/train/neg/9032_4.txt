I never understood Garba's appeal. She always found herself stuck in her movies, not all that is tempting, and the annoying voice that could drown the tube. She was also a very limited actress, as Gloria Swanson was much better left in silent times. In her last film, her performance is very average and even unwavering. She's trying hard, but it's all useless because the screenplay is even worse than her acting. It would be a screwball romcom that is never credible and will never get out of the ground (though Melvyn Douglas can manage to get into the air in the skiing scene, which is really the only fun thing. <br /> <br /> There is potential but the scenario fails almost all departments and losing to each actor. Douglas and Garbo had enough chemistry together, but this is not even a place in Ninotchce, which I also considered to be extremely overvalued.
