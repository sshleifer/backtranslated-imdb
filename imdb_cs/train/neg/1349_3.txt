I got this DVD more than two years ago and decided to watch it yesterday. I do not know why it took as much time as I like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. While it may have bright color palettes and all the technical sophistication of modern animated film, there are some old things that are missing that this Gadget is right after the toilet. The first classic theme of Inspector Gadget song and music is totally absent. The composer tries to compromise by making a score that sounds alike but still not good enough. Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can become a van. Plus, she looks more cute and stupid than just cool. Penny does not have her computer book anymore, and she and Brain are not doing well. <br /> <br /> There is no act. There's something about the transformation specimen and the doctor's paddle using some never-revealed evil, but that's all I have. What was the deal with a short / huge Italian guy I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything. And if there is something in the name that could happen, his last case is in no way packed. And he remains in power, so why is this called "the last case" is also a secret. <br /> <br /> I was not interested at all. This is an insult to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD, but do not let you invite you to purchase any Inspector Gadget DVD you can. I sold it just a few seconds after I finally watched them. No kid will want or appreciate, and no fan of the old show with to tolerate it.
