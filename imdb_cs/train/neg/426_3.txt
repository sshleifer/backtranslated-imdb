Do not get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic. But it was a great disappointment and I was really very angry at what Disney did. Planet Earth BBC was all above and above. It was delicate. She had an overall feeling of balance and showed the whole circle of life and death. It was tragedy and triumph, loss and profit. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's Earth Edition is nothing of it. They were trying to make a movie that Americans would talk about. They did it DRAMATIC. They will find top scorers to scare us. Predators did evil. WALRU made evil. They show each encounter as negative. She tried to be thrilling and successful, but at the expense of a lesson of balance. The film was an hour and a half negative, and only about 10 minutes positive. I am in favor of a global warning, but it was over top political and environmental waste. <br /> <br /> This is another thing I saw on the big screen but was disappointed with the picture quality. It looked better on your TV at home. If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, hire or borrow BBC Planet Earth. It's better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-ray) better image quality.
