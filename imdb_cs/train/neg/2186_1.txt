... but it makes you wonder if we have any first! This movie is just as bad as any terrible horror today. The man walks around ugly half-timbered ladies, trying to decide who kills them to give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man who waddled around and set through all the sets for three minutes and filled everything that must be over ten gallons of "blood". The film also tries to create a feeling that what a man does with his girlfriend is bad and against nature, but the film is so badly made that it is impossible for the audience to kick off some sense of shock or outrage. Powerlessly dark and insurmountably ominous, this movie can not even get its own title - the initial credits say "Brain that would not die", but in the end it will turn out to be "a head that would not die".
