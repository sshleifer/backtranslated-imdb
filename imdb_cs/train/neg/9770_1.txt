This is the version the author hated because he is so schmalt√Ω. They gave them a "happy ending" and changed a lot of dialogue, and it's just a big deal of saccharin. "Stage Manager" is pretty good, I think it was a role, but everyone else is in the 40s acting style, which is really just posing. One great feature - music. It has one of the best recorded recordings and is worth looking for in the store. Overall, I think the 1989 version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller is far better.
