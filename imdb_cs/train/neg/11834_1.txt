Let's just say it in words, so even the creators of this movie have a chance to understand: This is a very silly movie with even modest script, lame animations and a story that is about as original as remarks. Do not bother - if you do not need to find a way to entertain a group of adults with mental disabilities or extremely slow children. They could laugh, especially if they are out of their medication. There's a strange kind of insult in a movie that's so ridiculous - filmmakers not only think that kids are ruthless idiots who can have fun with a scream that is about with zero effort but they do not even bother to break the sweat with gag insertion here and there that an adult can be fun. This film, honestly, grimaced me. It's a shame on you that you rocked.
