Madhur has given us a powerful Chandni Bar movie in the past. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. He's obviously telling the story of some high-ranking people in India. After seeing the scene where a man forces another man to play in the movie for sexual reasons. It seemed to me that pissing and breaking the DVD. At the same time, I did it. The reason why the film contained scenes from child pornography and harassment. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing things, it was not necessary for the kids to show naked. One of the rich people likes kidnapping poor children and selling them to foreign people, British men in this film. I'm shocked that this movie was Hit in parts of India, otherwise the Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I am from the UK and such things cause me illness, they should not be released in the UK.
