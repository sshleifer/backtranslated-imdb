Adrian had just left the asylum building, he was rich and without parents, his life seemed empty. One day he meets Gonzala, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to make some money, he helps Gonzalo Adrian look for his life and where his parents. This is a movie from a new director and it's absolutely clear in most films: the scenes are not properly directed, the dialogues are a little forced, some disagreements in the script ... Anyway, the end is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little bit) and it puts the film a bit. Actors are known and very good, but they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; they all improved the papers in another movie. The movie is dull and you'll probably spend most of your time thinking about how much time it will take to the end. Of course, there are a lot of worse movies, but there is certainly a lot better.
