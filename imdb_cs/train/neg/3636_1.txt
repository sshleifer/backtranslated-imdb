I am very open to foreign films and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, even if some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time that really did not make sense. Now that I've seen such a movie, I'm not thinking in that direction anymore. There are tones about society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has it. And when I look at South Park, it really makes me feel emotions. The closest thing I felt during this film was the yawn I had seen after the first five minutes. I rate a typical movie seven or more because I love most of the films. I gave the film one.
