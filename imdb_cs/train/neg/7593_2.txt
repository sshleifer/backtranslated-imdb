I do not like this movie, but then I did not think too much about a book that, although praised by many as a "masterpiece", seemed to me lacking in character development, and in fact it was incoherent and illogical, although it was much more readable, Fante's terrible first effort, "The Journey to Los Angeles," was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> I was impressed with what kind of Towne soup would do with such despicable ingredients. He worked hard in scripting to correct the many shortcomings of the book, but for not saving my money. In the film Ask the dust, there was never a movie whenever he tried to remain faithful to this book. I consider this film to be Towne foolishness. <br /> <br /> In a word: forgetful.
