I watched it as if you were gripping a big mackerel again and again. Even if you thought that "the mackerel can not come again," it was there. I'm not sure what they thought. This is the kind of pilot I've been watching and thinking, "Still, they knew they were on a convicted ship that never wants to be in a series?" Not just black stereotypes, but also Swedish and Indian. And while the "Blazing Saddles" made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were simply totally offensive. There was no conspiracy line, the end was stuck, and the jokes were not. Still, if you are a comedian student, watch this pilot to find out what you should not do.
