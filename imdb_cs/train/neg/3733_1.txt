Weak, persistent, tired, clich√©; it wants to be a basic instinct, but it lacks the opportunity for opportunities for new perspectives, new insights. Insipid, trite, grotesque, and without a possible redemption of the value of brevity; oh, wait ... it was only 90 minutes long ... it had to be * seemed * much longer! I'd like to clean up the toothbrush bus toilets before I sit down again. I express my opinion here: I think it means I did not like it.
