In a panel discussion I visited after watching this film, the filmmakers said they should not look at it as a movie, but as a provocateur of thought. Well, the only thoughts I've been provoked for were useless when I watched the movie. The shapes of the film (documentary style, futuristic environment) served as a distraction of what was to be thoughtful exploring the debate of abortion. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring film that preaches the choir.
