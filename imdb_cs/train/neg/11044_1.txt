Appearing in Australia as "Hydrosphere," this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you will become hypnotized and you have to watch it to the end just to see if it can be even worse ... and that's it! The story is so predictable, it seems to be written in a classroom of dramatic high school, the ensembles are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is wooden. Infant "muppet" appears to have been stolen from the Total Recall support cabinet. There seemed to be no single, original idea throughout the film. I found this movie so bad that I mostly laughed. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should shake his head in shame. He obviously needed money!
