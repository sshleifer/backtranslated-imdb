In a deserted wasteland of the future, humanity is terrorized by Cyborgs 'robots with human features' that have discovered a new source of fuel: human blood. Their ominous leader, Job (Lance Henriksen), is about to overtake Taos, a densely populated human base. Only one force can stop Joe's death, Cyborg Gabriel (Kris Kristofferson) who is programmed to destroy Job and his army. In the mirrors of the village he finds Gabriel Nea (Kathy Long), a beautiful young woman whose parents killed Cyborgs ten years ago. He wants to avenge now. Attack the contract: Gabriel will train Nea to fight Cyborg and Nea will lead Gabriel to Taos. Five times kickboxing champion Kathy Long has all the right steps in this high-speed adventure that brings a lot of action. Also stars Gary Daniels (like David) and Scott Paulin (like Simon).
