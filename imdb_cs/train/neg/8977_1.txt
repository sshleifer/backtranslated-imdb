A woman country singer dubbed "Big T" - seriously, that's what they call her - risks her growing musical career and her life going into the society of a dirty drunk (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother has committed suicide, his father is also an alcoholic and has a violent mood. You can imagine where it is doing. Meanwhile, music is intricate, like Parton, with her fluent vocal skills, reminding her of song after song (at least half a dozen of Texas). Avoid this mess and look at NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
