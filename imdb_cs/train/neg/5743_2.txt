Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who want to trap this film in the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel like this. In fact, if it was promoted as a zombie movie or the like, I could enjoy it. But now I'm totally speaking. SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what to spoil * Let's start with the first major mistake. If I did not know the movie was called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and I did not see some sequences where some people look like sucking blood, I would not see a connection with vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The second bad point: What is Metal? It seems that all young people, but especially the so-called "Vampires", are in different kinds of metal, mainly judging shirts! Do not get me wrong, I've been getting into the more extreme forms of music for 15 years, but no one will scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers at Iron Maiden (from all bands !!!) Shirts running around, pretending to be vampires ! "Pathetic" is the only word I can use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: actors. Wait a minute. What actors ?! You mean director's wooden friends! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> It would be a strong point and something to enjoy if the "brilliant" director in this film did not create the ARTIMIC vampire theme. I wanted to see vampires, but they were treated to some silly looking kids who would like to use their baseball bat. Movie makers should simply advertise a movie that says "cheap horror class B without a conspiracy, but a lot of gore!" This film is a blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And that makes me sick.
