For me, every artistic subject is judged by the following criteria: Form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to be in the forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. Long shots indicate a feature that the viewer can fill in. Because of the lack of texts, the story becomes a quiz. An introverted person suggests that he has depth, but sometimes he shows he has nothing to say. This film acts as an introverted person. If you have not read a synopsis, you do not see it as a suicide (and the unanswered question Why?) Which changes Anna's view of life and makes her suspect. "Why do not you talk to me?" Sebastiaan asks. Anna does not answer, she just starts looking at him for a long time without saying one word. What is the function of this image? What does it mean? My question sounds like Sebastiaans: What does this movie mean? What does this movie mean? The answer for me: shows a handful of people with passion with a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. The themes for their actions are not displayed. The rest is: leather, living, landscape. Nice and artistically finished, but insignificant, without having "instructions for use". In my opinion, this film is designed for other artists, not for ordinary viewers.
