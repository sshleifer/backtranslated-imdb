Stay in touch with three beautiful women in California who are going to a festival (or something like that). All hotels are booked to spend the night in a haunted old house. What they do not know is that there is a haunted resident who likes to kill ... Yawn. A boring, absurd, utterly stupid "horror" movie. Bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful, but the film is just dull boring DULL! Bach and her friends are not acting - their faces are empty all the way. The final "revelation" is ridiculously predictable, and there is no blood or gore to keep you in the way. There is some unexpected female nudity, but it is not enough to save it. Boring, useless and unknown (for good reason). And 1 all the way.
