What an insult to the SA film industry! I saw better SA movies. The comments I've read about Hijack's stories, by saying that they are worthy of ten out of ten, are pretty scary. The film's rating should not depend on "OH, a film from the emerging country. I ROVELY UPON ITS INDUSTRY BY NICE SOLUTION THINGS OF HIS WORK, EVEN IF IT IS WRONG." We have experience with good movies. Do not tell the movie industry about what people say about how great they think they are kidnapping stories. We can tell big stories like Crystal Beloved Land and Shaka Zulu. Cry out the beloved land I receive 9 out of 10. The great director Darryl, the great acting of two big older actors, no matter where they are. Hijack Stories .., I'll give 1 out of 10. It could only be people who contributed to the project to give him a high score. I'd do the same if it was my movie.
