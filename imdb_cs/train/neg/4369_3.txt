*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British "thriller" released in the US First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius, who has to abandon his research because his finances have dried up. Karloff is forced to retreat to France and begin medical practice. It is submitted by a disgracing woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. He knows that Karloff needs money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees with this challenge and soon becomes a GP's husband. All this time, her wife is arguing about a town with a local not a good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser by poison and he starts. His son (from another marriage) comes a few days before killing and finds that the will has been changed. When he pours the beans onto a woman, he goes berserk and even bites his son's hand. Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse loses Hypo Karloff, who killed an old man. When Karloff discovers that he has no money, he will ask his wife for poisoning his son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. The analysis shows the poison, but not quite in time, as Karloff kidnapped his sister. In order to shorten the long story, the nurse escapes, gets the police and can save the son to be injected with Karloff. Karloff instead injects and dies. This movie has some good points. Karloff is obsessed with playing the type of crazy doctor he did in Devil Commands and the man who lived again. It is strange, though, to see him ride firmly and slightly exaggerated. We never know why they are walking this way. I suspect the director thinks it makes him more sinister. The actress, who plays a 2-timed woman, overestimates something terrible. It has a French accent. Even if they overlap, you can still hate her (or maybe you hate her for her acting ...). Less than the average for the Karloff. If you buy a copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is a bit torn.
