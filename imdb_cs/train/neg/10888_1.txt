This movie is absolutely terrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story almost does not exist, characters are full of stereotypes, and Special-FX just laughs. The only remarkable thing about this film is the guest appearance of Rapper Coolio as a police officer. If this movie was to be a comedy, I could not do that. To watch this movie: First, first drink and then prepare for some good laughter ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like trash movies at cheap: this movie is absolutely necessary for you.
