So far, I have decided whether it will replace Anacondu as "The Worst Movie I've ever seen". <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore harsh accents, low production values ​​and watchful camera work for it. I just saw how I read a book and wanted to see how this complicated conspiracy would be in a two-hour film. The simple answer is - they did not. Characters appear only with little or no explanation of who they are, and then continue to play an unimportant role in narrative. Even the main characters act reasonably, so at the time the movie reaches its climax, you do not care what happens to any of them. I can accept that the books sometimes need to be overwritten to fit into the movies and that it may be unfair to judge this movie against the book it was edited from. But after we and my friends and I left the cinema, I had to spend most of my way home explaining what was going to happen. There has even been a change in the real meaning of the title "Rancid Aluminum" by pushing it into another piece of insignificant voice to allow the film to have a great title. The real disorder of the movie from beginning to end.
