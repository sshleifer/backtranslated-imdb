:: POTENTIAL SPOILS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was terrible. The Catholic / superstitious / thrilling thriller crosses the already well-out terrain of previous films. Poor priest. Sex and Priesthood. Politics and religion. Church Hypocrisy. Conspiracy involving the Church. The dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid and lame with a faint tale is enough. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the Sacrament of the anointing of the sick - the last right that a man can ask to purify his sins on the verge of death; And excommunication, the act of cutting a person from the church. In essence, the Excommunicated Person can not accept Absolution. So he will come to the sinner and I will. Take all the queries I have already said and you have "Order". I found a sexual scene with the priest interleaved on the image of the Virgin Mary, which was somewhat offended by the Catholics. Heath Ledger ends, he says (I paraphrase) "I'm a Redeemer and a damn of sins, I live without love blah blah" / I want to walk him in a dark alley with a long trench coat alla "The Matrix"> <br /> I gave this movie 1 not only because it is dirty and non-original but also because it has managed to offend the whole faith in this process. If you want to see something better, I recommend "Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
