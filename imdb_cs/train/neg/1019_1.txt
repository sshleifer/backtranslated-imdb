Frankly before I watched this movie, I heard that many people said this movie was shame. I did not believe this because Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took the role in this film and watched him. They were obviously right. I was really disappointed and I was thinking all the time during the movie - why the hell was watching this movie. Of course I did not expect much from Justin because he really does not belong to the movie / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself why they agreed to Edison's participation. To be honest, their roles are quite stupid. Well, you might think that when the players get sucked, then I should pay more attention to the story. It's really a story that's at the heart of the movie, but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie that wants to give its story to credit. Imagine, a journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned how to become his "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by one agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). Eventually they beat the system with a happy story. Jeez, I could not go on with it. Just the reminders of the movie are getting worse. My boys, do not look at it! Please save money and time for the next movie.
