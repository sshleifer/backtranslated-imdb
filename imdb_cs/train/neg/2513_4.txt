When I first saw this movie, I thought it was supposed to come from the children's section - it's very fun and sometimes humorous, and it's a pretty good story, but it lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors such as Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins they are able to deliver. I have to note that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein and his performance is extraordinary, but that is the only exception. This movie looks a little forced, the director lacks substance and oh yeah ... the music is ridiculously terrible, I did not do a very good mood. But if you do not expect a smart, well-done story of comedy / romance, then it can be fun as I said ... it should be in the kids section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from the boring, almost tense effort Tim Robbins steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflicting film, but if it does not take it seriously, it can be a good movie.
