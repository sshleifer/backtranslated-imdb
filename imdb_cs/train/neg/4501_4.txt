It is true that the setting in Paris is great. The actors are all right. The story is a twisted morality. Does it mean that if you want someone wrong, is it okay to hurt everyone else along the way? In a real romance you want a little less clich√© than a man who is bored with his wife and is willing to push his family and the woman who is right and encourages him to do so. So what if they look decent and when Karen Allen shows her body? The characters are still absorbed and condemned. Perhaps the moral of the story is: "you get what you deserve". I give it 4, only for fast scanning potential through "white interests".
