Frank Tashlin's "Home Front" is one of the most important Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons created as instructional films for the army. Rather than make Snafu any unpredictable disaster action, the Home Front instead focuses on his close home and how much he can offer his military efforts. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought it was easy. It's a concept with little chance of good gag, and instead, Tashlin plays a harder card with dangers, widespread jokes involving strippers and dressed dancing girls instead of effective comic relief. The result is a well-known short text that has little or no value today than a historical artifact.
