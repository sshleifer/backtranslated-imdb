Well, here it is, another disappointment from my account. Two, in fact! Above all, although I think I know something about 70 ecu and its most fruitful contributors, I have never heard of Joseph Sarn. Here is a man who has made more than seventy rancid and cultivated exploits and I have not seen one! As? Why? What happened here? Secondly, and even worse, just when you think you've found a new source for dark cult movies, it's the most famous and anticipated "masterpiece" of the director, which is an extremely boring and irritating movie. At least, lesbian Vampire films make a whole unimportant genre, but some of them smoke in a sinister atmosphere and curious sensuality (such as "Vampyres" Jos√© Larraz or "Daughters of Darkness" by Harry Kummel). The film of Josef Sarno's film has nothing to offer, in addition to a wealth of free-range nudity, and even becomes boring relatively quickly. The events take place in a remote old castle hidden deep in the German mountains, where a dangerous and bloodthirsty (literally) baroness lived five centuries ago. Her faithful disciples still defend the naked dance parties in the catacombs of the castle, which are illuminated by the AUCH penis, and hope they will soon resurrect the baroness. Suddenly (you will not even ask how) is a castle full of young and sexy female guests, so even more erotic rituals. It sounds great and fun, but "The Devil's Plaything" contains a huge number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the unfamiliar facial expressions are simply disproportionate! Sarno is not able to create tension or build a Gothic atmosphere (or maybe just did not bother) and the capacities of actresses are limited to standing in front of the camera and not being brought to the face. Please do a favor: no matter how desperately trying to see all the noble lesbian vampire movies of the 1970s, this is not worth the penny! Even the repertoires of Jess Franca and Jean Rollin are pure art in comparison to this mud.
