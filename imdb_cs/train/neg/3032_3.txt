Someone told me that this is one of the best movies for adults. Since then, I have discredited everything this individual told me after seeing this movie. It's scary. Without going into lengthy descriptions of different scenes, take it for word, sexual scenes are at best uninteresting. Jenna in the usual street wear at the beginning was the top of the film (looks good) but it's all downhill from here.
