Now I watched the four Bo Derek cars that were run by her husband, John; all of course are totally horrible, but it is definitely a pit. Is it a common fragile fence, bad scripting? director, naturally? and act, not to mention the stupidity of a naked star, it is that he loses a much older husband Anthony Quinn (he accepts a shotgun suicide by saying that he always admired Hemingway) but who still appears and talks with her. In fact, he wants to return to another, younger body, but he really does it only in the very last scene! Derek is beautiful as always and still plays naive (!)? especially during a confused middle section that is hunted by a hired killer in the spa. Quinn is also typically larger than life (read here: hammams), but this easily forms its nadir; besides, it takes a shiny plastic behind (probably suggesting it is in some language) for a long time! His "replacement" is, of course, a handsome stud that has no talent or personality. Also appearing in films are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (Quinn's best friend and business adviser Bo) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife)? plus the surprising arrival of a portrait by millionaire Donald Trumpe (who probably needed this on his biography)! It is also obvious that John Derek was his own filmmaker that the final credits are full of unnecessary (and blatant) expressions of gratitude to many people who gave them a helping hand and that GHOSTS CAN NOT COMPLETE THE COUNCIL in the 1990 Razzie Awards!
