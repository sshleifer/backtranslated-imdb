Missed train. Bad phone number. Another cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly harmless decision? Most people do not, because they are absorbed in their own thoughts and activities. "Happenstance" tells the story of mutual relationships and the causes and consequences of secularism as a group of ordinary people in Paris. It has all the ingredients of what is going on for the current theater, full of incapacity and disillusionment. There's a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a flat-footed roommate, and a homeless. Audrey Tautou serves as a former protagonist (in the sense that she is the same as anyone else on the camera and opens and closes a movie) and a normal girl who simply can not find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ What happens to her during the day is told by different characters. Is the forecast predicted? The concept is good, but the narrative is fragile. Connection from one event to another is weak. It is better to interpret stories in 15 seconds after Liberty Mutual's commercial insurance, where one person sees a good act and passes it to another person than it was in two hours of Happenstance. If you like Audrey Tautou, then you can certainly sacrifice time for this film, but you end up discontent and wonder what that story might be if a better producer and director fly it.
