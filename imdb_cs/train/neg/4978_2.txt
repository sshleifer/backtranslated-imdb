This movie lost me with an RPG cone (rocket powered grenade). It was as if someone had cut out and put the scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say, "I'd love to!" I was looking at it because I like Chris Bruno from the TV show "The Dead Zone" and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least kept it in line with the whole film - unlike all his creations. They constantly glided in all sorts of speech from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. There are already many comments on how this film differs from the original material. However, even in itself, this film is not good. It's just boring, which does not justify even low budgets. Having low budgets means you have to have at least a story, a dialogue and a decent deal. These things do not cost much. Instead they spent their money on CGI and some decent costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
