He just finished this movie ... he saw it on the shelf and was a fan of Nick Stahl, I had to rent it. Overall, it should probably stay on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were several rather clever twists and turns, but somehow I managed to guess almost everyone before they came. And the film just went a bit far to the end in my opinion ... if you have to suffer by viewing it you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> A positive note, Nick Stahl worked great (especially with regard to what he needs to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always played the same type of character ... too much Paul Finch of the American pie that came for my taste. And in the end, the worst part of this movie must be the unsuccessful performance of January Jones ... I think a pretty face is really a matter of Hollywood.
