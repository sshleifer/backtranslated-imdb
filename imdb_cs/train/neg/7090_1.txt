I slept on the couch at 7:35 last night watching Larry Sanders (usually I say but not yesterday). In December he woke up (an investment banker on the West Coast) and was fascinated by seeing it on HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this movie was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I have to comment on iMDB. That really is really bad. writing is boring, but directing and editing are just below the first person's level at a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a video. Keep in mind that it is shot on VIDEO instead of DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. Clips from skateboard videos have a greater "movie" feel for them than this horror. I wanted to describe poor filmmaking, but I honestly can not remember anything. Snapshots and blocking are stupid. yes, I chose the word "stupid". not unconventional, not courageous, not brave, boring, just stupid. I know people who review this review will say "give me a good example". I can not. It was 3:00. but trust me, I know that you will look at it the same way, you will be dragged by horrible reviews. <br /> <br />
