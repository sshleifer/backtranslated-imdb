I like Jane Austin's novels. I love books and movies about pride and prejudice and sense and purpose, and I'm halfway through Mansfield Park. But I could not build Emmy. I gave up the book in two chapters and I could not take care of Emma until the end of the movie. It has not changed at all. Perhaps it was Paltrows (which is excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. I do not know. <br /> <br /> The costumes are nice, but the dance was clumsy in comparison to pride and prejudice dances by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I gave her 2 basically that the knight was surprisingly gorgeous, and although it was Ewan McGregor as a rather disordered performance, I liked his singing.
