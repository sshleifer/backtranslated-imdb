Cute and playful, but chrome and cheap. "Munchies" is another Gremlins clone that dates back to the 1980s. I'm not a fan of imitation. <br /> <br /> At first it was an excellent 'Gremlins'. <br /> <br /> Then came the very average "Critters". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, I probably thought it more fun than "Ghoulies," but I prefer a darker tone. <br /> <br /> The game is played by silly nature (which is better for her), but because of this nature can play hammams (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) just to see munky running amok. There is fun. Mostly foolish fluff, as the story focuses mainly on munchies (who are either hungry, horrific, and destructive) in a series of supposed comic encounters (in some moments they work) in a small desert town because a few people are persecuted. It's stupid, but strangely dealt with zippy. The creatures themselves look somewhat inconspicuously and poorly detailed because they are the basic dolls they are catching. Where their personalities came from is that they can really talk ... and with an attitude. Charlie Stratton and feina Nadine Van der Velde (who was in "Critters") were just. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo will also appear. <br /> <br /> Fun entertainment fun for the unpretentious.
