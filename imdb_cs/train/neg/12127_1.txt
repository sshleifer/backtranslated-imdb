I'm sorry for Fulc fans, but I could not go through it. The soundtrack was so unpleasant that it was that the actress was a girl, the story had been done and done, and the direction was not there at all. <br /> <br /> The massacre honestly looked like a children's film project. But I've seen some of them, and actually look better than this! They seem so poorly funded that they could not afford ... Anything! It's not a DoP, not a director, no one who has no idea what actor is. It was a very bad film experience; one of my worst. This was the worst story I've ever seen, next to Teron's Toon, who is just another, named Killer Klowns of the universe. I have nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> It is 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
