The only good thing about this unfortunate jam is that I did not have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can not find humor in something that's free, it's hopeless. Still acting and poor jokes can not be masked by an excellent, yet confused set design on the Volkswagon Beetles market. I do not know what Michaels Myers is doing in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressing. It was no more than an obvious effort to earn Grincha's previous success (who has his opponents, but I liked it very much). It is hard not to disobey this failure and to think about what better projects have been passed on to fund it. Do you want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with Grinch.
