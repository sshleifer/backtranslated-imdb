There is no mention of Ann Rivers Siddons adapting the material for the "House by the Door" from her seventy novel of the same title, or someone else did it. This life film was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed up on the cable version of what was probably a movie made for television. You know that when critical moments preceded ads that could not be found in this release, we were watching. The star of the film is Lara Flynn Boyle, who sports a new look that threw this viewer's curve due to the cosmetic transformation that this actress has gone through. From her new eyebrow to the other parts of her body, Mrs. Boyle is barely recognizable as Col Kennedy, a character in the center of secrecy. This was not one of the actresses, better moments in front of the camera. This is true of the rest of the Canadian actors who deserve better. The film has a cross between "Desperate Houswives" with "Stepford Wives" and other familiar features, combined with a slight dose of creep. The best on the film was a house that serves as a setting.
