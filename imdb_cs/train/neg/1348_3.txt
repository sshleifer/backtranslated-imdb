this animated film Inspector Gadget is pretty lame.the story is very weak, and there is little action.most of the characters are given little to nothing to do.the movie is slightly fun at best but really does not go where and where it is bodless. it is observable but just fair and is not anywhere near the caliber animated TV show of 80.sit is not a movie that carries a repeated viewing, at least in my mind.it is only about 74 minutes including credits, so i think it's good thing. in a TV show, characters do not get rooted for here.in show, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who really cares? anyway, that's just my opinion. for me Inspector Gadget The last case is disappointing 3/10
