At least between these movies with 100 votes or more. Nominated for Best Screenplay Written On Screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for the best actress in a leading position? Nominated for Best Picture? I always disagree with many Oscar nominations, but this film could be the worst film of all time the academy has to honor. Writing and acting were both terrible. Blethyn's acting performance was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably most of all the acting performance of all time. An amazing film that is not good for a big screen and is not worthy of any cable or TV channel that ever played it, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just grateful that I do not really have to see one of the most overrated films of all time.
