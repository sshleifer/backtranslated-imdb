The thing that really gets me about this movie (that's the thing about this movie that makes me physically worse) is that someone actually paid for it was. There is no purpose at all for the existence of this film. It's not scary, it does not mean it provokes, it's not fun, it's not good. It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide. The DVD case compares with Blair Witch, Evil Dead and several other decent films, so the film's desperation is clearly evident. It's nothing like any other film ever made; is far, much worse. Claims of an "extremely shocking ending that you will never forget" are equivalent to one ton of snakes of horse sickness. Do not waste your time by watching this waste because it can be sterile. The man who wrote this film should be deleted from the Writer's Guild membership list and never allowed to filming anything again. Because if he thought this was a movie that would be worth it, he probably does not have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod smiles the soul of someone unhappy to see it. I'm going to vomit now.
