It was a weird movie. It started quite well. Strong soundtrack behind gore snapshots and chaos when our psychopath has done his thing. Another coming is his "downfall". Here I could say I was in a real cheese movie "B". Poor acting, I think how hard it is to keep a gun and act like a policeman? These guys could not do it. After the death of our psychopath we get an introductory credit and the movie begins ... From this moment, it is a bad acting big goat, an occasional bucket of blood and badly executed deadly scenes. </ br /> <br /> It told me that I made the film four, because despite its defects it kept some craze that I just could not get. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, but I have to admit it seems worse.
