I saw it in an art cinema that also portrayed "Last Days" and some of Charlie Chaplin's films. Based on the quality of other features, I decided to give "Immortel" a chance. I almost disappeared from this movie and I love science fiction! The story takes place in the futuristic city of New York, filled with Blade Runner-style commercials and several similar debates about cloning / synthetic people. Unfortunately, the script was not condensed enough for an hour and a five minute minute film. There are three groups in this world: people, artists and Egyptian gods. Art artists seemed to have control over the city's politics. People are slaves and used to eugenize and donate organs. Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid in Khufu and completed with a worsened exterior, so a smooth "cap" will remain on the pyramid. Will the sail of the futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city, and no one on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not bore you with the so-called conspiracy, but there is a lot of unnecessary gore and many rough scenes. The movie, as I said, appears to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps the Fifth Element and the Matrix. At the end of the film, thanks were given to the UK, France and Italy. The film is French but uses British actors who do not speak French. It is therefore obvious that their French dialogue has been dubbed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that going back and forth between real people and animations totally distracts. It does not help that animations are bad - not better than video games. Skip this.
