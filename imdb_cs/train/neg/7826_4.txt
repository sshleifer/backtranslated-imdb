Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Grapes. No plot. No depth. No meaning. This movie won Superman as an absurd hero, a hero without an archetype. In the original film he represented America in the Cold War. Here he represented nothing but Hulk. Sure, the actors were all right. Kevin Spacey was, among other things, a great choice. <br /> <br /> This still does not solve the problem that this movie has no depth. I do not see how anyone in this movie can think of something meaningful when he was a Superman and was created everyday to be a meaningful hero not only in comic but also in human minds. That was a real waste of money in terms of how much direction this film could take. Only a few cases: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and on and on and on. It was just another hackman incarnation. A Superman? Why is it in this movie? Nothing but a hack "mammal" number. Wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you see it at all.
