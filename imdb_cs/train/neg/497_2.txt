This is a really silly movie. It could be fun with the cold search of aliens and setting the ground, but it just is not. Some strangers hear the broadcast of World War, when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing people they make their slaves and they are angry. The front cover of the film shows that these aliens are in the universe ... not really what they are doing. They are not strange aliens, they are silly cartoon idiots with annoying loud modulation voices. A stranger with the highest acceptable voice is also a stranger who suffers from Jack Nicholson, who always wears sunglasses. Besides strangers, acting is terrible. Scripture is, of course, intended for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie that may only be appreciated by children. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 100 minutes. PG for mild language.
