Stevina Irwin's show is hillarious. He does not even try to be funny and he's just, but his movie was not what I would call a movie - I guess the guy on his car is trying to kill him, he just says, "Oh, guy!" And looks straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too! And then, when that guy falls out of the car, do not you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst acting I've ever seen! Just as when a crocodile almost eats Steve, he just says "Steve." It was not afraid or something, it was just "Steve". I think I hate it sounds good, but it's not worth seeing. I like Steve Irwin, but his movie was just too stupid.
