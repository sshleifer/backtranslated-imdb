I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 at a relatively important video vendor to do some "indie" movie research because I just finished my own job and edited it. Now that I feel down about my skills as the first director I just need I'll hate to talk to another filmmaker so I'll use constructive criticism 2. When shooting video clips, you're overwhelming the scenes and darken on your computer later in post 3. Detailed shots are better for the video 4. When the actor enters the scene, wait a little while to talk so we know what's going on and who's talking 5. You never show the back of the door while we wait for someone, who could open it .. The damn well worth $ 3.99 <br /> <br /> True horror would have been a review that separates here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit ... they got to the distribution.
