Sam Mraoviƒçi, we know you tried so hard. This is your magnum opus, which is a brilliant example for the rest of us, that it is definitely worth nominating at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you say on its 1998 website). Unfortunately, it is better to stay silent and be considered a fool than to talk and remove all the doubts. You and Ben and Arthur are doing it only. <br /> <br /> Apparently gathered with inadequate teaching or education, the screenplay of the film makes us truly bizarre with each new scene. It's a crazy justification for the story, which may also be the best film ally. Glamorous, homosexual titles that Ben and Arthur try to get married go so far as to fly across the country, in the shadow of Vermont's most beautiful palm trees. But all that stands is for blood. Then more blood, and more and more blood. I think in the final third of this movie there must be at least $ 20 in a fake cosmetic make-up. The film in its entirety is a technical gaffe. From audio to music editing, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note that takes place on the keyboard, it's great to keep the movie together on any medium you're viewing. It is such a pity that some decent amateur performances are wiped out here. Sam, Sam. I'm sure you've made five numbers on this movie in rent, or whatever drives a poor soul (like me) to see this movie. We can not be sad with you.
