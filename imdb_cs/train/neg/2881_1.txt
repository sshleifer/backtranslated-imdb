This movie was so ridiculous that I never even finished it, that I actually thought that someone had created their own version and called it on DVDs from the film store. This movie made me sick because it was not cruel but because I lost 2 50 !!!! It seems like my brother and I went to the house, we shot the film ourselves and edited pictures of slaughterhouses! I'm so ticked, BTK Killer deserves more credits than it was not accurate. I think coming to the cow's head was obviously made from playing dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG I cant even get all the words out of explaining it DO NOT COVER THIS FILM !!!!!!!
