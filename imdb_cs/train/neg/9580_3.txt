Former brother actor and all the boys Rob Lowe are playing in a high-security American prison. I had the feeling that his character would be popular for all the bad reasons, like Tobias in the first OZ series, but PROXIMITY is not such a movie, it's more like the movie "Man on the Run" UPRCHL√çK. He also puts on the subject of punishments and justice with James Coburn portraying a portrait as a spokesperson for the pressure group for the victims of justice, but any intelligent discussion about how society should treat criminals is totally ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches and car chase
