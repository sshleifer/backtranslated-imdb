Woody Allen, when he has the best, has one of the sharpest pens around. He can make acute observations and wrap it around his foot like no one else. However, when in his worst case, his films can destroy pretense. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" has this smell from opening to closing. Establishment is one of his most interesting ideas. Four friends sit in the restaurant and discuss whether the essence of comedy or drama life. To help solve the argument, one person joins the beginning of the story and asks the other two guys who quarrel (one comic playwright, the other dramatic playwright) whether it be a story of comedies or tragedies. Both men then continue the story and the film plays stories to weave. Now that I first heard about this movie, it was clear to me that they are telling the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) is changing only as you look at it. Now it would be interesting. However, stories have only one main element and several minor elements. These are completely different stories with large differences in plots. Drama is so sketchy and demanding that it can really work as self-propelled. If that were the reason, then it failed because these elements prevent viewers from feeling emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is a story that has moments of success but is still short and short. Will Farrell will probably stand for Woody, but he could play this figure much more faithfully without adding Woody's stuttering and handwheels. Woody is the best in Woody. When someone tries, they do not play a character, they model a recognizable actor. This type of thing just pulls the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen movies forced me to leave the theater a little lighter than I had come in. This made me get my money back.
