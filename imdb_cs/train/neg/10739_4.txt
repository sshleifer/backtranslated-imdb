"Iedereen Beroemd" has everything we expect from a direct video. It's a story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star. All he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and earn some blackmail. The problem with the movie is not basic, but how it is done. Everything should be funny, but it is not. It is trivial and clumsy, the signs are shallow and the end sequence is completely without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene in which you feel laugh but just how pathetic the whole layout is.
