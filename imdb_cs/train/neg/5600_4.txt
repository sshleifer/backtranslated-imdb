experiments with scifi and failure. usually in his non-horror films we still get aggregated gore, but not here. Calculate very funny scenes like when prisoners are forced to hold the bar for 12 minutes and if they are released they are excluded. that guy is down and he's got about two minutes on the floor until his friends who kept trying to keep them picked up the floor. The city is an obvious model, but it's not bad. and the ultimate explosion is at best ridiculous. And do not let me start on terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
