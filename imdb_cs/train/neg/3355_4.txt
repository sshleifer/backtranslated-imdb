It was just two things that interested me about this movie: I'm expecting Owen Wilson to die and Catherine Zeta Jones. Basically, it was one woman. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye candy. Liam Neeson was completely useless in this film. Just like Jones had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). It was the only one that actually contributed to David Self in this dirty script. OK, it was his first and he bought himself with Road to Perdition. I do not know what was the problem with director Jan de Bont. he did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. actually fell to work here. He may have recovered from the Speed ​​2: Cruise Control disaster. He should thank his stars for the wild wild west, otherwise it would be the worst image of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
