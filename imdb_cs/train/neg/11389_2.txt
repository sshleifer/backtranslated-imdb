If you like movies that run with a little expedition of flavored sex, this movie is for you. On top of that, the lead actor / actress (the new incoming transsexual) has an interesting presence on the screen, but it's not enough to add up to much more than a slightly interesting movie - if that's the case. In essence, this film is about three socially murdered (transsexual prostitutes, male impostors, and Russian, homosexual immigrants) who have somehow made a bond. Why it is not clear. We expect to accept that these failures are essentially basic honest people who have the ability to love when their bodies are massed on the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her nine-year-old sugar. The film director has a fragile, unpleasant side of life, while he wants us to believe that all these seriously damaged people are really normal if they have a masculine life that helps them in life. Pretty fantasy, but unfortunately here depicted as the real look of life on the wild side. In short, no plot, no truth, and no real reason to spend a lot of time here. If of course you do not like to enjoy it!
