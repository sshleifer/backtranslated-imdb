I am genuinely surprised by the many good ratings that have been won by the anti-Christian pseudo-documentary film. Now I respect the opinion and belief of man, I myself in this state do not believe the learned Christian teachings. Pro-Christian propaganda is somewhat different. This movie has valid points, but there are only a few and it is represented in a very interesting context. I do not answer to seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see them and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And that is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. Instead of a questioning approach to this topic, it looks like a personal vendetta in a Christian school that has hit his childhood. It also distorts Christians most of the time as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no slowing down between that. The director uses the film scenes of Christ's misery without permission, provides an interview with the director of his former school and represents almost only anti-Christian stories and writers. In fact, I have found that the director is the man who is the most on earth, and he thinks his attitude is quite well-founded. I also confidently doubt that some of the Christian faithful who were interviewed were consulted after disclosing the purpose of the investigation before the interview. It has been said that there are certainly new and interesting facts found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. But the way this whole thing thinks is often offensive, very unprofessional and terribly biased.
