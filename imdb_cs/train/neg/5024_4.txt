There is not much to say about this. Gammer is some hot turtle. It is released by a nuclear explosion. It threatens the ground and begins to destroy buildings and tanks and other unsolicited things (oh yes, power lines, I almost forgot). Suddenly in the movie he sees a little boy and instead of throwing him away or shooting him, he puts him down. Safe. From that moment on, we have to look at this peculiar face that appears and escapes, shows and escapes, shows and escapes. For some reason, Gammer is able to hear this child from 20,000 feet. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammer to get to a place where he can be placed on board a rocket and fired into the universe. As usual, the monster is rough and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammer suit). The Japanese Army (with the help of the Americans) is using enough ammunition and fire forces to resolve the state debt, and of course it is not good. They should know it too. We saw a lot of monsters in Tokyo. Do not add it because it can be fun, but it really is not very good.
