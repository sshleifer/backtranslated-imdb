CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, members of the West Point Academy torn apart from the outbreak of civil war. OK historic drama by Gregory Hoblit is an obvious point - virtuosity men are blindfolded - although production seems to be a bit depressed, despite the authentic details of the season and the casting of talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney etc.), which Dan Futterman performed as a southern conscientious who had a weapon in defense of slavery in direct conflict with his former northern friends. The film is an emphasis on such an intriguing - albeit sympathetic - character that is particularly courageous, but the drama is otherwise flat and shallow and Hoblit's direction is more effective than inspired.
