Given that this painting is classified as a "pure entertainment" work, and given that there are already a number of comments, I would like to address something important about the misuse of humor. We see that Marlon Wayans plays a jolly role in this film. Certainly, as he embarked on casting, he always worked as a small man - the actor can change his usual dress, but he can hardly change his physical appearance - and the other may be an advantage if necessary. Far from what I expected, I saw the picture very shadowed and pretended to reveal various aspects of the child's life by mistake for a forty-year-old criminal. And with an absurd happy ending. So, what's the point? Many elements are mixed, some of them violence, sex and criminal activity, among which the story is poorly composed and to a certain extent a lack of common sense: where is Vanessa when a room is broken in her house and her husband is being persecuted? In addition, the diamond is even larger than the world number 1 Cullinan! The worst is a constant attempt to make the little man a superman and show his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. The diamond is precious, hard and fragile; can not be cut by other material, but only by conquering the hot blood of the goat man. That's why it's no longer a diamond, but a piece of debris.
