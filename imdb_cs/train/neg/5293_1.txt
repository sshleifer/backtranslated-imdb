I captured this video after reading the text on the box, the story looked good and had Keanu Reeves! But after five minutes of observation I noticed how terrible his acting performance is, he walks and talks so stupidly all the time, it's fake and not convincing. It does not end there, almost all the characters act so badly that it's ridiculous, the only acceptable acting performance was Alan Boyce (David) but the guy committed suicide soon and you can not see him again, you never know why he did it! Everything about this movie screaming low quality, I can not believe how this thing gets into motion! I have been tempted many times to stop watching, in fact I did, in half I decided to stop watching and turned it off, went to the IMDB to find out what the other people think I did not find any comments (not surprised) so I decided to deal with the pain and come back to finish it, let me come here to comment. The only good thing (for me) was the Rock School theme, occasional guitar games and the singing part, but it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and direction ... A terrible movie.
