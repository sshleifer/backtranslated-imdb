Initially three words: READ THE BOOK! Really boys - this proves the difficulty of actually releasing esoteric affairs. I loved the book and I was totally disappointed in the film. It was absurd, half-hearted, and the story was misinterpreted. Novel - in the first place! - was not meant to focus on adventure! That's just the neighborhood. In the movie, the focus is on it and the message has a back seat! In addition, the visual effects that show the energy of all living beings and explanations of events at the end were Scandinavian! They crumpled it! ... I will never watch again!
