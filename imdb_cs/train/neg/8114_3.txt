... mainly because Ju-on 2 boasts mischievous material in minutes for the fortieth minute, which is literally drawn directly from the first Ju-on - and when you think the sequel continues for only 76 minutes, the movie. Ho-hum. I find it deeply irritating - as if the audience simply did not remember the same things! - not to mention it is boring, it has to look over and over again. Okay, the complaint aside, the herb for Ju-on 2 was that she should explain a lot of unanswered questions from the first film, which frankly, in 36 minutes just not far enough to make any kind of sense of the original highly involved story. But there are some really new new horror sequences that show how good a movie could be if it had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some but not all - are answered. So, in the end - if you loved the first original movie and wanted to see some further story development, go for it - but remember that you can control the remote control with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes.
