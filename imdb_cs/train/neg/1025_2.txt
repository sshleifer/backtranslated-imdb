That's the only question I left with. Why did the film stretch so much when he had such a great actress? Why was writing so bad left the audience totally unrelated to the characters? Why does not it make any sense? Why did the study get a perfectly good assumption and "Hollywood" missed the hell when it all needed it was a good, clever story? Why? I will never understand why movies that are starting well transform into a bunch of crap when released. I hope that in the interest of Freeman and Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, it's never allowed on big screens in America. Like someone with a bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is just ridiculous. I just ... I think the scenario had the potential, but executions made him clich√© and terrible. Just. No.
