I was looking at this film and I was hoping to make something better all the time. What is so great that a person without emotions? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You will never see that Alex shows emotions for someone other than your son. Yeah, I know that's why his son is the only one who will lose his mood (if you can call it), I'll get it. <br /> <br /> The characters are undeveloped, relationships are not getting enough time to understand. In one scene, Sarah says they will not fall in love, and next time we'll see her talking about how she really shaken her because they were so close? There are logical synapses in this movie. It's like someone watching Boogie Nights and writing this part to mimic Little Bill. Even the scene where he loses his mood is the same as when Little Bill filming his wife, except for facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at drawing a man without emotion - he was there, he did it - can you tell Magnolia? This film not only lacked emotions, it lacked its essence, a good script, developed characters and plot. And I definitely miss recommendations. :) <br /> <br />
