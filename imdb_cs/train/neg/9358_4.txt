Since the movie begins, there is an inconsistency. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East and is also an international film, it can be expected that the right accents will be displayed. This is not done because most of the cast American sound. I also think that acting is at best tried, the story is a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very accurate in costume and scenery. If you want to see the movie to get a sense of what it used to be in the past (even if there is a lack of accents) then this film is worth the rent. If you are looking for a film as epic as the kingdom of heaven, look elsewhere.
