I noticed that "The Fire" was on cable at night and I started watching it because I could not remember anything special about it other than I remember it was a terrible movie when I saw it back in 1985. Twenty years later, the film is still terrible. In addition to the synthesizer, saxophone was the most common instrument in popular music in the 1980s, as is evident from the title track. When I heard this song, I once again wanted to snap a screwdriver in my ears to end the sound distress that had been caused to them. And to compose this musical assault, Knight Lowe played the character as a saxophone and there was one scene where he played solo, which continued and continued as Charlie Parker, only his bloody tone and play resembled monkey kazoo. All the characters were very unpleasant, even though I have to say they did a great job when they filmed the same enemy actors. Actually, I thought Mare Winningham was attracted to her and I liked her character at first because she was wearing funny underwear, but then near the end of the movie she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe, who would probably be the most likely to choose a variety sexual illness if such a thing were voted.
