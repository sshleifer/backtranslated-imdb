Fuj! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film was a well-managed story of a man who was already dead and drove the purgatory. The original film had a lot to say and did not get out of the way to say it. And that was a girl on a motorcycle. This version seems to me to be something that the producer bought rights and then left out of interest. It looks as if a group of people deliberately decided to adapt to the 1990s and changed ethnic groups and sex just to be cute. The film does not concern burnout that is about to commit suicide in the last act of defiance. This is a person who tries to get to the hospital to see his wife. There was no reason why this film should be different than to make me angry ...
