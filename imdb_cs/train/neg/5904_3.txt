With the unsuccessful success of the "Army of God," it seems that every Mormon with the camera is now trying to shoot a movie. In the recent "The Other Side of Heaven" it was not bad at all. The movie, without being great, was pretty good. "Singles Ward" is not. When he tells the story of a young, divorced Mormon guy returning to a single life, the style of writing and filming "The Singles Ward" is in many ways, very similar to the comedy of the 80's "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". However, similarities end. While "Ferris Bueller" was humorous, original and well-performing (as far as silly comedies like this are concerned), "Singles Ward" is totally the opposite. They try hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags are either flat or clich√© and jokes you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seems to be worth it to fill the time. And acting, though not horrible, is at best amateur. Besides, if you are not alone Mormon, or very, very familiar with Mormon culture, you will have almost nothing at all. Since the "God's Army" and "The Other Side of Heaven" appealed to a wide range of viewers, both inside and outside the Mormon Church, this film is definitely one big joke, and even if you get it, it's just not so funny.
