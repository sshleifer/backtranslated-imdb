Do not bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on the basis of his own merits, but compared to the original 1972 (which is a classic), it's just really terrible. And BTW, someone remarked that the 1972 film is bad compared to the book. It's stupid, movies should never be judged against the books from which they are taken over. There are two completely different forms of art (as if it were to be emphasized, but apparently it does). If you applied this criterion to all movies, then "2001" will suck, so "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs."
