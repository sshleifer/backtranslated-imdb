My original review of this movie was simply sh * t written 2000 times. Although it was a very accurate criticism, I felt that my review should be a bit more descriptive. I'll start with a lead actress; her facial expression does not change once in this film, does not show fear, happiness, or depression. Her body language skills go down to the point that her eyes from the left and right look and look as if she did not know the jack. It's an impatient chaff that I think has too many botoxes. However, her lack of face expression through the film is overcome by a regretful love affair with the main actor, who appears to emerge from nothing and to set off on the beach and fall in love within hours of meeting each other. The lead actor, whose hair needs more attention than he, was at best average and never felt he was in danger at all. The only thing that is at the top of the horrific acting is the direction, plot, and inaccuracies in the plot. I've seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie. They are not about character development, they seem to say and do things I could never believe in a real person. This movie would not be bad if he tried to be bullshit as the purpose of a snake on an airplane, but it was trying so hard to be a serious action move that I could not even laugh. I think I now have brain tumor watching this movie and thinking about all the different ways I could use this budget and cg to make something much better. If I bought it on DVD, I would crush the DVD into pieces, burn it down and then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid. DO NOT USE THIS FILM!
