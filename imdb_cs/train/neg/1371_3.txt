I can not figure out how anyone could get the movie budget so bad. It's like desperate television, nothing at all. They are buried under a lot of snow, electricity is constantly on and off, but magical is the backlight that remains constant. Where does this (fake) light come from? That and all that stupid guess among the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining each other than trying to figure out how to survive. They try to create a sense of urgency and the people who help. But because it's so bad acting and acting, it's not going to fix your Florence Nightingale with this movie, I'm sorry. I join negative feedback and I agree that it's one of the worst movies ever.
