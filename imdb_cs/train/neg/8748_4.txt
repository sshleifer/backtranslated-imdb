It was interesting to see how accurate it was to write a geek buzz word, yet very naive to the corporate world. The Ministry of Justice would capture more big giants if they won such naive things. The real corporate world is much smoother and more interesting, yet each one is ominous. I seriously doubt that YES would have someone directly kill someone; i mod these days is indirect. In the real world they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This film had to develop some garages, I think, and the studio did not know the difference. They wanted only to look at Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
