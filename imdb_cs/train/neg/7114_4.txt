As for cinematography, this film was quite good in the mid-fifties. Several times, the lighting was too hot, but the shots were generally in the frame and stayed in focus. The deal was above average for a low budget, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were taken too long in an attempt at tension and the effects did not exist. The attack of the skull into the pond should be completely removed from the last cut, and every attempt to bring life to the skull was evident with the chopsticks and strings. I also could not help, but I think the budget did not allow them to supply the house, so they kept talking about those who are moving and that all the things to be stored should be soon. Honestly ... it would be more fun if it were a worse movie. It was not bad enough for the movie to be "good and bad" but it was not so good as to be "good". Get the MST3K version ... it's fun.
