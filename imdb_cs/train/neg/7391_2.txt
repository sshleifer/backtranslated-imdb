Well, like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I will not expect a masterpiece every time I shoot a movie, but I expect the movie to have at least some sorter budget. The main problem with the copy I was watching was horrible over dubbing. I know that in some films it has to be done and I accept it, but when they overcome the way of a completely different acting voice and still make the film, the spell of overcoming. Also, the sets seem to be built without care because in one scene the sliding glass tip in the secret secret lab has a massive crack passing around it. I was really disappointed with this film, and I just hope that another Stevens project will be completed before the movie is sent for a purchase / lease. The story of this film was thinking to me if I was looking at a science fiction movie, or not some parts looked alien but never completely explained what was going on, I find it very confusing.
