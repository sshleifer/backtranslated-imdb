I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story should be in the Algerian Berber terrain, this one was shot in the southern Tunisian desert (a completely different culture, I know that I am from Tunisia and Algeria), the second shocking element was the figure of her companion's aunt, speaks in a film with a very eloquent French, academic academic French, while the character she is playing should be disturbed, never left her mountain type, as alive as Bedouin with this kind of education in this context is impossible. The worst scene and disrespect, especially for the inhabitants of the region, is the "femme repudiee" segment, which is the pure invention of a writer / director, such things will never become Algerian society at all !!!
