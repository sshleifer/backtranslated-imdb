I do not care how many nominations this junk has got for the best, and that this movie is broken. I did not know whether to turn off a set or file a lawsuit with O.J. for unjustified damage to my mental health. I rarely bored; calling this mournful fun is faint in the face of every movie-goer across the planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was uninitiated, the "drama" was emotionless. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this incomplete experience.
