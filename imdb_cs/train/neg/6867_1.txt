We can start with a wooden actress, but this movie is a disaster. When I grew up in NY, I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or people. I'm not a culture advocate, and I find it a hollywoodized piece of rubbish that suits its fictitious, ridiculous culture and language that knows everyone who watches Seinfeld is inaccurate. It's a colossal waste of time, and even worse, it's not entirely interesting because the result is obvious and the confrontational scenes are ridiculous. Who is acting this way? Nobody. <br /> <br /> The name of the writer is Israeli or something like that, but it is clear that he has no idea about the subject he writes about. Looking at his bio, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how he had a real connection with the community. Even average films such as "Stranger Among Us" are better and closer to the truth than this blow. Reading this guy is no wonder he wrote scripts on all C-rated movies that somehow represent stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone, because this scenario is even lower than the bad movie Dolph Lundgren.
