Although in some aspects the seven pounds are solid and interesting in some of his story, the Gabriele Muccino project is rather average. The film becomes more and more dark and manipulating as it moves towards the end: human and emotional heart, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven pounds are more amateur-like Amores Perros Alejandro González Iñárritu and 21 grams, with plenty of shows. The problem is that the story is quite predictable thanks to the movie. That's bad because seven pounds could be really "good" if Ben and Emily got into the right hands.
