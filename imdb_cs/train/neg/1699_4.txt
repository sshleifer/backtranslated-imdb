I'm somewhat a fan of Lynch's work, so I was thrilled to find this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very tired. It's a series of short cartoons that try to show a disturbing and nasty kind of humor. The animation is very rough, no doubt at Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big fat guy who hits his family and acts as a blockbuster for everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this animation, they are probably quite amazed. But if you spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com like me, then these cartoons will not be different from all the other things you've seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists on Newgrounds do a lot better work than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch puts this work on a website, then it fits perfectly with some of the better artists of Newgrounds. But since I saw it on DVD, instead of Newgrounds, I put it 4/10 instead of 7/10, as I would otherwise do. These cartoons are good for the internet, but with the name of David Lynch, I expected better quality both in storytelling and animation.
