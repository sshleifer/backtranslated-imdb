This is the biggest Flop of 2008. I do not know what the director has, his mind is creating such a big disaster. The song was added without the story, the story was shot to fill a 3-hour gap and most disgusting are the action bits that actors played as if everyone had superpowels that can run between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was Anil Kapoor the man who is always the best in playing the role of a villain with a comic that Hinglish speaks ... Akki also does a good job .... But the filmmaker just forgets.
