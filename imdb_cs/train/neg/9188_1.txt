That's the only movie I've seen that Uwe Boll did. I knew he was probably the worst director who always makes video-based movies also that "The House of the Dead" is one of IMDb's 100's. But I still wanted to watch because I was a huge fan of the game and wanted to see what it was has the movie that is so bad. After watching it, I agree that it's crap, the film did not have a story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but a teenage teenage brainless girl running (for a while I was thinking, are the zombies brain-dead? Or the girls are?), Then at night the zombies jumped out of nothing & started attacking people later the woman started shooting I think it's one place and another 5 minutes. Is it a comedy? Or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I slept in the second half and woke up at the end of the credit so I did not, which is a good thing! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please do not make any other movies. Thank you!
