NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror films, but it must be the worst attempt to make someone. The "movie" call is also a stretch. This "random clips-obviously-fake-and-shiny-violence-and-ugly-woman-trying-act-sexy-dressed-wrong-together" is not worth the attention. <br /> <br /> Watch as interesting as watching a random family holiday and have the same quality you would expect if you sent your 10-year-old son to the woods with your new video camera and told him a movie. <br /> <br /> Wonderful.
