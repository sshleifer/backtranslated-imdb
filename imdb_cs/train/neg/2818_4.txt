Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocritical biblical father, archaeologist William Finley, and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by the descendant Mark√Ωza de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in memories, pouring into his cell. The Genie is led by a bullfighter from Muhammad (Juliana Merra) and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), bisexual, who introduces her to opium smoking, leading to wild hallucinations featuring dancers without a hallway, a woman simulating oral sex on a snake , orgy and her father preaching in the background! While the black hooded culture awaits, the eyeballs slip and cut off the throat. When Genie is in her tea to steal drugs, she imagines de Sade hanging from the cross, a golden woman in a deciduous cord, and herself bleeding on a bed covered with snakes. It is all because it is the reincarnation of the lost love of Sade. <br /> <br /> This typically dirty Harry Alan Towers' production is superfluous, frantic and quite nonsensical, but sets, costumes, cinematography, and work on the site are great and there is always something going on. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
