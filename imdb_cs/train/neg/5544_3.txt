While this movie is definitely the smell of a bad film, it is surprisingly observable at several levels. First, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the lead role played by Dean Jagger (unrelated to Mick). While Jagger later went on to play a very respectful role as a supporting actor (even collecting an Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performance is really unique because he has a full hair head (I have never seen him like that before) was by far the worst actor in the movie. This film points out that if an actor can not behave in his earlier films, it does not mean that he can not finally learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. The second reason for watching the film is its sheer syllable Everything. Writing is bad, acting is bad, and special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and the unnamed Cambodian pass through the water, it is obvious that they actually go only to the place and the background is wrongly projected behind them. Moreover, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! Horror continuity and ruthless dialogue all over the film - to such an extent that it is hard to imagine why they did not ask Bella Lugosi or George Zucca to play in the film - since they both played in a number of horror films. In many ways it would be a perfect example for the film class about how to NEVER shoot a movie. So when you give her 3, it's probably a bit exaggerated, it's fun to laugh and short, so it's worth seeing fans of bad movies.
