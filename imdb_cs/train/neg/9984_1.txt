It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the advertised movie on TV. They said it was a comedy! The film started, after 10 minutes, after 30 minutes, and I did not even know. The fact is that the movie ended and I did not even decide to laugh. PLEASE someone dirty me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
