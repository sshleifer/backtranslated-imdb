For some reason, the various young couples who cross the Italian Alps have broken up to find out who will first get their camping. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters the cave, finds the skeleton of the old demonic gladiator, and becomes obsessed with the spirit of the "Tyrant" when he attaches a helmet belonging to the body. After that, he spends the rest of the film, running in the woods, hunting his buddies and hooking from their limbs to join some soul to bring the undead "Demonicus" back to life. This filming on Digital Full Moon is stupid, pointless, has horrible acting and sound and (Los) Angeles National Forest is a bad substitute for Italy. However, it is rather an unintentional laugh, mainly due to the prevailing lead power. Whether it's a caught eye running in a cheap-looking armored weapon struggling with a sword or angry neurotic Latin gibbery about demons and resurrections, it is to be supposed that Kenyon's sensual facial expressions and clumsy line are believed. Well, at least not boring like most of the rest of the cast.
