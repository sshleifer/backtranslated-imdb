The story of the film is not powerful at all, lots of holes. If you approach it as a car movie, it's not bad, lots of great cars in this. The reason I like it is that I'm from where she was shot. I am most delighted and looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and see how the city has changed from 89. It's an interesting historical piece for us local. It seems that whenever a movie is created, everyone wants a relationship to it. It is not possible to find a copy at any of the local camcorder stores because they were all stolen once they came out on the VHS. I had to get a copy of Japan on Ebay. Interestingly, there is a pulling track across the city. I did not know that the director was from St.Cloud.
