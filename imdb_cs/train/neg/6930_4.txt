Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon is a journalist who travels to a madhouse and writes about the new technology they use in their patients. However, the journalist soon finds out that things are not as it seems, and asylum is managed by patients and doctors are in cages. First, some parts of the movie are simply boring and just want to sleep, and interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (guy who thinks it's a chick). I have to admit that the story is really good, but the film itself is a bomb. The music of the movie is really weird and like something you would hear in some crazy comedy, and yes, there is a scene that includes dancing chickens, which I really wanted to turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated: R for violence and nudity.
