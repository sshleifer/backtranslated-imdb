Obviously, most viewers know nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Hitler and Stalin era. Nuremberg (and a lot of forgotten judicial work throughout Europe) was the revenge and injustice of the winners. What do you think there were no US, British, French or Soviet defendants after the Second World War? There were no US, British, etc. War crimes? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn, and so on. The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg, justice was not a reality. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (This was also the title of a book in America, 1941.) This film is a terrible, ignorant brainwashing tool full of mistakes, lies, propaganda, prejudice, and injustice. Above all: full hypocrisy. Not surprisingly ... Why is the Nuremberg process not enough? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hate and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq, and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very clever. Even Stalin would have envied it ...
