I thought this movie looks like a case study on how to make the most movie. Since I am a filmmaker, I give it 2 for consistency. Problems remain from the beginning to the end when the conspiracy is extremely predictable using the bits of most, if not all, previous successful war stories. Computer-generated graphics were too similar to viewing video games in points, and it seemed that the director had no attempt to add realistic story quality. I'm interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what to work with, but I did not find this information. This project seemed to have pushed the boundaries of the low-budget movie too far, resulting in productions that attracted the viewer along with the story without their fantasy. The actors were not bad, but the story needs more innovations.
