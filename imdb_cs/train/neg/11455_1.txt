First, I'll give you an idea of ​​my taste in movies ... 2007 Comedy I Loved: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glory 2007 Comedy I Hated: Evan Almighty, brothers Solomon, good luck Chuck I had watched my first instinct and turned off "Hot Rod" after I got to about 20 minutes. From this I knew the film would not have struck me once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this immortality managed to make money on IMDb 6. Anyone older than 10 years who has enjoyed it must have some mental defect. This is no use with Will Farrell, and it is clear that Andy Samberg can not carry a sketch of YouTube or SNL for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I do not know how to exclude Ian McShane and Isle Fisher from this movie ... they had to have a debt of kindness or something. I came to know that it would be a silly movie, but I thought it would be funny. I did not have so much smirk. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on IMDb movies, but it was so terrible that I just had to warn people. This is only the 4th movie I've seen I feel compelled to rate 1/10.
