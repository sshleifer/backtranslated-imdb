I'm so offended by this movie, it's not funny ... And I thought Mulan was incredible! As long as my Disney expectations were, I never thought they would do something so stereotypical, but that way. There is no respect for any true Chinese culture, just for the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. I appreciate trying to make Wendy a normal teenage girl ... But fortunately, most of the normal teenage girls - especially Asian teen girls - are far less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. And in terms of culture, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are dressed in popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are, are still decent scholars. Another stereotype, perhaps, but quite true. Because it is Chinese parents. That's how the Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted authenticity, Wendy would make an ironic girl with glasses and a relationship of love and hatred with her family. It just adds my frustration to American films. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague nature-oriented phrases that are wise. We do not want to go after a smile, and we do not all know some form of martial arts. We are people, and I would appreciate if anyone wrote an Asian part that does not portray us as a sad cartoon.
