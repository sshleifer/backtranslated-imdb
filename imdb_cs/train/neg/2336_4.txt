On IMDb, I read some ghastly reviews and thought I'd go see the movie. Disappointed. On the side, the men are good and some interesting photographs, but as a whole, this film is not convincing. He seems to be full of his own self-worthing meaning when he tries to say something meaningful, but falls so short, and everything in the picture is an unconvincing mess, one of the films classified as film noir, which can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> , alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc. And together, they thought they were kidnapping a child and overcoming each other, it was a much better film if the story was more restricted to kidnapping instead of a kidnapper's character, I thought female lead was from her depth. she appeared as an amateur actress While some good moments I ended, I felt like I wasted my time unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
