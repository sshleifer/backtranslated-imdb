The novelty of Jay Lena's clear cut is a four-letter letter, the only unforgettable aspect of this formal, uncompromising police partner. In the COLLISION COURSE, the pelican comedian connects with later Pat Morita to track down the stolen prototype of the turbocharger (do you think Car Leno played hand in hand?). The two leads are trying hard, really yes, but Leno is not an actor and Morita is a fish-out-water routine in a hurry. The film has a bit of auspicious 80s but its a lot of times becoming more and more rare as it fills its extended time of 100 minutes. Fans of Lena's great comedy talent will feel tired; everyone else will be bored.
