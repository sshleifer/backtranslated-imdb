The worst show I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have a lot of power, and when they use some special equipment, they turn into strange, poorly designed suits. The effects when not in a retarded suit are decent. It's certainly not good, but not the worst acting I've ever seen. However, when they wear their suits, acting is going from above; much, much worse. Hyper animated idiots have countless unnecessary moves. Even when they talk, they seem to have seizures. The villains are more stupid than the Rangers. Every episode, some feeble, idiot villain comes with some plan to destroy the Rangers. It then sends the power of hyper-animated aliens who attack the Rangers. The Rangers initialize their 10-hour transformation animation and then destroy the aliens. Then he has a badly designed villain, who can be either an armored villain who really looks and acts evil on a humanoid ladybird like a creature with tubes attached to the back that show obvious signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers fight the villains, then the villain turns to Godzilla, whether it's a rain or a nuclear rocket (yes, they burn the nucleation at the creators and the creature turns to giants). Power Rangers spent five minutes playing hyper-animated and called their Zords, which are, of course, toys that showcases producers to use special effects to make them look real. Power Rangers win, villains are crazy, everyone is learning a "valuable" lesson and the show ends. And it is done. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, a fake fight with kung fu.
