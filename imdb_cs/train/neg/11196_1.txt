My friends and I left after 15 minutes, and we were not the first. Then we tried to get the money back. Keeping cinematography would not allow it, but we agreed to see another movie. The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: A former child star. As you can say, it was not an unforgettable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. Close up must be when I saw double headmaster Domestic Ruffle and Heist. Finally, in the interest of mankind, you do not see the Order.
