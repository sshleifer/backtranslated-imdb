A group of people are invited to a high school meeting, but after arriving, they find out that it's a scam of an old classmate who played an almost deadly joke. He is now trying to avenge all those who have hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all the telephone lines. Dark Slasher movie with an extraordinary premise. Putting it in the notch is a few good performances, some rather creative deaths, lots of excitement and fear, some humor and the original ending. Not rated for extreme violence, graphic nudity, sexual situation, despair, and drug use.
