I bought it on DVD for my brother, who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to look at it this week. <br /> <br /> This is a reasonably fun piece that contains two totally separate stories. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was far more interesting than the two. She plays a growing Hollywood actress who has many short incomplete relationships. She literally hit Brian Kerwin (The Normal Married Guy with the Kids) after driving his car into the back. After being initially hostile to herself, she offered her home because she felt comfortable to drive. Romance develops in the end and leads to tragedy when his wife discovers. What's going on at the end, I was not ready, but slow stimulation and routine television overhead capture some drama from the fence. The second section includes the old studio boss, played by Darren McGavin. This part actually has a better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. Everyone wants something from the boss of the studio, but eventually, when asked to step down, everyone realizes that their career will not be anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's time, but it's not all interesting and I'm glad it's not bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she was certainly the only actress to watch in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. In general, however, if you are not a fan of hers, avoid this because it is very routine.
