William Cooke and Paul Talbot share a director / writer credit for this fun low-budget movie about three boys who become in the woods with their horror magazines. The legs supported by the fire and the schoolboy knit up and down ... and the grumpy city tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... of Skinface Glory) traverses and sells four stories of gore in exchange for food and heat of fire. One story is the old protector "The Hook," two teens on a loving street attacked by a demented killer with a hook on his hand. Another story has several torpedoes who need some weed. It strikes a person who knows he has some great person. When he smokes a bunch of sacks, the full skin starts to be gray and green before the bubbles rise and fall. One of the better stories is about the unfortunate person who returns home to Christmas, who can not wait for his mother to fall dead and like to say his nephews and nieces to Satan Claus. The fourth story of the campfire is a greedy sailor who is washing off shore on an empty treasure chest, and eventually being chased into the sea by zombies. Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets a cross-point and really could be much worse. A little nasty, but funny, except for the story of a sailor. Of course, the outcome has not been evaluated. Representatives include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
