Well, one has to give the director a courage. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total of five people (no bonuses at all) but also decided to use sub-par special effects with a confusing and boring conspiracy, he too, and I do not mind, I warn before the start of a movie that you could DIE OF FRIGHT ! However, they promise FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. If you want to have a spooky lying gardener, it's always a good step. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... If you look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen it. They want to show horror movies just to inform you. Good gift for someone you hate.
