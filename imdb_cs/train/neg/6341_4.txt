East Palace, the western palace reminded me a little of the detective, Frank Sinatra as a policeman, and William Windom is a boy. It's a progressive film for China, I think, but it also preserves myths about gay feminine: a lot of Chinese myths in which men take women's roles. The film focuses on a feminine man who wants to desperately dominate and hurt macho boys. He came out of the park without fear - hoping the officer would take him to the station. And that actually happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story when he is subjected to mild torture: he has moved to some time period, binded and let go. That's what the homosexual wants, and implicitly a homosexual man attacks the cop's own image as a male man. The story of a homosexual man's life (which includes flashbacks) is tolerable, but when it begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a regret for Chinese homosexuals who want to fulfill their traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not get together.
