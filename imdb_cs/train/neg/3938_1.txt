Even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could not save this dead fish of the film. To begin with, the screenplay was totally written to become a B-movie, but somehow the Spiritual (looking for a stellar vehicle that would rise from television) and Hutton (looking for "two" "one-two punch" he hoped to define his career after "ordinary people") joined the picture. Cheese lines, big dirty napkins from scene to scene (Come on - who uses napkins after the 12th grade of Telecommunication Classes?) And the simple old bad actor sinks this film. Even the Spiritual is not immune to the evil act of this film. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material. I have to admit that the Spirit has pain when reading the lines that are the voice. As I smiled, when I was sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, he did not prepare me at the end of the Duchon voice: "If you ever need a doctor, do not forget to call 911." If the studio called 911 only, the dog from the movie would never be made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
