The Nutcracker was a somewhat problematic ballet. It has little to do with the original story of ETA Hoffman on which it is based. The ballet is a story basically at the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Sweets Kingdom to see a series of characteristic dances. <br /> <br /> There is an endless series of stage productions that repeatedly interpret the story in many ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the weak ballet libretto. > <br /> Balanchin's version does not have any sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there is a lot of drama and secrets in Tajik's first class music). The result is a completely forgotten Christmas party in the first half, when almost nothing happens and where even dancing (that little of it) is not particularly memorable. The pantomime has an oversupply, especially from Drosselmeier, which seems to be on the stage, just looks stupidly shot for a big screen. Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get into the kingdom of sweets (Act II in the version phase). Although there are several choreographic events, most choreographies are clumsy and unwavering. This is certainly not a vintage Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt he was less successful as the creator of narrative ballets. Watch this movie version of your stage production, The Nutcracker, only reaffirmed this view.
