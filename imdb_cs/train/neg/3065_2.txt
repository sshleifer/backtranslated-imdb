This movie presents times that were made just like the original, I suppose. Which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title "Vanishing Point" is the original, so ironic. I'm sure it was not intended, but the original was shot in 1970 and released in 1971. REAL 'BROWNING BOD' was the end of the era that almost ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake, all anti-cultural elements were removed and demonstrated by more computers in an attempt to reach a wider audience. "Sanitized for Your Protection" The insertion of US Indian scenes was free, and the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" for a trip was subtraction by adding. I'm glad I noticed it, but I appreciated the original much more. The original is classic and gold. This remake is terrifying.
