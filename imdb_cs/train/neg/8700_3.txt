I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons did not try to make serious horror, or even an action movie when they made Carnosaur 3. The film is just stupid from start to finish. Even humor in C3 is fun because it's bad. Definitely high brand of water in the genre "So bad is good". If you like the worst of the worst, it's for you.
