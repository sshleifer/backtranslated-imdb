A spooky, haunted house thriller finds that the American family is moving to a 200-year-old house in Japan where a violent murderous suicidal love triangle has emerged. <br /> <br /> The Roman setting is the only element that is interested in the very slow movement made by director Motel Hell. The film creates a zero strain and consists of some torn scenes that rarely lead anywhere in the world. One example is a fairly early scene when men visit a temple after realizing that his house is creepy, as the monk had warned before. The monk tells the story of the house (whose viewer is already familiar from the initial sequence), and then the film simply cuts off something else. Previously the monk offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family remains in a haunted house as things get worse and worse, and no mention of the monk is done until the very end when he reappears to do what he should have done an hour ago - to try to steer the spirit from home even though he is this time difficult for viewers. <br /> <br /> There are some (probably) unintentional camp laughs when they see how American actors eventually become obsessed with Japanese ghosts and suddenly start doing bad martial arts, I say probably because the scene is more than a little resembling a duel about powered saw blades from the same director, Motel Hell, which was probably more fun, but overall it's a forgotten bagpipe.
