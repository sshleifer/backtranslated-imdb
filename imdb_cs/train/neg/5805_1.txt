Anyone who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin, who is trying to imitate Steve McQueen in a remake post, just does not work. While Baldwin did some admirable work, it's a flop from start to finish. McQueen had a charisma, never trying to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw, he said enough. McQueen looked dangerously, horribly and incredibly like a doctor, the film was excited and tense, Baldwin and society made it comedy, I laughed and just saw this mischievous movie. And that horrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of today's exciting and credible actors! I liked the makeup for Michael what they thought. If you want to see movies as it was under the direction of Sam Peckinpah Get the original!
