A family who travels to a daughter's softball girl decides to take a "scenic route" and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Father is a passionate photographer and when he hears an old abandoned side show in the city, he decides to take another detour to take a few photos. Of course, the next show is full of inbred who quickly kidnap women and leave the young son and father to take care of themselves. <br /> <br /> The only great thing about this movie is how the family really fights against their inbred prisoners. Besides, the film has nothing to do with meaning.
