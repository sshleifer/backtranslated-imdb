I do not know what it was about this film, which made me react so viscerally against it. Perhaps those characters were so neo-rational and not convincing enough to take care of them. Perhaps it was a disorganized story. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long hanging earring and eyeliner. Maybe it was because at some point in the movie everyone is performing in the song. Maybe it was because the 1980s were never the 80s. Maybe it was because everything was a modest exaggeration. Maybe it was because the character propelled her fist as she crashed out of the camera during the fading. I do not know what caused me to hate it, but if it means trying to track again, I'm not willing to figure it out.
