"Child's Problem" is one of the most brutal films ever made. It's not the worst (though some people do not agree with me), but that's not the best. It's a devil seven-year-old boy who has destroyed a comedy plot on a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who foolishly accepted him. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I will not buy one second for a child to behave in this film as rude. It's asinine and absurd, even though I laugh a few times all over (I really do not know why). However, I can not recommend this movie. I know I'm too kind to that. If the issue of child is something positive, it is better than a sequel that was terrible. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
