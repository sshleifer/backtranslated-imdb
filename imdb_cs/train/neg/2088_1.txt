What a terrible show. Science fiction fans seem to be watching anything, regardless of quality. It tells me that something extraordinary, like Firefly, takes only one season, while waste, like the remake of Battlestar Galactica, is melting. This turning point is woeful in all aspects of the show. The effects are juvenile and uninitiated. The characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that was ever in the bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than the main soap opera. Direction is dirty and sets are terrible. Caprica is a loss of film, a waste of time and a loss of effort. This is one division that should never be done.
