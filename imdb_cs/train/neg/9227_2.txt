CQ was the worst movie I've seen this year. Almost every movie I choose to see in the theater is at least fun or has something to say. This film looked as if it were a movie student director for his intro. into the film class. His father makes great movies. His sister was good. But Brother Roman? NO! One critic had the courage to compare this film with Godard's Le MÃ©pris (Demon). While Coppola, Jr. he had the same idea, a film about the film, he tried too hard to be European, artistic and humorous when it was really kitsch. The lead actor carries the same expression throughout the film as if it were either in amazement or shock that this film is around him. Schwartzman can somehow escape his role as a glamorous director. Depardieu is all right. One scene that has some real humor is surprisingly not B-movie scenes, but rather what's happening in Italy; mounting shots of several different characters in a very small car, riding around picking and leaving random people. It was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema I guess I was trying to spoil. Or break it off. Or both. There was even a documentary with the director who spoke to the camera and shot various objects, the end was marked for "twist" or artistic value ... I suppose the most fun thing about this movie is the film itself, not the way it intended. No wonder this movie was sent back after the festival show, which should be reworked or re-recorded, or whatever, making me curious as to how bad it was before. I can not believe it could be worse than this. If you want to see a good movie parody, look at Austin Powers movies. None of them. The opening of the third is more fun and more brilliant than the whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the sake of cinema, PLEASE go back to directing your cousin's music videos. Let the godparents go.
