I got a copy of this movie because it was a 1964 film called "Zombie Bloodbath" as one of its alternative titles. Surprisingly, this movie has a better rating on this site than the title above; which may mean the other one is really bad! This film is also bad; of course you can not go to a movie called "Zombie Bloodbath" and is expected to see a masterpiece and in fairness holds a title with a lot of gore on display ... but everything feels very old and tired that does not help the horrific and silly line conspiracy. It's just an average nuclear stain that causes people to turn to zombies and the like. The movie begins with a sequence that sees people melt and usually let you know why you are for them; low quality zombie trash. There's a lot of gore in the movie, and it's really a good job, otherwise the movie would really be boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap as well, and it was made by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence was Romero's superior day of the dead, though it could really be just something that contains zombies and gore. Everything comes to a typically predictable and unnecessary end and I can not say that I have impressed him!
