Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good, you are a better person than me! This film, while the great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very little to being honored or even being a film of some substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue is torn from old L + H films and is unrealistically deprecated, conspiracy is useless, insignificant characterization of other unnecessary stars, Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, he also tried hard to create a great mix Mr. Hardy. Where was the (good) music number? Edits are upset, they're stiff, the lines are horrible, physics is - unusable - (though maybe they've been trying to make it feel cheaper?) And overall, it's a terrible thing that you're witnessing. It is still painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made his last film in stunning 1950s writing and photography. Make a favor and watch as much as possible of Laurel and Hardy's original films and find out how things were. You know what MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not respond to any sentence with half-witted witches. <br /> <br /> The compassion of anyone who thinks it was a decent update / boys' honor. Where was the CLASSIC SONG theme?!? Why Destroy 'Here's Another Great Disorder'? Why skip 'some wiser'? Why was there an absurd group of stars? WHY MISS GULCH FROM WIZARD OF OZ ???? WHY LARRY HARMON MUST HAVE IT? Why BOZO! And did the study channel help finance the cause? I mean seriously. Fart jokes, for God. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
