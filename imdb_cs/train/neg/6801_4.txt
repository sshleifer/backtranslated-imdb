First of all, I'm not going to tell you why I was renting this movie because I was still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air rage is much like any movie I've seen where the plane is hijacked. Of course, there is one important person in the plane and the hijacker is looking for revenge. It is sad that some methods to stop hijackers have already been used in other films. Do we really become so vaguely so fast? Though it is Ice-T (which for some incomprehensible reasons makes painful attempts at ACTING, when not busy by "c" back before the rap), who is celebrated on the cover, the film actually stars less than the amazing Kim Oja as a flight attendant, which is 'surprisingly' interrupted by the five hijackers who naturally come back to go through them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I could recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania of "Seinfeld." I can not forget to leave my favorite part of the movie when the hijacker used about POUND from PLASTIQUE to blow the door lock ... BRILLIANT. The plot was unnaturally predictable. Scenario - horrible. I got to the point where I could say something, which I think would be stupid and it would be the next line in the movie. As for the special effects ... the only thing about this movie is that I have unnecessary electricity costs to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. And the title - the film DID takes place in the air. But due to less than stellar performances, the only Rage in the movie was the viewer. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to even choose a movie just because it's bad. Please SAVE YOU, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS.
