Seriously, what is it? Hooper made such classic movies as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then made a godsome movie about what happened? fell into the crack a little too much? This movie is about a guy named Sam who has the ability to light up things (Firestarter, someone?), Actor was crazy, conspiracy was litter, and special effects were tremendous rubbish, looking like something from the 70s. Van Damme should be delighted that Derailed is not the worst movie ever and what was the end? the blue light started to shine, turned into a glowing blue blob, drew a friend a fire, and the film ended. WHAT IT WAS? HUH? when the film ended, I hoped the DVD burned spontaneously to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> STAY FROM THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> I do not know, OBEY, thank you later.
