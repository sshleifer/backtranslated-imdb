Garson Kanin wrote and directed this view of Las Vegas's "modern day" and the gap between generations, his first directing efforts since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat unclear as the casino owner who reunited with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disturbingly like Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene in the same way: defensive, with a chip on his shoulder. When you play this role in coolness and kindness, you ask too much from Janssen, who barks on everyone as a nasty husband who summons him (he even chews on Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, who is trying to find his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people watch Las Vegas (giving them another ten years), and his disagreement with Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-styled secretary, and Edy Willaims has fun as a showgirl for bankruptcy. Unfortunately, where it is in place, there is nothing more than it is today in terms of ethics between adults and their children, some quick T & A shots and fun crazy satirical pieces in the gambling world - most of which were covered, ad nauseum. ** z ****
