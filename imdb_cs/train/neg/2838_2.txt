Skip the mission: Galactica and look at the original episodes of Living Legend. The network took part 1 and 2 of the Living Legend and killed them in a plot with a terrible episode of Fire In Space. Although Galactica suffered from networked writing and lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of television series in 1978. Fire in space is itself one of the worst episodes. As a historical remark, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek and then the revival Trek series, and you will see the difference in quality between the sci-fi produced in the network and the syndicated sci-fi.
