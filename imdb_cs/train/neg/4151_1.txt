This is probably the best horror film ever since Ed Wood died. <br /> <br /> I can not spoil the end because I have no idea what happened. But I'll try the best. There are some lesbian vampires, but they keep changing bodies, so any character may or may not be the character you think it is, or it could be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a sound? It's not as confused as you think, because none of the characters make sense to start. There is no conspiracy, no character development, and random people appear, speak a few lines and then disappear, never hear. There are also zombies who are * likely * enemies of vampires, but there is also a dream in a dream in a psychiatric hospital, so maybe nothing has actually happened and it's a hallucination of the main character. <br /> <br /> Waking up? Both leading girls shortly cut their shirt. The special effects are simply overwhelming (especially I enjoyed incredibly slow, unpleasant combat sequences). Everyone has a really stupid Canadian accent that raises the general level of gaiety. <br /> <br /> It's worth the price. We laughed when we cried.
