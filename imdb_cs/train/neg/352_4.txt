It seems that the cast should provide at least average film. So I sat down for 102 minutes of infidelity. Apart from Ed Harris, it seems that no one has the ability to play. Even Sean Connery, who I normally worship, had to have an absent day during the whole Just Case. Not once in the movie did one actor convince me. The film caused this movie to look cheap and unreal. The story gets a little worse. It's exciting and the fence is unexpected. Conclusion just watch this movie if you really do not have anything more useful.
