Terry West had a good idea with this movie. It simply did not happen. There are endless shots of the horror-looking outdoors of the school, which last forever and is likely to replace the operating time of the film. There are only 2 students in this school. Misty Mundae is as good as usual, but this movie will always be Ruby LaRocce (which is the only reason the movie looks at the beginning). If the screenplay focuses on her interest, we should watch the movie. It's so fun! Good news for DVD buyers, older (and better) Terry West movie "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is the movie that feels like someone who is not good at punching at the end of a long joke that has such a feeling. Then again, just look at Ruby LaRocca.
