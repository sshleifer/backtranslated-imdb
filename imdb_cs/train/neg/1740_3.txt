The film was a great disappointment. Especially because Priyadarshan was driving him, it was sad to see such gloomy standards. The bad scenario (almost nonexistent) and the sequence of songs with bad songs every minute and most odd times killed any humor that the film could offer. Some of the scenes were fun, but it's about 5 minutes long. The cut was pathetic. Depressing! the overall film was disappointed because the lack of a story was only obvious. In fact, only a few people remained watching the other half of the film after the interval. <br /> <br /> One would not miss anything if you do not watch the movie. It's not worth spending money on tickets for this movie. wait until it appears on TV ...
