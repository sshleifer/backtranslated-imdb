I can not believe I lost my money to rent this movie. I thought it was porn when it started, and it was never better. He plays, music drowns actor. Grapes. Save Money! You have to read the film all the way b \ c knew that the music drowned the speakers. I have never received part of the slaughterhouse or the need to further show that cows and pigs are being prosecuted. What was this to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were not famous actors and actresses in this movie. The script would take me to the first reading page. It would be better if you saw the color dry.
