I'm a big fan of the movie. I like movies of all kinds. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I get that book being watched closely, which means not everything should be in the movie. Especially because the authenticity of experience in the book has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not strange, they are mentally ill. Things that happen are not fun, they are disturbing; especially given that they are true. <br /> <br /> This movie was felt by The Royal Tenenbaums, another film I hated, just running with scissors was still dysfunctional and less fun. <br /> <br /> I will never get those hours again. I wanted to talk to my brain.
