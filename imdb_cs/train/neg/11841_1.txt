What happened to Peter Bogdanovitch? Once a great director, a blazer trail ... now he scratches at the bottom ... Is he the same man who drove "The Last Picture Show"? Here is a rather interesting (and yet neglected) assumption and turns it into a bubble gum that will lose taste when you have the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is like Chaplin and everyone else seems to be actors to be rendered for their "prospect", not because they were right. Very bad. I'll go and rent the "Paper Moon" again.
