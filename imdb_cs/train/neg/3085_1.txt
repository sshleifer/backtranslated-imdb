Description: Corny, absolutely stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and deceptive you will be interested in why these abnormally stupid people even unnecessarily paid for 2 months budget (I guess ...) probably not more than $ 700 to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br/> <br/> you save your time, life and money by NOT - repeat, NEVER even wonder if you should see this movie. This movie is so frantic that your face will turn violet hateful boredom. If you have single-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this totally contemptuous movie. Maybe you really admire it. (As I said before, if you have a single digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 actors, several puppets that you bought in the garage shop and of course the cameras and music, you will do a bit more fun home video than this piece absolute crap.
