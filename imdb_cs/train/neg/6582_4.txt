Geez, another Lifetime movie, but again not the worst movie in the world but far from the best. I think the main problem lies in the fact that it is quite clear who is responsible for it and it is generally quite predictable. Even worse, some flashes ended by being confusing, and the spectator thought, "Well, how much do I care?" One thing I wanted was that the movie will show you that it's never as simple as "good guys are good and bad guys are bad," and sometimes it's evil and evil rather than good vs. evil. Hadley did not do what she did from the sense of justice, she did it because she felt she was entitled to work for being a family, And to eliminate competition. As for Alicia, he simply proves that the victim is not always a good person. Some of them really "come", although "it" was painful, terrible death. "Burning Bed" is a great example of this, but the difference is that the nasty man in The Burning Bed won exactly what he deserved. But Alicia "comes"? Some will say that she did, but others disagree and do not have the law in general. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's a mixed bag. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just find their role indifferent. They were mostly wooden or simply unconvincing. The music was pretty decent and some of the scenes are pretty and brown, especially if you like girls / girl action. The film is not badly shot, but unfortunately, due to its sharp weaknesses, there are strong backgrounds. I've heard of the rumors about the sequel, but I doubt the flight, It's going to happen. But I would not be surprised if the sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is just as bad, scary and terrible as people say, then I do not think she thinks, "YAY! I woke up coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? That's fine! And they want the fees to be reduced ! "Hadley would not have been in prison for a long time had she never had any murders. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's worth trying at least once!
