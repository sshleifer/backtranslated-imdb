This movie has tried to be too many things at once: stabbing political satire, hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family value promo ... the list goes on and on. All of them unhappily failed, but there was an interest in me to stop me from stopping to the end. Though I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC, it suppresses me when I see such a frenzied effort, especially when it is intended to reflect the lack of serious criticism, rather than just the wrong writing, direction and production of this film. <br /> <br /> There is a criticism that needs to be done about the corporatisation of the war. But the temptation reduces the real atrocities of what is happening to her. It reminds me a bit of THREE Kings, which trivializes the real cause for concern.
