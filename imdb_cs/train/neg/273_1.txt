The mark of classical film is that it is born as a fine red wine. This film is not Cabarnet and definitely no Casablanca. I agree with other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that makes us now at night-time doing sit-coms and dialogue is stiff and sermon. But let's look at the obsolete film theme. With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. From observation on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman was exposed as a lifeguard Bidenesque with her so-called Real-life story "Julia" from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most responsive numbers of Western-European apologists, it is clear that her theme in play and film was to get America to act to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from fascists who have just demonstrated their military superiority in Spain. As one reviewer rightly said, it is not pro-American gameplay and film because Lillian went to her grave by the American Communist. This film chronicles such a famously humorous fool of intellectual elite that has created the American left as well as the full moon Levak Today's Kos, and Michael Moore has bought theory of plot and once again provided help and comfort to those who destroyed America.
