No need to say that their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused ... Leo McCarey's OK comedy has laid the narrative framework for William Seiter's masterpiece SONS OF THE DESERT (1934), with L & H playing occasional casualties, forced telling a huge lie that defies in an extraordinary way. Much of this is very funny, especially the scene in which Stan is sued by Deslys, which leads to a push and shove game. However, some of the fun is the undercut Oakland and Flowers, playing their roles totally straight, which adds an unpleasant element to the "henpecked husband" scenario. It was originally released in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
