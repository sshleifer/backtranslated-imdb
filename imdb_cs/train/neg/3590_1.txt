How little can someone dive when they try to capture old glory? ST: HF will like to show you. <br /> <br /> If you're used to see what happened for a good Star Trek show, do not look at it. <br /> <br /> Writing is a hodge-podge, the rendition of the actors of their character is weak and especially the design work is totally doggy. <br /> <br /> Just like watching the captains, do not look here! Like the Federation's strong stance? Forget it here! The Starfleet is ridiculed by the stars that wear SPIKES in their hair. While the seemingly mentally weak captain is mixing in about two minutes from the introductory programs, Ensign Spikey is trying to hold an exam with an engineer. Since then, it has only been getting worse. No, even the uniforms do not match, for the good. They are too small or too big, collars down into the chest, and TNG Seasons One and two uniforms blend in with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. Strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals that are missing in this production up to jogging! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which is getting a bit better with every season. OK, I took it back. Who uses CG unsuccessfully? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Do not be bothered by it, it will insult your Star Trek sense just like me. Even throwing back to the previous show can not save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I cried openly as I watched it, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost cracked. So bad.
