This is a very confused film. The film is very hard to watch, and the conspiracy simply does not make sense. Fury Wolfman was made in Spain, and I think that when a movie is nicknamed from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it did in the first place. Maybe it's part of the problem, but I doubt she can read all the problems with this movie. Dabing is pretty bad and the voices do not really match the characters. Scenes are fragmented, there are a number of strange and irrelevant characters that make the viewer a little more. What I liked in this film was the look of the werewolf himself and the scene where he invaded. Now, if they could put it together and make some sense, they could have something. Do not waste time on this.
