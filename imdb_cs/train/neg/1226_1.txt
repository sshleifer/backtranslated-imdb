My, how powerful they fell. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she definitely went crazy when she took that role. This film is bad for one reason: it loses logic. His look looks like one of those films that would be successful with all hole holes if it came out in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it just looks really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. The detail of the story, Della (Kim Basinger), is just getting from buying gifts in the business center and is being harassed by a group of gangsters who eventually killed a cop who came to help her. Since then, this idiotic desire to go through a deserted street and rid them one by one with tools full of tools. <br /> <br /> So many things are wrong in this movie. As I said, this film jumps over logic every step, and with the exception of Kim Basinger, acting is bad for television. Hell, this pseudo thriller is bad. The way he kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian, and 1 African American, who all gather to expel a Caucasian woman.) The way she killed hispanic woman hated me hysterically. in the left field, so it's shaking your head in shame, I recommend it to lovers of bad movies and no one else, anyone else, especially fans, Kim Basinger would not do this movie well, do you want to see the actress you respect in the movie so badly? You were warned.
