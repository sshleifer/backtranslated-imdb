Based on the self-service novel by a friend and friend of F. Scitz Fitzgerald, this fragile story was written by cleric Sheriff Graham. Gregory Peck continues to shamelessly surplus as a strong drunk alcoholic; contrary to the soft and soft-spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the Fitzgerald period of writing Hollywood, late in his life, a much honored author was actually living a peaceful life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was still not well known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to recycle his flapper stories to support his wife (in a psychiatric hospital) and her daughter (college). Living in a small flat and driving a second-hand Chevrolet, his life was 180 degrees different than the one shown in this movie. Virtually every twentieth-century Fox movie created during Daryl F. Zanuck's lead, as well as almost every film directed by Henry King, was an excellent piece. Beloved non-believers were the exception.
