He saw another trailer on this video and decided he would go when it came out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is extremely boring, acting (except for Christopher Walken) is bad and I could not take care of the characters except that she really wanted to see Nora's husband broke. The role of Christopher Walken is such a determination as to irritate!
