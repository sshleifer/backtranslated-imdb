Why do people who do not know what specific time in the past felt the need to try to define time for others? Replace Woodstock for the Civil War and the Apollo moon landing with the Titanic Sink, and you have a realistic shot, just like this soap-making operation is populated exclusively with low life litter. Were they kids too young to go to Woodstock and who failed to attend school? "I will show you the old ideas, I will unveil my own film, and prove that you do not have to know what's going on about your subject so you can still make money!" Yeah, we already know that. One thing that watched this movie was just a little insight into the idea of ​​subclasses. The next time I look at the color that looks like Diane Lane, I'm running the other way around. It is child abuse that allows parents to unnecessarily raise children. It's the abuse of the viewers only to make Woodstock and moonlanding lean as if it ipso facto means a film portrait of 1969.
