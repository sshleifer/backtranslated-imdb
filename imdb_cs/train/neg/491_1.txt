As others have said, this film is critically inaccurate in the performance of the artist's life and I was very disturbed and offended ... by turning her rape into a tragic love, for her culprit being responsible for "awakening her talent "by completely ignoring her work by turning her into a sexual subject, farther and further, you get an idea. I also find it disturbing that people who are unfamiliar with Gentileschi will see this film and leave with that impression.
