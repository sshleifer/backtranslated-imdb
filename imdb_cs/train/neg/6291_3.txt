Now I have had the pleasure of watching the funny comedy of the Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughing until it hurt the types of films. So naturally I wanted to see the sequel, I hope it will be the same laugh, but instead Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is made by an American Pie where it is tasteless and defeats the purpose of the first film. Yeah, the first movie is naked, but it does not appear in every scene. Also, the plot is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but it could be a little more original. The only thing I'm glad is that no old actor from the original movie ever appears in this movie because it would be blatant or really stupid. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda deal only after 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a wealthy family, but they are quite happy with Ron and Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid that Ron will take his job. So they go to Miami for a bachelor party and Todd make sure he catches Ron into a picture that will make Melinda change his mind about marriage. Bachelor Party 2: The last temptation has a couple laughing back and forth, but over everyone can not deliver what the first film has achieved. These guys, Ron's friends, were more unpleasant than sympathetic, except Seth, it was a bit funny. The only sympathetic figures besides Seth are Ron and Melinda, everyone else gets more or less nervous. Do you want to watch this movie? Just look at Girls Gone Wild, it's the same thing, just do not try to pretend it's a movie. Get closer to the original Bachelor Party, that's a movie that gets you in tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
