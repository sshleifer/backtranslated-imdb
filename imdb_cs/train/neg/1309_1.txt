This movie was extremely boring. This should be at least 15 minutes. The pictures of the injured child and the animal were a little worrying. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments, but this was so bad that she has so many good and excellent comments. I think in this case we are a step closer to honoring this title. What else can I say? In this movie, I fell asleep three times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from an 8-hour sleep. I think it's on its own. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between the characters, except maybe 2 sentences at the very end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep, when you look, do not try to rewind and recharge, because you will fall asleep again.
