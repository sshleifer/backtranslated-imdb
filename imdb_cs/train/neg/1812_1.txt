Immediately go and hunt for the movie. It will be at the bottom of the local video store and will be covered with dust. Nobody will touch it in a few years. It can even be $ .50 special! It's worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy! There are not too many films to compare - a celluloid version of that goo, which after a few years forms at the bottom of the basket. Yes, I put it "1", but it really deserves much lower. 1-10 scales have not been designed with such things.
