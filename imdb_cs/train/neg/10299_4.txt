I have to admit that I stuck here when I thought something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes ... and its liquidation. I was wrong. It was Betty's cinema, which closed the first part of Mordant Morven on the beach. I really do not care what the young girls from Scotland are doing, what screws they use, what they use. Visually, the Cabo de Gata walk in Andalusia was pleasant and definitely the highest place for me. Nadir was a workshop for her dead friend. As the film approached, I had two thoughts ... 1. Is that all that is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed her. Rename it. "Colorful boring, or what I did on my way to Spain." I'm so crazy that I've pulled these things out.
