You must realize that when the star title is incorrectly given in the initial credits, you are not in good time (credit value is "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some nice car chases, shoot them out and throw them out if all you want is action because the relationship to what exists is at best unclear and absolutely unbelievable. The motivation of the characters, especially those at Gooding's end, are worse than incredible, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly confused. The only thing I think is that Andy Cheng must be a really nice guy to get a lot of good actors in this foul (he can not have anything for all of them).
