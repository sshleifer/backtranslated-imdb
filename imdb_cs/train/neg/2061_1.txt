The only film I've ever left. Amazing because I paid for myself and my day and I'm really inexpensive. But my brain was no longer able to accumulate, especially because I could write more fun stuff until I approached and teased it. From the beginning to the end, this film is offended. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny, and now it's not funny. Even worse, this film is the beginning of the end of a really smart, sophisticated comedy. It's a youthful, really sophomore scenario, and ideas have begun in the era (which continues to this day) where cheap laughs and sexual raids dominate the comedy culture of the film. Sexual Olympics? What was not a little girl in high school? The beginning of the end.
