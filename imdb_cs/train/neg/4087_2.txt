In the first part of my review, I usually talk a bit about a conspiracy, but there is not much talk in this movie. Just mish-mash other FAR better sword and witch epic. Insufficient coherence runs uncontrollably as well as banality. Even the main villaness refuses to wear clothes other than loincloth is quite boring while she has quite a young boy's chest. Slightly fun in its inappropriateness at best and heavily retarded is the worst. Lucio Fulci knocked down the barrel and showed it. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Poster and Static Galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and American and international theater trailers <br /> <br /> Eyed Sweet: Sabrina Siani is at all times chubby (some may find it tempting, they did not); Various accessories are also topless
