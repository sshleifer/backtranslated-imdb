I expected it to be much better. I like Tim Burton's work so I was really excited to see these online short films. Well, they were not what I expected. I do not know what it is that I do not like. I think they're just boring. The sound is bothering me and most of the characters even though I like Roy's toxic boy and Stainboy. Episode Match Girl probably missed me, though it was quite funny. <br /> <br /> I also do not like the way some of the characters die. Just like Match Girl basically lit a gas station or how the Girl Who Stares generally died. Roy's death was surprisingly fun. The Death of a Car Freshener. Very original ;-) That made me so laugh ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not good for kids. Just some language and gore. That's all I have to say! 3/10
