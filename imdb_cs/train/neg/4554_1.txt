Bingo is a game, bullshit is a name. Rarely, the screen blurred with such a swollen swing of half-baked conspiracy theories, a Puritan pruder, and a newborn madman. A large part of the story is located in the tourist resort of Viciente in the Peruvian jungle. Do you think that Tolkien's Rivendell meets the planet Star Trek Baku, inhabited by sober followers of the not-so-mysterious but surprisingly narrow-minded cult of love and peace. Thanks to the stunning acting and cheap production design (especially the ugly visualization of the mysterious "ubiquitous energy" in the rainbow color), "Celestine prophecy" looks and looks like a discarded 1980 episode "Twilight Zone." Real mistakes about the history and nomenclature of the Church are rich. I can not believe Hector Elizondo has agreed to be part of this. Perhaps it was done without his consent, Bowfinger's style. Let the Lord have mercy on the director, the writer, the author of the novel, and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book.
