Reportedly, a "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in rural areas since the 1970s, "Nightmare" is full of bad stereotypes of the southern world, supplemented by false accents. Not only would it be unacceptable for the sensitivity of most southern Americans, such a frantic work emerges as just hidden babe in prison films - especially in its unreleased original version. However, acting is generally above average and late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making audiences hate it - although he looks a bit uncomfortable in several scenes. There is also a change-role-tempo for late Robert Reed, who appears as a lecherous guardian, and Tina Louise (formerly ginger from "Gilligan's Island") made a rather credible sadistic prison guard. My level: D. <br /> <br />
