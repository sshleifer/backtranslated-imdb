It's a cruel film. Two gloomy young women swear and torture middle-aged men. He does not have much to deal with as a conspiracy or "spoiler". I would just like to point out that the end is almost the most insignificant part of the film. Much of the film includes Locke and Camp, who are uncomfortably spitting and smile at the camera all the time. Add a soundtrack that is repeated over and over again, including the Vaudevillian song about "dear old father," which suggests that the viewer has never seen ink-hearted quality. Music is initially uncomfortable and eventually exposes the viewer to torture worse than shown on the screen. The theme here is the youth amok, which is understandable as a reaction in the 1960s, but it is done with little imagination or style. Avoid!
