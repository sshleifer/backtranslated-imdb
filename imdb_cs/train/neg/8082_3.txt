It was one of those late night hours "It's there" I saw it. Sometimes they are great. This was terrible, but it really should not have been. The film was really good acting. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We are here talking about the Oscar win. It had good special effects. She even had a really good goat! And I mean nice, full breast with full nipple and a beaver in one place. But it did not match the missing folder - the story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not mean the "solar crisis" of the sun exploding things, but that was bad enough. It was the rest of the stuff - oh so stupid and absolutely predictable things of evil society. The person who made STANK! No such amount of good game or cold space ships or combat scenes could get around it. <br /> <br /> I saw that these members are incredibly well. I've seen great science fiction films that have miniature casts and budgets. All the difference is in writing.
