Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town of Reverand, who married Martha (Ally Sheedy), but it is also custom that he decides to fake his own death to escape his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovic). However, there is an amnesia attack (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old kitten who is borrowing for a good Reverand in "Misery" shades. It's sad to see the pretty good rank we've lost. He is not even the smallest John Savage in a terribly forgettable role of a dirty private investigator. In the movie inlaid as a "black comedy," one has to bring two elements into that movie. While it brings the former in pikes, it sadly does not contain any of them. Moreover, you can not emphasize any of the characters and therefore you have absolutely no interest in them. Technically not just a bad movie just extremely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanoviƒç gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> Where did I see it: Showtime Showcase
