I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another of her movies, so when I saw the $ 5.50 protocol on Walmart, I bought it. Even if it's fun, the movie will never play again. Some scenes, such as the party scene in the bar, take too long and really have no purpose. Then, of course, there is a preposterous scene at the end of the film, which gives the whole film a bad taste when it comes to me. I do not think this scene has ever joined the movie. I do not like the stupid comedies that try to teach me a lesson written in the early 60's, especially! <br /> <br /> Finally, although I'm glad to have a different Hawn movie, I'm not really worth the money I paid for it!
