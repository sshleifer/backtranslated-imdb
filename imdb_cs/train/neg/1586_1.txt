I'm probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book on which this film was based. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see his movie version. After watching the movie I was completely disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the name and character names. The book features the Schwarzenegger character on the show. The main goal is to survive. But he's not in the arena. He is released in the city and must escape the game show (I think you would call it) of villagers who have absolutely no resemblance to film characters. This assumption has built up a lot of tension and hanging and ended up very much with the climax. The film was an absolute garbage. There was no film quality. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he was angry with this.
