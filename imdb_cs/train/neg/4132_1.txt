The introduction of cinematography at the beginning of the 21st century allows for various evil creators and evil guys. We have not seen such things since Godzilla in King Kong, and so on. It always sounds great on paper when you knock and in the fog of good things you have an inspired idea and you will see the whole game before you like Beethoven's symphony. Then you come to write. Great ideas like all vampires are feminine. Ergo hot, seductive deadly, but they want to perish somehow. And all the zombies are men. is that what a woman thinks of a woman just after she was thrown or cheated correctly? So it all looks good than it actually does. Then it begins to rot. Nothing will happen. Another fight. Philosophical noodles and cod. We found Eureka how to win. Big fight again and again. It sounds great, is not it? If it became independent, it would be great. But this is Hollywood with a look at the money: shine instead of what the fans want. Everything could be beautifully soaked.
