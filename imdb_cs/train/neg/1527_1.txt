If you really want to really throw two hours of your life, follow these steps: <br /> <br /> 1) Check out the TV lists. 2) Find the movie "Men in White". 3) When "Men in White" appears, sit down and watch. And that's all. After two hours of bad nails, horrible (and not entertaining) movies, and experiencing something with the smallest production values ​​you've ever done in recent history, you've lost two hours of your life unnecessarily and wondering exactly why. <br /> <br /> Why did I do that? I was stupid enough to think that this movie might be really good. It was not. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, if you're old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you could see some familiar faces during the movie. Saban (who also produces the Power Rangers) is likely to save on production costs and has decided to splatter old monster costumes from the most popular cheap toys in the film. I've seen a lot of old monsters out of the episodes I've seen since I was a kid, so I think it could be said to have some nostalgic value. But if you want to see the real performance of the Rangers Monster, watch the Power Rangers themselves. It's much better than this waste. (And it says something!)
