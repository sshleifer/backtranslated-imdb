I have a copy of this on VHS, I think they (television networks) should play it every year for the next twenty years. Let us not forget what it is and remember that we do not make the same mistakes again. Just like putting some people into the director's chair, where they do not belong. This Rappin film is like a Vaudeville musical instrument for those who can not sing or act. This movie is just as fun as trying to teach the "blind" driving a city bus. John Hood (Peebles) just got out of jail and headed back to the old quarter. In service time to the obvious crime of necessity. John goes back to the old street and greeted her with the old ladies' dogs and peer friends as they danced and sang all the way. I would recommend it if I were sentimental, or if it is true that someone is smoking a medical apothecary prescribed by a physician for glaucoma. In any case, it's badly controlled, scripted, committed, and even made (I never thought I was sitting), the satire of ghetto life with 'Hood'. Though I think the redeemed part of the story, through tiny combat sequences of fighting and dance numbers, his friends care for their neighbors and want to save the ghetto before it is destroyed and cleansed. <br /> <br /> Forget Sonny the spoon, Mario could win Oscar for it compared to Rap. Well, if you find yourself wanting to laugh foolishly and three quarters in embarrassment, first drink. <br /> <br /> And please watch carefully. (No Star, next time!)
