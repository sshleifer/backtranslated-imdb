does anyone think this show really helps some people, or does it just angry people watching it? when I walked through the channels and came halfway to this show to watch for morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. what I do not know is when his viewers are like him or are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what to say. Pat Roberson has little effect. he is an old man who thinks the old way. the fear of damnation no longer has the same effect as it once (thank God). now, if somebody answered my question, I'll get rid of lightning for the rest of my eternity.
