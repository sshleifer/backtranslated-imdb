Again, the film classic has redesigned unnecessarily with predictable disastrous results. The title is fake, just like everything about this movie. The period is not convincingly provided, and leadership seems too young and too flawed to be even criminals. The Artu≈°e Penna had style, humor, looks and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version does not exist, it will still be an unnecessary movie. The 1967 version vanished from the reality, introducing the charming version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative for 1967 and had some excellent performances that allowed you to take care of. This 1992 remake looks more like the original movie than the truth as it is known, and the actors in this version are call, reluctant and least interesting. This way, skip this step and I hope the 2010 version will be better. Could it be worse?
