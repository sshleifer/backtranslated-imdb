The concept of the potential and it was fun to see these two holiday icons, but ... Rudolph's glowing nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this film - like the power in Star Wars movies did not need explanation of "medics in the bloodstream". But most of all, the movie left me cold because Winterbolt's complicated conspiracy destroyed Santa. He has the power to put ideas into human minds, so why does things make such a huge way? Breaking the spells of Rudolf's nose, framing Rudolph, impending fusion of the Frosty family ... Comedy exaggerated drawings of Pinky and Brain and "Phineas and Ferb's" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (who are doing so purposefully and playing laughs) seems to be simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt, who is expecting us somewhat seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a strange (and fun) strange moment when a character throws his two weapons on a bad guy like boomerangs. I understand if they do not want shotguns in a family movie, but why do they have their weapons in the first place?
