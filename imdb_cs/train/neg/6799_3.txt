do not expect much from this movie. In many respects, this film resembles a film that Doris Day played in 1956, the title, Julie. In this movie Doris, who was a flight attendant, a stewardess, at that time the aircraft carrier landed after her upset husband who played Louis Jordan shot captain. She did a much better job, more convincing than Kim Ojah, who took control of 747 and managed to land without much help from the control tower. I know about 747 planes, I'm the airplane myself. Like I said, do not expect much from this movie, it was done with a cheap budget. Manufacturers had to use the plane with the name of the airline cheaply. Oceanic is one name that used several movies. The only letter on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft.
