I did not expect much from this movie, but brother, what a smell is. I found this gem in a huge box of awesome DVD $ 5 on Walmart (where else)? As inexpensive as the disc was, I feel it was broken. Special effects looked at them at college, camera work was destroyed by static tripods and striking lighting, and acting was a perfect example of a "Christian school". It is possible to imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" of the production company when they saw how to go back - the people who banked this thing had to have serious antibiblical feelings about the failed production company that took the matter out. Think about their misery as they see their $ 914.86 investment rising in smoke. Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - maybe Xian filmmakers have to look at GOOD movies and try to copy some of that good. Believing stories and characters, less hysterical shoulders and fanatism, oh, and a story that appeals to - everyone - not just true believers. I.e. Stop the sermon, save it for the Church. Take, for example, a series of Omen or Prophecy. Outstanding movies with stunning story lines, great cinema and intense music. No hysterical waving of hands. No sermon. If this movie laughed, it would be much better.
