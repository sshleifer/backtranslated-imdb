All the naked woman on the chest in the world could not prevent me from stopping a shot about a third of the way through this terrible waste. With wild talk, the same terrible scenario and the poor CGI FX to match; this film is an insult to the Werewolf genre. This should be serious, which would be fun if it could even reach the level of a bad joke. This is one of the movies where people are obviously competent but they are too lazy to do something even a quarter decent. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies. <br /> <br /> 0 of 10!
