At the time this movie was released, I saw Chorus Line 4 times on the stage and was eager to wait for the long-lasting film production of the story. My wife and I were in a few hours before the cash box opened on the day the movie was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a hip in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First, the story was "moved out", so talk, by including scenes that are not in the theater. These limitations are a big part of the significance and impact of this story. <br /> <br /> Second and third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs with a very dynamic dance number was removed. a song was added that was not in the production phase. Tell me what? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I made this movie 2 Stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the artists. Today I've seen Chorus Line on stage six times, and it would be no good to see it six times before I die. It's greatly written, with wonderful music and heart-poisoning truth stories. If you want to see a musical instrument that includes great auditions, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the Chorus Line story, look at the scene.
