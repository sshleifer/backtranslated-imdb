Some people could think of this film as a work of art - in order to express your imagination on film to create a film full of antagonistic pain and death. Personally, I think this movie is a disgust that should never be released. This movie is nasty, illogical and insignificant. It's not just a complete waste of time, but it's getting worse for a few days. The scary pictures displayed in the movie not only grab you for the air but they work in your mind and it takes a few days to forget them. Such a pity that people lose their imagination about such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, peak and resolution.
