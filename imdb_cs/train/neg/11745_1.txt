The fact that I do not like music is a very personal opinion, historical inaccuracies are not. I realize that this is an opera and not a document, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people are falsely commenting about it. Abbu Abas was the leader of this operation, which was introduced and reorganized for discovery on board a ship to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kuntar, a terrible terrorist whose story you might find by searching for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on Google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even though he never attacked Achilles Laura. Ben Laden never settles on the aircraft that hit the WTC, huh? <br /> <br /> *** maybe spoilers *** The film almost apologizes for the reactions and reactions of terrorists because of the horrors they could live, always emphasize and exaggerate how much the Israelis did to hurt them. Nevertheless, they never show the injuries that the Israelis sometimes caused the Palestinians. The film makes horrific images of Sabry and Chatile terrible, and nothing is said, underestimating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible without mentioning that it was the Lebanese army from Syria that was leading the massacre. <br /> <br /> Actor was generally very bad, but I think that's what can be expected from opera singers? <br /> <br /> In another note, I am shocked by how one can apologize to the terrorists for killing hostages because the hostages tried to upset 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists and add that a person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a partisan of Zionism . Imagine what his wife was dissatisfied with, spitting on the terrorists who shot their husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope no one in the world is as cruel as she (blink of a wink)
