DOC SAVAGE: MAN OF BRONZE (1 out of 5 stars) Haunted, terrible movie ... based on a series of magazines / paperbacks Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about the super heroic adventure hero in the 1930s and his five assistants, experts in some area of ​​effort that allows them to fight evil. It was a nice series ... but a little fun when I was a teenager. I knew they made a film version in the 1970s, led by Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never had a chance to see it. She never played in the theaters where I lived and I was never on TV. Now that I finally saw the movie, I understand why. Conspiracy and characters are never really serious ... it's all a bit jagged and frantic ... like old Batman television series ... just without it being funny ... or having some visual taste. Corny dialogue, cheese special effects, silly stereotypes, crazy action scenes and bad, bad dealings. In fact, it feels fascinating in its badness ... what would they possibly think? Arnold Schwarzenegger was said to play in a modern remake before ... but I can not imagine it would be much better.
