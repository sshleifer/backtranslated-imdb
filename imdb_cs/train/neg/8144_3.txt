I just saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2006. The synopsis in the festival guide sounds pretty good so we decided to check this page. I'm sorry I was very disappointed. In addition to writing badly, it was boring. I will not get rid of the actors, because with this bad script there is not much to do. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a clich√© without being ironic, over the highest seriousness without being humorous. The film would be better if Hunt Hoe went horribly in the camp. Instead, he took seriously, and it resulted in a boring film. I can not recommend this movie. He felt too long and everything was weak.
