PLAN B has the look of a fast-set, untried, careless script for a movie with a trip to the actors involved - a trip to be launched from the start. It is another Mafia-based comedy that has nothing new and reduces the standard for the participants. Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime chief who is more interested in clothing and outdoors than his business control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is stupid than dirt and his ignorance is funny. Maloni liquidated one of his debtors (who married Franco Dian Keaton), and Maloni takes Fran as her assistant to work on her dead husband's debt by being Maloni's "hit man". Fran is afraid of his own shadow and can not make Maloniin's assignments instead of deciding to transfer his "villains" to Florida to hide behind his brother James until he can figure out what to do next. This alternative to killing three candidates is called plan B, plan A is to kill them! The end is completely predictable, just like any series assigned to characters in the scenario. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has done a lot of great movies and is one of our most talented actresses and comedies, but here she yells and the horrors and twitchings go through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to be watched. Paul Sorvino is, of course, casting Paul Sorvino from other gangster films. Supporting cast is also allowed to play on the balcony in the widest snail, which is the perfect fashion that you can imagine. What is to be a comedy ends up just stupid and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes must return to the TV comedy series: he had this modest story compressed into a half-hour concert that could have a chance. Grady Harp
