It was another big screen that won an American TV show of the 1960s. It's funny enough, but it was a great formula. The intelligent Martian will land on Earth and meet with not too bright people, in his opinion. The usual kindness builds on the man, the bridges, finally connects with him and helps him get home. On the way, she gets a girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice trip for some nice Hollywood stars that I have not seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Some free time if you have nothing better to see.
