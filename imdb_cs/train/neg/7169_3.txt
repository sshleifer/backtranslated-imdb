This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, a little girl, Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken, makes this movie fun. Alice is smoking, drinking and the unusual way to appear when her name is named is special and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for his imitation of Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken, who allowed it to be in the movie.
