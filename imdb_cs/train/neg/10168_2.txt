Superdome is one of those movies that tells you why it happened. The whole conspiracy concerns someone trying to sabotage a superbowl and all attempts to stop. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills's career managed to survive is behind me. However, the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all! Avoid it if possible.
