It's just a joke from the movie, they've lost me already on the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) a dangerous creature kills another creature in his cage, it's being watched by a scientist who works there on the monitor and guessing what he's doing in a cage to check things, omg , how foolish the writers believe that human beings are doing the same thing as jumping in a tank with a big white shark because it ate a goldfish ... Quite futile and even more stupid. And I'm not going to talk about being cast because it's not worth it. why they did not get the guy who told me that it's just a secret for me ... And such stupidity goes on in the whole movie. Just a good thing where cgi is better than the average for these cheap low-budget movies. If these things do not bother you, you will see it, but be warned if your IQ is over 60 years old and it probably hates it.
