Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original frosting cartoon: It needs a little work, but it can be even worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on Thursday July? Come on! Give me BREAK! It was one film that was not to be created. It was bad. It really was not a holiday anymore, except July 4th. This made it particularly bad because Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And every film can be destroyed by too much singing. The frequent tracks from this movie looked much longer than it really was. The film tried to mix two well-known Chirstmastime characters with traditional American holidays (which seems to "limit" it to America), too many unnecessary songs and a miserable plot. Result? A bad film that can not really be tracked in any year. I would suggest that you avoid this movie, even if you like Frosty and Rudolf.
