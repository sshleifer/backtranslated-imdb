Oh, God, what an idiotic movie! Unbelievably cheap with a fake special effect (the creature is played by one guy in a lame costume) and a silly fence. All the dialogues are incredibly bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... But I have never seen such annoying characters as in these haraburds (these stupid children or a pregnant woman with her husband and many others). Overall, it's great fun when you're drunk. like a plague. Have I drunk? I do not think ...
