The average original picture of a science fiction channel. A bit shy, but not too much. Nuclear power submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep under heavy ice ice near the North Pole when he is attacked by giant charged electric eels. The crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks she has devised a way to communicate with monsters, but she is not given a great chance for unclear reasons. Among the crews are David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could be somewhat better if the eels / monsters were not so cartoonish.
