A woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) chases a man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) for his father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). A woman wants to get a man to invest money from a dead mother in the father's business plan; but the father is renowned for losing money on hair patterns. Few know it, but true thieves pose as the best friends of Man to steal their fortunes ... Production looks pretty, but the story does not work. Players do not play well drunk. Remarkable as the first show of Broderick Crawford - as a gopher "Hunk"; besides Crawford running, Mr. Crawford joins Mr. McCrea's floor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
