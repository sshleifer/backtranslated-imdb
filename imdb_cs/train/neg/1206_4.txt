This idea, which sometimes appears on the web, has long been lost. So I bought a copy. Well, of course, the acting is horrible and the story line is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who searched this site also know their story. It was made by the owner of the grindhouse cinema for an extremely low budget. But for me, he certainly did not spoil money on props but on makeup. Make-up is well done for this kind of flick. Zombies are observable and the gore is intact. The only problem with this type of films is the quality of the films. It's horrible, fortunately it does not sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to see the gore clearly visible. In a humorous manner, they tried to sell him as if they were not really squeamish. Read at the beginning of the movie to watch out for the signs and a green flashing person who tells you that the gore is on the way. Of course it does not work, I was thinking about Cannibal Girls, he had the bloody bell when the red stuff began to flow. They have an original idea, Cannibal Girls were made a year earlier. Do not use the story, go to the zombies and see a continuity error. When a girl and a guy love first, they take a bra, then they love and suddenly is lingerie ... try to do it or get a little off, ... eating that ugly bodies
