There are two parts of this movie. First, it's the laugh of the prologue of the movie, which is so hysterical that it will almost feel reasonable that "The Simpsons" Troy McClure should do a narrative. Then begins the rest of the movie (starting with the title song, which does not really stay with the rest of the movie), which is technically OK murderous by vague, inconsistent and unconvincing conspiracy and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense. <br /> <br /> This is especially true of Spinent of Mickey Rooney, who has been involved with the conspiracy and part of the "organization," what would happen if Hackman made a seemingly arbitrary decision to explode? In that case, it would be a totally unnecessary and unnecessary character that eventually still exists. The overall problem with the film is that it is totally unwilling to give some detail of who or what is behind this conspiracy. It is as if movie makers have no courage to suggest that a certain part of society would be able to create such an organization and instead settle for the hope that the lack of explanation is enough and the audience will draw their own conclusions. br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie fails at all levels.
