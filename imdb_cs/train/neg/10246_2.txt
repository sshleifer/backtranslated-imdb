The end of the world is an insignificant film that is weird because it is supposed to be a complete destruction of the country. The main character is a scientist, I'm not exactly sure what kind. She has two jobs in the government (?), Which are guarded by four security men. Its first task is to monitor transmissions to and from space (although it actually sounds more like a hobby it does when it does not work on work 2). Work # 2 requires you to wear a protective suit and go to a dark room ... at least that's the best I can do. It seems that the "plant" is not exactly mysterious because the scientist is bringing his wife there. She hang up (they are on the way to dinner) while he discovers the message from the universe: The main earth break, repeated again and again. He says something about it being the first message from the universe he has ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him he'll be late for dinner. So they go out and go to the party (!?!). A moment later, he finds out that China suffered a major earthquake. From here the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but it really does not help. Besides, Lee gives unspeakable performance in the form of his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough silly elements that you might want to suffer once if you like Christopher Lee or science fiction class Z. In addition, there are plenty of tracks from the land that is being destroyed.
