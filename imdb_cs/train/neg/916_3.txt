Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry in this film in 1945. Here is a good story about an axis that tries to get coal for use in the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not stressed. Instead, we're talking about Boer Boy. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real acting actor belongs to the veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxina. As with her unforgettable Pilar in 1943, Oscar winner "For whom he rings," Paxino is again playing the Spanish Revolution, but this time he is a pro-French two-dimensional counterattack. There's a pretty ominous figure, especially when he throws out a 14-year-old child out of the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
