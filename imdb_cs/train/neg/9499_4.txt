I thought the movie was a poor documentary. Nothing of substance has been discussed. It seemed to cheaper ideas and did not provide anything new. The film lacked a miracle or romance or something that would really lead to science. Most scientists appeared to be "stereotyped" and sometimes strange. The woman said her prizes do not matter much, just the children she helped. She said after a ten-minute scene explaining all her awards. You play a "humble scientist", right? "I have the equation in your head," another said. I do not understand how this explains something to us. It does not include the significant effects of science on our culture. The science policy was hardly affected. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie for kids aged 10-14. Besides, I felt it was boring and infallible. <br /> <br /> 4/10
