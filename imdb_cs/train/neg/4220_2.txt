A short review, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, a thorough loss of 90 minutes. At the end of the movie, I was not wiser what happened. It's full of portraits (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 seconds), "Philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognizable people, but that just does not make sense. Whatever the story has just lost in a layout that I do not have now, but I do ... <br /> <br /> Put a DVD in place or go to bed and rest! <br /> <br /> 2 of 10 (for karate and Morris Minor Car Chase) <br /> <br />
