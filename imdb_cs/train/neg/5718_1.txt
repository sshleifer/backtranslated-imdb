There was no characterization in this movie, and it really shows how much this talented hack who runs this must learn his craft. All of his characters in this movie were so insurmountable and I would take care less. The best point in this movie was final credits and hourly shower after this cause, I felt so damn dirty that I was useless money for this stinking load. Hey genius ... triads and yakuza are from two different places to learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so tense and useless. This DVD has proven useful. I love my new career. <br /> <br /> So children do not leave the money for this crap to buy Hostel instead.
