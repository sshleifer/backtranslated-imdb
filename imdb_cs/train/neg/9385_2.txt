The "Trivia" page on IMDb says the filmmakers were protesting because the movie was "simplified". If so, this effort was a complete failure because it is one of the most incoherent narratives I've ever seen in the movie - I hate to see it before the plot was "simplified." <br /> </ p> <p> It is sad to see Warren with such a small character that it can continue even though he can not do anything with the misunderstood material. It is interesting to see Caron in the 1970s instead of his Hollywood charm and personality, but it is sad to see that he is unhappily going through this terrible wife. In fact, she later joined and took the director, instead - who, you say, never said anything, but strictly 1st or 2nd worked on television from here. That tells me enough. I call it "interesting," because I have an automatic interest in American films of this period, and this role adds to the otherwise fantastic output of Oates (1971) - Lane Blacktop, The Hired Hand. But "the detective of the 1940s as a fish-out-of-water in the 1970s L.A." the theme, the only thing the film really says is sold too hard. A similar topic would be much better solved in Altman's The Long Goodbye two years later. And as for Oates, who plays a hard-fought boy on convicted matters three years later, he gives his definitive performance in "Bring Me the Head of Alfred Garcia". If you have not seen them, do not waste time with it!
