I'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and I just watched the episode that started it all on British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think about what came out of this one and that movie and I'm just wondering who spotted a huge potential "Columbo" and added all the little touches that make it such an amazing and classic series. This means that this particular film is not as good as the other (except the embarrassing last episode and patronizing British episode). If Columbo was made according to the original "pilot" he would definitely NEVER have been long or not seen and loved around the world. In this film, Lt Columbo is elegantly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, can not talk about his alleged relatives and finds himself very aggressive. There is neither the chemistry of cats and mice between Columbo and the "villain". Traceable, but only for the sake of novelty seeing Columbo started.
