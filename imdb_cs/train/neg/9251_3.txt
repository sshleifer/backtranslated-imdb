this film, despite its "independent" status, is a stupid Hollywood version of a mother and daughter's furious relationship. it was not bad at first, but somewhere in the movie - at about the time the daughter comes out with that guy, I think - it will turn into a mother and daughter's cheese film. I'm sorry, but I do not know about any mother who has such a relationship with her daughter ... his probably better than that.
