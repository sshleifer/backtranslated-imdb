Hollywood, a house of humor, a spell and a search for profits, barely rule with spiritual values, and therefore it is no surprise that his attempts to investigate spiritual life are thin and often stupid (better to go on - Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This odd hybrid of adventure film, love story, and religious parable dispels the very understanding she is trying to communicate. That the character of providence and salvation will work to match Verne (Clark Gable in his most crudest and confident view) and Julie (Joan Crawford, squeaking and spitting all the other words in quest for Queen Tough Dames) seems the best ridiculous. Is it the patron saint's star system at work that corresponds to the fighting ego before sending it to another criminal service on M-G-M? BUT. . there are good supporting performances and visually arresting moments: shadow prison barracks; the outgoing boat in the moonlight or against the painting cloud; Julie walked along the waterfront as the wind drove; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiate Verne's freedom when building a storm; unusually exciting homosexual prison romance between the two convicts. . . Finally, there is a dignified and independent performance of Paul Lukas as Hessler, a killer who will appreciate Cambreau's virtues, yet he turns to him. In the movie, the most arrested moment, Hessler, left Cambreau, stands in front of the cabin. We hear the wind in the jungle, we see the shadows on his face that bring a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he will go out into the night. At this point, Hessler achieves ambiguity, depth and existential power that none of the other characters can achieve. is the film a secret that his deepest sympathy is associated with Hessler?
