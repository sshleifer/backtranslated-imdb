It begins with a long opening of a seemingly endless line of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, and the country is trying to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional companies. His droning story assumes that industrial developments in China and elsewhere are completely unprecedented as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx never visited the British Museum. The fact that there is a connection between today's Asian efforts for industrialization and wealth and past experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, trying to portray Edward Burtynsky's photo of industrial waste as a "beautiful" one. Much of the movie is a slide show. They are well made, the size of the museum and apparently appeared on several exhibitions. For me, they only prove that almost every photo can be made to look beautiful if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photographs and the spoken expression of the film remains unclear. I do not think it would mean that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries are rushing to industrialization. However, the landscapes produced only offer strange and hot despair. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what's right with the US (and Canadian) left.
