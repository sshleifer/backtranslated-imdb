I was looking at it ... let me rephrase ... I suffered because I was a fan of Eva. I do not think this is a movie he puts on his back with his head. I like gangsta flix, but it was not even close. The budget could not be more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent on a cookhouse. The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you got a chance to take care or not. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to say who did what and how, because it is not worth it. I'm just glad I did not have to pay for this waste due to the monthly rental of the plan at the local video store. OH !! Before I flame, I love movies, I thought Lotta Flix was good that some of you were stuck, so for me I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know.
