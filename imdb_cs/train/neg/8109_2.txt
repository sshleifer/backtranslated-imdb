*** It contains Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found this surprisingly boring and somewhat shallow, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: since in the end we have to die, how should we approach life? "Light" way, like Thomas; in a "difficult" way like Tereza; or should we find ways to confront this problem, like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of professional life can be crippled for our loved ones? How much do we need to be involved in the political life and social issues of our country? Unfortunately, I did not read Kundera's novel, but after I was released, I would definitely want to: I want to understand if the story was destroyed by film adaptation (which is my argument) or if it was boring from the beginning. I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the film as a masterpiece. I just do not see why. What I see is a lot of shortcomings, and the demonstration follows them. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are worthy of you and it is very difficult to understand what is driving them in choosing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3) As if Tomas was issued for publishing. Nothing good for him. He is so selfish and selfish. He is not human, in a sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes he depends on others and is emotionally connected with something, I can not find the interpretation credible. 4) It is very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in the Communist country in 1968. In addition, the three main characters are very successful in their professions, which reminds me strange. a) how can Tereza be a hopelessly good photographer? b) How can they do well in a country where there is no economic incentive that usually motivates people to succeed? 5) The fake accents of English speaking actors are ridiculous. And I'm not even a mother tongue. In addition, the letter Sabina receives in the US is written in Czech, which I consider to be very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many commentaries praised the film that said that Prague was beautifully rendered: I think most of the film was shot on the spot so it is not hard to give the film a sense of Eastern Europe and because of the inner beauty of Prague it is not even hard it looks good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the end sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, away from the temptation of the "metropolis", away from the social struggles that their fellow citizens, who are disconnected from their professional lives, will die in a car crash. But they die after they realize they are happy. So what? If they died unhappily, would the message of the film be different? I think yes. I considered it a cheap trick to please the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in a movie that is unbearably light is the way the director portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you did not stay. You do not feel empathy, you have no connection with them, stay in your sofa, and look at a series of events and scenes that have nothing to say. 9) I hated the "stop music in the restaurant" scene (which some commendations praised a lot). Why does Sabina have such a strong reaction? Why does Franz agree with her? I really do not see it. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has a very bad mood and a strong personality. And it is done. What's so special and unique? After all these negative comments let me show that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (so I gave them two). <br /> <br /> "Naked Women Photoshoot", where the envy, jealousy and uncertainty of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. The second scene is the one that represents an investigation after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Photos of Tereza, which let the world know what is happening in Prague, are used to identify people who are involved in riots. I found it quite original and Tereza is a sense of despair and the guilt is nicely portrayed. Finally, there is little chance that the movie was deliberately "designed" in such a way that "Tomas types" I like it and "Theresa" will hate it. If this is the case (but I doubt it, then my comment should be drastically modified).
