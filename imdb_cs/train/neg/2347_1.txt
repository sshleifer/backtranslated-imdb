First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; so I was curious to look at this, her debut role. No argument that her talent is obvious and her performance excellent. I think I also see professional critics differing from the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies have a taste for fun and that is where this movie fails. I found myself in the middle of my mind: "How much longer do we have to look at the bored shop girl, standing around a deserted souvenir shop, regrouping the goods?" It seemed to go on forever! Then I thought maybe it's one of those movies when the director tries to listen honestly to the audience before they hit them with a dynamic event. No luck. The film continues, it's a boring, boring, insignificant story to the end. I do not say it because I'm an action addict. I love all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to have fun. Add the fact that cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad domestic movies. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I just do not like the way someone likes the movie. Zero Fun Value. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
