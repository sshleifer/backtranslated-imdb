I watched it just because it was driven by Lucio Fulci and introduced Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was surely disappointed. The idea that convicted prisoners will fight for death for television ratings has been exaggerated with Rollerball, Logan Run, Blade Runner, and the new movie Death Race, because it stars Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> It was just a twist for the most part. "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. "Training" was a snooze-fest. He never caught me and wanted me to care for someone, including the Dallas star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Choose one of these and you'll be better.
