Why is Colin Firth in this absurd movie? Was he really the one who was tied to money? The movie is not clear what it wants to be, grief, exotic places, ghosts ?, a vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a confused, muddy mess. There seems to be some idea that Italy must be good in itself and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but ultimately girls just want to go back to the street. <br /> <br /> There are unnecessary episodes on the beach, churches, busy roads - but what it means or why one should take care is simply not clear. /> <br /> There was also a woman in the movie. It was not clear what the job was here, but it seemed to be there just to make a faulty, inappropriate, and Maudlin commentary on the girl. Should it be a paedophilia? A pretty awful mess, in all. I gave her 2 rather than 1 because she does not have the spell of a totally hideous movie.
