After reading the other comments on this movie, I would like to share my own opinion that it's one heavy movie you would see if you are not a Brooksophile. I'm not. When a purely objective observer looks at her, the film is an unbalanced story that brings us more undiluted neurons than they are able to absorb in one sitting. It is quite difficult to watch. Brooks's character (Robert Cole) is so unsympathetic and uncomfortable that it's hard to concentrate on him - let alone it be the root for him when he encounters one of the dysfunctional situations that he himself engulfs. And he should never make a scene without shots and expect to take it seriously in a romantic context. No man should have so many exposed leaves and should turn to a child like Kathryn Harrold ---- unless, of course, Albert Brooks is in production directed by Albert Brooks. "Modern Romance" has fun moments ----- but they are fragmentary and unusual. I often felt like I was on a limited journey with an intimate person, and I wish it was over. It confirms the problems that may arise when too much control of the film is placed in one person - someone who lacks self-education to get rid of it and find out what is happening. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is actually what he portrayed. Six years later, Albert Brooks made a very successful "Broadcasting Report". James showed us how Albert can create a credible and entertaining comic performance. Albert let us see how James (generally not as an actor) are making rare comic twists in a surprisingly effective way. Fans of "modern romance" have already moved to another laudatory commentary on it. I'm telling you ----- there's a lot of pain in the world without having to find her in a movie designed for fun.
