I've never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> It is possible to take a video game and discard it in a decent movie. Error 1: Absolutely no connection to any characters. You do not bother with any of the characters in this movie because ... you do not have a chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. In addition to this unique character, the film's result is insignificant, since all the characters have been lifeless since the beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: The worst scene on the shooting holes at all. I love guns. I like when the hero opens to dirty and clean houses. Damn, I sometimes like to look at a dirty, clean house. But this fighter was weird, I think the best way to describe it is "Apathetic" I saw people shooting with more feelings and emotions while playing a video game. In this movie it looked and felt like "actors" simply went through the shooting of everything that moved without emotions. Why? Where's the waste? where are the hangouts between the shootings? You should be the children who were caught in the crash ... but also the true soldiers who behave professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity. If you want a GOOD horror film about a remote house full of monsters, I recommend the series Sam Rami Evil Dead. You do not see a catastrophe that is home to the dead. I hope he burns the master and all copies of this movie.
