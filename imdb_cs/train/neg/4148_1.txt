I caught this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting into. I started the film and I was soon attracted to the world of pain and visual torture. what the hell is. It's a movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. She had no conspiracy. Every scene is doing things, but no general explanation of why something happens. Instead of watching this movie, I suggest that you draw the nearest blender with oil and try to make the most of the beads in it. You will find that the result is much more enjoyable than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even look at it. Do not even see how bad it is. Much please. If you look at it, it means they will win.
