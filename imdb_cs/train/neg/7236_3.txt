Let's see ... I'm trying to practice the search for everything positive, so what can I say about Pelicka? I know! The performances were - no, it will not work because they've emptied all the personality from Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so lively, and eventually created cartoons from Carol Kane and Barbary Hershey ... Oh - how it works happening - no. It will not even fly because it has caused dosing. What was the genre? It was not funny, it eliminates comedy. It was not interesting to be dramatic. Was it a novel between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask because I can not be sure - let's say it "loses." I'm sure you started out with the vision behind this movie, I think they had to have one that would fit into the studio, but I need help finding. Even though I was a patient who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, I could not recommend a film with good conscience that allows a person to go to a professional interview in the wind and chaotic, fluffy, silly hair. When we talk about coat - should we be amused by the intense black roots and platinum locks that Hershey wears? What am I doing? I've lost 97 irretrievable minutes while watching the movie - I can not afford to spend this lost time.
