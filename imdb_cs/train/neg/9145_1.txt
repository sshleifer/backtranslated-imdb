Let me first say that I like watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than really great. This film is disturbingly bad. This vehicle for the vicious ego of Sam Mraovich not only bordered on hopelessness without talent but redefined the very meaning of words. That should be a barometer for bad movies forever. The Mendoza line for the movie. Mr. Mraovič writes, directs and stars as a blunt object Arthur Sailes struggling with despised women and Christian forces of evil like him and his partner Ben "dead in the eyes" The letters fight for marital equality. As a libertarian, I believe that homosexuals should have the right to get married. Ben & Arthur is more likely to hurt this cause than an army of homophobes. The rendering of all Christian things is so ugly and compelling, trademark Mraovič, that you do not have to take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Viktor, a bizarre bible, is such a terribly exaggerated evil / furious gay that he has to wonder how he was occupied in this role. This is because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also the casting director. The worst is Sam Mraovič herself. When do you think that the leading person means words pasty, bald and dandy? Sam also delivers lines like domino pizza, cold and usually bad. Final Match: You are writing, directing, playing and casting. This is Ed Wood four times the crown. I congratulate you on a terrible little man.
