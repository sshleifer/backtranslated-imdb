I sincerely disagreed with the other viewers of this wretched movie. The only reason I did not consider it terrible was Carmen Miranda, because of the great talent. Beginning and ending are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is with the rest of the image. Alice Faye looks pretty dull. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but with terrible writing material, he comes so terribly ominous. The plot is really tough, where Ameche assumes two parts as a song and a dancer and the Baron is not happily married to Faye. It seems that by playing song and dancing, Ameche marriage gets the second change to reignite. Some stupid nonsense about the baron having to clean up the business and be gone allows him to play in both parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal has little to do, so his comedy gifts do not get the chance to shine. Just like J. Carrol Naish, who looks uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> It's a chic bomb bombing movie.
