Tell the truth that I am a little amazed when I see all these positive reviews by so many people, which is also the main reason why I really decide to see this movie. And after what I saw, I was really disappointed, and it comes from a person who loves this movie genre. I am surprised by this film completely - it's like a kid's nudity film for absolutely no reason, and it all includes little children of cursing and swearing. I am by no means fair, but this really went too far for my account. Synopsis: A story about two boys went into the big brother's program for their ruthless behavior. There they met one child with obsession with a cat and the other is a medieval monster. Only a name that in itself is not really associated with the story at all. They are not a model and nothing to serve their time for what they did. The story is very predictable (though it is expected) and humor is lame. And we have not seen the same characters (Mc Lovin 'game) in so many other movies (like the Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laughed three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> No casting was fine because he is the one who produces the script. And acting is the way it's supposed to be watching this type of movie. And the direction we expect? It's the same man who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and the movie is also upset. But somehow he always managed to bring some star to attract his horrible film. Anyway, I did not feel completely, but I was completely wasting time. Only naked scenes seem to be the best in the movie. I really can not see any reason why I should recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two infertile scenes. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: No fun, terrible story, nudity, and children are not mixed. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Stage: F)
