I'm a very big fan of Jenny Jameson, but this movie is terrible. At that time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and was the director of this film, and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So Brad, of course, was trying to make as much money as he could from doing it by doing that great porn movie budgets. Now I know why there are no big porno movies. In a fantastic world, porn stars could act, but it's a real world and they can not act. That's why porn stars exist, if women as beautiful as Jenna could act then she would try to go to mainstream movies instead of porn. Just because your beautiful star does not make you out of the movie star. A good example is Traci Lords, when she was a teenage twelve, she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women in the world. She made her move to low-cost mainstream movies and could not act. Where is he now? I gave her 2 instead of 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she created as "Dream Quest". Come on, Jenna, we do not want to hear you, just like we want to see you have sex. You too, Jenna, would have a lot more fans on your bank account and more money if you made a movie anal.
