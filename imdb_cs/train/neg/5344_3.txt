You remember the movie Spice Girls and how bad it was (except songs) that their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) made the same mistake when he introduced S Club (another of my favorite groups) to his own film. With Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member of Paul Cattermole?) He basically asks his boss for a break, go on and see himself on TV! Three of them change, and vice versa, half finds clones from a greedy scientist, and the other half gets into trouble. Also play Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This film may have a conspiracy rather than the Spice Girls' movie, but in addition to the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Moving" and "Never Had A Dream", there's no reason to see this movie. Not long after the band split. Adequate!
