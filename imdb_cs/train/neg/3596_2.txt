To be the truest, Devil's Plaything is a complete piece of work, or the Beat of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or the Curse of a Black Nurse or ???? Does the movie have a good assumption for it? the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the offspring by helping and helping a group of women dressed in black? but the execution is terrible. There are great, long moments on the screen when nothing happens. The characters just stand with nothing to do. There is no secret, no tension, no conspiracy that would not happen. The hearing is just horrifying. Most acting involves a group of above-average-looking women dancing naked while looking at the camera. They do it repeatedly. And what little plot seems to be designed to get more of these less attractive naked women to get involved in the dance. While it's not as bad or unnecessary as a dance or plot in something like Orgy of the Dead, it's coming.
