There were very few films I could not sit on. I did it through Battle Field Earth without any problems. But this, this is one of the worst movies EVER. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to get into it. I do not blame her. I feel embarrassed that I should have it in my life. I believe it's a rare occasion when almost every gag in the film falls on his face. It's happening here. Not to mention the SFX, look at the dino with the control cables hanging from its rear end !!!!!! In the middle of the movie, I was still looking for a plot. I never found it. Save your rental problems and save 90 minutes of your life.
