Well, I like gore in this movie - it's really unsetteling. Everyone at the dentist will know why. The story is not really that bad, the motivation for Corbin Bersen's character is much more meaningful than most horror films. I've seen worse acting, direction, script, etc. But at the end of the day, it's still a bad horror movie. So it's a question of whether you like it or not. I tried to follow the sequel, but that was exactly the same as the movie. Keep in mind that if you love people suffering torture at the dentist, then it's the film for you!
