Mixed exotic tropical locations, gorgeous dress girls, explosions, good-looking Dudley Do-Right clones, movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), small martial arts and sexy grudges (Tracy Lor .... ..., sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH gentlemen) and you think you would be for some rescue fun. It is not so! It's a terrible TV film, and although he wanted to promote himself as "Charlie's Angels," he's not nearly as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irreplaceably stupid, recent C.A. movies. This abomination is best described as THIRD RATE Andy Sidaris. Nowhere near as much fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", although some of the battle scenes are pretty decent. Girls spend too much time trying to look like bulletproof and after a while it gets poisoned. There are better genre things there that is there. Yeah, and "babes" are not as hot as they think they are. Terrible soundtrack ... when it's there.
