I saw it on DVD (this is known as CORRUPT in this format) and the blur on the cover really encouraged Harvey Keitel's character Frank as much as the one played by BAD LIEUTENANT in "This bold and powerful police thriller." What I did not notice is that it is an old Italian film. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music that does not stand on a CD player, pulls out a big plastic thing, puts it on a rotating hob, where a mechanical hand touches a pancake pan, which makes the music heard. Do you see my opinion that this is an old movie? The DVD case did not know it was a movie that was created 20 years ago. It's also a film with poor production values, like so many other Italian films interested in American films. With the exception of Keitla, the cast is terrible, although Johnny Rotten's performance is bizarre rather than horrible, cinematography is static with image and sound quality, which gives the impression of watching the fourth generation of a pirate copy (I do not know if it's down on a small DVD or it's a very bad movie print) and the worst of all is the Ennio Morricone score. It is impossible to think that the one who made the irritating disturbing accidental music for CORUPT is the one who made music for Western Clint Eastwood. Everything is a shame because CORUPT has its moments. This is by no means the greatest psychological thriller ever devised, but he kept my interest and as always Keitel gives good performance as a violent policeman. It is a shame that the rest of the film did not meet its high standards
