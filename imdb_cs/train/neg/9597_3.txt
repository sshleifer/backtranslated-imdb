Like Japanese films I like, this not only did not cut it ... The film about rebels and survival of the royal blood line turned out to be a very slow film with a dubious conspiracy. br /> <br /> The shooting is fine, although I saw much better sword scenes in other Japanese movies, fast cameras and the way they watched the characters did not convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak you do not even notice its presence. The worst of all was the way the conspiracy evolved. I have to admit that in some cases I hardly understood who is who and what is happening. The always platonic love between the main character and the other was totally unnecessary, and it seemed to come from the Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you're looking for a Japanese action movie, it's not. It's very slow, with very few sword scenes and very sentimental ... bad way ...
