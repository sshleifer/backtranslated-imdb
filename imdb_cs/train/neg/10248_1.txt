the end of the world looks like a good film on the cover of the box, but it's warned of its bad. Being a big fan of mega star actor Christopher Lee I was deceived. like good tentacles (77), good cast does not mean it's going to be a good movie. the beginning looks promising, then turns into a tedium, many parts of the movie are too dark to see what's going on. Lew ayres, Dean Jagger, and MacDonald Carey as a security guard. I could expect better from Charles, who made fun films like re-animators and dolls. I have heard that Christopher Lee has been cheated on filming this movie. said that his stars will be Jose Ferrer, John Carridine and dean Jagger.well Dean Jagger is there, but the other two have never done it (luck) if you make a film about the end of the world, use a larger budget and better storyline.dean Jagger went on to do two good movies then, alligator (80) and death game (79) sue Lyon (Lolita) is also in the movie minus her lollipop. if you are angry for punishment, then watch the end of the world I will allow you to wake up throughout the movie. 1 out of 10.
