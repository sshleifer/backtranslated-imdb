I saw it in 94 when he was finally released. Apparently because Orion's images were in decline, I think the movie was not released a few years earlier. I have the problem of remembering the details partly because I have not seen it for a long time, but I remember it as a very boring movie. I have been constantly discussing whether to go out of it. The shop was not at all interesting or pilgrimage. It was the 3rd graffiti imitation chart of America. <br /> <br /> No performance is worth it. One of the biggest disappointments was that the local reviewers made a high score.
