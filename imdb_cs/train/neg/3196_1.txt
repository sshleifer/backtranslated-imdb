The only word you need is more afraid than Joe Don Baker if your thinking about watching the movie is Greydon Clark and if they're both there, go for your life. However, it is a very fun movie because they really took seriously! Beginning badly and going downhill, repeat scenes, Good the Bad and The Ugly as a shootout bring you to laughter on the floor. She is the best sheriff in Texas, who is following the mafia on Malta as much as she can. He creates his own rules, does things in his own way, all the time he wears cowboy boots and cowboy style. Want to see a bad but fun movie? Go on, it's your turn!
