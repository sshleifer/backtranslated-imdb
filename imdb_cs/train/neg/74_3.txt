They've made it like a kind of fantasy. A man from the snowy river meets Butch Cassidy and Sundance, and for a romantic touch, Ned and Joe play high-class, bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are plenty of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts that still provide room for artistic creativity in creating good historical dramaturgy. This is not the story of Robin Hood, not the legend of the Arthurians, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so obscured in the fog of many centuries that every recreation of life and times is 99% of the estimates. It's just a few lives. My grandparents were already in school age when Ned was suspended. <br /> <br /> So it's silly that I imagined that this movie was a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. After reading the excellent Petra Carey novel "The True History of the Kelly Gang," I eagerly expected it to be in a similar spirit. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger is very gloomy 1970 Kelly was probably much closer to reality, and a better film overall that does not say so much about it. <br /> <br /> I love two dollars to rent a DVD! I'll put it 3/10 and that's just because some of the nice shots of Australian bushes give me a generous feeling.
