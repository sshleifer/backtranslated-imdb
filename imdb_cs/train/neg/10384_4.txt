..JST TO ONE! Very cool assumption, straight from the bat. He has an excellent first scene, he must give credit where the loan is due. He has solid characters and a pretty good script for the ghost story, but here are the things that bothered me: Whenever the spirits I really enjoyed appeared, how it looked what it looked like ... the only thing was the spirit relationship. Because of the way things got in the first scene, you would think their dynamics would be different. Things slowed a little too far in the middle of what I felt, and the scene of the crabs / spiders was just bad. But then the end is actually very good! Sure, "The Grudge" basically said the same story with a polished lens, but no samurai and I liked this film quite. <br /> <br /> Please someone with tempered style remake this movie. /> <br /> "Silent Rage" fans would absolutely love this movie.
