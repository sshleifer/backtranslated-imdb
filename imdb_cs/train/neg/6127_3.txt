As I am from Hungary, I have heard many people who say better and better things about Üvegtigris, but I really do not understand the reason for the command. I enjoyed many movie points, some of the quotes really made me happy, but stereotypical characters are re-present, just like in any Hungarian film, and the story is also quite dull. I liked the first half, but then I got bored and then I found the whole movie just BORING. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is as good as ever, Reviczky is also brilliant, but the others are ... he does not do anything. How many years have to go through a good Hungarian film ???
