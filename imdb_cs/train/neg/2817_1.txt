Tobe Hooper is quite possibly the biggest genre that horror genre offers. Like any other horror fan, I like Texas Chainsaw, but I think you should have at least one more hit movie in order to be your name in front of the movie title. I really can not think of any other film that Hooper did (in itself, do not count with Poltergeist), which actually influenced genre horror or the movie world. And this movie, night terror, just backs up my point. Poor Robert Englund, I think he does at least do a good job with the terrible material he has been given. He did what he could. As for the film itself? Clean bagpipes. Unnecessary naked scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been written in ours, and really horrible scenery, music and cinema. Nothing in this movie can be redeemed. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's 1 in 10. I'm sorry for Hooper, his career seems to have ended before he really started. I hope he can get at least one other good movie, so he can make his cult status a fair one. <br /> <br />
