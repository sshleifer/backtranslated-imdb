I was more critical of this film than Tamara Jenkins. The story just sneaked and did not seem to have any point or plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) should be so crazy about losing her virginity. Maybe I'm too small to get in touch with it (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no trouble connecting with Shakespeare stories in love, or life is beautiful and I was not alive even for this setting. The cast is very good, but unfortunately the script did not expose them to join the audience. Overall Slums have had their moments, but if you do not want to remember the halter boots and the tube socks, I'd say you skip this.
