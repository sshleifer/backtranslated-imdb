I just did not get this movie ... Was it musical? no .. but there were choreographic songs and dance ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious course ... no playing was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is a high-profile actor. Certainly not. <br /> <br /> I've had trouble keeping up with this unconnected movie. The report on apartheid and "tributes" to students who died during the rising of students is marked. But as a fun it was very bad, and as a documentary movie it was worse. <br /> <br /> Look at yourself, but in justice I hated it
