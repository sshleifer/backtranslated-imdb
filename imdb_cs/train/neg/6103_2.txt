To be honest, I am surprised by the positive voices that this film has gained. The film stretches along 81 minutes of life and the audience has to suffer all the way. In fact, there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling gives decent performance. It gives her some pretty pathetic dialogue and she does it quite well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's friend in family ties) is a very harsh watch on the other hand. I think the pinnacle of his performance is witnessing how a man on a beach wearing a tiger patterned chummy ... give me a break. Valentine also gives us a deceptive and miserable picture of the vampire's suffering that lacks the day (see a more convincing rendition of the vampire's suffering, see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves so slowly and is only positively interrupted and sincerely Charlie Spradling's dance scene. This movie can only be honestly recommended to hardcore Charlie Spradling fans (which I am and I have had the rough time to do it!).
