While I do not claim to be an expert in marine life, I have to say that someone with a minimal intelligence could not buy this idea of ​​a whale (and not even of a mother!) Who would have no idea of ​​vengeance, seeing that his dead partner has a forced abortion from people! I mean, really! This is basically a whole conspiracy. Richard Harris had to be extremely demanding for the role to take on this waste. That's kind of a movie that's so bad that if you've paid 50 cents to see it, you'll feel like you're going to demand a refund.
