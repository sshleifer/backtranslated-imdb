I am very surprised to see such a high rating of this film and a few reviews to be positive. I saw the movie and was quite disappointed. I did not find it pleasant at all. It was slow and lacking the value of entertainment. Even the murderous scenes are insignificant, with the real weapons of generic shooters that do not look good. And the assumed big curvature is really good, I saw it coming, and then it ended up clich√©. This movie does not have to be mentioned a lot, but the small one that gets it is overvalued. I would not like this movie.
