This is a typical 70-year-old sexual romp in Russ Meyer, though perhaps less strange than some of Meyer's work. This film has higher "production values" than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It's a conspiracy, writing and acting are right from area B, though. Later, this film became the main pillar of movie channels B (for example, "Drive In Classics") in a 500-channel universe. If the soft core is why you're in the mood, it's "good" like something else in range B. Do not expect Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more. Jennifer Welles's performance as "mother" is perhaps the best of cast. None of the actors in the movie surprises. The confession of a young American woman in the home is far from the worst example of its kind. It's observable if it's your type of movie. Thirty years ago it would have been an avant-garde and risky film. Nowadays, you can see more or less the same thing on Showtime / HBO and the main time.
