I do not know what this movie really is about. It's like a project of a student art school. They never say why the world is dark, but it's always dark except for seconds per day. There are long, interruptive shots of insects of all kinds without reason. What little dialogue is in the movie is as unpleasant and pointless as the paintings. The black woman enters the flat of the main character. Somehow he gets pregnant overnight and then gets into his head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon and then a white naked woman appears. I have never been so blown away by how bad and unnecessary the film can be. Frankly, I'd like someone to watch them tell me what they think it is. But I would not want this level of hell to anyone else.
