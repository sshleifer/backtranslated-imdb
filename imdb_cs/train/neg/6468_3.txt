It's a good thing. For Marlon Brando, the score appeared as a farewell performance because I hated to think of going to Free Money. Even his fans should not remember him. In recent years, Brando looks more like Orson Welles, and Free Money is the type of film Welles seeks to fund his own work. Brando is the administrator of a local prison that is in America when he is in a small rural setting, usually the largest employer in the area. It gives the one who has a great responsibility. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has one weakness he will enjoy, his two twins bimbos otherwise known as daughters. Even when they are a pregnant pair of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to Daddy. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid because Brando is willing to put them in prison where they work under conditions that are not much better than convicts. What to do, but to commit the robbery of a train that passes through the site, and so often that it wields the money spent by the Ministry of Finance. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has some humor, most of the time it's pretty beneath the talents of everyone involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepfather, but also a direct mad agent of the FBI. Of course, these people and the rest of the cast had to work with someone who many consider to be the greatest American actor of the last century. It was not for Brand's presence, and if it was about 40 years earlier, free money would play on a circuit in Red America where people could see how they were chewing. a poor attempt to satirize them.
