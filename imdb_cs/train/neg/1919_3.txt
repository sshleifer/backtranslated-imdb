I've read the book several times, and this movie is not doing just as it should. I could leave this picture, it's a movie. But I have serious problems with setting up a movie. It seems that no one mentions that this film and the book on which it is based are based on the real events that took place in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city from which this film should be based. First, the "small" city, which is referred to as the setting, is the third largest city of the state. With a population of around 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. The second scenery of the film is bad. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. Which is very flat and has only a few trees. I was trying to watch this movie, but it made me crazy when he saw my native city so badly treated. It was a real event. Large parts of the city were destroyed. The book talks about cycling from the island of Mormon to Fonner Park. I think you could, if you did not mind 15 kilometers.
