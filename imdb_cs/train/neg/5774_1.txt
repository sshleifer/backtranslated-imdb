This movie is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this film. Get on the bus while being clearly anti-racist does not just mean white whites and degrade the black status quo. The story of this film is about a group of blacks traveling on a bus to millions of people Louise Farrakhan. The bus has every type of guy you can imagine: gay, muslim, gangbanger and uncle Tom (but he is dropped from the bus). There was one white person on the bus. He was accused of racism when he boarded the bus to ride. Despite being a Jew and the fact that he explained the situation, he ended up as a racist and left the bus. I hate to say this, but movies like this need to realize their own hypokration and the reinforcement of sterlotypes. This should not be considered a triumph, but a sad disinflation. Maybe you think I'm a racist for writing this, but I think well. Much better luck, next time Spike.
