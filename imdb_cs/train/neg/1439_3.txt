I give 3 stars only for beautiful photos of Africa. The rest was ... very boring. For about 50 minutes, we have a conspiracy sketch ... In the World War, the opening part lasted about 10 minutes? Then it was a real action! This is something like: "Let's go to the savanna and jump on the beautiful sunsets!". And maybe it will deliver you a message like "Do not kill elephants!" Very ecological. I wanted to expect it from the "new" movie Steven Segal, not from it ... The lead actress is thinking about artificial tan, dyeing hair and too many basics! And I did not see a scene where her hair was dirty or she was dirty, or her clothes were dusty. It simply does not look like a 19th-century woman! And in the bar where our heroes are looking, Swayze commands the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and became famous in the years to come. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So if the event does not happen between 1896 and 1900. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression .. like a nut - hard on the outside, but soft and plush on the inside. Not that I'm taking a nut, but you get it. In fact, he managed to look at his face several times. The film fell. Too long and still boring. do not look at it! Do not buy it! It's the loss of your money!
