This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's about as fun as doing a hard hand job with stomach cramps. The movie starts badly (I would rate the first minute of the movie 1/10) and then gradually worsen, minute after minute. The only way to evaluate it would be some sort of hostile spiral negative number that is growing for ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but best describes humor in this video. Somehow, the video will make even the cute, almost dressed women and the sex look grotesque and disgusted. This movie is amazingly bad. I think it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over again and Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning to the ear before watching this movie. The sequel is not so bad. If you have to rent Troma, contact Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back than see the CLASS HIGHLY. Do not get me wrong, it took some criminal genius to make the movie terrible, and if the film ever deserves the prize for being terrible, that's it.
