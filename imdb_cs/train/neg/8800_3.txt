A collection of squeezed scenes and alternate shots, editing together, and with added voice to make them appear after the events first. Pretty cool idea, but the deleted scenes are left on the floor of the cutting room for some reason, and that's another proof. Since it's not as fun as "Anchorman," and you really think the movie was not a golden comedy, so you get a 'movie' worse than the one that was just fun. In my eyes, STILL gives one or two notches above "Kicking and Screaming" or "Bewitched". Chross fingers that "wedding crashers" is a return to the old school form (no verbs designated) <br /> <br /> My degree: D
