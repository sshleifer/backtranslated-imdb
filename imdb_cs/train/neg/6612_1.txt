This movie I downloaded yesterday through the website The quality was pretty good! I watched a movie with high expectations (though I knew it was a flop), especially because the movie has a superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain. Though at least actors like him would have made some prize for their roles. Bachchan, unfortunately, failed to act as a criminal, proving that no one can compete with the magical process of RJV AMJAD KHAN to re-ignite the past. Sholay, the old one is a milestone in the Indian cinema with an all-star cast, dialogue culture, stylish cinema and a brilliant soundtrack that is still hit with current generations too. A good actor like Ajay Devgan TALENTY is useless and his performance was average.Prashant Raj , a novice does not know what actor is. Nisha Kothari has proved to be one of the worst actresses I do not know how she is still in the crew of RGV Urmila & Abhishek seen in the song without excitement and the passion Mohanlal tried best and Susmitha Sen's work was good and somehow liked to work in this It was a total massacre of the original Sholay
