The movie is really too slow. There are some nice pictures, but that can not outweigh the fact that the movie is actually boring. You see sexual intercourse with plenty of water melons and sexual intercourse when you're going to be a melon and perhaps a little more. It might sound interesting, but believe me I'm looking at it for 2 hours, it's not fun at all. Though you laugh a few times, but it is really inadequate and can be more desperate and disbelieving than fun. If you want to disturb the director of boredom, he will try to insert several movie clips into the video clip. They are really varied clips of absurd songs, perhaps from the 1950s, but it's hard to say exactly and they're trying to be so funny that it's really sad. Several times you feel that the plot may develop into something that creates a strong scene, but it will surely evaporate at the end and it is. Besides the clips there are almost no dialogues, let alone music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally, I can not recommend the film. I believe that art is something that should not be boring. During the screening she was growing throughout the cinema, which only confirms my short overview.
