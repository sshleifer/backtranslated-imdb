argh! this movie hurts my head. and not in the good sense. Maybe it's just my growing hatred of action genre, but even as a child, if I swallowed my rival as a sea seal, I still considered this movie unlucky. now I absolutely despise. <br /> <br /> Take one fairly good story. hold the title and throw the rest. instead, use some short-term future gladiator plot that is so full of holes in all the things that are in danger of collapsing (why there is a rebel center in the middle of the arena, what cameras?) why they have clearly marked records of what really happened to bakeries in an unguarded room?), the whole movie screams the 1980s, ranging from fearsome score to goofy shiny costumes. ugh. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. I know some people like it, but some people are starting to look at them and I do not understand them either.
