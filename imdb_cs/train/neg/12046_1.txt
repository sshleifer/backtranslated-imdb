I had great hopes for Troy and I'm so bitterly disappointed. The movie was filmed so badly that my stomach ached. The movement was so slow, the dialogue was ridiculous, and the movie - except the nice battle scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow. And why Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories to suit "consumer approval". Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted for 10 years, and Achilles was killed by Pariz outside the Troy walls with ankle-to-ankle! It hurts me that such a classic story, like that, has changed to soap. And do not forget me about the "lack of" chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman who fought the war, and it did not seem like they cared much about each other. No sparks, no emotions, no hope. I have to say that in defense films Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O Toole worked very well with a bad script, but that is not a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can someone tell me where the budget was 200 million pounds? Maybe on all the trees they use for burial pyres - where did they get all the trees? I'm so disappointed it hurts.
