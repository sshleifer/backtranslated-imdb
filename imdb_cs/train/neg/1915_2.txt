She is a pretty good actress, but the film has no place near the charming original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone who is looking for a kapar movie should visit the original. William Macy can be one of our biggest live actors, but he has little use here. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I like to try to fill him. He may also try to imitate Bogart or young De Niro. Artistic direction is rich and textured but does not bring anything to the story, the extra bits that add to the story are totally useless and the things they take are omitted. They even start as it seems they are bizarrely worthless and postpone the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his weird and brilliant charm, and Luis Guzman has this special charisma, but the love story of a part of the film seems clumsy and flat. It's a bad thing that nobody has found out how to make this film the same way it was made for the first time, but it's bad that we live in a culture where we feel like remaking wonderful stuff instead of simply learning to enjoy the originals.
