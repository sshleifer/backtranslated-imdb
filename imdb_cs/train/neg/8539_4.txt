This engagement (which should not be) the top Spanish exploitation (quite tedious I can supply) looks good, right? Let me say again "what?" In fact, the word "what?" it would be a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try. I just do not know if it's a complicated mystery or just confused confusion, but there is no denying how laconically unconventional, weird and witty it feels. Unrelated sequences tied up (like a nasty opening involving a little girl, a dead cat and a fire) into a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by the inflamed chest John Caffari, who is a mustache from the dead Mario ringtones for Nintendo icon, what's the chance? her girlfriend at home and encounter a young lady (beautifully fixating Patty Shepard) who asks to come with him to a photo where some hooded witches meet at this remote mountain sanctuary. Look at the blurred fence structure, which is just a moody piece of atmospheric mechanics and growing uneasiness. Raul Artigot directs a number of unusually unusual visuals and scary passages, but he seems to be sporadically non-existent and does not lag as well as his writing. Ramon Semper's amazing cinematography draws on a charming scenery as we enjoy the scenic view and let the time tilt. However, there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what is happening. Fernando García Morcillo is terribly bombastic, and the score is great for a compulsive dense atmosphere. Leads are capable, but there is also a robust bunch (selected by Víctor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> It slows down a little in the way of interest, but this dreamy set-up he and he can track until it's closed.
