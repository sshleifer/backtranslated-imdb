When I was a teenager who saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and her various stripes in this movie. However, when I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is terrible. I think Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she was a wife-director John Derek, make sure that you see a lot. But when you take this aspect of the film, it becomes one big, boring journey. And Tarzan, it's all muscular as you think it should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what he thinks. Notwithstanding the fact that Bo is wearing a wet visible shirt whose breasts are prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive person on the planet who would have the problem. If you're looking for a movie that could hide over a beautiful naked body, it could fill the ticket. If you're looking for a sophisticated, fun movie at a good price, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere else!
