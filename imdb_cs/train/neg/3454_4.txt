Cut tries to look like most of the Scream shots who tried to be a spoof of a horror genre that was trying to be clever by reference to other famous horror films. Now I'm not sacrificing "Scream," as I think Scream is a very good horror movie that makes a great job of blending horror and comedy. Cutting will fail at most levels. It has moments, but in general it just does not work, not even as a movie "so bad it's good", just below average. The first five minutes are fine and we set the story quite well, except that Kylie Minogue can not really act and ironically gets into her tongue, go. Go ahead and a group of film students want to end a movie that is clearly cursed. And as you've probably predicted, one by one cast and crew are slowly being taken away by a masked madman. Improper plotting, bad gaming and predictable end are just some of the elements that follow. There are lots of links in the movie, from "Scream" to "The Massacre of the Chain Saw". Not even clever, he feels like the director wants to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous screams of Scream's horror. For slasher there is a minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher who does not have much to go for. I really should support this film because I'm Australian and we're not as good at horror (but we have our gems), but Cut is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, I could see it in about 90 minutes, so it's at least something good. I'm not going to recommend anyone except hardcore slasher fans who can appreciate what they're trying to do, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
