I am forced to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means to warn others to save their money. Almost every episode of "Human Animal" by Desmond Morris or "The Story of Things" by David Suzuki could have presented the material presented. Not only does the director do not use incredible IMAX movies with dimensions of 65 to 70 mm and a gigantic presentation, everything on the screen is extremely insurmountable due to the availability of such programming mentioned earlier. The audience will introduce pregnant Heather, her husband Buster and their niece and nephew. We watch them for an endless forty minutes, eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Even though we have access to scenes within the human digestive tract and learn about natural children's diving reflections, do we actually learn more than just the majority of high school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained in the transatlantic moor? Do not we care? Avoid this movie at any cost. If you want to see the IMAX feature, I suggest a beautifully photographed "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or technically exciting "3D Space Station". Believe me.
