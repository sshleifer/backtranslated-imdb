It was all about 88, so it's time for cheese to tear up those older movies. The brain is well done, the scenario reminds me of Videodrome, but then even more, as I said before. The game can go with him. But it's the effect that laughed at you, the so-called Brain is really Turkey, and blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this film look like, the hallucinations are really nice and reminded me Nightmare on Elm Street, remember how the phone is alive ... Some of you keep watching this movie and waiting for it is going on. It's visible to all the monsters out there because there's no gore in it, and how he says blood is not there, but there's nudity on perversions. I've seen worser movies before this, just wished they were bloodier ...
