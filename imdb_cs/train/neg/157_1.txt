OK first the video looks like it was shot in the 80s, I was shocked to find out that it was released in 2001. Secondly, the conspiracy was everywhere, straight from the bat the story is confusing. If there was a short prolog or introduction, the story would be better. I also appreciate fantasy, but this movie was too much. It was bizarre and badly shot. The scenes do not flow smoothly and the characters are weird. It was hard to watch and maybe it was a translation, but it was hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films, but if you are looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film, I recommend a promise (visually stunning, plot is interesting and good nature), not this movie. Be careful, you will be disappointed.
