this film has no conspiracy, no character development, and no budget. it's really upset to make it short. There is no development for the film, but it really can not even seem like an attempt to be artistic or try to declare torture. Which leaves two other reasons why she can look at it. If you want to be shocked or get to him like a sick little angry. I also miss it here. The reactions of the girl look stupid. it's extremely easy to say it's fake (a sincere professional match looks more realistic than the bulls trying to get into this movie.) Their hooks on her, but most of it is sleeping, so it's just stupid. really a very useful part is the end when they quickly remove the scene from the scene just before the needle slips into her eye. But honestly, the girl is very ugly and everything is incredibly false, except for the eye. a movie about torture, patrol Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do they contain realistic violence, but there's also a real story that attracts you and makes you care about people. Plus sway films really work on deeper level topics such as American fear of foreigners, questions of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts vs. civilization and many other things. In addition, they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story does not focus on fatigue. These are far better choices than this piece of crap
