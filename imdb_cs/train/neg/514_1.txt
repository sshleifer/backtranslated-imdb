This is one of the most insipid, insignificant, non-original and useless films ever made! He almost feels that anyone involved in this project has not even made an attractive film. It is nothing but a continuation of a difficult series of films that try to make money for the success of Smokey and the bandit, which is, in my opinion, the best film of all. Regarding this loss of film material, Burt Reynolds comes up with the whole story, Jim Nabors is useless, other actors do not get much, automobile races are of course serial footage, humor is uninviting, and many of the scenes are boring and more vivid than staring at the wall two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous film that has nothing extraordinary or distinctive.
