I have to agree with the majority of anyone who thinks this show was badly produced as well as written. The effects were not a bit higher than lower production values, but I feel that the actor can only rely on the material he has been given. In line with this idea, I feel it is important to emphasize that one actor has risen and suffered behind this camp so that unstoppable production becomes a decent and quite talented artist. I mean, Laura Harris, a native Canadian native, is going through many badly produced shows and movies and finds a place on HBO's hit "Dead Like Me," where she plays Daisy Adair and plays a role in her role. I remember having had a typical child crush on a young actress during this series where she played Ashley's slightly spoken but intelligent seventh grader. I felt like someone could get out of this series from this series, it would certainly be Laura Harris and true to her nature, a field to gain the respect of many producers who now recognize her as her talent as well as the unique Nordic blonde charm. If you ever have the opportunity to see this series, I recommend you to watch epic tracks such as "Godfather" or "Beaches" to remind you that there is really a lot of true production integrity, and that this series is just a low-lighted reminder what Laura Harris can simply say about her time at the show, and I bet she would quote many young actors with the words of defense: "It's a start!"
