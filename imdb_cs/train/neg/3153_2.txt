I'm crazy about good romance, but this is not good either romance. I had the story loaded before the credits were released. With such a poor dialogue, drawing and character development, I recommend investing an hour and a half elsewhere. I had to hit and off Serendipity for the third time so I could get the bad taste of this from my mouth.
