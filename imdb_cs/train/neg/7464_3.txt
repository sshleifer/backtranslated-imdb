I did not watch the whole movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped watching the DVD for half an hour, and I suggest that someone think that they stop by themselves before removing the disc from the briefcase. I like mafia films both tragic and comic, but Corky Romano is just described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. The problem is that Corky Romano is trying to get audiences to laugh, it seems that the plot is an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is totally exaggerated, lacking in gentleness or credibility - all of his strange ways come across how he thinks - Chris Kattan is clearly "acting" rather than accepting a role - it will bounce you straight out of the story. Each scene is completely predictable, the "comic event" that appears on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies such as Mr. Bean, the catastrophe caused by the title character is fun, because you can sense the character's motives, and the initial event and the situation in which the character is over is not telegraphed. Corky, however, feels he deliberately attempts to ridicule an audience's laugh. If Chris does not play such an extraterrestrial figure (who is never really connected with the other characters in the movie) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (except for attempts at drawing laughter) and comedy scenes were not as predictable and stereotypical - all jokes seemed too familiar) could be observable. But it's not. Do not look at it.
