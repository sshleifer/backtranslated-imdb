What F * @ # I've just watched this one? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is incredibly bad and stupid. In bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (of course) with a wish - they were - vampires 'as' beings with superhuman power. OK? Oh, and their eyes blink side by side in a inhuman way? Wow! Even in this movie, however, suppress the Seagals has-to-have-the-last-punch-and-nobody-can-kick-my-a $$ ego, he is somewhat stronger than they are. However, all average people are crushed all around him. Come on, I understand the big assailant or drug dealer, but they are superhuman strong people. Oh and get it, Seagal is going through the short pain of the identity issue, because apparently he and his cohorts in the movie think he's Wolverine! Oh my GO ... And worst than all this! Yes, it's worse than that. My voice over changing her voice in the middle sentence when we look at his face. Apparently there was nothing like him and I think it could be one of the other actors in the movie. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always watch the movie. This is also low for Steven's direct video. Shocking! Shocking! Shocking! Two inches down! Tired? I think I will be fair in that aspect. At least some special effects were fine and I like the choice of wardrobe for actors and actresses. All women were quite attractive to the IMO. Yet, and I said that STILL is not recommended for the clumsy X-Men, The Underworld (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) to tear off! Director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed & exiled from the movie business. I think I feel the way most people feel about Blood Rayne about this movie (and almost all the other Uwe Boll films). That's all my $ 1.00 on this movie. See if you dare.
