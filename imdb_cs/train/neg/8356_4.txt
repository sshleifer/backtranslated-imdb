Peter Fonda is so deliberately horrified as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings abolish any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair. even his minor touches (such as the fingering of a non-existent mustache on his oblique face) do not show the character as much as a certain actor who is controlled by himself, an insecure filmmaker. In the southwest around 1950, a poor player (not a little cheat) wins orphaned, future teenager Lolita in a bad poker game; after getting a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the defending pair becomes search engine. Some beautiful views and the curious but interesting story of Henry Fonda, as a canyon, are just the only compensation in a tedious comedy drama, both guides being dragged by cartoon killers who stop in nothing until they get their hands on the map. Shields are very nice, but even if the camera loves her strap, shiny beauty - she has no presence on the screen (and her thin voice has nothing at all); every time he opens his mouth, one is inclined to either the cervix or the duck. * 1/2 from ****
