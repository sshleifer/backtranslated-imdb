Bobby is a terrifying boy who smiles too much and wants sex. So she buys a van to help in this way. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic, and the script is no more than a fret string of clichés and cheap excitement. The filmmakers apparently wanted to capture some of the fools of other films of that time, but a long way off. They even resorted to Bobby, who was sliding on banana skin because it would probably add comic value. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to find the redemption of the film's features. If you like DeVito, this is another classic role of DeVito - but it's just a supporting actor and there for cliché value.
