First, let me start with the quote that my friend said when watching this movie: "This whole movie must have been courageous. You know, like," DUDE, BET YOU CAN NOT KNOW THE LARGEST FILM EVER "". With this film, they have endeavored to achieve this title. The effects are, of course, bad. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from all B horror films ever made. Actors, I suppose, should be in college. Part of it (especially at the beginning) seems to be a high or high school. It makes no sense. The guardian of fear, which is about killing people, is not a bit pleasant. (SPOILER: Eventually, when they sip Lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and the scarecrow both agree, perhaps relieved to be on their last scene and cheese dialogue.)
