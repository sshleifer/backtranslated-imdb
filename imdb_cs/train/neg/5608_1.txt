I was curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my conviction. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to all opinions or opinions. It does not matter whether Jesus existed as it is written in the Bible. If Maria was a virgin or not, or all other similar pagan matches. It matters to me the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. What mocked me when someone took the sentence presented it as a fact, but without mentioning the context that was written. For example, in this film, the following sentence was great: "To my enemies who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me." Jesus (Luke 19:27) does not tell you that it is a context. Jesus told the story of the evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After an incorrect quotation of the Bible, it shows us that we are screaming people (pseudo-Christians) filled with hatred. Most viewers do not check the information provided, so they think that Jesus = hatred is not good for me or someone else. They are purely manipulative people. Please use your brain. Do not take everything as the fact that they tell you in this movie. We will destroy our own foundation, our civilization, if we start demolishing Jesus in this way and the message he has brought us. You saw a branch you're sitting on.
