This movie is a bad news and I am really surprised at the level of great name talent that would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk mail. I imagine a few strangled agents broke out on the Hollywood boulevard. as a result of this fiasco. What really gets is that it could be good. The directors talked about the stars and the object was enough to feed and sell tickets, but it's a flop. Multiple story lines are from bad to silly from end to end, and you finally feel like a labyrinth mouse looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be spoiled. What Spike can do is revenge against all the Italians who could have killed him when he was a child or offended because the film is doing a fair amount of habits for obsolete and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any movie in Spike Lee, there really is a thought provoking and magical camera. She does not have the gift that she is going to capture her psyche and bring you to her vision, and only in case of a few unforgettable scenes. But the question remains ... you can endure another 2 hours of scratching heads and watching the clock as you wonder and wait for the end that has to be somewhere there.
