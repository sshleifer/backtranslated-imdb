Yesterday I saw Flyboys and my girlfriend told me that it was the worst movie she ever saw ... Because I thought it was terrible too, I was thinking - which movie was the worst movie I've ever seen and it was just a movie that came to mind. Unfortunately, it was a few years since I saw it, but I remember the terribly unclear Dean Cain as a nice military man (nice Kain guy does not do badly). Special deal with a CGI helicopter, when it would be cheaper to rent a helicopter than hire some CGI guys to do it, but I think they found a helicopter as a free sample for a CGI program or son of a producer like to play with a new computer. And how did it look? Sad. And when the dragon attacks the corridors of the complex, he uses the same shots again and again - looks very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really terrible ...
