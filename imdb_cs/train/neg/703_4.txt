University students who clean up a prison house are persecuted by an unspeakable murderer. <br /> <br /> The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a little mixed bag for slasher fans. Film production values ​​are relatively low and the story is largely routine, even a scary bum hanging around for herring. In fact, much of the story is very forgotten, with the exception of one or two brutal murders. But the film is really better with a surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric environment) and a rather bold, unconventional conclusion. Cast is for the most part inadequate. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot because he has a really nice turn. See also the young Daphne Zuniga as a sick fateful pupil. <br /> <br /> Despite all this is quite a standard effort B slasher, but the end is well worth it to enjoy and for this viewer saved the movie from being complete <br /> <br /> <br /> ** from ****
