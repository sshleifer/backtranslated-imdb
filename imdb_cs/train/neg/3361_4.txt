This movie was one of the best movies ever to have ,,,, he had everything to make the movie great. Unbelievable acting, amazing special effects ...... oh wait I have to think about good movie. This was not one of them, it just sucked. What I want to know is what kind of bone head would think that this movie was 10. When I voted for 206, the god knows what's going on in their head. Now, like any other vote, 8 or 9 were still too high, but 10? Come on, what was this movie good for 10? I know these are the same who thought Jean Claude Van Damme was a great dramatic actor.
