Usually I try to be professional and constructive when criticizing films, but my GOD !!! It was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad actions, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /> <br /> The sketch follows a group of juvenile clich√©s on the way to rave (taking place in daylight) on a remote island. When the band arrives, they will find only empty dance floor and bloody clothing. Determined to find out what happened to other party participants, the clan set is turned off on a mission through a zombie infested forest. During this crusade, the police chick and the captain of the sea, who has the right amount of weapons, give them to each of them. They also meet Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. Basically, the rest of the film is a collection of badly targeted action sequences, including too long a shootout outside the "house of the dead." This fight has been linked to violent Hollywood violence, excessive video clips from the HOTD video game and unfavorable rotation of the camera matrix. One of the characters is even volunteers to sacrifice to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and courageous, but because his face was biting his teeth when the zombie spit on him after he continued defeating the creature long after he was disabled! I think I like this boy ?! <br /> <br /> To sum it up, it makes no sense to see this movie if you do not want to see yourself how terrible it is. The theater I was in was much deadier than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I lost when I saw that this piece of champagne could easily cover the costs that were incurred to make it possible.
