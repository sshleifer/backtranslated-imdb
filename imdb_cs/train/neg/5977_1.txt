Wow. I will not remember much about this movie except that it happened. The plot is basically; the girl's parents neglect her, so this humble PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one I disrupted? Then, this strange PokeMon drives Asha's mom to pretend to be a girl. I do not care if she's trying to make the girl happy, it's just rough. There was no real conspiracy. The girl was just a spiteful sleep that wanted things in its own way. She plays with Unowns, she was Ente's "daughter", and apparently she could grow and diminish her age with the help of her "daddy." That's almost everything I remember, but I can take it as a help and not see her. (Or if you see it, do not expect too much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Really. To PokeMon, rent "PokeMon, the first movie".
