Cameron Diaz is a woman who married a judge played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is fine until it seems, and things get a little more complicated. When watching this movie I asked myself several times why I was doing so .. because the movie is so ridiculous and foolish and misguided without any credibility. Even the audience does not really do what happens. Even the nice Cameron can not save this on a scale of one to ten.
