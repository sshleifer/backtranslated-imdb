this movie is going to be incredibly clever and like Tarantino <br /> <br /> than you try but you need solid film basics. these include good sound, editing, set design etc ... <br /> <br /> lets you talk about the sound in this movie. absolutely unpleasant. I've never been scattered by a soundtrack, sometimes, and before we talk about a low budget, a movie made in Chile etc. lets keep in mind that desent sound these days is far more attainable than it ever was. anywhere. and more information about the technique is available at all ever before <br /> <br /> The sound in this movie is simply bad. Foley, in particular, is out of place and inappropriate throughout, the atmosphere is just as awful. during the movie, I heard at least four loud clicks that are the result of poor audio editing. the sound inside the cars is terrible, the sound of closing the door is terrible. the sound of singing is incorrect. foley is either overboard or simply is not there as a healthy man just bored and surrendered. spaces are incorrect. it's all bad about it <br /> <br /> and yet, without restraining creativity, the movie is trying to get smart. for example, the sound of the aquarium is used in the next street. we hear the sound when it is not. sound adjustments precede visual cuts. every trick in a book is used, and yet the basics are just not there editing-wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts, we have tinkering around the time series etc etc, etc. yawning. all these techniques are imitated at a gorgeously low standard <br /> <br /> Overall mix is ​​crap, sound is bullshit. and so the movie is stupid. how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered a prize and a high praise? Chile's new film wave? the best creative output that Chile can offer? I hope not, and I do not think so. My theory is that Chile is a more selective and better talent avoiding this movie as an epidemic perhaps because of its risque content. the movie was likely to have received so much unwarranted critical response from the so-called "world cinema" enthusiasts for the same insignificant reasons. they probably reflect in his sadness. Of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality <br /> <br /> This film is garbage. it's all mouth and no pants and never deserves a rating of 6.8. the movie has all the quality of producing cheap Tarantino, a new wave of inspired porn!
