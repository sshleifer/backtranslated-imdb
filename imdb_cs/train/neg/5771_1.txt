He begins to apologize to creators everywhere using the terms "filmmaker", "film" or "movie" in connection with it, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seemed a little harsh. <br /> <Song: Poor. <br /> <br /> Direction: poor. <br /> <br /> Nude: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: Too awkward for words. <br /> <br /> Technical Skills Used to Build This Atonement: NEVER EVERYONE. <br /> <br /> This stack of rubbish could hardly be called a cinema. Most family home movies get closer to getting this difference than Revenge Quest. No, these are just 10 cars that were captured on the video. <br /> <br /> We skip the conspiracy in this report because there are too many holes that need to be covered at once. Let's just say it worsens the rest of this movie. To call one-sided acting, you will give it to them. What is scarce is scary from scratch and worsened by scary video and editing. The worst part of this atrocities, though apart from the act, should be the effects ... or rather its disturbing deficiency. There are no weapons in the gun, no flashes and few sound effects exist either "acoustic" acoustic sounds, or were generated by mouth (yeah, you read it correctly). The film director had the courage to record the sound "shh" for the lift door; I think he thought it was futuristic. This is only to be determined in 2031. But that does not explain the sounds he created for his fist fight scenes. <br /> <br /> If it was not bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (just using the microphone that was mounted on the camcorder, and it shows), the use of acoustic weapons was almost worse than not using any sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack as a drunken junk in the herd of sheep and are equally clumsy. Take a picture of it: A bad guy enters an office building looking for his prey. The lady is beginning to worry. Raises the weapon (uzi) and shakes. We hear a sound that is obviously not amazing. The woman runs out of the camera and suddenly a bloodbath (only 1) explodes on her back (looks like it has been hit by paintball) and she falls on her face. <br /> <br /> Bear in mind that my description makes too much justice for the disobedience of the actual sequence. The next sequence, which almost - but not quite - makes the film funny to watch is taking place in the staircase. The bad guy is a good guy and a lady who protects him down the stairs and shakes the plastic uzi all his way. Maybe you want a duck; there are poorly timed sound effects flying all over the place. I supposed Alan DeHerrera could not be locked away for the concept of this train wreck, but he went on all the way to editing and releasing. If there is any righteousness, there is some karma with his name. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this piece of industrial waste - and I strongly recommend it - the whole scene has just risen from Bladerunner and the AM radio doubles as a transmitter. Try to focus too hard on the conspiracy; it will only hurt more, if so. <br /> <br /> 0 stars 10. And that's generous.
