Every movie that has naked scenes of Karen Allen and I'm still so boring I'm leaving, that's smelly! <br /> <br /> Karen gets stuck in Paris and friends with a neighboring French man with whom she will soon have sex. Of course he is married ("But cheri, why should it be a problem?") What an interesting encounter of cultures is (believe it or not) just boring. I went out. <br /> <br /> Maybe, after I left, the movie was much better; but it would have to get a lot better to avoid a spoiled start. My advice, if you find yourself in this, go, do not go to the exit. Save time and energy. Sure you save money. It is a pity that the manufacturing company has not saved its money.
