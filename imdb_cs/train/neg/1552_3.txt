This film was very well-known. I'm a passionate filmmaker and I've seen the previews of this movie of the moon. While I was somewhat skeptical about how funny this movie is, my friends thought it would be great and it encouraged me. Then I went and saw it, I was immersed in the seat almost asleep until I forgot that I paid for this film. I wanted to laugh at most things in the movie so I did not want to feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, and I wanted to get my money worth the movie! I always go to a movie with an open mind, I'm not trying to get too much with them, but this movie was not that funny. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen but it's definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you have not seen a lot of movie previews, or you like very slow and nasty comedy, you can enjoy it, but for true comedic Id fans say they go through. Maybe even check The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to meet my parents!
