Anyone with a distant interest in science fiction should begin on the ground. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best movie sci-fi to start, which is fine, but the truth is TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, is a much better choice than those series. SOYLENT is probably the best science fiction. It remains one of the largest but most forgotten movies, but the impact of each encounter becomes a reality every day. Charlton Heston overvalues ​​his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most of SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes touch. It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is crowded, and food is incredible happiness (a small hole of strawberry jam costs $ 150). Big CEO of Soylent is murdered and police detective Thorn is in that case. The secret of green green is not a mystery when conducting research in the movie. SOYLENT is nice to watch, but the whole script is a joke. It's as cheap as the whole production. The screenplay and the dramatic actors shot the film, but they were totally gay. Everyone seems to be nasty and no one knows the rules, in particular, the cop Thorn, who just wanted to drive into people's flats, explore all the way around and steal everything he wants. Character interactions keep your attention on the movie, but you are still aware that SOYLENT GREEN is upset. Pleasant piece if you have time, but do not expect more.
