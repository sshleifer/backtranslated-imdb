Well, my God, I'm disappointed. When I first heard the 1963 remake of Robert Wise's film "The Haunting," I was afraid it would be destroyed by a number of visual effects in the summer movie. But I had a deep faith. Sure, with such a talented cast ... De Bont and Society do not destroy the original film, it was a fantastic and frightening film that grasped the fine art of subtlety. Well, the gentleness, where are you now? My worries turned out ... the promising movie went wrong. Yes, the production design of Eugenio Zannetti is a headband; the film is beautifully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never be wrong. The script, however, states that they are great actors who try them, and therefore show them that they are able to carry on such a fierce dialogue, which is only spoken in the films. In the end, Lili Taylor is always the only artist who has escaped with some dignity ... and it is hard to do. But the crime of all the crimes is that the horror shows us. We can no longer use our imaginations, feel terrible fear of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to show us what we should be afraid of ... and you know what? How strange they are, how they are ... visual effects look like a kind of stupidity. And the culmination is a fantasy mess ... but before that it was terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is exaggerated and exaggerated. I'm afraid there's no real excitement in this old spooky house ... ... just a groan. Check the original. <br /> <br />
