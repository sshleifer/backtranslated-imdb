I have to admit I laughed when I saw one reviewer compare it to LOTR. Well, yes, if you exclude dwarves, cast thousands, great special effects, great battles, strong characterization, decent plot, good behavior, elegant direction and everything else. She leaves you as she walks. And boy, this movie makes walking! If Mr. Piano had a trip, it would probably be a three-hour hardcore walk through the countryside of Wisconsin, but every 40 minutes, these poisonous martians appeared for a few seconds before they interrupted him before going to another mud. You have never seen so much that you would be in the movie. If it really had a budget of $ 20 million, most of them must get on Mr Pian's shoes because he had to get through a lot of couples with all the walks he does. Which explains why money is not left for decent effects, a decent video camera or the right actors. Frankly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with things going for long walks in the costumes period. Even on fast forward it's looonnnggg walking. As far as science fiction is concerned, I think it was the mistake the Martians put into the film: just walking, which is much more interesting to the director than the story. I wonder how many Mr. Piano will accuse dogs of going?
