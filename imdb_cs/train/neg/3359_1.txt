This story has changed! Eventually Nell is heroic and takes to save all of his Hill House donkeys and lots of nonsense! Split heads, wire cuts, and the ceiling turned into a huge hand! What the hell is that? I own and love the original movie, I read a book and I love her! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is that it scares you so much without showing the spirit. There is no gore. There is no ceiling hand. It's just a ghost how the ghosts can actually kill a man. They can not kill us, they can not throw us into the room or knife in the head. No. They can only crazy us. Removing all our sense of security. Nell was a selfish woman. He wants only good things for himself. Yes, she cared a little about the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have been killed for this great story! I hate that damn remake!
