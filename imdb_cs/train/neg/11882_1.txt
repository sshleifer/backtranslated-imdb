Several times I looked at the shelf and looked at countless huge positive quotations (with small names) on the front and I wondered if something was missing. The other night it was on one of the film channels and I tune in. I miss nothing. I have to admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the film becomes a comedy of gold after that. Due to the slow, fertile pace and total lack of laughter in the first 30 years, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The lead character starts a film in the classical style of "I Do not Know How to Start a Movie," with a long, tiring monologue about not wanting to sue. Its not funny. It's not funny either. Others commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, little laugh for the first time what he says. Then he kills him in the ground and smiles at the camera as if it were the most fun thing they ever wrote. Cross yourself. In fact, I think talking to the camera was the reason why I did not immediately like the movie. Do not assume audience knowledge. Knowledge is obvious, just like respect. From there, you are basically a fat guy who speaks in a very effeminate way about his dark life as a tempo. I did not realize he was Jewish; it is to discredit Jewish comedies to call this "Jewish humor." It's just an unfortunate humor. Just because you're Jewish does not mean you have a comedy. And WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job with self-humor than this guy, so of course it's not of ethnic origin. If any of the pieces I saw worked, I could get stuck. But some shit is about how much she loves the names of the women she works with, and then puts them on for five long minutes, does not make a great movie. This is an obvious attempt to take advantage of the popularity of "Office Space". Do not fall victim to target marketing. Just say no, "Haiku Tunnel".
