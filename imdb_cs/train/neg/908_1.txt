After I purchased a DVD at Bargain Bin because of the impressive amount of features on the cover, I popped it into a DVD player and everything looked good. Nice animated menus and lots of other features ... but when I was playing the movie itself, what left it. It's the worst thing I've ever seen, and in my time I've seen some bad movies. The comment that praises the film here in the IMDB is actually from the people who made the film. So do not believe it if you do not waste money!
