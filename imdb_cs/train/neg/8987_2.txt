The only redeemed quality of this film is a real story ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The game was ridiculously bad, and the designer was juggling and very tiny. The story was decent, but it was very hard to watch for all the horrific acting acts. I would not recommend watching this ... The only redeemed quality of this film was that the actors were a little attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, a man playing the soap opera star. Some adjustments have been made well, but there are mistakes of continuity all over the place ... I'm just getting sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get good soon?
