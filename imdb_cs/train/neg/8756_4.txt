Russell Hopton worked in many films until his death in 1945. He only directed 2 and "Black Gold" was one (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro sometimes had an abrasive screen, but he played a good kid. He was obviously quite popular on the "quickie" circuit - he did so many movies. This is what the son of an old oil rocket plays, who is convinced that the oil will soon hit. J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to persuade the old man to sell because he knows that there will be oil in every moment. Geologist Henry comes to the scene and assists Father Fishtail. He also convinces "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry's eye on Cynthia, a nice teacher. This was Glory Shey's latest film - she began her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). Secretary of Fishtail is killed when sabotage is sabotaged and Henry is determined to show Anderson and his friends in court. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade Fishtail to sell his hiring oil. Everything ends when the oil strikes and "Fishtail" goes to the Military School. <br /> <br /> It's fine for a rainy day.
