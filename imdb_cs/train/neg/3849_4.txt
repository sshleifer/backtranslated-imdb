Debbie Reynolds toe-taps, tango and yes, tap-dancing the way through this common thriller that has a distinctly 30s atmosphere. The two ladies, associated at the time their sons committed murders, tried to start their lives by running a tank dance school in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is tormented by neurosis. Can you imagine this thing ten years ago when director Robert Aldrich directs Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never allow Joan so much time on the screen to remember her stuff, and I can not imagine Bette Davis in another role, and danced her heart out. This is a purely fraudulent piece of scary work written by declining Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to build mass murder of a group of rabbits!). It's not a unique entertainment in the whole lukewarm package. * 1/2 from ****
