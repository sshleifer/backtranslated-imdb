- The Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something. I went to see this movie because it was a WWF game and so I thought it might be funny. It was not. It is unbearable to watch. Embarrassing. Every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly missed. <br /> <br /> I admit I do not like Jack Black. Then I thought about my brain to realize one good role he did. The only thing I can come up with was where was o.k. was a necessary foil for John Cusack's character in the film "High Fidelity." Jack Black is one of those spooky ruthless flat rockers (such as the little fat in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being overly idiotic is not the same thing that is funny. <br /> <br /> It's not a ghost. It's just irritating. It's not even scary, it's just stupid. I've also heard good things about Napoleon's dynamite, but if it's something I should go, I would not hurry to find it on DVD.
