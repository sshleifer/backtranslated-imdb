Fragile, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - these are all the teasers that I enjoyed spending an hour or so "discovering" the jewel of the film. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po will never get there. The film is incredibly self-confident. I did not find myself unable to stop the mist for a moment. Exaggerated, obviously theatrical ensembles, exaggerated, apparently theatrical acting, exaggerated, apparently theatrical direction - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegory does not need to be delivered in the style of a hammer. And it's hard for Julian to feel something, because we never know about it. Smiling girlfriends, poisoning city dwellers, idiot priests, baby brothers - why would anyone, especially someone with a long life ambition, get to the sea (Slaterova character), decide to stay in such an unfortunate place?
