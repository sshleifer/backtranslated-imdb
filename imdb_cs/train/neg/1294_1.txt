The main theme of this film seems to be a mess because relationships, settings, acting and social relationships lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual flawless clarity, direction and intensity. To make it even worse, the name of his name is "Che" and we just (directly, the narrators) said that the film is not that "Che", just a guy named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation into America. So clich√©. Other reviews describe how the film describes the impact of the revolution on a boy's family; however, the Director's political attitude is at best unclear and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what the bloodshed. So they lost their property (gained by game profits) - so what? Rejecting political attitude when shooting a film about the Cuban revolution is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they are not allowed to shoot in Cuba. And if the most important family life is here, it would be great if we could find out who is who - we are all "introduced" at the beginning - by the cheap way to make the relationships in the whole movie clearer! The game was mostly shallow, wooden and incredible, the timing was all around. "Special" visual effects were confusing and disturbing. Links to American films - and a black character like a Greek chorus - are totally unreasonable, intellectually ostentatious, and consistently out of place. I watched the whole movie just because I was waiting for clarity or something for all of it. It never happened.
