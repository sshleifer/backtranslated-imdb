I will not go and give them my 10 dollars I went and bought the fourth vintage original and the best. At least my children enjoy it and they can watch it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager, and she thinks the previews are ridiculous, and they'd better look at the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a terrible daisy, in fact she thinks she looks more like a whore than a duchess. Those shorts that would not have anything to wear. And since when American Pie has something to do with Dukes Shame, they gave that ugly line of sex to the car. This in itself should have a film rating R. The only good thing that could come out of this is a movie with new originals. Allow all hope. So people who went there and saw the movie will see what it should look like
