I just watched the Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and take care of it, I even tried to get the blind women to look at it and she turned it off for about 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this one? As for writing, if this is what you would like to call, responsible people should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell! I believe I read somewhere that the budget of this movie was $ 10,000 and was so below. Did Wallmart make a good interest in this matter? Each store has a huge huge wastebasket that sits on the sales area. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a track or trade it with a friend, but then you do not have to be your friend anymore!
