Now there are plenty of talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. None of them is associated with this "movie". Why do the producers really invest money into something like this in the world? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget of this waste! It's not funny that seven adult men run like dwarves and pretend to be fun. What is funny, however, is that the film producer (who becomes the oldest man of the pile) plays the smallest dwarf. The film is filled with moments that scream at the headlines and say, "You should laugh now!". It's hard to believe that this bullshit is a comedy. Many people actually got up and left the cinema for 30 minutes in the movie. I had to do the same instead of hurling time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
