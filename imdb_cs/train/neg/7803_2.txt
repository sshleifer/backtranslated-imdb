The "secretary" is one of those baited, clich√©, "thrillers" who are exposed to observation on Sunday afternoon when there is practically nothing else. While the conspiracy (the demented woman becomes jealous of everyone who has managed in the office and has decided to do anything to stop) can be unique, I have known the countless plot of conspiracy, probably taken from other television films, which I was reasoned for . <br /> <br /> To make it even worse, I was not strange about the wilderness. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appear in so many television films as either "mum" or as a "victim" of bad play or abuse that one has to wonder what kind of life he is leading. At this moment, she enjoys playing mother and the victim of Sheila Kelly's psychological secretary, who was not a bad choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly did some good career (Singles, Breaking In, and I think law and order), she is also dressed up by a number of woeful TV movie roles, and that is what she adds to that. As for the others, I have no clear memories about them, so it has to say something. This is going to play on the Lifetime network (I think I can see it), but no matter how you watch it if you're too bored behind the words. Not that it would make you more excited ...
