I thought this movie would be much better than it was. It sounded like the culmination of the spy general, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this film came short. The story is just ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have set up an espionage school to teach their spies how to behave like the Americans, but the city that trains it for training is a bit too late, so they're coming from the United States, up. I do not know, but it seems to be just outside. It's really strange when no one in this Russian city speaks a Russian accent. Someone was casting a cast. <br /> <br /> Also for comedy it's painfully dry. There's one, two funny peaks and there's not a lot and singing. The movie will eventually sleep. And like a twisted blow to the face, this movie is so for the US that it does me wrong. The film still repeats, the US is God, and Russia is a devil. This is the kind of blurry campaign that was done against the Japanese in the Second World War. These are such films that everyone thinks the US is full of. <br /> <br /> This gets 4 out of 10, and I'm kind. It should really get it, but the dance scene was fun, but then it went far enough to make it really fun.
