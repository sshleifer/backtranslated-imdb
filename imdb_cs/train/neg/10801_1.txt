Now I'm one who's watching movies that have bad reviews and say, "Hmm ... that's not that bad!" I loved The Cable Guy, and I thought the Big Fat Independent was great. Keep in mind that I did not really start watching with hope, but I thought maybe ... maybe ... it would be so bad I could laugh at it. I was wrong. At no time during my suffering with this "film" (And I used this term gently) I was even close to having a little fun. To get started, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando in terms of acting. I hate rape music, but if I did, Amish's priest would probably be a better rapper than he did. The main character is simply unpleasant and is not a character that is easily liked. Quite frankly, I'd rather eat bloody thirst from the bloody ulcers of Harlequin's Fruits than to watch again.
