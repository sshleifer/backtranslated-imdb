I'm a huge Stooges fan, but the only and redeemed quality of this movie is that Curley is in it. Long before he began to drink heavily, it is his classic self (and even Larry is not bad). Moe's character is an equal part (mostly) and this film would be better named "Curley and Larry film". Not that none of the Stooges films were, in my opinion, very good, but as one commentator said, how sad it was that the film had real potential. Casting was good, it was well directed, shot and edited, but the story line tried to be something serious, with some Stooges antics and musical numbers (which I guess I think they are good). Doing yourself for yourself during this movie you should really believe that it must be better than lawn mowing and waste removal (which is the subject of debate) is to wait for Curley / Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest.
