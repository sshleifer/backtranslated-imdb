I watch a lot of bad movies, LOTS !!!!!! It's a bit of a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday, I gather a group of friends and gather and watch garbage from all over the world - ANOTHER. Turkish superheroes, vampires from Brazil, Italian films about gorilla transplantation, Kevin Costner films, ANYTHING (except possibly Raising Helen), but I have never seen WINTER before THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even funny in Ed Wood - it's just SUCKS. Now this film was famous in Hollywood at the time it was made because Whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the press and everyone else who would listen that she was RIGHT TO THIS PART CRAP = she was trying to get out of her contract she cried out, but she was running, but she stuck her thick butt into this leather fixed futuristic police uniform, which is terrible to see, jikes !!!! And you can see how pain is happening to her - she does everything, but she looks for the camera as her agent to scream at him. The dinosaur has about three facets, and the script is so terrible that a third-class class could do a better job of promising cookies.
