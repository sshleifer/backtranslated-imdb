The film had a good concept, but executions simply did not. What is this term? Well, the story-wise, that's "dirty Harry" meets "M". The breath killer began to terrorize the city. The leading detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never met a serial killer before. The mayor and the police chief desperately hired the local crowd to speed things up ... to go to places and do things the police would not be able to close this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> To be fair, this movie really offers some good things. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I liked the look of the killer's hiding place. Norman Bates has his cellar. The guy has a mysterious sewer. In some shots the light reflects on the water and creates corrugated reflections on the walls; I often give these scenes a haunting, dreamlike type. <br /> <br /> And that was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who get better with age. <br /> <br /> Once you get around it, however it's more or less going down. <br /> <br /> The movie is going too fast. The investigation process of the two teams themselves feels rather humiliated, unlike the feeling of complexity and fascination. This could be solved in two ways: either to extend the movie or to cut off some of the subplots. Neither of them would allow the crew to devote more time to the real secret. An example of how bad it is is one of the key stops that helps them reset the right suspect. this: at some point in his life, the suspect went to the animal shop ... That's right ... Here I am very serious. It's like going from point A (first guideline) to point Z (suspect) and skipping through all the "intermediate" steps. Then there are signs. The only one I really liked was the two pockets you met in the movie. Given that these are small characters, I would call it a bad sign. Finally, there is an angle of engagement. This is the one that gets me the most, because that's why I grabbed up to 3 dollars to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! During the last 10-15 years there has been an absolute writhing of serial killers. The mob angle was a trick that could help him rise above the others ... but not. I was thinking that the gangsters would be brutal but also entertaining and exciting; something like an alert movie or something like that ... maybe they'd throw some hemispheric film elements. We talked about the criminals. Instead, we get some of the most responsible protagonists who have committed themselves to celluloid. Detectives challenge witnesses. What does the crowd do? They are investigating and killing them. It's not so bad that these witnesses are even so bad. I really found the villain less sympathetic than the killer he was hunting. If the good points I have mentioned are not enough to get your interest, I would say you will miss this. They may sometimes use the same story again and they will do the right thing. I hope. I hate to see such a good concept go into waste.
