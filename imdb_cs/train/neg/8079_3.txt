Another movie with an interesting premise and some amazing special effects that go directly into the basket. <br /> <br /> The boring direction and performance (with the exception of beautiful Annabel Schofield, who is much more cute as a brunette and probably deserves better material and sometimes serious Charlton Heston) are getting a real smile. It's amazing to watch Heston go up to the usual state and show how bad he is. It's even played on a partial plan that interested me just to see how it goes back to the main line of the movie. The way they finally resolved was that they did not. It simply falls to the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste time on this.
