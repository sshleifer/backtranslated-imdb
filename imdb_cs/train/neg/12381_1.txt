This movie is really shameful. He plays urban paranoia of the 70s and 80s and puts it in the school context. I do not say that urban crimes were not a problem for many people, or that schools were not / are not problematic areas, but this shameful exploitation takes over a biscuit. Violence is over anything realistically possible, but in this case it is not a case of social problems, but white high school students use it to turn it into the criminal top of its local high school student. And of course she knows how to play the system. You know it well. Yes. This turd is a purely violent exploitation, a really ugly work. It is a disturbing brutality dressed as a social note. It belongs to the same category as garbage like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on, and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broken at the time he had to do such things.
