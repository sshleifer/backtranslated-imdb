I do not know what others are watching you on Steven Seagal, but I look at them because they are so stupid they always are good for laughter. Why would you rate this movie 1 in 10 based on dabing when such a thing is exactly what makes this movie a favorite cult that you can laugh at stupidity? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I felt that it's a lot of Steven Seagal vehicle like many of his other films; in fact, I did not think it was one of his worst long shots. It was mostly a hemispherical coherent conspiracy line, and it was mostly exciting. The end was really exhausted, but it had some nice elements. Eventually, the story itself did not deliver what he promised, but actually I thought that acting, characterization (if I use such a big word), and the rest of the production values, I deliver exactly what a real fan of Steven Seagal expects. Seagal himself was exactly the man with a stone face who was not the absurd man we expected, and the rest of the cast supported him quite well without ever waking him up. This, folks, is what Steven Seagal does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10.
