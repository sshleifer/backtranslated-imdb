What was an exciting and fairly original series from Fox has worsened on a meandering claw. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, not only due to Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fox's strength-to-be decided that they need to "fine-tune" the plot. During the 3 episodes of the season opener they completely lost me as a viewer (even when they saw Jessica Albu!). I found new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateur. The new phrases expanded continuity and the credibility of the show was too thin. In one episode of the second season, Max even slept and dreamed - where the first season said he could not sleep biologically. The story morale (the one Hollywood never gets): If it works, do not screw it up! <br/> <br/> and so on
