A cheesy, convincingly terrible (and not funny) C grade movie. Everything screaming "amateur", from scratchy scenarios (bizarre spaces, limited coherence and predictable endings, turgid lights, sound and hand slamming camera angles, equine and passive sexual inneundo and links, disordered and unbelievable dialgoue to Z but I saw it on DVD and he hoped Edward Wood would have jumped in. Everything is forgiven - your worst movies are works of art and more coherent than this. "Every night in my dreams I hear you" - are you convinced that the Titanic crew was not involved in this side?
