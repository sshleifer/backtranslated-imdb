My girlfriend once brought the Zombie chronicles to watch us as a joke. We realized a little bit of a joke on her that she would pay 1 pound for it. While watching this movie, I started to come up with things I'd rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These include: 1) Bleaching bleaching 2) Frying sand in your eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Renewal of the American Civil War 5) Tax return 6) GCSE Mathematics 7) Sex with old Ms. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote it? That guy could not even kick it properly. The best tingle he did was kick the door down (the best part of the movie). It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw the White Noise: Light. Never has the movie so many mistakes. My girlfriend left it here, so now I'm pity to own this crap. <br /> <br /> Messages: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill. Fact. <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE
