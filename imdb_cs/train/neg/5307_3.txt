What happened? "Doubt" had so much potential to be a great movie - but instead it was calmed down by dragging a simplifying plot, which made me stop watching. The only thing the movie was trying to do was Meryl Streep's great affair, who did not deserve the Oscar nomination at any price. Though it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and true character that blossomed across the screen. However, even the brilliance of the screen legend would save this movie before the congress. From a tedious start that had no strength or impact - to a less than convincing ending, the film was really disappointing - especially because it provided so much potential through the promotion and trailer. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot and eventually ended up with a boring film that had been going too long, with too many words and inadequate actions. Besides, the second Oscar nomination was not convincing. Though Philip Seymour Hoffman did a decent performance, it was by no means Oscar-worthy. (Especially since they completely left the show like Will Smith, at seven pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve this nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - because it was one-sided and simple. It would be much more meaningful to nominate her for Razzie because I'm sure she would be victorious. Viola Davis gave a short, but true performance, but the length of her performance made me wonder if the Academy should really nominate her. <br /> <br /> Overall, I find doubts as one of the most disappointed films in 2008. It was a mess of a movie with such great potential and I do not recommend it. The only shining light in the movie is Meryl Streep, which nevertheless represents a stunning, solid performance - not even enough to save this film. *** / 10.
