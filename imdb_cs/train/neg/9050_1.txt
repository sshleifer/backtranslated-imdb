I saw the whole movie in the 1960s and 1970s, it is terrible and could be the front of the series "The Face of Death" popular in the 80s and 90s. Due to the status of so-called "Driving education" these days, this should require a tour of everyone who is preparing for driving. When you see violent death in all your horror and horror, surely (if you have any sensitivity at all) you get a truer view of the responsibility that is necessary for safe driving, what a moment of hopelessness or inattention on the steering wheel can do. In the seventies and eighties, I worked for Bell Telephone, and at one point I was in charge of the security class. I found this movie in the corporate library, showed it at the meeting, many people were physically ill and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said, "I never knew a traffic accident could be so terrible!" This film and more, "RED ASPHALT", is certainly a reality in the most graphic form. I will never forget it, I just wish I could find a copy when my children attended "driver training" at high school!
