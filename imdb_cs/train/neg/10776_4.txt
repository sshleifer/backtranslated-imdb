When we and our wife and I chose to watch this movie, we thought it could not fail. I like Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julie Roberts, and everyone we talked to said they liked it. <br /> <br /> We were introduced into the spades. From my side, I felt Billy Crystal's figure was extremely one-dimensional and did little for the film. Sure, he cracked some good jokes, but as a character did nothing, he exhausted his seat. And poor Julia Roberts. In past shows she plays well as a very willing, self-appointed lady. In this view, it seems to be totally suppressed and has very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts my wife likes to watch. OK, if I found one good thing, it would have to be Christopher Walken. Now it's fun. But just like Billy Crystal, almost nothing is shown to his character. If you are looking for a night without sensual laughter with very little redeemable value, look at it. But if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, it's not your movie. This is none of the above.
