I think it would be a great movie for a true believer in an organized Christian dogma, but it is a terrible joke for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thought, separation of church and state, and good science fiction! br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors who either worked poorly or needed to share their personal convictions with the rest of the pagan. <br /> <br /> I was enjoying this movie in the same way that I enjoyed "Reefer Madness". The film attempted to teach drug education in a tactic of fear in the same way that this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our world. <br /> <br /> It laughed at me, and at the same time I was terrified that I realized how many people really believe our society should return to the good old days of the 19th century!
