For life, I can not figure out why someone would shoot such a movie. Thought is tired, the tune is tense, the language is always nasty, and occasionally the use of the word "F" seems to lack the dialogue to prevail, so "we throw another pair of" F "for good, that's what the American public wants to hear ". Gossett was particularly disgusted and seemed to enjoy his role. Forget about this c__p, rent "Shrek" and laugh good.
