I watched the whole movie, waiting and waiting for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault when I expect evil and terror instead of psychology? It is a weird repetition of the oidipal myth: I want to kill my father and mother, marry my uncle and build a musical theater with him? I did not understand why some of the land was even present: why was the building upstairs, why were the big stairs with the perfect place for someone to fall into their ruin if no one really did it, why they had scenes when you worked with your father, why such a nice kitchen, if you just want to eat what the boys want to be baptized, and parents are those who resist, instead of the opposite. I see a lot of good reviews for this movie ... did my taste have been damaged by going up with 70 b-movies and old scifi movies?
