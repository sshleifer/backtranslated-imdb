TV production at the beginning of 2000 was between the weak and the poor. In front of stories such as Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk, TV still did not have the right hit, which could capture the attention and interest of the audience in 2000. Titles such as Relic Hunter, Mutant X, , (Sheena) or even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging to follow and follow you, or at least not the fascinating and interesting time that preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, men in black encounter the spoof of X file files! (It's like a special unit 1). But even by this great formula; it did not work well. It was promising; at a time when, for decades, a number of X files had already been saturating from "supernatural" cases, so the natural spirit broke it too angry (imagine Mulder is a woman!). However, Special Unit 2 was not the strongest or strongest in the comic Sci-Fi show. It was totally ridiculous when every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgust. It tasted bad. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and mostly intolerable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was everyday. Of course the show has a funny look, but overall it was a dysfunction. It is clear that there is nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among other works (Evan Katz) as co-author and co-producer (Seven days) before or (24) later it must be a low place! In spite of the prominent personality, most of the time he managed to be a stupid joke. Therefore, if it was there a goal, so one of the strongest really! And it would really be one of the rarest times to be grateful for canceling the show after 19 episodes only!
