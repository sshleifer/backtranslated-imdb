This movie has a beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, he has no plot. In order to have a conspiracy, there must be a conflict. This movie had none. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and never did any activities. The image is trying to be artistic, but it can not pay attention to the basics of telling the story. If you love sceneries in Montana and fly fishing, you will find some value in this movie, just do not expect the story. There is none.
