I usually like such movies. It's a documentary style, but acting and writing are terrible. The game is wooden and stiff and the font is just a clich√©, but not at all. How to write this, I am surprised that this is 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I'm sure most of these voices must come from relatives in the movie. I guess if that's the case, you can laugh a few, because it's always funny to see your relatives / friends shoot a movie. Well, surely, it gives hope to all and the upcoming writers, the director, the actors, etc. Because if they can do it, you can do it. Though you might not.
