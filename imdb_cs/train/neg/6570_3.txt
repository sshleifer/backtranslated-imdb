I have never found Charley Chase very entertaining, though his character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Clees, whom I find very funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of Gow Hen Broon from the "Sunday Post" comic book in Scotland.) In the best movies, Chase tends to admire his professionalism rather than laugh. I'll give Chase his best movies - such as "Powerful as a Moose" and "His Wood Wedding" - inspired by fans who are indifferent to him ... but I feel that even the most ruined fan of Chase will agree, that very early and very brutal "married to order" is simply not funny at all. Chase - eager, uncomfortable, carefree, naff - is a young wisdom to hope the court at the Rose Fair. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as her fine dad, who despises Chase as a "mollycoddle". Leo White, who has made a remarkable job as Chaplin in Essanay, is here as a rival. <br /> <br /> There is an action involving Ingersoll watches. I was impressed by the fact that the brand name is listed in the dialog names: is this the first example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main mistake in 'married to order' is Rosemary Theby's distinction as Rose: it should be a standard problem, but Theby - with a flat chest, with a hawk - is physically ill for this role. Theby (wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but she was never a credible inventor. Film historian William K Everson has been very convincing with her in one of his film books. <br /> <br /> Rate 'Married to order' only 3 out of 10 and I'm charitable ... because I still suspect that Charley Chase has something everyone else gets but I miss it.
