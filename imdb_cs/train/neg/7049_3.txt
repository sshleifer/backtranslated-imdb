The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without waves. Viewers who love surfing on this movie will be a huge disappointment because the total number of surf minutes will try to reach three times. The story is a slice of life about raised surfers who are waiting for it, the perfect wave, but for every wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surf who flirts with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as she's going to find adult bliss with the woman she loves, the three older surfing friends get up and convince him to hit the beach and look for the Bone Yard monsters. The problem is that there are no waves until the very end of the movie, so most of the story is scattered over the meandering sequence of disconnected events on the beach. It usually plays average. Sean Pertwee has several comic moments, but mostly his acting was secular. Ewan McGregor was decent as a drug that dealt with a wild man, by far the most intriguing and peculiar character. Probably the most entertaining performance was Peter Gunn as Terry, who turned his body body into a constant look. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character did not really have enough meat to show a lot of acting skills. <br /> <br /> There is not much to comment on. I rated it 3/10. It's a real beach bummer.
