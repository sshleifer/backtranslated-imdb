Damn it. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. All the performances are fine, but there is no conspiracy. Really! No plot! A lot of clowns talk about it and it and that's your movie. Ug ... Robert Duvalla's character is senile and still asks the same people all over again. This brings him the same answers over and over again. I'm sure this movie got to six, because people think he likes it. A good performance with well-known and well-known actors, but the real complete work is a brown turd. Well, maybe it's a little misleading because the steam rising from the fresh pile sounds a bit like something that's happening and in this film NEVER IS! Bag
