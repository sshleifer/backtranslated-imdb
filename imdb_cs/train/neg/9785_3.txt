This movie, for a special school, is not that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're still in the classroom. Guy teaches a couple of young fans how to become good players on the ball. We never see that these NCOs are doing badly as a good player is trained. Everybody suddenly turns into a good player meditating. There are too many characters and no character development. You spend too much time on the main character and his sexy sister and are not enough for some of the other kids. It could have been a "Bad News Bears" (the original) because there was a girl on the team of all the boys, but there was no feeling in this movie. He has no feeling and looks at him with fat pain in his bones, it's not a fun bag, it's not fun to watch and it's just ... there. Simple. Boring. Something you would follow after school before your eve of sleep. As boring as the day is long and it's a long, long day watching this movie.
