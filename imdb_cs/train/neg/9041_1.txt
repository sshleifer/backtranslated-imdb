I liked the movie, although it's a fair pace. But I did not comment on the fact that Canada was referred to as Montana North. This is definitely not Montana north and will never be. Americans ask why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one of the reasons. Stop teaching children from the United States to think they own a planet. Such a centrist view of the world does not become one of the world's greatest nations. Even in jest. I would never think of the US as "Alberta South". Walt would never let us down, so why start. Other than that movie was quite hideous, and then better luck.
