The year 1934, when Shirley Temple played three major films and really began to make a name for himself. Unfortunately, the study rooms had to experiment to see what they liked most. Two of these things sang and danced. Another was a short and interesting film that kept the attention of the people and led their thoughts out of the crisis. You know the other keys for successful Shirley movies. This film did not achieve any of the above, despite the starry effects of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard, and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. Besides, there are too many talcs that become simply boring and too many arguments between the lame Lombar and Cooper. To do this, you did not have a normal feeling - a good end, which is what the public wants. I think they learned after this movie.
