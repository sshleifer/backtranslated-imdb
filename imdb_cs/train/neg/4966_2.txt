I understand that this film was made at a very low budget, but that is not the justification for the absurdity that Grendel is. Deathstalker, The Fiery Throne, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, The Invincible Barbar, have made themselves on budgets and poor special effects, yet they have managed to create classical cultures by adding some frightened fighters and a good sense of humor. Early costumes, dark castles, and beautiful Bulgarian landscapes allowed Grendel to be a very good low budget sword and wizard film, but the creators had completely destroyed this opportunity with extremely bad CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this movie to Beowulf (1999). It does not have to be Citizen Kane, but it's a good example of how the entertaining low-budget sci-fi / adventure film can be made using trusted special effects and attractive characters.
