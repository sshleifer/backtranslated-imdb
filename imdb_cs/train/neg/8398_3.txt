70-year-old Horror films Schlock ... you have to love them. Unlike today's tedious slasher movements, these K-tel specials do something terrifying and do not bother about the tired pattern. This is a B film about creating B movie ... it was terribly wrong. Faith Domergue (this island country) plays as film queen B through film, about a series of cruel murders that struggle with family in their home. Her friend / director, who looks and behaves like Gordon Jump with his attitude, shoots on the spot and on a tight schedule. Ken's doll Ken discovers a book of Tibetan singing that works in the script and adds "realism." Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could do without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, who has long since left The Search for the 17th Gland (The Unearthly), now exhausts his humble existence as a property manager. It comes from his everyday work, but it seems that it always happens painlessly. <br /> <br /> Horror is slow; here a dead cat, John Carradine goes into the grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (At least it's true in the ad.) It's only sad that the ghoul did not understand that the film was composed of him. How poor Faith knew that the tiny Tibetan singing really worked? Facing it, you just can not go around to pull on Satan's coat and expect him to lie down. Sterno says he's doing an autopsy in the House of Seven Bodies.
