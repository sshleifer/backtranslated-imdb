I remembered it during my first debut and gave him the message "thumbs up in the middle" and remarked that I would give him the benefit of doubt even during the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now at this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong fanatical Batman, I can not hesitate to say: this show is a total crap. <br /> <br /> Everything is fine with it. All. Walking through the mischievous animation and design, stories are ridiculously complicated and without any development of the character or obvious interest of the writers of this strike to give any substance to any story. And for God .... Is it just me, or is Joker in every EPISODE? Is Gotham so much justice system with a revolving door? Or, it is a complete lack of interest in the writer to make every effort for other villains (see "No Personality Development" above). And to make it worse, every Joker story is the same three-dimensional formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gasifies with people. <br /> <br /> 2) The Joker runs on the gas of the city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode I saw that was not the story of Joker. The title escaped me, but the villain was the shameful Cluemaster ... episode "Think Thank Thunk" with the quiz show. It was the only worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard, or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I feel like this show is because it's probably against ToS but starts with the letter "B" and rhymes with "fasting". Thanks God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. Bat-Era era, back from Fox days and Kids WB. Things that are good and I should know, they just could not last forever, unfortunately.
