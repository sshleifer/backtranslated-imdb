This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It can be the worst movie. Some movies are so bad that they are good; this film is so bad that it is a pleasant camp and just becomes undignifiedly terrible. It's anti-enantiodromy. We bought it with the intention of slipping and all my family gathered around for a fun evening of smart notes; instead we sat in stunned silence and flown poor Peter Sellers. That's worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the sequel to the Matrix. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances let this film get closer to ten feet away from your TV.
