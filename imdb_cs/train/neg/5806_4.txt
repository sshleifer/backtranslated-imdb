Nowhere near the original. It's a pretty accurate copy that is nothing new to the story. But the direction is very bad. Basinger is weak - without good direction. Baldwin is simply a second league compared to McQueen. I just watched curiously, it was a huge fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost the film B with the second one and the director. I was not disappointed, I just do not know what she was trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it is not a tribute and really misses a really good actor of his time. It reminds me of this bad xerok copy of a beautiful photo. br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time. Save 2 hours or play the original (again :)))
