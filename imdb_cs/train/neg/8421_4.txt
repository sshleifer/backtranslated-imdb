I'm sorry to have to rethink this movie, but here I am. I'm re-evaluating it because I just had a chance to witness the revival of R.C. Sheriff's "Journey's End" on stage in New York at the Belasco Theater, where Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as David Grindley, are playing. the theater crumbled. I'm not exaggerating, I was amazed. After almost two and a half hours of reborn and very claustrophobic depictions of soldier life in the trenches of Somme (speculate), during World War I live alive, all involved, I left the theater with shakes. <br /> <br /> Do not forget it, I have no chance, or too sensitive. I'm a theatrical actor and director myself, so I know the buttons are pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. But what I just saw has come so much to my life that I was cold in my spine when I left. None of these emotions appeared, and she watched "Aces High," a movie based on this game and even adapted for the screen, in collaboration with RC Sheriff himself shortly before he died. Screen editing takes place in the sky over France. So, the claustrophobic atmosphere is gone. The only addition to the film is the aerial combat scene, which looks like its special effect compared to today's standards, but still very valid flying tactics received on the screen. Several screen modifications have been made to Erich Maria Remarque's "All Peace on the Western Front" screen, which takes place in the trench and not in the sky, but it was a "German" vision of things if we wanted to be choosy about such things. "Journey's End" is just the second side of the medal, and it would make a great movie if it left alone and intact. DVD conversion is poor even though it is in a wide format and adapted to 16: 9 TV screens, the movie quality is a cinema itself. Nothing more. It's sporting mistakes such as tiny scratches and dots, though the copy, for the rest, is clean. If you want another world war movie in your collection, especially for those who love and love seeing aerial battles among the old, then it's a picture for you. But I would prefer to suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, though it is also a film full of inaccuracies. For the rest of you who love good acting and drama, I would leave this out. Buy game. Take a look at the game if you have the opportunity to get a decent recovery near you, but keep away with this desire of adaptation. It's an anti-war movie, awarded, but the weakest I've ever seen in my life. The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just bluff because they are simply seen in very weak and very short film roles throughout the film. McDowell, the very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, have very poor performance, not because of lack of skills, but rather because of a lack of real and stiff direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in it, and as has been said, it is stretching for a dubious end. It is dubious, because in the original game, none of the men we met and sympathized with would remain alive. Everyone is killed in a deadly and futile mission. In the movie, everyone will die, except Malcolm McDowell, who somehow manages to stay alive the next day, be the commander of the wand of an unfortunate bunch, just to get three more pilots to fly and die for another lost thing. <br /> <br /> The end of the game leaves the bare stage in complete darkness. You are hearing gunshot guns, machine guns and grenade influences throughout the theater. Suddenly, there was complete peace and silence. A curtain appears. Lights. And here they are all. Closed, built straight and firm. Obedient Corpses ... <br /> <br /> Far more interesting and much more shocking than the final "Aces High", which is also drawn by the hair. <br /> <br /> It is up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had money and contacts to do so, I would take the game and develop it as it should be. Adding here and there some action scenes in the field just to visualize the "external" horror and defeat that is going on in the "giant fields in France," around the men involved, but then just concentrating on what is happening. that little "shack" on the edge of reason and the world ... <br /> <br /> Want such a movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask him. <br /> <br /> It is not.
