I'll get to the movie a minute. First, someone wanted "proof" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he claimed that the US "deserved" attacks in 9-11. Well, here's what Clinton said: "In the first crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first fired a synagogue with 300 Jews and killed every woman and child who were Muslims in the Temple Mount. I can tell you the story is still still reported in the Middle East and we are still paying for it. "<br /> <br /> Are we still paying for it? Whaddya means "we", thumb? Sailors did not hit the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in fact, Clinton never really went out and said that we "deserved" 9-11. Like all his statements during his presidency, IMPLIED that we deserved 9-11. Just point to the "fact" of A, B, C, and perhaps D, and let the audience deduce that they must add to the X conclusion. When in fact most of Clinton's "Facts" added to guacamole. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> But this is next. We're here to talk about movies, not about politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can not escape his deformed politics. It was only a matter of time before he concentrated on the paranoia and the bitterness of Reagan's time, and what better time than when Stone's dreams nearly came true on the day when Reagan nearly bought the farm. In Hinckley's attempted assassination, he did not find any shameful plans or schemes, he develops one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority, Haig transforms from a public servant who really has to change his curative civic career into an exhaustive megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to shake hands together like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to "release the chase." Kamen even recruits an emerald man in Hollywood, where our former Foreign Secretary Richard Dreyfuss plays. The boy you love to hate. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is fine. The average, which is below the average. Do not be bothered by renting or buying. Try to catch it on the cable. 4 of 10.
