I'm the kind of guy who always looks at the horror section of the movie, so I chose five over my eyes, I was disgusted with this movie, and I thought there was no story line and no point you could use it, that caused me to think of my skin to think that people like to watch films that only encouraged violence to hell, that it was a low budget and extremely rubbish! I think I could do better myself. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and you should not bother if they were watching the actors were the trash the camera was terrible that the picture was bad and the sound was not scratching I think it was a bit a bit like the excitement of the ripping off of the press, which the project did not work at all, it was dirty.
