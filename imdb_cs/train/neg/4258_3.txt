This would be 5 rather than 3 if it was at least in time ... When I saw it for the first time, it was exactly what you could expect from a job that is not based on the artistic capabilities of the directors but on the idealist or I would rather say the idiotic habits of our (Kazakh) government ... It's a shame because "Qazaqfil'm" shot nice movies when it was not honored by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually running with him. Movies like "The End of Ataman", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". But after the death of Mr. Aimanova, the production of quality films almost drastically declined in ten years, when only a few films were produced. At the end of the 1980s, however, the "Assa" was shot, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in a large country, a year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov made another film with a common view of the same actor / vocalist V.Tsoy, at that time Soviet / Russian rock legend - a movie called Igla or something, was completely new, someone called this period as a resurrection or a new Kazakh film wave. Unfortunately, today we do not have quality films, our directors shoot movies on French and Japanese financial support, and therefore the films are not for the public, but for the authors, professional critics, some of them take the prize at international film festivals, but there are very few of them business property ... And back to our "Travelers". Such films are usually unpopular due to great aspects. The same effects were with "Sibirski Cyrilnik" Nikita Mikhalkovy about Russian tsars, who were also filmed on parity with foreign partners, I think they are French or maybe British. Nobdy liked it, and the Russian public became the main subject of comedians and comedic performances like KVN. IMHO
