I wonder if there is any sense in this movie. It's a big joke. Good .. It's fun .. You can see the stupidest plot played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder which groups of viewers this film is basically focused on. Prizes (and professionals) play a replacement mother for a happy couple Salman / Rani who wants a baby but can not. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real life away from a real couple's life. Rani looks happy with another beautiful lady in her house that was brought to make a baby for her and Salman. She takes care of Priety and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity to have some romance. When will the audience become accustomed to Salma's nails? <br /> <br /> Although it's a good past, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
