It's a movie in which actors are all right, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie where each of the three couples meets in a situation where they feel compelled to be either cute or to make a story in motion. In other words, it seems that film scenes are created, not real life. Even when women working in peep salons sometimes come out with one of their customers, it does not seem to be as realistic as it is written in this movie. Also, when one of the characters encounters overweight in the movie, it's artificial to look at each other after the argument. Once again, the actors are all good and the moments of this movie are pretty, but in general yet another indie that could use some transcripts before the production came into play.
