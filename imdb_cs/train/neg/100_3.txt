OK, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I was able to sit and watch it TWO! the story of the line was pretty awful, and during the first part of the first story I realized what the hell I was watching, but it was so terrible that I loved cheap laughs all the way. <br /> <br /> Jebidie deserves an Oscar for her role in this film, the only thing that left him in the middle, stopped his stupid name that he called. Overall, the film was perfect, but if it laughs cheaply and you see it in pounds of land.
