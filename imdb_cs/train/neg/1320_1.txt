This movie was exactly what I expected it would be at first reading. Probably I could write an even more exciting plot, it's a shame they left him for a pack of drunkards Howler. Alberto Tomba was certainly a good skier, but he has to thank God (and also us) for not having to rely on his acting skills to get his life. He can not play, I can not speak, he can not move on the continent even without skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde and that's all. Apparently she was not chosen due to her overwhelming ability in dramatic roles, but probably for her beautiful legs. Still, I must admit she could be Tomb's acting teacher because she's even worse actor than she is, and that's funny, especially since it's not Italian. I still laughed and watched this movie. I found it so sensual and senseless that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.
