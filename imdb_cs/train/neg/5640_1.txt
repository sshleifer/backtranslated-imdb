I'm a huge fan of Willem Dafoe and I really was looking for this movie (I had to Region 5 to read her DVD!). But it's really one of the worst I've ever seen. The game (except Dafoe) is terrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH have written and directed this (though he is not credited as a director) and have no recognizable talents for writing or directing. (Shut up Willem, Giada break out of business, PLEASE!) Absolutely nothing will happen. In addition to a series of completely unconvincing, completely credible motivations, the actions of these two people (who have just met) in this house. Colagrande is sleepy, I could not be less interested in virtually NEVER changing. And sex scenes are totally flawed. Actually, I stopped him twice. Fuj! They are certainly not a bit erotic, and yet it's the only time the movie can not sleep. Then it's a busy refusal. <br /> <br /> Just terrible.
