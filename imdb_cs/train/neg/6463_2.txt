Last night I watched Free Money and it was the longest 90+ minutes of life. With such an interesting occupation, I really thought I was a favor - especially since I was a Brando fan. POORLY! What a loss of talent. It's almost embarrassing to watch sometimes (like adventure) and so many missed opportunities for humorous settings (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character to come back to Brando?) Ugh. She's trying to be a little comedy, but I just did not buy it. Skip this. Only for Hard Brando fans. I give it 2 out of 10 because I still think the worse movie ever was Skidoo.
