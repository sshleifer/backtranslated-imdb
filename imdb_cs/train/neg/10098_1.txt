They do not want to rent a camcorder, not for a time or occasional effort. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that the child can do. * Efficiency was over ... bad direction. * The editing was very upset ... many things did not make sense, or seemed to be impeccable. * The sound was badly nicknamed. * Music was very inappropriate. Casting was extremely gone ... he had to be in a crack. * Zombie, which speaks nothing ... drive, dance, work ... just upset me. * And the wrong one ... Holy crap! Like a hell of a hell ... he was the best-looking zombie of all. Which does not say much. <br /> <br /> Cover art was good but very cheating ... as well as the main DVD ... great artwork and music. <br /> <br /> DONT TATO!
