Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, Dike Mike Mitchell. When his girlfriend resolves, the fearsome yuppie does not want to stay alone at Christmas, so he decides to return to his childhood home and save the dysfunctional family he lives in, and the bribes are to be his family. An unpleasant and one-dimensional performance Affleck, who works mainly with a smile, causes his character to fall as a mentally unbalanced dot, but Gandolfini and O'Hara breathe some life into this mess. Even for the farce, his stupidity is savage, it does not make sense from scene to scene, and his sentimental message is as fake as Affleck's smile. 91 min., Rated PG-13. * Â½
