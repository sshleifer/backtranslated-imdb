I am surprised by many female voters who even give this film better marks. My opinion on this movie was that the target audience is adult and male. Handy and tortured women, merciless revenge and a high number of bodies are typical ingredients that introduce spaghetti subgenre into the history of the film. Opening and manual smashing are obstacles to DJANGO. However, SHOOTER lacks the style of DJANGO. Score, acting and cinema are at best average, but if you're looking for the ingredients above, you're in the right place. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
