Like what other Dracula films do, Dracula always dracula on Dracula's side, which eventually disappointed me. Regardless of whether you want to remain a vampire or not, I would like to see something like the first film that the minion is fighting against his master. It's very interesting (because you can almost predict how the story is going) than just a priest or D. win the game (we need some surprising drawings!).
