This movie is deeply stupid. A man wants to avenge a crime - but when his revenge shows up - there's a video camera all the time. What brain-headed man would sit there and do it so long before the video camera? Just the fact that this script would never have happened, unless someone could not dress himself destroyed it for me - but it became a fool! I think scriptwriters have some serious habits that cook their brain cells and make them miss the plunder of holes that you can drive a battalion of armored tanks over. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A man tries to avenge the death of his beloved, but in the middle of the fence something is totally wrong and then unexpectedly unfolds. <br /> <br /> Only those people who write this story are not so stupid to write absolutely unrealistic plot that would never happen like this. To the writers I am saying - seek help for your serious mental problem.
