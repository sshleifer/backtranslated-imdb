I was looking at this show and I just could not find it at all. It could have been the first episode. Recently, I realize that ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and it's like a station. All the characters at this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and scripts are pretty terrible and they will do that. I think I think that this show will be canceled, but because ABC poses a great threat to the quality of the concerts they play, they can simply keep it simply because it is average compared to them.
