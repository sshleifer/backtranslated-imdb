Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ @ ERS !!! How could you do that to me? I can not believe it ... this film is actually worse than the first one. I went to see a theater viewer with my brother, because my mother made me call myself ... Oh, God ... where should I start? Story SUCKED. Voice actor SUCKED. Animation SUCKED. The end really hit. If you liked this movie, you have heard it. And Futuramafan1987, who said it was the biggest movie ever, you are TOOL, PLAIN and EASY. It's not a movie for someone, just ten-year-olds who join Game Boy who think Pikachu is God. I'm still crying until I think about the terrible turmoil of the movie ... and then there was Pikachu adventure ... nor do you start me with the terrible mess of the movie. It is indeed one of the most difficult experiences of my whole life. Do not use it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Go, find each copy of this movie and drink it. Blow them all up and then continue to rent a good movie like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even back to the future!
