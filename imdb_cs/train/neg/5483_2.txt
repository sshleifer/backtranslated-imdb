I just fired four dollars for renting this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis promotes such a bad excuse for the film is outside of me. Even more surprising, however, were the relatively good reviews that gave this film to several Canadian journalists. I'm tired of our media justifying movie simply because it's a Canadian and a low budget. It's like waiting for Canadian movies to be miserable, so they can do good reviews of it anyway. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: The actor was below average (with the exception of the male character who was actually quite good). The quality of the film was poor, which can be expected from an extremely low budget. The script was absolutely scary. An example is a story that revolves around one of the main characters - a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients to take her to repair and steal bicycles for her gang whose sole purpose is accidentally destroying SUVs. It is likely that many of its members' bikes are destroyed in these activities (I do not know how to buy new ones because this is a big drug trafficking from Vancouver to Toronto). /> <br /> Anyway, the point of the story (which is not revealed until the middle of the movie) is that the drug dealer plans to burn buildings in the Toronto area to try to make homes available - because one will want to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - I need to say more. <br /> <br /> Damage at the Toronto Film Festival for receiving such a film, Telefilm for its support and Globe and Post and the Georgia Straight newspaper for such biased reviews. The film should not get special treatment just because it's Canadian !!!!
