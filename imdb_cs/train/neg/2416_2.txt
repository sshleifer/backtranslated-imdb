2 stars and I am generous. (smaller spoilers) Look, this is a low budget zombie movie in the Oakland gangland. As the plot goes, the scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after he was killed in the drive-by. The main problem with this movie: what zombies? All the "zombies" make it sound (which does not sound distantly terrible), and they have falsified red blood from their mouth! No scary eyes, no disintegrating body, just a lot of people shaking sharply and running like idiots. The packaging is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the movie, so it's not like the whole "hood" is destroyed by zombies or anything else, it's very little and is contained in no time. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that it's funny. Nobody can act in this movie (with the exception of one of the gang members), and it really seems that many friends have gathered, decided to put their family and shoot one weekend. <br /> <br /> Final Note: Since Doctors Wear Tramps? Skip this, please!
