As you can or can not hear, there are no real fighting between vampires and zombies in this movie. One can then ask why the name suggests such a thing, but it really is appropriate because nothing else about this movie makes any sense. There was no story or plot at all, it just happens. The game was incredibly bad, worse than safeauto advertising bad. <br /> <br /> Not only there were no fighting between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies in it. Their makeup looked like it was applied by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was totally random and was in place, and it was one of the characters that fought the zombies with a hedge trimmer (I do not speak) but used the sound effects for chain saws. This was undoubtedly the poorest film I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not completely get rid of every person responsible for producing this film is when I learned that it was made exclusively by the eleven-year-old. <br /> <br /> Really, although I have all the critics to offer here, I recommend watching this film only on the basis that it can be the worst film ever and that's pretty funny about it. Even counting the shortcomings in it should make you entertained.
