This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if writers from a five-member party got it and made it t.v. film. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good talk, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the worst scriptures I've seen since the Wild Wild West. Surely it should be interesting. I know that vh 1 happened on behalf of their household for the music shows. which are much better than all that would work if it was a musical episode, but it did not and did not feel on the face.
