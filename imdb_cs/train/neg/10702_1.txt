Dialog: twisted, cliché; Cast: hammocks, clichés; Plot: predictable, cliché. <br /> <br /> What does Christopher Plummer do Nastassia Kinski in this "B" rubbish? Plummer was well established for decades before the film was shot, Kinski had masterpieces such as "Tess" and "Cat People" ... He must be desperate. Thieves all have bad guys - * bad * bad guys! (Plummer in particular! Where did he learn to learn German?) And most of them also have bad guys. Innocent surrounding audiences overcome panic to laugh at you. Good boy survives among other things: * 5 "hook knife buried with his hands in a deep shoulder - only pulls him out and seconds later using his shoulder without problems at all, * marines' machine gun fire (I think someone referred to .50) in the leg he will solve by combining the bandage around the legs of his trousers and then barely limp, * several fist-fighting, in which he held more punches on his face, as well as running the skull-in front of the door frame, * falling out of what looks like in the third floor, on the pavement without a twisted ankle or any other such little inconvenience. The script has exactly 3 clever lines, the rest when it's so dull and boring. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not all bad.Plummer brings a certain class in his role and is undoubtedly the best actor in this movie, but he can do a frantic villain without resorting to the ham technique that most criminals use in his song "Ve haff vays a mea but you always realize that you've been watching Christopher Plummer acting a villain. This movie is really a terrible waste of time. The actor, as he is, is like 707 movie movies from 007 that deliver wooden lines, encounters Bruce Lee's seemingly fake scenes, but he is not as close as Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee. Do not bother.
