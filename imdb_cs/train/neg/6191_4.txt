I watched this film along with other adaptations I can get in hand - including viewing games - in preparation for some academic research. Cinematography is very moving, just like music. Unfortunately, life has been removed from the story. I've never seen such a terrible picture of Mr. Rochester. All its most basic properties are gone. Where's his joke? Where is his passion? Scott Rochester is more akin to Rochester's film, St. John, rather than the character from the novel. In fact, the actor who played St. John in this adaptation played passionate Saint John, while Scott is happy with crushing things or just looking at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what he is thinking. I would like to give this film a slightly higher voice based on wonderful music and cinema, but I honestly can not know this movie too long due to George C. Scott's performance.
