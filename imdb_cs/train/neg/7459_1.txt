save money and see something else. this movie was such a crap. I did not want to go, but I had to think I'd laugh at least once, NOPE. no laughter, it was terrible! chris kattan will never get a good comedy after this and a "night in roxbury". this film is quite obvious, has no clever humor and repeats itself over and over again. listen to me and go crazy as far from this movie as you can!
