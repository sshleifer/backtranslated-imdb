This movie is much like a movie Hostel, except with * BAD * acting and not very stressful. Gore elements are there, but for those characters you do not feel anything, so violence is not very effective. Some parts are just weird ... like a snake on the neck. What's wrong with that? Should it be scary or cruel? It's just stupid. As far as torture is concerned, there is none at all (except how one begins to blow at the beginning, which they do not even know). The main thief is still saying, "Help them die slowly," but the butcher quickly kills them. Death is relatively fast. Yes, I watched the version "Unrated". So overall, I'm not the worst movie I've ever seen, but nothing at all. Do not miss anything if you miss this one.
