The name "cult film" is often devoted to films that continue to show up or sell in a home-cinema format more than a generation after being released for the first time. Superchick, which was first released in 1973, is now coming into this category. Her cultural status is largely due to the interest of women who consider her an early and effective feminist film. Despite the connotation of "Superwoman," "Superchick" is not a cartoon but a very competent young lady who works as an aviation stewardess - a career choice that in the 1970s was commonly regarded as one of the most enchanting girls and which also allows her to imitate a traditional matelot who allegedly has a wife in each port. Because she has a black belt in karate, she is able to say clearly that she is very satisfied with her bachelor's existence and is by no means true to any of her large male admirers. This film is a sitcom that avoids a much shorter life attraction of a farce in general. His appeal to feminists is also reinforced by the climax in which our heroine uses its karate skills to avert abduction and rescue all other passengers on its aircraft from potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film appeals to both men and their partners, the director wisely ensured that he is liberally sprinkled with eye candies. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too criticized and want a very light, easy-to-follow comedy that they soon forget after watching. They are so forgetful that they will probably find it as enjoyable if they are followed again in one year; despite his age, he may retain his cult movie status for a while. However, dialogue and negotiation would make it more difficult to award this film than 4/10.
