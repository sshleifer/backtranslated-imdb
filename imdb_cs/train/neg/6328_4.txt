Why is this film falling below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humorous scene. The thin / average Travolta (looks more like a dapper in black, I must say, with a huge parmesan) and Gross both act very well as two young-ish 'slick-dressed' but still spoiled New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. Besides, the rest of the film is just boring. It's so boring that it's really not good to know what's going to culminate in the movie at any level. Kelly Preston apparently radiates sexual attraction and sexually charged dance with her friend Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch KGB fight honcho "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the movie would be better if the plot changed slightly so that the setting did not change from NY to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you understand if you see the movie ... It seems that this film was shot in 1986 ready for release in 1987. I think Paramount stopped for the release of the film until January 1989 due to an incredible conspiracy. They were reported to be "irrelevant". However, this $ 6,000,000 movie earned a bit more than embarrassing revenue of $ 163,000, since only BRIEFLY was released in places like Texas and Colorado before he went directly to the video. This is evidence of the overall BAD quality of this film.
