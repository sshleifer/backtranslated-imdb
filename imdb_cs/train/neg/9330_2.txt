He had seen this movie recently and had more hope. Not so much based on a director who had not previously made a cinematographic release but rather on the basis of his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn, and Craig Wasson (starring in the pair of Points, masterpiece by Brian De Palma) all took part in great movies. Not together, but this fact has not changed due to this fact. The film is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that could be a bit attractive is the selection of places on which it was filmed. In my humble opinion, do not waste your time on this.
