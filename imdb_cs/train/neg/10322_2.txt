If you are looking to be either offended or amused, or both, you will probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really does not even think of provoking overlapping usual stupid clich√©s. At the end of the second episode I felt somewhat embarrassed that I was actually sitting through a fancy mess. Apart from the thinness of the covert gimmick assumption that attracted all the initial attention, it is first and foremost another lame, harmless and antiseptic commentary and entertainment attempt that CBC usually stands out for in production. And once "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!" hype is exhausting its welcome, the show is likely to follow the ether of abolition, because it is so superficial when judged on its merits alone. <br /> <br /> If you are obsessed with Muslim culture in the West and / or are easily amused by the most powerful idiosyncratic on this subject. I really do not see how LMOTP is more pleasant than satisfying the curiosity that results from hype. Other shows better tackled the question of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in western multiethnic societies. LMOTP never takes part in entertainment or insight.
