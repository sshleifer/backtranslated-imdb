I remember tracking the BSG pilot. I can describe this night exactly. I remember on which chair I sat. The demonstration was magical. She was alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed part of the third year a little, watching each episode of the fourth year, quite faithfully in the hope that it would turn around. Well, no. <br /> <br /> I watched Capric and was enchanted. There was hope for something good. Then I started to watch regular episodes and they are getting more and more bored. It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the far-reaching political correctness of his last failed Virtuality show. Most of his work on DS9 was good. When he organized the BSG, it was good. This is especially true when they were more or less watching a sample of episodes set up by the first BSG series. When they met with Admiral Cain and Pegas, everything went into the pot. It was like writing the rest of the show without knowing where he was going. It may improve. Maybe it was just a few weak episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
