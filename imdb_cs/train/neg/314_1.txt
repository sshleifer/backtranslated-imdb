I caught this movie for $ 5 in a discount card shop, Adam Sandler is a wonderful actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it was not. There was no story line, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "F-Word" every other word he said, the curse usually does not bother me, but it was over the top. And even worse than the lack of a story line were those parts when Sandler began talking to the camera in random places in the movie, reminded me of Dora Explorer when they turned and looked at the screen and asked you. And after all, if they accidentally put Bikini shots of a girl at random time in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, its waste of money
