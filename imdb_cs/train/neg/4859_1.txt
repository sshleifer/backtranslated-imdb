You have to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, shifting and enthusiasm in film making: between 1985 and 2000, he shot 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is something you could go to, it's probably all crap (and it seems that a quick review of their IMDb rating verifies my idea). Part 3 sees a group of unpleasant students finding retention a little more than usual when they were attacked by hordes of living dead who escaped from the most secret military base directly under their school. The work of Brian Eklund (who relies on liberal use of f-bombs) by director Sheets brings yet another embarrassing amateur effort that features inconceivably horrible performances of his hopeless cast, terrible visual effects (some CGI crap and what looks like the front of the huge cardboard space shuttle) and his trademark dwarf gore (a handful of scrubs pulled out of his victim's clothes). In the end, after what looks like an eternity watching the irritating characters running for their lives and unconvincing undead people who are cuddled with animal guts, Zombie Armageddon ends with the end of the time / paradox that invites viewers to watch several torturing minutes from the beginning of the movie. Honestly ... once did it, Mr. Lists, what did we do to deserve that we would have to watch again?
