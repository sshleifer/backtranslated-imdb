Unimaginably stupid, superfluous, and humiliating closure of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that director Rachel Talalay deliberately wanted to change Wes Craven's initial presumption for one big, bad and impeccable joke. This is not just the worst entry into the "Elm Street" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror films ever made, and it completely offends fans of the genre! The story is stupid, the character of the drawing is ridiculous, the structure is all dark and ??? most ?? special and visual effects resemble Tom & Jerry cartoon. Sequences in which Freddy Krueger kills his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Should we be frightened when Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into the video game and pushed him around the walls of the house? The story brings us back to Springwood, and it seems that Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. Do you think he would have mentioned it in one of his previous adventures, have not you? Only one teen lives in Springwood, and Krueger uses it to get in touch with his long lost daughter. Another reason why this last installment is so terrible is a completely illogical structure. John Doe-boy is introduced as a leading figure but then suddenly dies and the plot is still rotating on two adults! How about: Freddy Krueger, who spent five full-time films that kill nothing but teenagers, eventually defeats two adults who wear 3D glasses! Something like the ruin of the whole essence, right? As for me, the "Elm Street Nightmare" has always been a horribly overrated series, but the poorest posts have at least some redeemed elements. But "Freddy's dead" is simply rigid and no one should let his precious time hurt.
