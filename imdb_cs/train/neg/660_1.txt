Good grief I can not even describe how poor this movie is. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect a lot to start. Let's see, the PG-13 slasher film is destined for the missing ummm ... slashing, so no one should be surprised at the lack of gore. But that was the level of incompetence and the cliche on the screen in all the other aspects of this movie is what really kicked me off. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is just so useless that you find yourself rooted for a bad guy.

I'm not saying when I say Dora Explorer has more vicious guys than this movie. Finally, because all the potential for tension or free of charge will remove the dire (and seemingly thirteen year old) director, what could be left to fill 2 hours of on-screen time? <br /> <br /> Cloakroom, that's what. <br /> <br /> Lots of cabinets: big cupboards, small cupboards, mirror cabinets, Narnia cabinets, so many damn wardrobes you do not want to dress for another year.
