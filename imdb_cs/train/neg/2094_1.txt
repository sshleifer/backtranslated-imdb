I had to suffer from adolescent, middle school and family conflicts on almost the entire show. I really do not care about how girls in secondary schools are looking after their relationships. I spent time in hell dealing with these problems, and I did not care about the fictional adolescents who go through the "lite" versions of horrors that I have endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. Several seconds of science fiction appeared in the show. Finally we see proto-Cylon. It was good, but with one problem. His red eye point would attract some object. We all know that Cylon eyedets always scan back and forth to give the machine a map of the world. Red eyes never stop moving. <br /> <br /> I really hope writers will fix this abuse before the second episode.
