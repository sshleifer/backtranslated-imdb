Formula flick of a guy who wants a girl, a boy who will lie to get next to a girl, a guy who will have the best friend to help in an inaccessible way (comedus reliefus, no?), To help deceive a girl, etc. This was made it to death, and with the exception of several scenes of z, it was better. <br /> <br /> Stop with the side, the guides are attractive and there are some good moments. Jonathon Schaech did better, and his acting came close to being called. It's not a total loss, but nothing new in this lazy affair.
