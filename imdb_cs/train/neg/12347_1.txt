This is perhaps the worst movie Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both completely crippled in an exaggerated film about a girl who goes to the army. Very stupid. And there's never been a scene that would be convincing. It is really hard to create such a movie. Everything a crew can do is a thought for everyone. Writers did not have much inspiration; many stupid dialogues that did not make sense at all; and some insignificant actions. I strongly recommend that you keep from this waste. I hope that many talented people involved in this project will realize that this type of film does not deserve their attention and that they will work on more honest and intelligent films in the future than this unnecessary mess.
