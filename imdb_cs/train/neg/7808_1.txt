I'm a huge fan of Michael Madsen, so it's useless to say, I bought this movie without renting it or something ... This movie was so terrible, I did not even take it to the store, or else I'm subjected to this human poison, I just threw it in the basket, it did not bother the money, it was worth it to throw it out. The game was not so bad, it was not good or nothing. The story was terrible, and the end was something I despised. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. his life was a lot of junk mail. I thought his horse, the peanut, was a terrible device that showed his childish innocence, the dog would be much better. I also hate religion, so it undoubtedly ended with anger. Jesus heals all ... I hate to know people who are like great Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not do everything or anything else. It was a terrible movie if you can see, go through or buy or rent it, and throw it in garbage, and in the morning leave the coffee that morning
