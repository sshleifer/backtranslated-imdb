This may be the worst film adaptation of the Broadway musical ever. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough does not know anything about the theater - almost every shot and moment circling fake. But I say it's almost so bad that it's fun. Hairstyles are remarkably dated. I can not understand what's meant for me by opening a movie with the exterior of the theater where "A Chorus Line" plays. Can we think these people will try for "A Chorus Line," which contains stories about the problems? Oh no, the show collapsed. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album a hundred times. Why, why did they do that?
