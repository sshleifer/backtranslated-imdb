I saw this movie because I liked the plot, a group of foreigners is held in captivity trying to figure out how they are connected. The setting and assumption was obviously influenced by the first (and best) saw the movie and although there was not much action the story moved quite well. <br /> <br /> There was a comedy relief in the form of two blatant 'Alpha Men' and it was a welcome surprise to me as well) to see Melissa Joan Hart, who still did not work. Several things made it for me personally; 1. The pedophile was precisely characterized to turn everything from the child to the dead body. <br /> <br /> 2. The MJH line about how the policeman "got into it" when in fact he was the least deserving person who was there, unwittingly contributed to the events leading to their capture. . End ..... What movie is ending in the middle of something, what's going on? There was no resolution, no hanging on the cliff, no obvious end ... it just ended. And for the same I dropped two stars from my rating. The first 2 points would leave a slide, but not the end!
