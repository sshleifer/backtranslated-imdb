This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was terrible! I can not emphasize enough! Play, direction, story, characters and everything about it was bad! It was so cruel and clich√©. Do not be fooled by the envelope, or the "Texas Massacre" mark can not laugh. "You're kidding, you're kidding It was ridiculous The first two minutes of the movie are good until they get into the main character of Brendan OK Now turn it off What I got out of the movie was a lot of ugly, annoying and immature people going to the cabin in the middle of a forest and a clown that sings children's rhymes, kills them in irregular and fake ways. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money and it would be a waste of your money and time I quickly played most of the movie, because it was so terrible I just wanted to see how every bad actor died and it's still not worth it Just watching the cover is a waste of time This is really the worst film EVER Rating: does not deserve one.
