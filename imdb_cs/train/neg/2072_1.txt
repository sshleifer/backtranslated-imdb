Tonight I leased this movie because it looked like a fun movie. I thought you really could not break the Ex Girlfriend concept with super performances. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was puzzled and unnecessary ... it seemed that the writer was always throwing an unwanted thumb on every step. The writer has also been throwing too much toilets and sexual situations that could only be loved by a teenage boy. It seems that it could be so easy to draw a story from Fatal Attraction Super Hero .. but I think not. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic comedy that has been advertised. You could not take the baby to see it, and you would be afraid to see the date. <br /> <br /> If the writer could make a basic story about a high concept and clean it out - the movie might have a chance to fight. <br /> <br /> Serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
