I find that the tempo is icy and the original story is blowing disproportionately to the content. My wife slept most of it, and I did not try to wake her up because I felt nothing was missing. When Holmes and Watson enter the house and then are potentially caught, it is unclear how he could quickly hide all of his entry and burglary tools. It's also not clear how the doors to the studio are blocked and prevent the servant from getting inside. The thing that confused me was fine, in the eyes of a broken statute. I have no idea what it was supposed to be.
