The film is very tedious and unfortunately differs completely from the novel. If you want to see a movie, first read the novel because it will shock you. However, cinematography was fine and if you are a person who loves adventure genres exploring Africa, take a look. Effective performance is reasonable, however, many important events that have been present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis sought rather his brother rather than the lady who was looking for her father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in a cave, while she turned out to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
