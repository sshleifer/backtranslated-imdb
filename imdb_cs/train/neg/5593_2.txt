I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies, since I was younger and I thought he was great, but the movie was really bad. I do not know if it was my youth that deceived me to believe that Lee was the perfect Dracula, with style, appearance, attraction, and evil under him. Or maybe it was just the movie that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine that Dracula with the English accent and the tongue of the body go with him? Do you like when the plot contains unrealistic character choices and is boring and lacks any kind of tension? Then it's a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - you do not see! I just gave it 2 because I managed to stay awake throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you enjoyed this movie then you had to be sleeping and at home in a dark room with a lot of unsecured space behind you. Perhaps lonely in your parent at home or in a foreign home. Because even the characters in this movie were far afraid, and I think it sums up the whole thing! Or maybe you like this movie because it's a place in the history of cinematography Dracula, maybe fascinated by how Dracula's story evolved from Nosferatu to what is today. Since the film is not so appealing, it does not include the suggestive secret that makes the Vampyrski myth so fascinating. <br /> <br /> And it has so many people who feel that way. Scenery looks like a cheap Theater. And I'm not saying I reject everything that was in the 1970s. Because I can love the old movie and the new movie.
