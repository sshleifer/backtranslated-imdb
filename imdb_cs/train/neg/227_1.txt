Was it a comedy or a serious drama? This film begins with a light heart among the three women. Good. It moves into a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Good. There are a few ancient ones among them. Good. But when the conspiracy envelops and eventually becomes black I start to wonder if I misinterpreted the first part of the film. He continues this time for a while until he finally attempts to return to the original reckless chatter. But it is late. It is hard to understand why these women still speak one another and the final is not convincing. Really Instruction (for British filmmakers), how to make movies. It is hard to see how the producers have ever convinced that this movie will work. And the box office proved to be a real flop because I never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years after its release).
