This film is basically about some girls in a Catholic school who get into trouble to put the red dye in one of the school shampoos and after being reprimanded for doing so, they decide to fly to Florida for a vacation. On the way, they meet some boys in the local restaurant and decide to meet later in another place. The girls end up on the road next to the forest and stop for a while, and while one of the girls chooses to walk a little, she sees the murder involving the local sheriff. She's afraid and running to tell others what's happened. The other girls decide to go see her and two of them kill a murderer. Then the two remaining girls are captured by a murderer and are placed in local prisons. The Deputy Sheriff, meanwhile, watches the girls, and despite their insistence that the Sheriff is a murderer, he ignores both and acts as unconscious, and everyone else in this film, who simply can not put two and two together much less some filthy detective work on it. It was the best rapport between the killer and one of the girls where she decided to rape her in prison and it seems that the girl really wants to rape this man and the bare chest scene I admit was good but before their lips meet, he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frank Avalon, who looks at him, the same motif that has another distinctive part. It's not a movie worth borrowing for even an 80-year low-budget movie, and the end was the worst end I've ever seen in the movie and let me take the money back!
