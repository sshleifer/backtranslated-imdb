Go back to Cabin by the Lake just ... missing. It must have a very low budget, because a relatively large part of the film has to be shot with a normal video camera. So in the same scene - you'll have several movie shots and simple video cameras. It makes a very special blend! I think they should find some way to avoid the "home video" effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing when you've seen the original CBTL, because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL .... you will never want to see it if you see this first! It will probably be too crude and will turn you away from the care of the original.
