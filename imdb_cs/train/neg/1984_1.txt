Absolute steam pile of cow dung. I think the movie was even made. Hip-hop and the old westerns do not just look. What target audience these people thought about when planning this train. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a concept and a plot joke, but the acting is terrible and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare film makes their whole laughter career. A cat without worshipers should never be forgiven and she is deprived of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, she should ask which of her friends is playing this bad joke. After some research I actually found a list of some of the other actors who passed this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I'd rather watch a blank TV than watch this movie again.
