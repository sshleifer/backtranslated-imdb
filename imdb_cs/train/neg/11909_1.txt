I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time: Darklight. The essence of the film - Lilith was Adam's first woman, and she was considered imperfect and expelled from Eden's garden because she thought Adam was straight and refused to obey him. You see, I took those words straight from the script. Then the movie continues, and although he is the hero of the film, the only time he becomes acceptable is when he does what men tell him to do! She finishes the film under the control of The Faith - all male groups! Besides, the script was predictable and the FX was terrible. In addition to the apparent hate of women, which is much softer in modern film, Darklight was nothing original.
