I will try to use words to describe it .... I have seen the original, which was good in its own way, but at that time I should be afraid to continue. <br /> <br /> And I was afraid when I chose this, but now that I've seen it, I have to say it's even worse than I thought. Why these movies still get money still rotates their minds. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they're not that good, but we have to say that some are doing their head by being just awful. But what an actor can do with script like this one. They try to copy the original, this time the places have changed, any form of the story is gone, and any attempt to actually come up with something that has not been done before, unluckyly fails. In the unnecessary attempt to get it up to date, they are trying to make it exciting by using the whole big brother theme, but it has been worn out years ago and offers nothing but a fill between the beginning and the end. He tried to try to save the film by making a number of references to the original '83, but eventually ended up just fun and sometimes a little sad. Finally, if you do not have anything, and I do not mean anything, do ... go watch it or play Frisbee ... with DVD .... alone. It will offer you so much fun. I promise
