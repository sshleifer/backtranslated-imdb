"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feel-good", called "Heat Warming" and out-for-ratings show that ABC has time together. <br /> <br /> Understand the problems these families are going through. That's why I'm sorry. But do not you think that the introduction of four wide-screen plasma TVs, three desktop flatscreens, inground pool halfway to the yard, and a box full of expensive designer clothing is BIT too excessive for any family? Sure, these families were a lot. Sure, they deserve the nicer things they had before. But honestly, what Ty Pennington and his crew have put into these homes are enough to suit the entire neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really moves me on this show is that you and his crew have always something to say about each little thing that concerns family or family status. Telling a wheelchair person that he is "so strong" or "very courageous" really gets old after some time. It may sound rough, but believe me; watch this show and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Overall, this show is overestimated. If you want to look, go ahead. This comment is just heads-up for what you would watch.
