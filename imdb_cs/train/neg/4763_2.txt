The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "revision" of the great game and a good movie from 1972, a terrible movie experience. If I could save someone from watching him, I would do a good thing. This "new" version is loaded with talent and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh is ugly, sterile, one note. He continues to shoot a movie from every artistic, disturbing and self-defeated angle. We see the reflections of the actors in the stainless steel, the security monitors, their 200 ft high heads, the close-up of the eyes, the chin, and more. The script by Nobel laureate introduces long sections of unpleasant homosexual banter, which are falsified by both sides ... I think? Given the character of "twists," how would I know? The characters themselves, who are so richly cartooned in the original, are indecent and indecent. The operating time has been shortened by an hour, which is either a real problem or the most beautiful thing the director has done for us. Actors effectively use their lines, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. Jude Law is over the top of Caine, but as credited Producer, he must have Branagh's blessing. Overall, I find it ugly to look at the unconvincing shell of the former classics. Why was it even made? The paying public has spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A miserable piece of work that fails every step.
