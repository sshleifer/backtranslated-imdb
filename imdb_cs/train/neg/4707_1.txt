OMG was the most painful experience in my life. I could even finish what Nick is doing. Their best thing about teen Nick is Drake and Josh, and this is about to blow the air. Children's songs are a little annoying and kids are too. My little sister wanted to see the show because she likes everything that appears to Disney or Nick, but after watching this show she says "one of the worst shows I've ever seen so boring." My little brother fell asleep and I envy him. In short, if your three-year old without activity in the brain will enjoy this show, otherwise the channel will now change.
