The 1980s were not very kind to one-time star Charles Bronson. Beginning with 1982, "Death Wish II," and ending this really horrible film of 1989, Bronson's screenwriters seemed to try to cover each other with progressive roughness. "D. W. II." In the performance of the Bronson character's daughter's rape and suicide, he had little imagination (the rape and murder of his housekeeper also manifested in disgusting details). "10 to midnight" was such a filthy movie that you later wanted to bathe. Nothing was bought for it. Other films like "The Evil That Men Do" and the remaining "Death Wish" films from that period stretched the line between high camp and high barf with their serious images of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) get up the hill when they see that Bronson cares about elderly people and destroys punks young enough to be his grandchildren or something, but dirty craft (and terrible scripts) of these movies usually destroyed little energy. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is quite well made, but it really takes a cake in a cinematic disaster. In this film, Bronson: Sodomizes the Perverse Jan; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a man to be raped by another prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic notes, fortunately I forgot. Also, there is a gang-rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately it was out of the screen, though well-denoted). What did people think when they shot this movie? What did Bronson think when he decided to destroy his career with these terrible movies? For anyone interested in the best movies, check out most of the films he made in the 1960s and 1970s such as "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon til 3", "Once Upon a Time on the West "," Red Sun "," Big Escape "," The Magnificent Seven "," Rain Rider ", etc., Atd. ....
