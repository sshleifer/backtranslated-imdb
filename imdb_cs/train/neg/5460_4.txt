Interestingly, Columbo Series 6 contained only three episodes, and in at least two scenarios there is very little evidence of quality based on this trip for the "man in mac" and "Fade into Murder". <br /> <br /> It is not accidental that Peter S. Feibleman wrote both of the above scenarios (incidentally, he also plays part of the murdered security guard here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is very rare, and many artists just do not look as if they are uninteresting with the material. The story is relatively poorly developed with some long boring conversation times. <br /> <br /> Columbo is also a shaded colleague (similar to "Last Salute Commodore"), but the value of entertainment is minimal. To add to that, Celeste's Holm characterization, which is intended to provide a comedy, raises embarrassment rather than laughs. The script dares to deal with family history and the murderer does enough to gift a Columbo case, although there is never a credible discussion about the motives of her crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically what turns out to be, probably the worst adventure of Columbo is the most fun moment in the series. He quits a male hairdresser and at the same time has a haircut / manicure. The next 5 minutes are funny - it's just that Columboin's hair is so perfectly trimmed, then she can not afford to pay her bill, and then, when she asks for jewelers, she's still looking in the mirror to admire her hairstyle! /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's the only decent moment in the script that looks like it's paved after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Columbo.
