I recently looked at Belle Epoque and thought it might be great because she won the Oscar for the best foreign language film. I was a little overwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film. Maybe I have had a conflict since the film was shot, the plot of a man who falls into beautiful women and eventually fell for a good girl he has done so many times. In addition to the conspicuous plot, some scenes in the movie really felt in place with a story (for example, a certain event at the wedding). Sometimes the film was a bit of a sermon in his ideas and in relation to the French time the film was placed and the Church. The only thing the film had to experience were the cute moments, scenery and character of Violeta, a strong and independent woman when women did not really relate to these qualities.
