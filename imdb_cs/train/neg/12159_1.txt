I can not believe I actually watched it, but I think I just wanted to know if this movie could be unintentionally fun and fun to the end. and that was it. the peak was the worst performance ever given by the lawyer of defense - so from real life, even for a fictitious story it was too strange. no one on this planet can act in court like her. and probably the worst prosecutor in the world. why was he in court too? he did nothing, and absolutely nothing to prove he was guilty. a simple search for her house would result in the finding of rings. but not. he would rather say "objections" 2 or 3 times throughout the process - it was. the blond fool has been given the true drug to prove her innocence, but not Brett. the fool had almost at Brett's altar house that could prove her ill obsession. but not again. during the court scene, I felt the silent urge to take the needle out of my hand and suppress it on my head several times. Even real viewers do not look like a stupid fake "I'm innocent" like her. and what does this film tell us? never married a woman with life insurance: once she falls down the stairs, her husband will be jailed, guilty or not. evil, evil man.
