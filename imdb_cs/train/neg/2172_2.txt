The lower part of the barrel, a non-imaginative and virtually indivisible remake of the YEAR ROLLER. This movie follows an exact conspiracy like the Filipino film STRYKER and is far worse! Bad action, dialogue, effects, dubbing, stimulation, action sequences ... The list goes on and on. Italy has achieved literally dozens of Road Warrior jumpers in the early 1980s, some good, some bad. It's the worst off, no competition. Not only was the mood of the film absolutely bleak and unhappy, the experience of sitting is a hole and a half. At the beginning of the film, there was 1 (one) good sequence of persecution and the cold shot of the man holding the hand grenade exploding. But ALL other things about this movie are seriously falling! For true post-nuke fun, go tracking a copy of ENDGAME, after falling NEW YORK, or ESCAPE from BRONX instead. They are much more fun than this waste.
