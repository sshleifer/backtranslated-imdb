The film starts with people on Earth who discovered that their rocket on Mars was not lost, but just emerged in a space near the planet. When loaded, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive and the other two is missing. What happened to them is said through the flashback of the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a series of very stupid bats. Special, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the strongest I saw on the film. Moreover, in a strange attempt at realism, production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation only caused the film to look quite cheap when it was on the surface of Mars And the intensity of the redness practically caused my eyes to bleed - it was bad! Despite all the cheese, the film was as interesting as the good news about space travel. Lovers of the genre are worth seeing. For others, you can just find the whole thing a little stupid - see for yourself and decide. While according to today's standards it is not particularly good science fiction film compared to the films that are made at that time it is quite good. <br /> <br /> PS - When looking at the film, pay attention to Dr. Tremayne. Looks like a splash of Dr. Questa's picture from the Jonny Quest comic strip! He sounded and worked much like him.
