My first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two dives played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who like to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. One day after the day of exploration, they approached the pair played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell young divers that they want to hire them to discover a cliff and discover a rare artifact about Columbus's hidden treasure, which is recorded at the bottom of the cliff. the bottom of the cliff and the rough diving all day will not find anything. Several days before, and two hired divers discovered they were part of a big lethal conspiracy in which they could not escape otherwise, they would be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core. The film also has a story about another person (the lead character brother) who is trying to imitate his affair, I estimate this part of the story was a waste of time, it also includes a very nasty sexual scene between a couple who is a complete waste and there was no need it was shown. However, besides, this movie has some good underwater photography and the colors blend well, which is why it gets 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel by name only. None of the original actors or characters return, they have stupid plot, stupid characters, and boring climax.
