This is probably one of the worst "wanting to be low budget hit movies" to borrow a dinosaur genre. The movie is so predictable that you could go away, prepare dinner, answer the phone or anything, and when you return, you will know exactly what happened. The special effects are so bad that you would think that the Lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so willing that it makes the pet look like a super predator. Effects are complete. They are trying so hard, but there is not enough character behind them to get into the characters and the scientists ... Yeah, we know exactly what happens to the blonde in the glasses. Stereotype was created for such films. If you want to watch this movie, I recommend you not be in such a serious mood as cast and crew. And if you really are in dinosaurs and you know about everything in the world, do not look at them, you can break the screen - the facts are so far.
