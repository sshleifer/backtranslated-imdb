I'm a huge fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was completely disappointing. Besides surrounding background music? which really sets the mood of the movie? I miss almost all of the features I've come to associate with Lynch's work. The visual pages are boring, the least, and the dialogue is unclear and monotone to be of any interest. It feels more like movie students annoying trying to do arty dogma film than the work of an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur movies with far better cameras, scene, sound and script. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities. I feel like watching one of David's home videos that are produced during a weekend trip with several friends.
