Celia Johnson is good as a sister. Michael Hordern is as good as Capulet, though it's his usual light and wail and not the patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Brother Laurence, although he will never come anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. Benvolio Christopher Strauli is compassionate. The sets are nice, if not stunning, like some other BBC Shakespeare. And that's it. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire turned to 15 years during production, and has no idea how to deal with Julia - she opens her eyes wide and kisses every line exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is wrong for her, and his self-confidence is inexplicable. The balcony scene flows smoothly and smoothly with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their death comes as a relief. If I had a dagger, I'd offer it an hour ago. Anthony Andrews is undeniable as Mercutio, a great shock if you remember his great work at "Brideshead Revisited". He broke the mirror of Shakespeare's verses into a thousand particles of two or three words, then shouted fragments as indiscriminately and unreasonably as possible. In this production Queen Mab abdicates. Director Alvin Rakoff shows only the broken gift of the camera to show us what we want to see. The opening battle is largely incoherent. However, there is humor, when in a later fight Romeo seems to Tybalta's knees directly in the pavement. Tybalt then grabs the attacked area. However, did that happen? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom or much else.
