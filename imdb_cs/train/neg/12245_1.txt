Why why? ... did I choose this? Well ... I needed the discomfort in the summer and the packaging looked cool. Of course I should know better. It's really a really bad movie. And it scares when the creators know it's bad, and try to hide it by adding some sexy / beautiful women and some sexual scenes. Well, people ... it does not cut it, it will do it! If you want a great movie about a big reptile, which is really very, very good, well played and fun: go hike Lake Placid! (that's the order)
