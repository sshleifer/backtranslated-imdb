Just because the event actually happened does not mean that it will be a good script / movie. Cat's Meow by Peter Bogdanovic claims to be based on the real events that happened on the voyage hosted by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than spending the time to create a story about the bizarre attitudes they would have. The key moments of the story seem unlikely; For example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer and believes he is Chaplin. Placing a key element of a story on someone who wears a bad hat is thoughtful and fanciful. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but Cat's Meow lacks an important part of this equation, a comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for some of the characters. It hardly depends on who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong nature that could wake up. As a result, conflicts are difficult to bother and the end result is accidental.
