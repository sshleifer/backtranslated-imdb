I went to this film and waited for a brief film about Sam's influence on society. I did not expect that Spike Lee would be forced to feed more rubbish on racial tension, mob-justice or the inability of an ordinary citizen to vote under pressure from peers. Lee introduced an extreme view. The whole movie could be more effective if it is in the 90-minute format with more focus and less tangential sub-graphs. <br /> <br /> Don 't even bother to rent a video unless you're passionate about enjoying Spike Lee; in that case, it is worth the theater. This is not the movie that escaped.
