This movie had to be the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and they got it by accident. that it was a joke in front of my own film. it was terrible, I waited for it to start frightening and it never was. this movie had no real facts about the real Zodiac killer. The filmmakers apparently did not even bother to investigate anything about murders ... they just liked their name ... so they decided to write a script that his name was not true. I'm angry that I did not realize the movie was not earlier. I'm trying to get something out of every movie, I do not hate movies ... never ... except this one. If you did not give him any stars, I certainly should. 1 out of 10.
