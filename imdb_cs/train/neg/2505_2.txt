I saw a lot of little Richard in interviews and performances and enough poor Leonians who got into the music in the 1950s and 1960s to know that Leon is not the right actor for this role. Leon was as true as David Ruffin at The Temptations, but in this film he is totally lacking in capturing the nature of Little Richard. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez, who played Little Richard in "Why do the fools fall in love?" was a much more appropriate choice when she drew a strong but effeminate personality of the musician. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, the movie will be as good. And this happened. The whole gloss or completely omitted are LR invasions into homosexuality and voyeurism. What "The Temptations" did so well to capture the rise of the band, warts and everything, this film lacks a wide brand. What's happening with director Robert Townsend, who has just started "Hollywood Shuffle"? He's a talented, funny guy, but he did not make the first effort.
