I am both amused and disgusted by people who claim that this film is so accurate about Vietnam and NEVER EVER. This film is about as true about the whole war in Vietnam, because the beating of Rodney King is true for ALL cops. Yes, bad things are done (and they did), but generally people are just like you and me. They have morals, they do not kill machines, not all drugs. Atrocities were an exception in Vietnam, not a rule. They have become much more frequent than the "hype" will lead you to believe. Oliver Stone has a talent for shooting movies that show the Vietnam War as brutal bloodshed, but they are based just like Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA have done much worse things to the South Vietnamese than any soldier in the US forces ever did. Reality: World War II soldiers treated enemies much worse than Vietnam soldiers and were welcome when they returned home. Good Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political point of view, no one could ask for more from our soldiers, and it is a very disappointed statement that this kind of "mostly true" fiction is the way things really are.
