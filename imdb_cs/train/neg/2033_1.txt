If I could give less than 1, I would. Do not be afraid to rent; if someone gives you a DVD burning. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. Total waste from even a digital "film". I saw better 12-year-old boys on Youtube. Lommel says he wrote it, if it is, it is the classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The story line does not exist, the dialogue is mainly screaming, working with the camera is an attempt at artistic charm with the nonsensical cutting of completely unrelated jumps on industrial transport scenes or some weird, excited young woman. <br /> <br /> I can usually watch less than an obvious conspiracy or see purpose in a "creative" movie - I like David Lynch. This is either so far behind my limited understanding of what I missed or is completely useless. I think it's "letting you see if we can catch the title that will soon come out and make a strange contradiction and see if we can catch some money." <br /> <br /> I do not see why Lionsgate has bothered this activity. Totally worthless is so bad that the same director will not be different.
