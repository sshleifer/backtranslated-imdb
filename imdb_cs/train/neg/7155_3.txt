I'm sorry but I did not like it much. I mean a million ways to make it better. The people who did it obviously do not have much imagination. Interviews are not very interesting and there is no real view. The shots are not collected in a very informative way. It's bad because it's a movie that really deserves a special spell. One thing I say is that Isabella Rosselini becomes older and gets it. Everyone was thinking it would only get "4."
