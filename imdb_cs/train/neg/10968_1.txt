*** THIS CONTAINS MULTIPLE SPOILERS, BUT NOT EXCELLENT, ALL IS PATENTLY DISPLAYED *** Oh, my God, where do I start from? Well, this is the first time I ever came out of the movie and said, "I have to get to IMDb and write a review about NOW, it's my duty." That's the badness of this movie. <br /> <br /> * start dividing * But let me just one thing before I start. I'm not Harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie (actually, I went to college at the far end of Mass avenue in Cambridge where real intelligent people without rich dads and trust funds are going to place me directly in the addition group a people who should be obsessively love and a comic book, and I hated this movie ...). My favorite attention is for film production that includes Die Hards, Bond Flicks, Clerks and The Grail. I wish the Titanic never fell, not for the lost lives, but we would not be exposed to this filthy pile of film. And the only reason I'm going to watch Snoot's French art film is when Emmanuelle Beart is young and often destroyed. I even gave Max Overdrive one of his precious tens of IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm so deep that they're coming, so I'm not criticized by this movie because I'm looking for some standard of excellence in cinematography - it's because Elektra smells like a three-week dead goat. * Termination * <br /> <br /> OK, there is so much wrong that I have to try to categorize it. Here is: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the persuasive reasons why a man would like to see this movie is to see a bunch of hot JGars (I do not know why the woman wanted me). I think between that and "Find Nemo", the other one was a more sexy movie. Do you know the red clothes she advertises on every crazy advertisement you see? You see it in it twice - once in the beginning, once in the end. Bummer. In fact, it looks as though she looked Morrissey if she was a woman - a lot of dwarves and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible number of expressions JGar shows in her acting activity - from "fastening" all the way to "bondage and crying". Oh, God, you think she was forced to Ben Affleck or something so terrible. Wait ... <br /> <br /> WEAKNESSES / GAL: They show the same amount of expression and abilities you would expect from slightly overweight grapefruit. At least beside the performance of JGar it does not look too bad. The task of one person is to stand there and be enormous, the other is to stand there and have something to come out of, and the role of a woman is to stand and breathe and / or kiss people. They can pull these incredible performances. The major thief has the most difficult role of all - he must ALWAYS a) be angry and b) look like an Asian. He does a great job of doing it. I think there was the fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain is starting to block parts of this film in self-defense. <br /> <br /> PLOT TWISTS! This film has as much surprise as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let's just say that - my wife, who is only half a year old in the US and speaks very little English, whispered to me when the girl first appeared on the JG mat and I swear to God that I did not: "She goes to the house to kill the girl, and also my father. " And that's before my dad appeared on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but Mensa does not die for her gifts, and she has a zero exposure to Daredevil or a comic book genre. And she invented it in 0.00015 seconds without knowing it. This is the obvious feature of this film. <br /> <br /> RARELY-PRECIOUS FUN! OK, so that's a great friend in the movie. He can take a shotgun detonator and remove the shot as if it were an inflammation, and he could pull a malicious electric tip on his chest and just bend the metal (or scramble it - or something else - to defend more defenses, thank God). But JG jumps on his head and explodes? Achilles noggin? OK! This is the stupidity of this movie. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm beginning to feel the bleeding from the brain, so I have to stop. But you were warned. If you have to deliberately shatter your own tires to stop seeing this movie, do it. And if Armagedon is going to be on, please let it be before it appears on DVD.
