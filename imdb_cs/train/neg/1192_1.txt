I totally agree with jamrom4 .. it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen .. holy crap it was terrible .. I was warned not to see it .. and I foolishly followed him the same .. about 10 minutes into a painful experience even completely give up watching the atrocities .. but sit down to the end .. just to find out if I can .. well done it and now I wish I did not .. it was nasty .. nothing happened and the end was all the proclamation .. but a movie that has a bad right to survive .. I urge you all to save your fear of fat bus drivers .. though I just realized the same warning .. please save yourself from this movie .. I feel like those who they were highly involved in the filming of the film ... and they should all be erased from the face of the planet.
