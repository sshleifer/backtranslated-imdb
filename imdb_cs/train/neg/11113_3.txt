I often feel like Scrooge, tapping films that others talk about - or write reviews to balance unwarranted raves. I found this film almost imperceptible and unusual for me was a fast forward, not only a boring, clichéal dialogue, but also a boring cliché of musical numbers. Whether any original in this movie - an unusual home environment for music, a lot of fantasy, some animation - is more than offset by a script that has no accent or thought provoking the plot. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but they can not wear the film as a team. He is not really charismatic or has a lot of sexual attraction. Both are insignificant. I like Billy Gray, but his character is quite remarkable. The best part of the film for me is beautiful costumes and a big body.
