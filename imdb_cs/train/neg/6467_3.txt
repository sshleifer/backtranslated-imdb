I still can not believe this movie. He has so many incredible things that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to do it. The story is a joke, but in the sense that it is funny, but rather like no story at all. How can you mix a creepy comedy with a train robbery, prison film, city plot, sexual jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> In addition to scary directing, the most important actors are. I was watching this movie and I thought, "Is it really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be." (5 minutes later) Is it Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. to be Donald Sutherland (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino This film is too bad for all of them (at the end) No, no, no, it does not have to be Martin Sheen !!! movie. "Then it ended and I was nervous. So good Oscar winners, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, silly and horrible movie. I rarely wanted to know as much as they came in this. They could not get that much money. <br /> <br /> Only an incredible stupid idiot movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)
