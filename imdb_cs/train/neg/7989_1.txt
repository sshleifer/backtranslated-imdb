I had great expectations for "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend It Like Beckham" and (less) "East Is East". The history of the British Asians, who find themselves in their home, has many good shows on the big screen as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness, Mercy, etc.). This one falls. In spite of a good start, he quickly went downhill. In the end, it was a very typical BBC effort, supplemented by strong regional accents, exaggerated by over-acting characters, the soundtrack "these were days" and lots of "questions" in an attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> During this movie I found myself at many points. Writing is predictable. Any possible clichés were pulled and broadcast. In fact, I have trouble thinking about any means between cultures and generations that could be used that were not. The figures were thin and cliché: an eccentric non-conforming minister; a meaningful, but ultimately racist, old woman; overweight, horny aunt; Indian parents; a working class neighbor; "wise" deep grandmother; motorcycle rider on horseback. The script was weak, with every chance of shocking an audience with an open racist dialogue of two dimensional racist white figures. And why it had to be set in the seventies (except that you need an apology for the 70th soundtrack) is a secret. Maybe they make incredible characters a little more believable for people born after 1979. I do not know. Even those things aside, good acting could bring this into a worthy unknown. Instead, they were accused of the usual "BBC comedies" of the suspects to reinforce them. "Bend It Like Beckham" has a much better comic actor (and really serious acting) than this, with a practically unknown cast. Overall, lazy cliché script, sketched, predictable story. Give it a bug. <br /> <br />
