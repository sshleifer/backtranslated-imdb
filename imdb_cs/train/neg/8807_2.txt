I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie just like "28 days" or so ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem to be infected with a strange virus that makes her eat the human body to survive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> ----------------- <br /> <br />
