This is probably the most unnecessary film in history. I am very looking forward to seeing this film with the actor / director Roman Polansk√Ω. I think I'd rather see three Amigos than ever watching this movie again. He quickly went directly to the garbage from the DVD player. I apologize to those of you who apparently enjoyed this movie, but you probably also enjoyed a new coke. I'm in a loss when I see why someone can enjoy this movie, it's slow, boring and has no real plot. Wait for 105 minutes before the movie starts. I understand that happened in 1976, but it was a time of bad television everywhere. Thanks to the divine disco and Three's, the trail of glasses and Bay City Rollers. Oh, just my thoughts.
