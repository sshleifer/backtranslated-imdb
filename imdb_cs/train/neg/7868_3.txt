I've seen many of Guy Madden's films, and I loved most of them, but he literally made me headache. John Gurdebeke's work is too frenzied, and in addition to the tour-de-force sequence that shows a number of heads that attach to one object, nothing affects the actors' ability to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not want about this movie was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's earlier works-though his films always had dark elements, his sympathy for attitudes gave movies the prevailing feeling of humanity. This seemed more like roughness due to hardness. Because I am obliged to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my reviews, I will mention that an actor who plays "Guy Maddin" can manage to suppress his facial expressions quite well.
