I sometimes hate ... try and try to be charitable towards all the films B through Z, but once in a while a certain film will try your patience until you want all the participants. "Bat People" (which I've seen under the title "It Lives By Night") is just such a movie. You can not watch it without thinking that it really should be an episode of "Night Galleries," and not one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> The film has to do with a doctor who gets a bite bite and then begins to switch to Were-Bat who drinks human blood. (In fact, you would think that if it turns into a real bat, it will eat mosquitoes in a gallon bucket, but because it's a cheap, brown horror movie, the word is blood.) Despite the fact that it has a hip and episode exhaustion almost every night , his friend and colleague doctor Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme insists on having an "allergic reaction" to rabies. So far, the worst and stereotypical regional sheriff in the world suspects the doctor that she is responsible for the brutal murder and burglary of several local girls (and one wino). Meanwhile, the female doctor decides that the denial is a river in Egypt and alternately patrons him and encourages him to disperse. <br /> <br /> This is not so much that acting is bad - you can say that actors do a professional level of choice and try to bring some juice and life scenarios, even the one who plays the sheriff. (Well, it's bad, but it's bad in cliché, wooden, professional). It's just that everything about acting, the way scenes are moving, costumes, dialogue, script, and story generally set your teeth to the edge and make you want everything to take part. <br /> I think the film had an extra chance to be a haunted, worrying little cultured favorite, but: 1) The director needed to defeat Michael Pataki, an experienced acting character with his chair until Pataki disagreed with ACT, and not just with the Dennis Channel Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) He also needed to find a script that made a bit more sense when it comes to the overall scenario "Bat Bites Human, who then turns into a bat." <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed an actor who played a doctor to find a bit more physically believable bit scene for his "episodes," rather than resorting to "Man Has A Sechure," the Golden Book of Clichéde's Acting Mannerism. <br /> <br /> 4) He needed to rework the whole 'wives' figure, making him both smarter, less vulnerable and more cautious. <br /> <br /> I would never have watched this movie, with the help of Mike and Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad, stupid or interesting. Even better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld".
