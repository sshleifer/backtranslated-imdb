When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a good movie sasquatch. Usually, when you have these types of movies, it's generally one sasquatch, but this is something like what? 7 or 10 of them? The game was good, the plot was fine, I liked scenes where sasquatch kills the first couple of victims, a very good camera. I expected it to be a horror film, but it was very little. This movie was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs more sasquatch movies, I think I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I'm reviewing is fine, but the Sasquatch movie was not, but I do not rate it so let me go back. This movie is suitable for rainy afternoon but for other occasions, no.
