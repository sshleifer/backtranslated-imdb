Sondra Locke smells in this movie, but she was just as awful an actress. Sadly, she pulls all the others (including then = real life friend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her.) But what did Clint Eastwood think when he agreed to play in this? One reading of the script should say that this was that it was really a snorer . This is an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or fence at all. Add to the bored, bad play, even from the normally good Eastwood. However, no action but a few arguments, and as far as I am concerned, this film is at the top of a pile of natural sleeping amplifiers. Could the movie be any boring anymore? I think watching the dry color or the grass grows, it can be more fun.
