Fuj. I thought it was strange that their ancient book of curses was created using a common font script instead of handwriting. The game is sometimes apathetic and at other times it is so dramatic. Why "demonic" kills two suspiciously silent doctors who helped make him immortal? Just that damn it? And it's really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle whenever it's out there. We understand it! You spent a little money renting a 3rd degree crotch rocket. That does not mean you must always see it! The "Faith" branch looks like the old Battlestar Galactica school, which has changed at the last minute. There is a scene where we were shown to some people on the talk show about 30 seconds before they were killed for no apparent reason and no meaning. All are launching character. Unforgettable characters and even more forgotten conspiracies make this one of the most misinformed films I've seen on the SciFi channel. Stay away until you get into bad movies.
