I went to see her at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, Oh, and - I hate my life now. Christopher Reeves would be a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> The movie was painful, but when he saw that Bret Carr personally saw desperation on top. My favorite part of the movie saw how BC slammed in the face of what looked like a "C" battery. The jury is still up to it. It was from the vibrator and it was slow. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Turn the left side of the face only ... people become famous strenuous things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr put on a chicken trunk for a little reversed psychology, walked through the streets of Clifton where he played his own film. Should. That's right when I uploaded a movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be a cult leader, or smart enough to be important. This is a feeling you get from what Bleepesque trickle of brainwashed, susceptible neo-yuppies who have come to see this Bret Carr work of work. It's an emotionally exhausting experience just thinking about writing about this movie, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
