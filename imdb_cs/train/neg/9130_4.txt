It is true that some work fans Peter Sellers may be disappointed with this, his ultimate intent. But surely every fan of the retailers will enjoy all of his movies, simply because of the huge talents of man. and Fiendish Plot Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Sadly, it became Sellers' last film (he was even released after his death), but it is still nice to see how he managed to maintain his irreplaceable talent until his premature death. And not only that we get one retailer, but we get out because Sellers is not only playing the title role but also his nemesis, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, a hunting detective of the crazy 168-year-old Fu. The story is just as unusual as we follow Fu immensely lofty to make his age-old elixir grow, and also Nayland and his team of coworkers who try to prevent him. Like any of the seller's greatest movies, the film comes with guaranteed flawless performance from him, as well as many of his familiar faces - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few. It's also nice to see that Pink Panther, Bart Kwouk (Cato), enjoys friends with the Sellers - even though he plays the same role but still is nice. The story is really quite ridiculous, just like many of the characters involved in it, and who thinks it as a movie strongly under the influence of the Goons. And while never reaching the heights of Goon's comedy, there are plenty of fun jokes that seem to be the right direction. The film was commercially unsuccessful at the beginning of its release due to the worldwide sadness after Sellers' death (the film was released less than 3 weeks later) and there is always a sad idea lurking in the back of your mind as they were the last movie vendors. It's far from a great movie - it's often slow, too absurd, and sometimes jokes simply do not exist - but it's still nice - even if it's just for other top performances by Peter Sellers.
