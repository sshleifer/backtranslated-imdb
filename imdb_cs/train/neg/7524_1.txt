Several critics appreciated this film with positive remarks. I do not want to discuss their point of view, but I definitely disagree. When I first watched this movie, I was slightly overwhelmed. But after comparing with other films, especially with the late master, Bruce Lee, I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it was not for the film, I would never buy it. Game of Death 2 does not relate to the original Death game (except that it shares one character, Billy Lo.) I was amazed to see how similar Death 2 was compared to Enter the Drak. The lands have striking similarities: Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. Both sites are similar in which they are both very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. In both films there is an element of prostitution (women are sent in two films in two films). Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's friend have a missing hand. It's an underground drug operation at Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, it's one in Game of Death. 2. Han has a cat in Enter the Dragon, the director used his imagination and gave Lewis a monkey. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> As for other aspects of the movie, such as script and acting, I felt that it was very bad. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to play and pray for the film to act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that choreography is impressive. Although combat sequences have strong elements of acrobatics, they are skillfully executed. Since the story is inadequate, I could not relate to the characters, and therefore the combat sequences were more of an exhibition than to make sense of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would say that this film is recommended to all martial arts fans, but for those who enjoy a solid action movie with a good story and strong characters, I would not seriously recommend this film. My views on this movie may seem very interesting and unilateral, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema, especially after his masterpiece: Come to Dragon, this film did not fit these standards. If anything imitates a truly martial arts martial art in the hope of reaching the same level of glory. <br /> <br /> As far as my rating is concerned, when I make this film very hard 1 out of 10, the film is observable with barley and it must be grateful for the combat sequences it has done.
