At least with a teen geek he gets girls' movies, that guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the forty-year Virginia he is replaced by a forty-year-old man who is popular with women, but in some way remains a virgin. But then you should not get your brain involved with this movie, or did I miss something about being a comatose for 20 years? One of a series of films in which 40 people have become teens and women for some reason find it attractive enough to have a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how it seems that the country that has created such a great television comedy thinks it has to rely on the rough and shallow figures that laugh. They made rough movies. We did it to behave like all Americans are 15 years old. Where do they go? <br /> <br /> This movie is rough and raw fun without a recommendation.
