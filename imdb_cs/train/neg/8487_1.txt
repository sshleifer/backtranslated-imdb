I have not seen anything so bad when I went out of James Bond's movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. All in all, I managed to sit down just for Tilda Swinton, but nothing that she could save to save this beast was nothing. As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this film unfortunately failed in every aspect of the film. The figures were cardboard and could not bring any sympathy. The plot was totally unbelievable. The acting acting, with the exception of Swinton, was amateur. Computer graphics were worse than in the "Throne". Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what makes sense. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why the actress of her caliber was concentrating on appearing in such mud, but it most likely regrets it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste money or your time on this glowing. There is nothing worth seeing.
