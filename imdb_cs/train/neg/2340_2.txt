The story is about the lives of ordinary people living in Antwerp living their lives. That's what I said, and there's nothing more about this story. The film is fast, like the MTV movie, and well photographed and we feel the director is talented and should make more films. So let's forget it and hope it will be the best with another Deus-Barman picture.
