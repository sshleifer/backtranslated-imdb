characters without depth. you have seen all the characters in other movies, I promise. the script tries to be nervous and unpleasant, but unfortunately fails. it fits into some hangover meets an excellent comedy, but the jokes are completely forced from the left field and are almost incomplete after they are cracked. the hot little girl is old and has no personality, she is just about thirty-year-old blonde with a few witty asses that carry jokes and are less than cute. the attraction between Molly (hot chicken) and Kirk (hunting interest) is barely communicated. attraction in no way where its completely platonic relationship is found until a clumsy and predictable safety belt-mishap kiss occurs. because they are in full relationship and they are simply incredibly chaff. the main focus of this film is not a relationship, but an unsuccessful attempt to create a horror movie with a very bad esquire with a semi-comedy plot. I could compare it with a hangover, in my forced nature. I can not get into it. I could go on, but it's just futile. you just do not pay to see this movie.
