After my kids had to watch it at least ten times for each of the last two Christmas, I feel reasonably qualified to decide on this version of the classic Dr. Story story. Seuss and well ... that's not very good. First, after a classic act like Chuck Jones's animated TV special, it's going to be difficult for someone, but this interpretation is so heavy and cushioned to be positively numb. I admit that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall, the film is becoming a countdown in cash, at the same time as it is supposed to be the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top, but it is totally inconsistent with the figure of Grinch. As Boris Karloff characterized, he was a slow burn; methodical and irritated. Carrey is not madness, and that's just the obvious mistake. Talented actors such as Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are totally useless. Why, Universal, why? I understand that I understand that Tony Hopkins will have almost any offered role (like his compatriot Michael Caine), but he has to be filmed under "Movies That Should Never Be Made". This is not a good reason for a cat in a hat, an even thinner that Universal prepares for this Christmas. I feel like I will make the same recommendations for who I am with this: I skip it and either read the book or watch the TV separately. That's 2 hours when you can never go back.
