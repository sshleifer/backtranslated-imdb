In fact, I look at this movie when I write it. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true artistic filmmaker," then it will be. . . <br /> <br /> . . I thought (still thinking about how I'm just watching) that this movie. . . to put it mildly, is very, very overvalued. Again, very. It looks like a really bad student movie made by someone with extremely limited resources. . . and who did not pay attention to detail. I do not want to go any further on in all the different ways I think it lacks, but. . . well. . . I just can not (remember, I fully admit that perhaps it is me that there is an idiot - not a filmmaker - for not having obtained this "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I was haunted by the whims because the reviews were very, very excellent. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
