Five-year-old Michael sees his mother being killed by his serial killer father "The Highwayman" who later committed suicide. "20 Years Later," Adult Mike (Gordon Currie of PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invited seven of his friends to their lonely home grandparents to "cope with their own concerns" at the Halloween Night Costume Party. Morty, a wooden doll held in the attic by an Indian guardian, becomes obsessed with the spirit of a dead father and kills them with his phobias. Characters are thrown out of the window, drowned in the toilet, eat rats, throw away, and the like. Morty goes to father and tree, walks around and makes stupid jokes. After finding a girl chopped and stuffed in a box, the characters stay in the house, make funny jokes and have sex. Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from the original Friday, 13th) is surprisingly beautiful as a grandmother, but this thing is even more pointless and vague than the original, and is full of fake burns, bad acting, brain-dead characters, and harassing distorted camera work. The only two minority figures (the Indian and semi-black girl) are the first to die. BLAH!
