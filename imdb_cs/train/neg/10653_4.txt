One two-three-four-five-six-eight-and-back, haha. It is necessary to see, first to see work out. There is plenty of work to show, look at those close up, the person you will like. Several years ago, the video was certainly based on this film. It's teasing, but no tension. The end is also fun and the clothes they wear in the wood that face the copper, Jesus, looks like a clown. Killing is mostly off-screen, blood flows, but never too cruel. There are lots of fighting scenes and hey, no one has been injured. And what about the weapons of killing, she never saw such a big one, it will not ruin you, you have to see it. And when you're a smiley, there's a lot of T & A. To guess who's a killer, you'll be trapped a few times, and that's the best part, but what the story of copper in the woods, huh! But still because of his cheese it's one that many would like to have. I'm glad I have my copy, one of those failures. But man, that dress, not to mention hairstyles! If you are in your forties, then one is back in the memory lane.
