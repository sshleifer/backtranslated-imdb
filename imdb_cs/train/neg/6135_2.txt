America needs the best man to win the "game" so who's hired? Gymnast, played by Kurt Thomas, who has the skills needed to win a game that includes the ninja, the village of fools and Richard Norton, who tells Kurt Thomas "to keep his hardware in his trousers". (His exact words) I missed it in the theaters and it's a good reason, because I would probably be kicked out because of the laughter that I came across at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my mind is just how it is that these ninjas are lame if the gymnast can kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is like five feet 4 and he barely strikes one as "The Best Man to Work" As for acting talent Kurt Thomas, well, if you can not say something nice ... In all seriousness, though one has to wonder how much cocaine was used to to introduce us so stupidly. Just the decision to shoot Tary Reid as a scientist fills this stupidity. For the whole 18 years, it was the title of the deepest film I've ever seen. Do not say I did not find this illegal that I was so laughing that I was almost strangled. Twice. It was only in the eighties that a film with such a bad idea could be made. Although the hero is so horrible to record a single film, he can not even pull the sword out of the ground. This is the most popular action movie ever made and one of the most cheerful too. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
