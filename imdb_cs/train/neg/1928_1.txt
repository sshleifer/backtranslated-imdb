As Grinch Stole Christmas was a beautiful little Christmas cartoon that someone could easily enjoy, I never saw a reason for a remake. Not to mention the remake that was created with people, the cartoon was simply perfect, what is the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a bit weird that Jim Carrey was Grinch. I think he's a great comedy actor, but he like Grinch? It just did not make sense to me. His performance was a little over the top, and he was inadvertently mixed in moments. Not to mention that one of the dialogs added was a bit childish and was not pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou - which was done and was not needed. In fact, they just destroyed the story, the period. Everyone in Whoville is preparing for his best Christmas season, and yet everything is supposed to be perfect. But Cindy Lou - Who is curious and old about Grinch, who lives above them and that he will not get as good for Christmas as good for others. He throws it out and decides he does not want Christmas this year, and that in fact he should only steal Christmas together to show who his version of Christmas is. But he soon realizes that who can know it's a little more than what is the materialized version of Christmas. How Grinch Stole Christmas was not needed and was a little over the top. I really recommend that you stick to the cartoon just because it's a very worrying version, at least in my opinion. Making and presenting the whole movie was just a little more, not to mention how Grinch Stole Christmas! was more wanted to be like a cartoon rather than the version to play Jim Carry. But at least this version owes you to the Boris Karloff version, which is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
