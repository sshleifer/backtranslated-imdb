Poor will could change to his grave if he could have this horrible German-TV adaptation of his classic play. It is obvious that very little money was spent on it. A permanent riser, a pier and some randomly placed columns leave as a set. The film was inadvertently dubbed into English, with English voice actors occasionally muttering their lines. All production had an incredibly dark and sad feeling. And where was the movie Fonterbras in this movie? The MST3K gave this excused production the treatment he deserved. <br /> <br /> Be or not? I wish this movie never came first.
