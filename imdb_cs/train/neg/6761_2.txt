Let's be honest. As a film school project that takes place without budget and "real" actors, this is an interesting film. Like something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it's a very poorly produced product. If I tirelessly changed the channels and accidentally caught the film, it would probably stop my eye and attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I have a suitable film product, that is, a movie, I feel deeply disappointed. It's a videotape television game, something along the lines of the sixties, but without a certain spell. Besides the head of Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors are either the boys from the campus (a bit too old for it), or the members of the director's household who appear in front of the camera without any help not only from the actor's cafes, but also make-up or hairdresser (the hood over the dominant permanent bangs or the top hat over the parmigiano is a very long way from the creation of 1840). Everything is shot using a camera mounted in a small, bare studio, sometimes with a blue screen for an outdoor environment. The synthesizer generated an uninitiated score of the lame "period" inspired by romantic karaoke offending audience ears more than once. The movie is trying to be "dreamlike," while in reality it's just a nonconceptual collage of those shots that have become part of the editing (and believe me the norms were not too high before it started). Sometimes they are interesting dialogues, but overall it is a nice and two-dimensional production in more than one way without the genius flashes of either the director or the crew. So "art" movies were trying to look like in the 1980s. Mr. Redfield is doing a much better job than an actor than a director.
