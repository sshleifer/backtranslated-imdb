Marc De Sade, Egypt, ancient gnostic culture, Robert Englund in a double role, carefree sex and nudity, murder and chaos ... on paper The Hopper night terrors sound like it should be at least fun, fun filming with ingredients. It is not. This is a less conspiratorial, incoherent jingle that brings little fun. Basically, there is no plot that overlaps some unclear things about the cult that follows De Sade, who for the unclear reason felt the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That's quite a bit - I think he has something to do with Gnostics, but who knows what the writers mean. Most of the film is a crazy mess because the heroine is exposed to various peculiarities, dream sequences, and erotic encounters that engage Englund's scenes as detained by De Sade in the 19th century to chew the scenery. The creators seem to have tried something serious, but regardless of their claims, they were buried in cheese, ill-acting, dirty and fake-looking heads. Robert Englund is fun to watch as ever and leading actress, Zoe Trilling, though not very talented, is attractive and at various stages of stripping in the movie, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I've seen a film from which came the movie "When You're the Criminist Like Me" from the Australian Film Certification Assessment Guide, which was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the 1990s.
