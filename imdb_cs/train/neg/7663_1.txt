Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a businessman with dollars Konstantin and Stephen Dorff as ... and it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR SAKE CROSSING !!!! I personally just want to thank these great directors for their hard work and effort. You guys are. Heres the idea, just my humble low opinions as a film with the public but it directly follows your previous decision, the film about the most brilliant neurophysics in history to devise one pill to heal all the diseases ever known to man and get it, heres the piano must play by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you'd love to. You really owe me $ 7.50.
