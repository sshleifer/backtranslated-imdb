This so-called prequel is just a bad remake to a better version of Dangerous Liasons. Plots are identical to most scenarios. I loved a book that came out of it, and I loved the first film, but I will not bother the third movie either. The unnecessary knit between the two main characters in the prequel was utterly predictable and vague and ... I just can not stress how bad the movie was. If you do not want to talk about it, just look at it and see what I mean. If you've read a review that says "If you like the first one, you'll like the other," the only reason is because it's exactly the same movie! Even though the plot is not that good. They've taken so many rows since the first movie, It's hard to tell which movie you're watching.
