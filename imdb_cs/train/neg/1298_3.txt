Sogo Ishii may be an experienced filmmaker under the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of the warrior monk and his only rival Genji clan. Film production has the main characteristics of low-cost production, including blurred combat scenes and clumsy assemblies (a kind that you might find in unfinished dreams). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual master that his destiny lies in the defeat of the mysterious spirit that guards the Gojoe bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will bring him into conflict with almost every element of society at that time - he could receive enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There is no ambition, however, in the display of the conflict between the saint and the secular. Art blossoms in some photographs and adjusts the help to compensate for the free movie style. <br /> <br /> Disappointment.
