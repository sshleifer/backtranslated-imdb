... but a miserable movie. Maltin says it was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. Well, that's serious ... seriously! The plot is stupid and slow (something about the aged who inhabit the bodies of little children to achieve immortality) ... the film is all talking talking talk talking talk talking talking about the same things over and over again. Actually, I beat a few times! The film is so bad! Casting this subject apart from Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably the work of love for both (often complaining that horror films are too violent ... well, this is NOT violence!). Avoid at all costs ... if you do not have insomnia ... it will give you sleep!
