The film has a good start to show Shannon Lee's interesting and powerful, and in the first half he will present two very sympathetic characters. But later, something happens, and Shannon suddenly turns to this straight face, the other hand to a bad girl, and the film is lost in its own context. The other half lacks any charisma and is full of clich√©s, misconduct, terrible conspiracy, and even worse coordination of stuntmen. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the Chechen Mafia. <br /> <br /> "Death 2" was a bad and cloned Bruce, but his daughter made it even more embarrassing than herself twice than Bruce Lee played at that time. I really believe he can do much better than this, and I hope he will make better production next year. If you are a real fan of hard major events and do not care about quality, go ahead and see this movie. I personally enjoyed it, but I was very disappointed.
