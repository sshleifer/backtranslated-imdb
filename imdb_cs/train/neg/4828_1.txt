From the library, I picked up TRAN SCAN and brought him home. We were thinking of the way east, and we thought it would make us feel what it was like. The film was a complete waste of time if I went to buy it, I would say TRAN SCAM when I found it worth $ 49. The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a rollercoaster ride across Canada with my belly feeling that wrong as they went up and down and around the curve with the film at high speed. There were plenty of shots you probably shot at, and you would think they could have made a better product. If I wanted to make this project, I would like to provide further shots, stop on road signs so people know where they are and stay in place to see the scene. To make such a movie it should be 60 to 90 minutes. Oh, yes, the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a tingling sound from the accelerating sound of a car that could at least give music to it. If you want a good movie in Canada watch The Railrodder in the lead role of Buster Keton (the last film he shot) in this comedy film Buster Keaton gets on the Nova Scotia railway line and travels to British Columbia
