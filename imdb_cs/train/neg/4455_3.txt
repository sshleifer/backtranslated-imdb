Where to start? OK, do not compromise this movie to fight for the start - ridiculous. If it were even a patch on a fighting club, violence, blood, gore, etc. It would be much clearer and more realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory - which is much more realistic (and Danny Dyer's Nicholas Nickelby looks embarrassed). Sure, the story is pretty decent and the battle scenes are well choreographed - with a decent end that I could add. But the whole movie is poor, really poor. As people mentioned, the accents should not spoil the film - I do not agree - either with a simple filming mistake or with a lack of effort to coach the voices that caused the film to be irritating all the way - it was obvious from the scene that Geordie played a part. Do not get me a bad, good-looking guy who looks great with the head of the skin - but not a football hood. I could forever visit the ridiculous football scene - the situation of a "fake manager". Also, when GSE is about to play north, they're on the train and expect only three of them - it makes no sense - it's a real organization of gangsters and criminals that is portrayed in the movie as some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. As for accuracy - did not West Ham and Milwall participate in the championship for the past two years? Hmm, ten years fine. And I'm sure the "Bouch" would only be able to fly into the lover of a solid farm. A basically very poor film that will appeal to people if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you really love football, and you're going to take on the underworld of hooliganism, you'll feel as though this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
