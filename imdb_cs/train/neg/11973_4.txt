This is probably one of the worst French films I have ever seen among the more than 100 French films I've ever seen. A terrific scenario and a very medium / unprofessional acting cause directors to be powerless. with all that it does not matter how nice the western french scene and charming music can add to the story. One of the key weaknesses of this film is that these two characters DO NOT use people as an audience I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how this movie won the jury prize in canons, man, I love almost every award-winning canoe movie, but not this. Great disappointment for me.
