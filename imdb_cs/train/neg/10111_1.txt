Scary acting, bad story line, cheese make-up, and it's just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen a worse movie in my life, I've decided to go forwards for five minutes to find out if something is being redeemed ... No. (In addition to a nice breast splatter) The film was probably shot in some furniture store and the same store was used in at least 90% of the set. You can even see the same red chair in several different places. If you are going to make a film at least renting an office building and an apartment, not a warehouse that will reflect your actor's dialogue. (Note to the manufacturer) Small office space and apartment per month is much cheaper than the entire warehouse, and both are quite a bit more versatile and credible) If you spend your money to hire these people, I hope you get it with a return guarantee ... You will demand a refund ... I spent only $ 2.99 this evening, and I feel it is broken.
