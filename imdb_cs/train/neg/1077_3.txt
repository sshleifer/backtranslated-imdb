Have you ever heard that people "are telegraphing their intentions?" Well, in this movie, this character makes more than telegraph future plans - he will appear in your house drunk and calm you around your head. It could be forgiven if the settings were used better or if the characters were charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagh fails to make his character likely written. unmistakable characters and grotesque "southern" accents used by British actors.
