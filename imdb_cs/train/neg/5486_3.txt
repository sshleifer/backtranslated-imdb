First, this movie starts with a really silly note: A ten-year-old girl playing in a moving vehicle decides it would be fun to cover her mother's eyes with her hands and then cause a terrible accident that kills her mother .... duh .... sorry, there is a positive 10-year-old that stupid. The rest of the movie does not improve much. After the mother's death, according to the most prolific ten-year-old man on the planet, his father moves his family to Genoa, Italy, where he has to teach at a local university, but here he is sharp: he does not speak the Italian word! Then the little girl has a "vision" of her mother (whom she killed) and often the subsequent night's fears, which always ended when the father held and wedged her. Then we are forced to watch how this family is constantly lost and then it appears and then embraces it and then weeps and loses and then finds (followed, of course, by more traveled and weeping) to the extent that I actually wanted some natural disaster to clear all the unnecessary , ignorant people from the planet. Do not get me wrong because I like indies, but indie about fools (and I mean really stupid) is just ridiculous and futile. It is really a pity that this film was based on such impersonal practices that intersect in such slowed scenarios because the local environment was interesting.
