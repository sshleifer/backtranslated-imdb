hg is normally abused and never really bothered me - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudo-science or heuristic play. the entire film is based on an esp person caused by an electric accident and a witch. I'm not against the wizards, and I liked "carrie" (a novel and a film), but that bothered me. I think this is because the main character is esp from the electric line. also a university professor wasting his time studying esp cases. in the 1960s I was not alive to know first hand whether esp was a common mistake then, but I suppose that any such theory would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was the way the police described schizophrenia as ruthless, unpredictable villains, who 99% of the time can look like normal people and then they are just going to be. nothing could be further from the truth. I abuse such a concept because they add to the public idiot. many people still think schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. who wrote this script much did not know about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent film concepts. I liked how a witch used a man; it was a nice change. I liked how she could become attractive, but she did not do it when she was around her forced lovers. I wondered how her other lover also burned his face. if the screenplay was touched a few weeks before production and was not aimed solely at making its audience happen, it could be a decent film.
