I'm a big fan of the television series Largo Winch. This movie was pain for me. I had to use it quickly to avoid sleeping. It was boring! How can anyone destroy this title so much? The story was the only good thing. Actors were shadows. They can not live this role. The main actor (Tom ...) is zero. See the other roles of this actor. The combat scenes were incredibly boring and not traceable, somehow they were not able to follow the situation. Just like other reviewers, they listed a low-budget film with bad actors. Maybe next time someone else can do a better job of this title. Frenchmen can not do the right thing with big movies like Alien 4. It was a bit brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.
