You can often say that the film did not match, as if it were a heavy use of a narrator. This movie is part of this device. Richard Jobson is not entirely content to write directly and even fund some of the film adds to his credits by reading excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical writing which in combination with some nice editing can hide what is a blunt, depressing tale that must to be mistaken for an original art house. Kevin McKidd gives a good performance. Everyone else is all right. Budgetary constraints meant that all scenes are filmed in daylight, although most of them are of course at night, even though you know that serious alcoholics work mainly in the day, so it gives me a touch of realism for me. The funniest part of this film is a waitress who can not age a single day in 20 odd years between their performances - the more extreme version of McKidd's problem who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
