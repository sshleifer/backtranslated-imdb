The coming attractions on the "Ceremony" make him a decent horror secretary / thriller, but what we have is a plot that has the potential to be excellent all gathered and to form a pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> First, the whole movie consists of a terrible dialogue and God's special disability. There was nothing we could be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I wrote it right.) He saved the movie in this category. For heaven: DO NOT KNOW THIS FILM!
