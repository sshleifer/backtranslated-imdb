This movie has no graph and no focus. Yes, it was a slap-stick, a stupid comedy, but the screenwriters have no idea what the film is about. Even the title does not agree with the movie. It should be called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. Characters are not developed and nobody cares what happens to them! The girl roommate figure (from the 70th year of the show) was the only person to be worth the attention. She was cheerful and stole every scene she was in. Others need to make sure that their diplomas are in work because they will need a career other than playing.
