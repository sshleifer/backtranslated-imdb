Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York City by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn), and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to take him and make sure he does not get vicious goldsmiths. One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the scene to disagree with women. We are following the story because girls are offered more money than they appear at the show, instead of their escort role they agree to take place in three months when Bill is in New York while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. In the end is love in the air for Bill and others ............. <br /> <br /> The quality of the picture and sound quality are bad in this movie. The story is scattered by musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not that good either. It's so nice, but it just really comes alive when playing drums or trombone. There is a very irritating character that plays the cab driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is just boring.
