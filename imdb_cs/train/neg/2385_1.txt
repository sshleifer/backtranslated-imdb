I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd try my sister, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry to try it. It was embarrassing and the movie has this strange plot, if you mean it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits in the toilet, sleeping with this old man in the mountains, what's up? In my life I was never so dissatisfied. It was just waste. I can not believe that the actors agreed to such a loss of film, money, time and space. Sissy is "beautiful" when I did not get it. I thought it was all, besides. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if he can stop? WHAT IS THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame that the vote does not have 0, not even deserve 1. Hopefully Rain is better in other movies, I forgive her for this performance, I think that with this movie it would not be much better.
