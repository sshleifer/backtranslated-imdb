I just can not see how the movie Concorde-New Horizons director Jim Wynorski and Andrew Stevens's acting actor and puppet may be bad. It just upsets the mind, does not it? Well, we do not think so. "Munchie Strikes Back" is really a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has been for centuries. For reasons not fully explained to the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a free mother and her son. The mother's problem (at least her main problem) is that she has two months of paid balloon payment on her mortgage ... for a tiny melody of $ 20,000. Ouch. She can not come up with money because she just fired. OK ... JUST is the keyword in that sentence. What ...? Would she have to pay her for a single postage fee? Perhaps it would be a good idea that you spent the last few years saving it for ... you think? Munchie has magical powers similar to those the genie should have ... but there is no limit to the number of wishes you can do! Munchie gets the boy a lot of fancy things for one night, but then the child asks for him to be sent back to the shopping center that Munchie "borrowed". An unpleasant furball also uses his skills from another world to help the boys win the baseball game by cheating. Baseball is hit hard enough to revolve around Earth a few times. It's sad that stupid parents watching the game do not think it's strange. Hmm. Anyway, I'd like to wrap this up, because it's been so far I've exhausted enough life force. You will actually be absorbed by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down plays mother, kicks a dog that nods her. Your heart will melt away for her charm when she notices that the dollar bills go down to the front yard and she's wondering how it can snow in the summer. The success of Munchie Strikes Back promised another film, which in my opinion follows the "Munchie Hangs Ten". To date, watching public movies has been robbed of what would definitely be a film tour de force. Hey. 1/10
