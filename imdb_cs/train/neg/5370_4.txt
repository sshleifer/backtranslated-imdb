Råson is a terrible movie! It's so simple. They seem to have been trying to make a movie that would show the life of the reel. Just like Zappa did many years ago. Unfortunately, Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon is still a small girl in "krummernes Jul", and Laura just is not good enough to play such an important role. Several times in the movie he plays with the soul and it is to destroy the movie! Even though I think this is a movie you should see. I do not agree that young people behave like this, but I think they can show how it can end if you leave your child on the left. It is also important to promote Danish films and new companies such as "Film Folk"! <br /> <br /> I think people should see Råson. Not because it's a great movie, but because it's a movie that deals with important themes. I also think it is important to emphasize that there are some violent scenes in it, and in fact it is in these scenes, Laura is the best. - like the end where he holds the gun!
