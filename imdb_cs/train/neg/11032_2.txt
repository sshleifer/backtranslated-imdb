"I Love New York" is another VH-1 entry (MTV Networks), which shows the fun page of dating a grumpy, uncomfortable woman. It had to be an easy decision to take the wildest, loudest speakers of Ebona, the wildest contestant-and her mother-and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, "It's a show". That's true, it's not as bad as the previous show, "Love's Love," but it's just as bad. It reminds me of the 90th year of "In Living Color," where Keenan Ivory Wayans was the imitation of boxer Mike Tyson at the "The Love Connection" dating show and he chose "Robin Givens" on a date. Mike talked about how well it was, but how the unsuccessful mother is always leaning. This show reminds me of it. The men are picked and given names to get worse and the woman they are dating more - (I would think the intelligent man who is looking for an intelligent woman to date would not allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you will be bothered every time you appear on television.) professional reality actors, so why bother. <br /> <br /> Escape misses me when I find out what's so fun. That it's as fake as her newly implanted accessories? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising time for the network? (Well, you can not hate them because you're trying to make money.) Maybe it's a miracle - who would want to be with the woman in an hour? Or are you wondering if her mother's next show will be at WWF! Whatever you say, it's the train crash you've seen countless times before, so the shock value is no longer scratch. No twist or turn will cause it to be a more interesting wreck on a train or other than any other. It refers to the smallest common denominator, and for those who call the "end" of reality, it's just another nail in the coffin, why they should end immediately.
