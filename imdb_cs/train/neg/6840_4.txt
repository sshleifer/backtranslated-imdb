While this trip definitely does not meet its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, right after he wasted the city block with his "Videodisk Cannon", we see close up of Nimoy's face. As the only tear left from the left eye, we know at that moment that Nimoy is more than just a killer. The viewer can not help but be drawn into his emotional turbulence and we realize that his former flat influence was only a facade. Absolute brilliance !!! Sexual scenes show a pleasant balance, physical, but not pornographic. Then I felt I had a pretty good idea of ​​how to work with Magnavision Videodisc Player. It's a shame they have not produced them for more than 25 years.
