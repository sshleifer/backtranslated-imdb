Ashley Judd, in the early role, and I think her first starry role shows her true rebellious character in this slowly moving feminist soap opera. Wow, this is a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? For being a real feminist in real life, this scenario must be serious. No wonder the critic Roger Ebert of the Left Wing loved this film; it's also on the political aisle. Unlike the reviewers here, I'm glad that Judd was getting out of this crazy fool for better roles in the movies they enjoyed, not preaching about the heavy liberal politics.
