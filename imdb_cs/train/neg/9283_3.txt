I do not know how this movie has received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big fan of vonnegut and I'm very familiar with the story of this original Showtime movie bastardized through faith, but even if I was not, bad acting, very bad casting (Sean Astin as brilliant, athletic and all around, Harrison, that guy is quite generic! substandard writing made it barely observable. Someone pointed to the cute line of Maculay Culkin. If you read it and you thought it was pure comic brilliance (sadly, it was probably the most intelligent part of the movie), maybe you will enjoy this movie. But if you are a fan of Vonnegut or not quite mad, you do not see him. Please.
