I and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. First acting ... wow ... acting was the worst, the effects were also really bad, it seemed like a film that was made as a college student. The conspiracy was pretty good, but it was done. The thing that destroyed the movies was the actors. The main boy was the worst actor at all ... it's a shame, I even call him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad that it was funny ... so if you want to laugh good to see it. ... but otherwise than ... stay away from this. I usually love B playlists and such, but this ... I do not know how it was handed over to even get a video ... this is the worst I've seen ... and I've seen some bad ones.
