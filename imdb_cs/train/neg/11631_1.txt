Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. Hollywood produced films based on one of the darkest days of our nation. Everything changed. It changed our perception of security. It has changed our understanding of the evil of man and mankind. And what is most important and devastating, it has changed our world. But I can not emphasize how utterly alienated, disillusioned and angry that I am on the careless and obvious Hollywood ignorance that seeks to earn a lucrative gain from death and destruction. This film and those who resemble it will have to spark a dispute between audiences and critics; which will surely repeat the traditional press. Hollywood sank to a new level. Even less than fools who have committed the most barbaric acts of wildness and relentless cruelty. Beyond that is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry about this movie. How do they dare not respect memories of lost families? How dare they laugh at the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those who find themselves in the damned towers on that fateful day of shame? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time earn on the national tragedy in the mist of the sad and tired post-911 world?!!!!! How ... laugh ... they? <br /> <br /> Those who have anger to even think about seeing this morally awful travesty, I say with a hard heart with all my might: Remember. Think back on that day and ask yourself if you are a normal and moral person. Remember that day, ask yourself if this film is shameful and disgraced to the lost lives of that day. Think back on that day of crying loved families. Think about the day of life lost on these two planes. Think of the next massacre after the attack. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think about it. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost in 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
