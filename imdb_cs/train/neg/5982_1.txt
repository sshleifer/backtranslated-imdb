I'm sorry to say so, but "Thunderbirds" does not come out with loud popp, nor do thunder. At one stage, I seriously considered going out of the cinema, I remained in the desperate hope that the film could improve. I was disappointed, it was not better, it was worse, if at all possible. If I looked at the film with the idea that it was a "spoof", I would have left it. They had a great opportunity to create a great franchise of films here, but they were completely exhausted. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have the names attached to this movie and Jonathan Frakes well, what I can say he should be embarrassed and ashamed to be far from the truth. I saw this movie on a show, I expected to see it most eagerly when I grew up in the 1960s with the original shows. To say I was disappointed would be something undervalued. One last thing to say about the film was that the puppets in the television shows were just a little wooden than they were in the movie.
