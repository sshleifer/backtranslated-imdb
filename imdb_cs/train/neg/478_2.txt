The Warner Bros. War Worst Kay Francis is stiff. I only saw eight, but the comet on Broadway is still the worst. The best thing is that it's short. Oh, and orly-kelly dresses (of course) are all right. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis looks all over the body and is much less attractive than usual. Minna Gombell, which I do not know otherwise, is good as a semi-tough "burlesque" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The final shot - Kay Francis and her baby (when the baby learned that Kay Francis was her mother? I shot it?) Driving the dirty path towards the prison painted in the misty contours on the sound stage is beyond the absurd. The whole movie is so inexpensive, so unlikely and so carefree that it feels infected by sour cynicism by anyone who did it: Warner Bros. throwing garbage on crowds they do not know, in the cynical estimate of Warner Bros. that what they get is waste.
