I love watching early color films - do you think the 40's dress was not gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. Her "eccentric" apparel is really more attractive and yes, she has an incredible hourglass figure. But I feel she got her head too much. She probably developed this characterization on many performances and nobody said, "If it laughs, leave it out." She makes it too frighteningly foolish to be surprisingly down on the ground. Madame Arcati's joke is that the media were usually portrayed as gloomy women with long curtains. Arcati behaves like a retired retired (we'll really get back!). The contrast between her wind, the usual way and her crazy faith is not really drawn. Just because all the actors are English (except for Cummings), Americans feel they have to use the words "Brit", "Hard", "Lips" and "Upper". Oh, rest! The three main characters are constantly losing their mood and making remarkable remarks (Did he love you? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).
