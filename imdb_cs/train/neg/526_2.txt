It's nearly as boring as to read how to read that evening is a beautifully produced failure ... until Meryl Streep enters and silently tells its other members cast how to deal with such things. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking in her role as dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire were to change their role, we could see the life of Young Anne, which gave her a story in the distinct world of the story, and we could imagine that the older Ann was actually dying. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that adding Michael Cunningham to written credits would wipe out embarrassing narratives, but unfortunately. That caused me headaches.
