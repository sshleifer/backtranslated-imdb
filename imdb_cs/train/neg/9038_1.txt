It's a terrible production of Bartleby, though not as another reviewer put it, because it's "almost", but rather because this version does not preserve the spirit of the book. She tells the story, almost so painfully. I watch it, I can turn the pages in my book and follow it, which is not so fun when it comes to adaptation. Rather look at the Bartleba version of 2001 with Crispin Glover. This version, though humorous, brings the film new details while preserving the spirit of the novel. Ghost is important, not an ingredient of things like setting, character names, and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, tiring and cheerful. This version is a lesson on what may seem wrong when adaptation is treated poorly, painful, seizures.
