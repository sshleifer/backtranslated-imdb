I am a huge fan of war films and as Vietnam Veterinary Veterinarian you have some experience with technical details. I've been working with the bombs several times, and I have nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians and especially veterans from Iraq have summarized the inaccuracies in this film very well. A poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a fantasy fantasy, and that's why it fails badly. No bomb removal unit or unit would ever tolerate this dishonest operator for more than 5 minutes. Military troops agree on things and discipline because of saving lives. The opening scene has bothered me mainly. The guy with the cell phone would be shot dead immediately. Screaming, "Stopping the election" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse. Snapshot scenes were particularly enormous. As others have noted, your average EOD guy does not know the Jack about the sniper and think any Arab sniper is so good that he really augments imagination. The kidnapping of an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge would not happen. Someone might shoot him, but this kind of risk is limited to movies. I could go on, but, as I said, the other things have been shown in detail. It's not a good movie, and if it's worth winning, it's another reflection of why La La Land is called.
