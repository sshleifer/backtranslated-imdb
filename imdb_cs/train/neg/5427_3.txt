A typical Gothic cat (Rainbow Harvest looks like the cross between Winon Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) even happens to people who feel that they hurt her with the old scary mirror he finds in a new home with his mother (Karen Black horror, the only one remotely good thing about this travesti) to buy. Efficiency is pretty ridiculously bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the above-mentioned mirror) and there is no fear or tension. This film inexplicably multiplied for three sequels, each of which was somewhat harsher than last. People who are looking for a similar, but much better film effort should only look at the episode "Friday 13: Series," where the girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. This reduces the cold in its 40 minutes than the whole franchise has provided through its 4 films. My Grade: D Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling Provides Mandatory T & A
