One more early film by Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to have been contractual obligations. Like Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this film. There is almost no style or craft. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple who will come to some money and go on a cruise that has proven to be the test of their marriage. Emily has a chance for a new life with a good heart, a rich man who falls in love with her but definitely takes a high road and stay with her husband. That might seem more credible if Fred was not to be a totally insensitive, pompous ass who jumps on the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. The couple ends and stays together, but the film has no real conciliatory scene. The third act goes completely different, with the couple stranded on a deserted ship and rescued an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very thoughtful performance as a faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. That's all you can tell him.
