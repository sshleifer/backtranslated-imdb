<br /> <br /> "Did the veterans come from Hollywood?" (as the brothers "asked") that's what Hollyweird demanded and what he has. However, like so many of his recent decisions, this was a terrible mistake. The director is out of touch with today's audience, attempting to return physical pratfalls and gags to a place of fun dialogue is just a disaster. I knew that, the audience knew it, and CAST knew that. What a shame, why did they ever think about changing the directors? Not only that, but two Wayan brothers played as two of the four basic characters, without them it's just a farce and sad. SP <br /> <br />
