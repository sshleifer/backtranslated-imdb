This movie was bad at first. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a high number of bodies. The game was terrible. The murders were very bad. Like when Ally got the toilet, I think it was in an abandoned cottage. But when the end of the movie comes and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin, you see Ally for Angela to get in and get her. The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin, and Angela took the guitar cord and pressed it. One was a terrible actress and two, why would not you just turn around and hurt the whores?!?!? Then, when Molly is chasing Angela, if you have a neighbor, why not just turn and stab her ??? So stupid. This film sucks ...
