This film is a vehicle for clone Alexander Schwarzenegger Nevsky. His charisma, however, is not enough to raise this film above the level of bad scenario. He has little to do with his Arnie-act. Michael York is quite pathetic as a diplomat. Watching that his D'Artagnan act had been repeated since he was a better actor, I felt restless. Come on, you can do better! The story is full of holes and inexplicable relationships; the top of this law is the informant of Vlad, who sounds like an American woman, but seems to work from the context for the Russian government. <br /> <br /> Even though the story takes place well after the Communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vlad is entitled to drive the vehicle as a police force. Action scenes are poorly recorded and therefore lack dynamics. <br /> <br /> No need to see the movie ...
