The original series of Lensman novels is the classic of the genre. It's a pure SF adventure with some substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood made it literally because it's just the kind of thing they like: massive explosions, super-weapons, uber-heroics, the hero gets the girl , the extraterrestrials (great potential of CGI), good versus evil in the purest form, etc. Instead (and remember that I am a Japanese Filipino and Anime Lover), we get this horrible childhood movie, a story that mixes in star wars (ironically, when some of them sometimes broke the book), pastiches and fools the whole thing to the level of "Thundercats". To see Kimball Kinnison, the incarnation of the Galactic Police Officer and the second stage Lensman portrayed as a little boy is pitiful (etc.). I can not understand why the producers did it because they probably had a story and could make a lot more money (FAR!) By saying straight. It makes no sense.
