"Maladolescenza" has the atmosphere of a dark tale, its children's protagonists, the forest environment and the discovery of castle ruins. Still, it is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. He opens with a dreamlike process in which he works with the ruthless metaphor Fabrizia to wrestle with his menacing hound, film in detail his psychological pursuit of Laura, the girl who promised her love for him, and his possible romance with the equally damning Sylvia. The philosophical complexity of the film gives movie credits, yet there is no doubt about how unnecessarily abusing the film in its imagination of nudity and sex. The film's appearance lies more in its beautiful places rather than on specific cinematographic skills, and there is no doubt that the greatest benefit of the film is the scary children's choir sound. With his strange dreamlike character, the film is most interesting, yet fades beside the surrealistic and brilliant "Black Moon" Louis Malle of the same time. We certainly deserve a debate about art versus pornography, because, unlike many forbidden films such as Pasolini's "Salo" or "Ken Park" Larry Clarke, the film from an artistic perspective is rather insurmountable. It seems that the cinema is gradually losing the ability to shock, so perhaps it should be admired by the "Maladolescenza" for preserving this power thirty years after its release. The value of shock, however, is the only reason why the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has its defenders. Nazism is the same.
