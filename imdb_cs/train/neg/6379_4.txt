With movies called "Gayniggery from Space", how could you go wrong? Just throw some of the highest stereotypes of the character, use Village People as the main contractor of soundtracks and throw a ton of gays. Plot is not important. It is a shame that this film does not contain anything and that every joke is lacking. All the characters look similar to the German gaynigger, one or two jokes work, others have lost. The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh even more about the movie. My expectations were obviously high.
