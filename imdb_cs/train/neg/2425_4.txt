### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What is a movie movie? Outside of control editing and cinematography, which corresponds to a terrible plot. It is sad to see that the talent of Denzel Washington wasted in ways like this one. We have certainly indicated how the Mexicans can not save themselves, they need external forces, perhaps militaristic, American. And we know that my father has a shadowy nature is, after all, Mexican, unlike a woman who honors Creusey more because he is an American. He killed everyone when he thought he had died. And she? Of course not, it's a little kid and you should not hurt the feelings of a Hollywood fan. The only thing that prevents me from evaluating it under "Unlikely Success" (as some critics have pointed out) Taken. The nagging of such films will take a while. In reviewing these films, we must question the credibility of IMDb.7.7 for such a film and 7.0 for our own private Idaho. Go find out! The mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
