What a fantastic premise: a film about Berlin air transport. It should have everything. Tragedy. Tension. Camaraderie. Opponents. Berliner Frauleins and hard American pilots. love and tears. What we have is a movie with none of the above. Heino Ferch is trying to assume John Wayne or not, but he's unfortunately failing. It's so wooden that it should burst at every moment. He's trying to play a hard guy instead of being a hard man! Why would Bettina Zimmermann fall in love with him? Because they were throwing stones in the lake? Because it brings its coal? SFX are very, very well done. Too much. Hundreds or so planes over Berlin look more like assault aircraft, not organized air transport? how it was. Interestingly, the White House office, the Kremlin and General Lucius D. Clays appear to be all the same dark and dusty sets. Notice the same curtains hanging deep into the windows as if it were a shield against a nuclear fallout. Why are almost all the scenes inside dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY encounters a little time, an uncertain, looser general who believes in his own noble idea of ​​air transport. It was quite the opposite. So you combine all these individual mistakes, and the result is a film that focuses on no passion, no tension, no historical precision. Sad, has it started so promising?
