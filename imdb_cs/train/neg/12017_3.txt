I'm a big fan of Ludlum's work and Covert-a, and I often thought how incredible they would be filmed. Imagine excitement when you learn that such a movie really existed! The "Hades Factor," the first in the series, seemed to be an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the film was disappointing. Simple elements of the film, such as the first Griffin encounter with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and far less exciting. Several characters are also badly busy. To begin with, Dorff is sad as Smith. It's not a bad actor, it's an incredibly bad choice because it's too soft and does not have many features that are the definitions of John Smith. <br /> <br /> Ripping, shifting and even omitting some characters further delineates this movie. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire recount of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the film somewhat confused. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and many rear seats on the seat (not to mention that the character has nothing to do with the character in the book) is another big mistake. <br /> Rachel Russel is supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. It's not just Sophie Amsden's sister (she should be called Sophia Russell), but she also works from the CIA, not "Covert-one". Which brings me to my last point and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not exist at this time! Only in the second book of the series is Covert-One, which the President has proposed as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. To be honest, I can go all day. In short - if you like books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you will be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action movie it is thoroughly mediocre, mainly because of too little luster and bad effects. A shortened story line and a drinking water scenario are the last nails in a very cheap coffin of this film.
