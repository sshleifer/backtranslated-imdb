I often read my review before I watch the movie. Guess what I did not do before I watched the TLB and I must say that I was very surprised to see the above-average IMDb rating. I find that he has a complete lack of a story. Just to get it (and sadly, it's not the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie), and it has a sudden end, which I was not very satisfied with. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the wounded soldiers looked quite realistic, especially with a low budget in mind. But get ready to laugh ... Some boys are fired by the air as if they were Olympic gymnasts. The center air corkscrew or sommerie during World War I is a little too much for me, especially when it's a lot of times during the movie ... But those parts that really got me laughing when I almost called out were close-up scenes. Screaming and shouting of German voices ... incredibly funny. It looks as if only one actor / vocal artist talked to them because they all sounded exactly the same and it sounds like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> Anyone except the people who want to laugh because of the sad and frantic quality.
