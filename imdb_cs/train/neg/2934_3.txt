Simon Pegg starring as Sidney Young, a stereotypically clumsy idiot Brit working as a celebrity journalist in this American comedy. After receiving a very happy break, he began working on a highly respected Sharps magazine run reliably on the Jeff Bridges form in New York. It's more, the Devil wears Prada than the Shaun of the dead. Unlikely interest in love is provided by Kirsten Dunst, who works with Pegge with a smile, but does not fit his passion on the screen. Sidney is going through some emotional problems, and at the same time tries to decide whether to forget about her journalistic principles to get the material in the magazine. Of course, he eventually raised the glitter and spell of the celebrity world, especially young star Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). Hot Fuzz and Spaced fans will ask if Pegg himself has appeared with this movie similar to real-life feelings and to some extent run Run Fat Boy Run as one of Britain's finest comic talents that destroyed the United States. /> <br /> It's a forgettable comedy in all. Please come back to Simon, we can forgive and forgive.
