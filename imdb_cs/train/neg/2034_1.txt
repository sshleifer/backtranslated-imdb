Really, really bad. How's the movie doing wrong? I still waited for a redeemed point of conspiracy, interesting camera work or at least for free nudity, but I did not have anything. I just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was the wreck of the train (except Nudes and Pancakes), but it looks like a genius compared to this stroke. The best skeptic doctor in the world could not save this nasty pile of poisonous poo. <br /> <br /> The only thing that's going on for this movie is that it's over. <br /> <br /> I have headaches just about this movie and I'm trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid only $ 5 for it, and soon it will end up in the landfill.
