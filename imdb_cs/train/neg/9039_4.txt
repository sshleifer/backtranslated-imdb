I think it's a noble effort but ultimately a poor one. Before I saw this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was powerless. After what I saw, I still do. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and will be disturbed by the unnecessary revisions of the film (updates from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even the outstanding talent of Paul Scofield can not save what seems to me to be a meaningful but misleading attempt to make Melville's metaphysical classics.
