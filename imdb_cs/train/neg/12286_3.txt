The summary provided by my cable television guide made it sound more interesting than it actually did. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror film I've ever seen, the title previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From the opening scene, I can say that it will be really bad, but I was bored that I did not. This movie contains ridiculous acting, especially the one he's dreaded in dreams, unbelievable, like in the untrustworthy plot of the plot, and one of the smartest music I've heard, and I live in a time when Britney Spears and Nsync control the air waves . The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not funny. One would be the film so boring and boring, and so not scary, because it would try to add something to a bit of funny lines, but not. We have a Tormented Guy ego-friend who is trying to be funny, but he has come across an unpleasant one. (spoiler) And please tell me who in this crazy world is crazy and confident enough to visit a scary prison in the middle of the night? Nobody! If you do a horror film, do it at least as a matter of course. This is nothing else.
