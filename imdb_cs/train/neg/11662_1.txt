I still do not write comments but I only needed to warn someone who might think that by watching it, they will see a comedy. That's coming. While the premise (change of color / gender / anything) is bad enough (and has already been done, many times before), the real transformation of two black boys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever seen on the screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required by the scenario was a change of white chickens. But Wayans brothers must conceal themselves as two concrete white women. As you have already guessed, they fail completely. I saw expensive queens without makeup to make more convincing women than these two, with the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can provide. It's scary. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, horrible dialogue and plot of holes than a golf course, and this film will come across a new personal minimum. And I love bad movies! Avoid the plague.
