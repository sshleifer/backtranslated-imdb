I was hoping that this film would be fun, just like other genres. But it was lame and I did not find myself laughing very much. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rental to waste and you need a movie to take the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> This plot is simple and straightforward, and it could be funny, maybe if the script was better. Jason Lee can be cheerful and a few laughs here and there, but the film falls. Just do not look. Directing is insignificant, but for what it is, overhead is not so important. I think his main disadvantage is that it just is not that much fun. Look at something else, do not waste time here.
