Italian and American co-productions together with Linda Blair and David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff: How could a fan of terrorist resistance resist such treatment? Well, based on ruthless, extremely dull, and absolutely meaningless first forty minutes, I would say "very easily"; Fortunately, things will eventually get somewhat more fun with the introduction of several deadly death scenarios and for those who are lucky enough to find an uncut copy, even a nudity of nudity (unfortunately, my description was optically adapted to remove such offensive material). Hoff stars like Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) into a "run-down" hotel on a seemingly abandoned island to take photos for her latest project, The Witch Book; while there, frustrated Gary also hopes to try to cure the bad case of a blue ball by relieving Leslie of her virginity. His plans for the nookie are exhausted by the unexpected arrival of developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), Tommy's son (Michael Manchester), pretty nymphoman architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) hotel island. After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by new owners of the property, and when a violent storm suddenly rises, so it is dangerous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, the hotel guests are also home to the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef), which requires human sacrifices to come back to life. One by one, the victims are drawn into the whirling red faith (which guarantees unintentional laughter) before they encounter a terrible fate. None of this makes sense and the acting is unsuccessful (Manchester because Tommy is particularly bad while Hasselhoff appears to be one of the best performers talking about others), but viewers who make it a terrible first half are rewarded with several nice moments gore: Rose has his stitched lips together before he feels in the fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured and hooked on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulse and explode in blood geysers; and Gary is stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy without lips and Blair gets obsessed (again).
