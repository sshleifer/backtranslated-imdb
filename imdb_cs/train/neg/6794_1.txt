Friday 13th Step! Officially there is a worse movie than your hate series. I was winning this movie in a college competition and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones plays like a really horrible singer trying to find some assassins or something. At least on the thirteenth Friday he never bored me. I would like to have my nails pulled out to see it again.
