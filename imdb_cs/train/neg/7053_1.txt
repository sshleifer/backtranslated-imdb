Well promos promised comedy and people (just a few) went to watch it Being the first edition of 2006 is not a bad thing or for every thing since the first and last movies mostly flop except GHAJINI and others /> Okay comes to JAWANI DIWANI < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In short, the film is that Emraan Hashmi is doing his usual things unfortunately it's annoying this time after repetitions It has irritating Hrishita Bhatt and flop Celina Jaitley <br /> <br /> Crashworthy dialogues, comedy scenes and poor drama and lots of gaps. <br /> <br /> Direction is wrong Emraan Hashmi is annoying here, fortunately he's coming to the age But the post of FOOTPATH ​​and MURDER and some decent work in some other movies the actor took in the back seat and the directors focused on his kisses and a feminine image that unfortunately lost her touch after repetitions Hrishita and Celina are bad Mahesh is terrible
