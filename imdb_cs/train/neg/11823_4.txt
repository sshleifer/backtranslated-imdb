TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> In the late 19th century England young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to a public school in Rugby where he is undergoing the reform of a radical new director (Stephen Fry) and will stand up to the young boy who lives at school, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). (most remarkably the best version of Gordon Parry in 1951) - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel gets treatment for the early 21st century courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoaha and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is so pleasant and attentive but also rather stationary and boring, characterized by Fry's sincere performance as a new director who is determined to remove some of the most dubious "tradition" of the school and the introduction of a new star in a 14-year-old Pettyfer, a talented child with such a carefree a spell and a living good look that should get him all the way to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, it is a typical British feed for feed, which is something preferred by managers who want to fill plans with the product of "prestige", even so incompletely. The publication of the British magazine, Radio Times, described it as "obviously weird" and raised annoying eyebrows over "all the blushing and brutality and the handsome, inconspicuous villain who tortured the life of sweet young boys." Quite.
