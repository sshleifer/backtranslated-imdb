One of, if not the worst, film that came out of Britain in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This dirty middle-aged story, which will "sweep away" two teen washing machines that do it, and his fake wife have nothing to redeem them. , frightening, disorganized and unrealistic, this film produces depths because it is unsuccessfully failing to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is how strong cast George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched with such a lame script. Not surprisingly, it was a late Andrea Dunbar's work to get to the screen. Complete and complete waste at each level.
