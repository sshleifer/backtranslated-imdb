Stanley Kramer directs action thriller and skips two main things: action and excitement. DOMINO PRINCIPLE states that Gene Hackman, as a prisoner, worked from prison to do some mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his agents - probably working for the government, but like most movie lines, it is never clear. Hackman asks for many questions that NEVER get the answer, so the movie is absolutely out of the question. While trying to be like NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, DOMINO PRINCIPLE combines ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is very well photographed, but it even works against it. Kramer's direction lacks any style. It's a very sunny movie! The game is fine because Hackman proves he is largely unable to be bad. Widmark and Wallach are well offended and Albert is well-liked as the cruel Widarm boy. Even the usually unpleasant Mickey Rooney is quite good as Hackman's sidekick. One particular feature is the distinction between Candice Bergen and Hackman's wife. They told us that she had spent time in prison and seems to be trying to get some kind of dusk in the south. Kramer's idea that she seems to be a trampoline is to wear a ugly brown wig. It is a role more suitable for fans like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
