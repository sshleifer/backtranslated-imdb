To summarize this movie: Without a real plot, this film consists of 80 minutes of scattered characters, whether drinking or making bad jokes. Music is just horrible, humor is not funny, and all female characters are stupid idiots or fools. It seems to me that the movie is actually written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks that drinking is fine, women are designed to please men and everything that is against it is geek. The film also has nothing to do with the original American Pie, other than a few, and Mr. Levenstein, who is a minor figure in that person. The only good thing about this movie is pretty looking girls. Do not look at this movie and do not be fooled by rating 5.4 because it obviously overestimates and does not deserve anything above 2.
