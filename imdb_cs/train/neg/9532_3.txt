So the guy named George is sitting at home on his birthday when two women appear. George's wife is in the hospital and cares about her son, so when her wife is gone, George gets into the bubble and loves both girls. It's not such a great scene because it really does not show anything. Then the birthday boy wakes up in the morning and the girls are still at his house. They bring him a nice breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to get rid of them, but when they come home, the girls are still at his house. Girls have old enough George and do not want to cook for them anymore. They both appear to be the main psychopaths and use George in their little crazy match. I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and they slow down the house of George. George was not really great for his two guests. When George said he was married, it did not seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker on Family Guy. I was all the time for both girls.
