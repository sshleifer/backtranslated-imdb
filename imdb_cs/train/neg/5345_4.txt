If you succeed through "classic Meyer" titles / intro, you can go through anything. But would you? I did not find much to do to tear my teeth. I suppose if you get to this with low expectations, you will be delighted (and la Charlie's angels.) But for my money I would like a little more, more visually and more moving. More. I feel as if I begged for a cough @ the foot of the master. men got the goods. but he just will not share it.
