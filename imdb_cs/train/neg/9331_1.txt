Are we talking about the same movie? This movie is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. This is a typical direct film on a DVD / TV movie that contains all the ingredients needed for a horrible movie experience: Over-acting actors, side steps from the plot that have remained unexplained, GIRL SHOWS HER T * ts (why, god, why ?), people do not react to things as it would be in real life. I do not even have to worry you in detail, it will last all night. Okay, just one: When two people were killed in the street, one of the victims practically dies in his arms and his blood runs out of your head, your first worry to be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts come to Harvey and his lost career.
