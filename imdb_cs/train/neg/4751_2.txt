First of all, when I saw a teaser trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney Channel, will be martial arts and I was fine ... until I saw the movie. The action was badly built, the film could not make anyone realize, the fight was unrealistic and sucked ... along with the story. If you really think it's crazy Buffy Vampire Killer, a girl who is a descendant of other warriors who are women, a girl wants to ignore her call and wants to become a queen home, an observer who is about to prepare for a big fight against an ancient evil. The idea simply was not entirely original, the film is wasting time.
