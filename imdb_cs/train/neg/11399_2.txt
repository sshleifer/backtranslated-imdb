I can not believe I lost 80 minutes of my life when I watched this awful movie, and I hoped it would improve, but the boy was wrong. Give it was totally poor, playing was very bad and the special effects were terrible. Even the two beautiful girls could not revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. I can not lie, however, some of the lines in this movie were quite memorable, as if the Asian boy said I had lost my virginity to the babysitter so stereotypes '' <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time with this crash if u are not ready or want a good laugh .. Maybe so you can watch how to break this movie with some friends
