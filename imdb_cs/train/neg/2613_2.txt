This sequel is totally uneven, incoherent and unreasonable in the "plot" (if one is really) and attempts to be too damn modern (ridiculous, from the period and characters of the 21st century style) and the cute (yawning: too much produced, furious jokes with animals.) The actors in their film are next to a teenage conspiracy. Even Glenn Close (and she is normally very good) is going through this movie, parodying as the original De Ville and the Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that can not even be looked at. This is a very good example of a bad and unnecessary continuation. Even Basic Instinct 2 had conspiracy, characterization, and acceptable negotiation. Not that. It is bad.
