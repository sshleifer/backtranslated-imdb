Home Alone 3 is one of my favorite movies. It's a crop cream or with *** if you tend to be cynical because it ranks (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could be even worse than the two of you, because those two at least were intermittent laughing at me for their stupidity. It made me constantly hurt and applauded when the loans began to bury. No other movie caused me pain. Now we will show exactly why this movie is so incredibly nasty. <br /> <br /> It's funny first. It revolves around the chip in the remote-controlled car (?!), Which is misplaced and how these terrorists want. Small things. The action that follows is similar to the other two Alonas, boobytraps and all, but watching how these executions are executed is rather than funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I had no laughter (or even a smile), I was constantly spraying, and I was hoping the terrorists would play the baby. The bird, rather than providing comical relief, was unhappy and annoying. The game that makes a lot of names ranges from poor to bad. There is no good performance. Alex D.Linz is absolutely insurmountable and unlucky as a kid, while terrorists act (and make their decisions according to their film credits, they look) because they were quickly picked up from the street ... well, that's it. <br /> <br /> I can see that some people say, 'Man, this is for kids Well, MAN, kids may like but they can get pretty good Look at Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before , than you think about how to do it. Even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who bother - look at those reviews for more) are better than this! So, in short, it's an infallibly cruel film. It was obviously recycled for money because it almost completely broke away from the first two, the only thing is that the first two will be offended. No person, child or otherwise should find any reason to believe he is home alone. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
