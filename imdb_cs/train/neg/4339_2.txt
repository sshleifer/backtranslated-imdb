this movie was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie is called something else, no one notices the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really weird because I can not see it. the predecessor and the sequel allow simply to say that it does not make sense or answer. Maybe I'm naive, but I'm not a vol. 1 & amp; 2 to answer. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in prison in the 1st and died in the original, and in the prequel lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy was fine but they should change around some actors and some story lines and movie name and it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end up as if the other one started. <br /> <br /> If you have any comments on this post, please.
