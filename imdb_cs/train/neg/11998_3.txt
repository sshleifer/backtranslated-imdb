it's a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First of all TOOO long. the longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Stories are too damn over the top !!!! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are too many stories that the story line is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Comedy was not a comedy !!!!! it was not funny at all .... The story is so repulsive and badly written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ......... <br /> <br /> I had some expectation from this movie. ........ but my expectations were crashed completely during the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good for this movie is MUSIC ...... and apparently Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and performs among all the older actors ...... it's just a new piano and still shines and makes the rest of the cast looks so silly !!!!! Govinda and a blonde who plays his love interest also help save this catastrophic film. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of taxi driver. and Blonde also gives a very gentle and consistent performance .... next Talented actress Ayesha Takiya is totally missed in this movie !!!! so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his role well, but it seems to be too high !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally useless ...... <br /> <br /> The only one that is not unnecessary is Salman Because he has no talents that will never be lost !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It is a very impossible movie with the script Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar that the plot is shaped by silly comedy scenes. Imagine how silly this movie is !!!!!! 3/10 it's four hours long !! think and RETHINK before going to the cinemas !!!!! better Avoid it !!!!!
