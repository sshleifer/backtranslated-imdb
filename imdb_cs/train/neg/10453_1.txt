This film deserves more than 1. But I give him one because so many boys from fricken fans gave him 10, which gave him a rating that got to the list of 100 best. It's not that big that it's not that bad. It's a stupid classical culture with so many guys who are frog fans, it's ridiculous. These are the ones who are probably still laughing at Chuck Norris jokes and still say, "I'm rick james b! Tch" No matter how old or annoying it gets. I'm afraid I have to hear "I'm tired of the MFN Snakes on the MFn Aircraft" for months from idiots trying to be funny. His dirty conspiracy, etc. It's good to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit it's a bad movie. Wait until Marine plays John Price if you want to see the real movie
