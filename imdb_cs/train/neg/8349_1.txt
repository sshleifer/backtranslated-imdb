The guy who goes without a motive ... I will never return the two hours of my life. The guy still held his identity and cheated on his pregnant wife. What did I think? How did it get from anywhere? I understood that he loved his father, but besides, the film was totally senseless to me. What was the purpose of going so much and going to the alien's funeral for no apparent reason. How did his life enrich him? Why should we see the dying old lady on the underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> Though it would be deep or something more interesting. I do not answer the movie even when I sleep ...
