A reasonable effort is a summary of this film. A good film of the 1960s, which has no sense of success. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was quite plausible, but not as good as she could give, other actors were horrible! A terrible display. It was not very funny, and so his genres did not really happen because it was not senseless and it was not dramatic. The only genre has reached a satisfying level of romance. The target audience was not hit and the film was broadcasting confusing reports. The very basic conspiracy and the very basic story have not been torn apart or have not happened and people have been confused, why the film was not that good, who was the target audience, etc. However, Maggie was pretty good and the story was fine with moments of ability. <br /> <br /> 4.
