Bad use of scenic cuts. All continuity is lost either by terrible scripting or lethargic. That stupid robot ... had to be a jazz dancer? Also one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues mostly drowned in music.) And ... where did they get props? This ship looks like a box of milk ... I've done better effects on 8mm at the age of 13! I would recommend that every film student watch this movie (5 minutes at a time) so that they learn how to NOT create a movie. Or ... was it a bug of the editors? It's really bad because the script was actually a good concept ... just badly done all the way. (I apologize to Malcom, you should send a "double piece".) You are too good actor for such a deadly bomb.)
