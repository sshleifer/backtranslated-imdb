Pakak suggests that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are breaking a huge bank robbery, but that was not the case! I did not get anything! In the first half there is a new character in every other scene (without introduction). The first half hour is totally incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, annoying, backlit chase scene. There is always an irritated sound in the background, whether it's a noisy watch watch, a siren, a train whistle, or even a terrible Quincy Jones score. There are lots of parts that are ridiculously bad. Likewise, bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice with CAR! Or the police have come to the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
