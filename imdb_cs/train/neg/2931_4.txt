Sitcom The League of Lords follows the lives of some bizarre inhabitants of the fictitious village of Royston Vasey. Individual scenes are linked together. <br /> <br /> In the first series of sketches, the main plot is a new route that will be built by Royston Vasey. As a result, more foreigners visit a small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of the "local" trade, which is actually far from the city, do not like strangers. When a visitor enters his store, he will kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are carefree and not fun at all, for example when a couple engages two engineers who want to build a new road. Edward's drums, while Tubbs dance around the victims. <br /> <br /> In addition Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. He works at a local work center. Although Pauline hates people to work with, she does not want her to lose her job. So when an unemployed person gets an interview as a fireman, they will not let him go because he's not ready for work yet. Then there is Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about her "sexual" conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, the vet Mr Chinnery always kills the animals instead of curing them. In one case he comes to the farm and leads to the living room where the dog is in the basket. Farmer goes out. Assuming the dog is a sick animal, Mr. Chinnery euthanasizes him. Secondly, the farmer opens the door, holding a "real" sick animal, sheep. Some other residents are a husband and his wife, visiting their nephew (his boyfriend is killed by the shopkeepers by the way). The couple is very tidy. They have, for example, towels in different colors. Each color represents one part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys marked with different colors and accurately classified. In my opinion, players play very well. Women's scenes become comical. Costumes are also suitable for actors. Tubbs has a scarf and some crazy characters, like Edward, have unexpected black teeth. The show has a lot of dark humor, a typical Brit. The design set reflects the mood of the series. The villages and all the houses look gray and are decomposed. Around the local shop is often fog that strengthens the impending effect. Even the village sign is ominous: "Welcome to Royston Vasey, you will never leave." <br /> <br /> Though I think the actors do a great job, this type of series is not my taste.
