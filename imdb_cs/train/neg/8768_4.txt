Now please do not start calling me names like "unpatriotic", "weirdo" and others. The very length of this movie (4 hours ..!) Is his biggest mistake. No editing at all - it seems that J.P. Dutta was too fond of his project. Even Lagaan was four hours long - but he was entertaining and gave a message. It is based on real events and real people. Kudos to that, but were they really needed repeated war scenes? In addition, the focus was constantly shifting from one battalion to another, and it was impossible to keep track of all. <br /> <br /> The songs were songs of loneliness, love, and related things. They were chattering conversations. In the beginning, it made some relief from violence, but later it became monotonous that even the nature of the approaching conversation could be properly predicted. Why did soldiers walk like lions in the jungle, do not you know that the enemy was lying somewhere nearby? And when they were shot, it made a sympathy, but it seemed unthinkable to have such security in the first place. <br /> <br /> Music was melodic and the lyrics were soulful, but they did not fit into the movie. It is better to listen to the soundtrack than in the movie. Performing Salvation Grace: From experienced veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to relatives like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, they all played as a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve special mention of tightening mood whenever necessary. Dialogues ranged from brilliant ("From Madhuri .. with Love !!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan with zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). And exhausting rioting consisting of all MC, BC, Cs and F-words was not really needed. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil will try to provide bold Indian soldiers, but he tries too hard and eventually fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve better tributes.
