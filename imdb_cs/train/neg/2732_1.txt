When it was "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" last season, I was delighted. Scrubs, I thought, doing something clever and unique when it comes to the clip-show concept. Instead of playing records, it plays jokes in a confident way, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. One season later, they succeeded in what almost inevitably do all the sitcoms, a show of clips ... and it seemed to have done that together with children's work. Dr. Cox shows how lazy editors work together because they will not appear until "My Long Goodbye" 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that the wig is too much effort to keep the continuity of what was once well built by the sitcom. Who knows why it was there seemed to be lazy and has no place and reminds me (mostly) of the episodes that they broadcast over the past year. Three seconds hacked along with background music is DVD extra for (very) rainy day, not episode of primetime television.
