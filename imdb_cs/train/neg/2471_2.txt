I remember when I was little when I was gone in the camp and we would camp under the stars. There was always someone who had a good story to say that it was about the forests that surrounded us, and they always drive me out. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I checked it, I hope to be one of those movies that have a supernatural body that chases people in the forest, as well as stories told in the camp. Well, to my horror I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three drives their winter cottage, which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a wooden cabin and runs into deer. Well, it seems that the local furious actually hunted this particular deer and they are very excited about our city. The film spends too much time after the family's everyday activities rather than getting to the point of the film. It was not until the last 15 minutes when we actually had an action involving "wendigo". My suggestion is that this movie stays very far. Leave you an hour and a half back.
