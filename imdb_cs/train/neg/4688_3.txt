Letting a class follow it in English was a bad idea. Movies that are serious and educated may have an effect, but it does not seem to have any effect on the class - whenever the teacher left, the interviews quickly began - and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Tempest" used at all. And when you look at it, it's easy to understand why. Executing is nothing special - everyone seems to be bored of pieces, just reading from a world without care. Shakespeare always preferred an explanatory dialogue to action and death, but I simply could not understand the word someone said. Costumes are not too bad and they are not special effects - the movie may not love the movie, nor do they accept the dogs. But it's hard to joke on a movie that has no inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the beginning of the movie were not too badly done - though the rain looked a bit unrealistic, everything else was good and good. But where were the cut heads and the exploding masts? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel would be taken much more seriously if he wore clothes - but because it was all on show, it was just another excuse for a joke. This film is by no means dazzling about sex. Women and girls will have no romance or comedy to enjoy, and there are plenty of naked men and lack of action or death that leaves most of the men and boys. Tempest was not done badly, but it feels like something the producers should do, not something they want to do. And general boring and lack of inspiration show. 3/10
