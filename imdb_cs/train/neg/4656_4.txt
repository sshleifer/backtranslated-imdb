An unforgettable and unforgettable remake of the old, celebrated English film. Though it may be too destructive as a complete disaster (which is not), it never produces any tension and pretends its origin of television. Richard Burton is playing a role, and Sophia Loren's face (in this film) has no great passion. (**)
