In a word: unbearable. I was advised to read some articles about the philosophical meaning of this film, but after standing for an endless 115 minutes of film and being slowly crushed beneath its fanciful symbolism and lava from oppression, it seemed better to report my reactions to the film. After all, who is going to see the movie with the outline in hand? And that screech was gloomy. Actor Claude Laydu, from opening the film to the end, wears the same tedious and annoying mask of agony that is virtually indistinguishable from the eternal and dark voice of the film. Shooting one above the other could work better than to get the audience of both, because basically they say the same: priest Ambricourt is a poor man. The story of a persecuted priest attempting to help an agitated rich gentleman does nothing to make his characters remotely interesting or compassionate because the family has a lot of unpleasant wizards and the priest himself finds himself as a nasty pest. The last 30 minutes suggests some breathtaking report about the grace and suffering of one person that is equal to the suffering of others, but because of all the delightful details of Layda's suffering and the vague undertones in Robert Bresson's script, everything I felt is over, let's get a little ice cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson fan Paul Schrader, just to find out how many character elements and settings Schrader brought in his own scripts and movies, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
