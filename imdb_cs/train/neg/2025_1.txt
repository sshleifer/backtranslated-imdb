My wife and I have fun with Showa Howie Mandel .. I also like Shatner - even if he is in his craziest .. But that's absolutely the worst show on TV. <br /> <br /> Please cancel this show. It's upset **. The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hot at this show and they seem to wear less clothes than the Deal or no deal ... Questions are a mixture too easy and incredibly obscure . And watch Shatner or contestants say "Show me money" will make me vomit .. This will not last.
