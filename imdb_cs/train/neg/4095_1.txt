Today, Bea Arthur died, so I passed the IMDb site and somehow collapsed at an exhibition called "Gloria". "All in the Family" was a great show for his first four or five years, and I bet I've been watching each episode more than once. However, I swear I did not know there was a show called "Gloria". Maybe, that's a good thing. Maybe it means I have more life as a young adult than watching TV. On the other hand, it is doubtful that the "Everything in the Family" franchise has deteriorated so much, a show I have never heard of - and which has been rated very poorly by previous reviewers. <br /> <br /> I rated the show 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to register any voice and the writers and television directors should be convicted of opening a show that would have no air traffic and bothered the memory of one of the greatest concerts in the history of television. Shalom, Zwrite
