This complete confusion of the film was directed by Bill Rebane, a man who was partly responsible for the truly infamous Monster a-Go Go anti-classic. As I approached the end of the cold, I came to the incredible conclusion that this film was actually worse than the shock. Story ?? like this? there are about three eccentric millionaires who call a group of people to their remote dominion to play a series of horror games. The one who can keep pace and survive to the end gets $ 1 million. It's a very simple conspiracy, but Rebane can still convincing himself of the incomprehensible. Things are happening. Characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes much sense. And then it ends. Oddly. I mean what the hell ends up with? I think you have to omit your own conclusions. Production and negotiation values ​​are no doubt a pornographic film standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not that good. She is so incredibly terrible she is convincing. Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said about this mud as a whole, it's just a bargaining basement.
