And it falls directly into the category of "Wonderful Bad" - ie Film's drunken students would rent to get a kick. I was at the Science Film Festival and all I remember is a wave of hysterical laugh when he spoke. Other critics will better characterize the fecal nature of this film and I felt oh, so bad with the poor guy from the production that appeared and apparently measured the response of the audience. What he earned was a scifi equivalent to a drunken student audience, and after a "serious" anime movie I think it was "blue sky," the audience was in a dark mood, and then the movie opened and in a matter of seconds everybody rolled in the islands . I will show the worst part of the ball; Scenario: The funniest and worst part of this film revolves around a linear and predictable journey with occasional, badly thought out sides. <br /> <br /> Animation: Badly done and put together if you can cope with a rough background and gradually skimpier costumes for a heroine (I know I can!), Then watch out where she "transforms" from a Swedish peasant girl to LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: One dimensional is painful, there is a short story (with side-divided dialogue lines) and little light shines on the real motivation of some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So in a nutshell, if you're captivating the audience and a couple of drinks lying around (try and make sure you're alcoholic again to relieve pain), then slide this movie to DVD and get into the "mysterious science theater 3000 ". There is no other motivation to watch this film other than laugh at it, and it is not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT USE THIS FILM ONLY. It could be even more boring to watch solo than "New World" with Colin Farrell, because you will not have a laugh of laughing with a friend or two.
