That's because the missing term is a bad movie. Where to start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This was perhaps the worst I've seen this year. It seemed as if the camera ran from a camera man to a camera. Maybe they only had one camera. It makes you feel like volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are lots of scenes, randomly, throwing up without continuity at all. When they did "split screens" it was absurd. Everything was flat, it looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Colorful tones were quite out of the ordinary. These people have to learn to balance the camera. This movie is badly crafted and misplaced. Conspiracy - you have to be kidding. If I were an SS agent, I would be sorry for the producers. he looked like Marks Brothers with radio and weapons. Sutherland was in the "24" mode - I see it for free. Eva Longoria would be better with a little less and much more. As an action, it was not too much. I did not see a real conspiracy, except Douglas, who was talking to the wife of the Presidents. He never told why the mercenaries tried to kill the president. I just do not see the President of the United States running for his life in the utility tunnels of the building, like a rat in a maze. p-1-e-a-s-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This film is proof. I like "big screen". I was a child. Many other "movies" like this, and I will stop going. What is Hollywood, doing so many feline movies, will you forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start running old movies. The one with real actors, a good story line - and good Cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> This movie is a dog. Do not waste your time or money on it. This movie is measuring zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look at his age, but his right is too futile to handle it.
