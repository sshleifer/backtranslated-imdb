Memoirs of Geisha is a beautifully shot movie, no doubt. And acting is generally excellent, at least in terms of how it portrays characters as they are written. However, so many details of small and big ones are just _wrong_, that it makes me too bored to be able to fully enjoy. A small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity is one scene (where there is no danger) where Mameha rings the bell hanging by the door of Sayuri's house on a snowy winter day. The bell that rings is fuurin, or the wind sound - which is in the summer just hanging off the houses in Japan! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have bells - they just opened the door and announced. (Maybe you think it's such a trivial detail, but I would like it to film about America where the Christmas wreath hangs on the door in July and nobody knows anything about it.) And I do not even start with the totally bad hairstyle provided by maiko and geisha , which is vaguely pan-Asian / Chinese / kung-fu-ish and nothing like a real thing. I think that this relatively cavalier attitude towards the culture it is trying to portray is actually based on attitudes and imaginations of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So I think the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and mayka in Kyoto (which is what is "Miyako") then I assume that the more you will like it. I honestly think this movie could be much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
