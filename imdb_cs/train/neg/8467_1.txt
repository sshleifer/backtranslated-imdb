My friends and I rented it from Blockbuster because we saw the name of Nany Visitor on the box. This film is a travesty, I hope she will reject her resume. <br /> <br /> "The conspiracy" was lost and flaccid; it is mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The movie made no sense. The rough plot of a foreign parasitic species that infects humans has many times produced films with much better scenarios than the invasion of body kidnappers and faculty. <br /> <br /> If you've ever had that when you meet this movie, we'll suggest you burn it. How does it teach you as a horror movie where fear, tension, gore, terror, or some of the usual horror films are not used, but if you still think you want to watch this movie, I suggest you have a lot of sugar in hand, so you can find him fun.
