It's not bee sound, it's the effect of watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly-processed film. As I have done in all three and a half hours without falling asleep I will never know. The story is simple ... 3 deeply insane fools talk about sex in 3Â½ hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. It's even worse if possible. > I have to be really masochist if I could watch the whole movie without turning it off ... or killing someone.
