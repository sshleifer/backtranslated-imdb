This film is another Christian propaganda film in line with The Omega Code. Not that it's bad, but the fact that most of the propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they want to deliver. If you like a polystyrene portrait of life on the streets and the way the gospel can change your life, maybe you will enjoy this movie. I say, save money and hire Cross and The Switchblade or Misi. When do Christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals who are not allowed to swear (what? Criminals say bad words?) And flat faces I really did not have a relationship with. It would also be great if the film showed some T & A. Now it would be something I'd like to pay to see it. Who was a blockade that compared this social waffle thin film story with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
