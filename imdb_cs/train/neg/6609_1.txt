I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever shot because I did not see a Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it could be. This film seems to be an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director and I think he was successful in his mission. No A-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same bill as he does for any humiliation this film is required to carry with him. But he leaves only the director's blame here, there is a cameraman who seems to be trying to appreciate the amateur home movie of the year. There is a surprising score that brings you to the next scene. An illuminator who had to hold a cigarette in one hand and a lamp on the pole in the other and hoped that the flame that burns from the cigarette would add much needed light in every scene. And, of course, actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, otherwise everyone could be forgiven. A set of Aag actors has been set up to support the new beginning and dimension of the re-make of the most popular Indian film "Sholay". We must not forget that these actors were not forced into this film, they are A-list and willing participants of what we should, we should certainly have a high and eager public expectation ??? So he asks, Amitabh aside (for now), other actors really believe that their performances even attempted to improve the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believed that people would remember their dialogue in this filthy abomination of the film? Do not be stupid, of course it did not, it was a demonstration to the public about how much money they are talking about, so they can make the actors walk. I really hope that all the participants are happy with what is a really vulgar attempt to remake a classic film that succeeds in polluting all people while watching the original.
