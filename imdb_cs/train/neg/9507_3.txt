I've always been frustrated with films that were obviously written by one sex. Especially when, of course, they are not doing enough research to find out when something is not just true, but it will ring falsely. The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his football teammates that she got Diane pregnant. In no way shape or form a guy would ever encourage another guy to get a pregnant girl in high school. You could cheer up on having a boy with a hot cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first football team has heard it will not be with the urinal. It was obvious b to take so seriously, and it was not bad, but come on!
