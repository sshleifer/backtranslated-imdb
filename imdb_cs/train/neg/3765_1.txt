I've always been interested in Bigfoot, so when I walked around looking for a movie to rent, I was interested. It was the BEST $ 4.50 I've ever spent and I want the money back! Do not forget about it! It was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so incredibly boring and I found myself very fiery in sight and I had not even been looking at it all the time. I just got it. The game was terrible, the effects were horrible, everything was really bad and without taste. It all seemed like a really bad, boring film and a complete waste of time and money. I hope one day they will make a good film about Sasquatch, but until then I will have to sit through countless cheap bagpipes like this to find a real masterpiece.
