BE WARNING. This movie is such a mess. It's a disaster. Do not waste time with this. I warned you! Acting, story, dialogue, music ... basically everything is so over the top, it's totally annoying and ridiculous. It made me avoid (if it was not dialogue / acting / story, everyone was shot dead). You'll feel like watching a comedy. The problem is that parts that are supposedly funny are not even funny. Actor, story, cinematography, you can feel everything, just try WAAAAY too hard - but he will never succeed. Virtually every shot is full, but what ?! This movie feels like a student film. No wonder they shot it in HD, because it would be useless to spend more money than it would be possible to shoot for a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are easily entertained or as bad acting, writing, editing, directing, full of clich√©s, everything that is forced on your face, and mentioned bad acting? (Well, it's not really the guy's fault - it's a director!), then I think you will like this movie. I had to look at the class. If I could, I would immediately turn it off. If you still can not say I came to this film. It made me throw and come back ... at least I did not have to pay for this garbage. Jeff Goldblum, you know ... guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day, he's in this movie, but he's definitely gone downhill since then - he's taking roles for movies like this disaster.
