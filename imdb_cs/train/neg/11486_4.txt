Because some people, like me, like to know everything about the movie, even if they plan to see, including the end. Anyway, here's the end, as I remember, because I could not have been over 8 years old when I saw it as the first and only time on television. But I'll tell you, that little boy I was scared that I was, and I thought about it a few days later, and still it still stands out for me, although some details are a little unclear. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember that! I did not even remember Barnabus in this movie and I loved Dark Shadows. So at the end is the Referee (Belinda Montgomery?) Glamorous (Joseph Cotton, I guess, even though I remember him as an old family doctor or something other than a judge, see how memory fades?) To a wedding place that I remember being in some cave? Maybe I have it wrong; and Shelley Winters laughs and the judge has a cloak and the camera looks at him a bit, throws off her cloak and has her goat legs and announces that she is actually her father, the devil, and she played directly in her (satanic) hands because " "the guy she's in love with (I think it's Robert Foxworth) is also the guy Satan wants to take, the Yellow-eyed Demon and clearly, clearly, show Robert Foxworth and his eyes shine yellow. There's a lot of detail in the last few minutes of the movie. Everyone laughs and rejoices, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy and weeps or scream or something, and that's over. Evil people will win.
