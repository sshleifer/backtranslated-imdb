The plot is not worth discussing, although it suggests corruption, murder, power, and other thriller-related topics. Characters are interesting though sometimes. It is not realistic but interesting. Development is slow as a tea drinking ceremony. The visuals are not overwhelming, but they are good enough to soothe eye strain. A good movie that will be useful after dinner before going to bed - not very shocking, not surprising. Movie sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I like Woody - great performance. He had to fight the imperfection of the plot and did it quite well. The rest is tolerable, albeit very predictable. The whole is observable and better than most television shows.
