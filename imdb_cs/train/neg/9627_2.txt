Well, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, although I'm lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think the girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen is very difficult to overcome her fake behavior. Sounds like he's just standing there reading from the script. This movie had just one good thing, and that's Ben Stiller. This conspiracy is so exploited and abused it's ridiculous. How many movies have the same type of plot? Can we say "the forces of nature?" Not only is the plot so old, but the result is so predictable, it's boring. I knew that everything that had happened before happened. It was a drilling, but the observation of Stiller is always fun!
