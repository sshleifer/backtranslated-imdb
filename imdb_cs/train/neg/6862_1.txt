This superiority of the original stupid film Blind Dead is another waste from the waste bin. So many people have encouraged these films that I can not believe what they are saying. Since I was a child, I've heard how these movies are scary and great, and I've seen them all, and I've been almost disappointed, have been on drugs since the 1970s, or just do not know how boring it is?
