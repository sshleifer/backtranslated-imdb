Roberta Altman's doubter, newly clouded west of Edmund Naughton's "McCabe," was overlooked at the time of his release, but has been critical in recent years. In addition to a totally convincing boom-town scenario, the characters do not have much interest here and the picture looks (intentionally) brakical and uninteresting. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a businessman from the turn of the century, settling in a fighting community on the edge of nowhere and helping organize the first mess; once profits begin to come, Beatty is naturally at risk from city hurricanes who want part of the action. Altman creates a festive, winter atmosphere for a movie that gives viewers a sense of time and space, but action in this justified town is limited - most of the story is made up of vignettes - and Altman's stimulation deliberately slow down. There is hardly any statement (just the opposite, in fact) and lighter actors look at each other without much attention. It's a suicidal picture, and yet, in the full sense of Altman, it will be proud to beat. ** z ****
