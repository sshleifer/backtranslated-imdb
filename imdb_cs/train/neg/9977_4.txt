This baby is rather bad, but they will never do it as a type that overcomes adults and can fire experienced thieves at every turn. No, it's not so dirty because it's a child with serious emotional problems. A nice couple who wants to get acquainted gets caught up in it, and when her husband is a little more willing to give this baby the chance that the mother is not. Through the bizarre character of Michael Richards and always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have a rather bad film with a few laughs in him here and there. I really prefer to continue this film because I like the fact that Amy Yasbeck has brought it back as another more sympathetic character because there are many characters in this film that are inaccessible in this movie. Even the boy is initially a bit uncomfortable in this one, and they calm him up a bit in the sequel. The plot is simple enough when potential parents accept this child who thinks she is great because the orphanage is throwing a party when they leave, soon realizing that they have a small hellion themselves. Add this little hellion to some sort of convict. I'm not sure if this character is, at first I thought he was his real father or something. It's not all good, but I'm picking it out before that guy Culkin every day of the week.
