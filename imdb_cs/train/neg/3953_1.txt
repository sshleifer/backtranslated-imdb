I can not believe that this movie was allowed. These people should be drugged and defeated by blunt objects. They should be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It's nothing but a record from the first movie. Whatever is original is strange and does not make sense at all. It's like some sort of hallucination. Likewise, what is the layout of the naked therapy mirror. Also, no matter how he once knocked, this turd did not even bother to watch the first film because he still calls Natalie's character Suzanna Love when it's Lacey. I felt like screaming on the screen: "It's Lacey, it's a lace!" I give it -50 of 10. MY GOD !!!!
