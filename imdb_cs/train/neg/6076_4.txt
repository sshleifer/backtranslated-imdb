In the film Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see a problem with this type of role that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scenarios. I found it a little difficult to believe Renard would start like a frustrated obsessive sports fan to be out and out of psycho Character arc is not the only problem with this script - also missing (I am a problem I had with UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should be great, but finished slightly flat), I thought for several sections of the film that Bobby Rayburn was the main character, then the story turns back to Renard. It also seems to disappoint a lot of sports fans who seem to think it should be more focused on baseball. I'm not sure if it should originally trigger the interest of baseball fans, but again there are elements that they could have if the producers invented what and what to do about the story. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am has fun with FANEM (especially the soundtrack), but it is a very bad film, and it should be remembered that by the mid-1990s characters such as nutters, like SINGLE WHITE WOMAN, have been penetrating long ago
