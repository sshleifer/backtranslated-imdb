Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired burglar officer who is forced back into "play" when his younger brother is facing death for not meeting the order of British crime boss Raymond Calitri. This work involves "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours, or Calitri grants his punishment. So Raines quickly builds the crew he can trust and decides on the task. But the police are on it and some of the cars on the list are not easy to take. It seems almost impossible to finish the job. It's quite busy that in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribis, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone deserves better. Sufficient power to power the Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is, there are many cases when too many cars cross the parking lot, many signs, lack of cocktails. Since then, we have no doubt that it is Bruckheimer / Simpson's production, a script script tied with loud sounds and cheese bets, scattergun adjustments and finely pointed by the hammer Dominic Sena. This is basically a big budget remake of H.B. Halicki's 1974 indie films with the same name, with the premise offering the potential for an adrenaline car based on the film. A potential that will never happen sadly. There are one or two moments with a big impact, sure but still pleasant. But if you justify the argument, the movie never gets out of the first gear, it's much more pleased to learn the characters trying to break the Scott Rosenberg script. <br /> <br /> Auto fans get some of it (cars are ace in the eyes) as well as fans of unintentional comedies {look at Ecclestone's grief}. No, it's really bad. 4/10
