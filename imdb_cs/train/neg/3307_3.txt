My notes can be a little spoiler, because it's worth it. Stop saving now if you take care of yourself ... <br /> <br /> Save Grace should be called "Paper-Thin Excuse for Old British Women to Get on the High Screen." This movie is stupid. Random music is unpleasant, as is the obvious, crumpled melody that appears sporadically to comment on the narrative ("Spirit in the Sky", for example - Oh, I'll get it!) This is basically the movie Cheech and Chong, with its rigid English settings and Brenda Blethyn's overwhelming force to elicit emotion on her audience with her own voice. I could literally listen to people on the High Times magazine magazine, who got their jolly over the huge "buds" that throw this picture. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda is trying to sell her illicit goods on London Street in a pale white suit. It's not funny. It's not original. Not interesting. It's not a good movie. Rating 7.2 is the result of excessive vote by fanatics. Do not waste time ...
