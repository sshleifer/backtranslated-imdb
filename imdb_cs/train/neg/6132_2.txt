As a child, I'm my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody film ever to have been. I'm not sure who started this reputation. Probably born out of the frustration of ten-year-olds who could not see her for some reason. Years after Gymkata was released, she became a permanent late night cable film, and as a result I was able to make up for the lost time. I had to see scenes from this terrible apology for the film more than a dozen times and I can always see it from 1-2 seconds of screen time. Nonetheless, in addition to the forced combination of gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, hard dialogue, and horrible complicated storylines, the film has several things. Of all that is visually bad about the movie, the sound is really fun. Never before has a kick or kick been made with so little power and volume! The preserved kung-fu sounds are irritated, but the slow and distorted music and the almost 5-minute slow scene are really weird. The search for the city of dementia, bloodthirsty villagers is not as tense as it is irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and accessories that everyone looks into the camera and wave to make this train-wreck somewhat entertaining. Could it be a cult-class situation? Where is MST3K when we need it?
