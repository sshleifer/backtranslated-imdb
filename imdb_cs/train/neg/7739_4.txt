Do you remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies? These days they feel more distant memory. While "Hollywood Homicide" is by no means terrible, it's a routine and surprisingly boring movie friend. It is a comedy that is not particularly entertaining, and an action movie that is not particularly exciting. Surplus subplots can not mask the weakest of events. <br /> <br /> Ford at least seems to be enjoying more than his last few projects and is able to carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is reasonable, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. Overall, "Hollywood Homicide" is a fairly funny diversion, but hardly. Get Ford off, and that's not the case.
