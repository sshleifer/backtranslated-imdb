I'll just explain it, it was the worst sequel to the classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney launched what I worshiped as one of his greatest movies ever. Now remove great tracks and add a bad plot that resembles a lost TV show. "Do it and what do you have?" the biggest load of raw material I've ever seen. After what I saw, I thought it was all for Disney. The cinderella was about to end, "and they lived happily to the end." not this garbage. This film did not deserve such a sequel. I thought it would be a "twist in time" that was mild but better than that. What did Anastasia care about? She went aside as Iago but did not help anyone.
