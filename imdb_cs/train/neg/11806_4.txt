It was hard to watch this movie and to be absolutely fair and objective because I was a big fan of the original film in 1944. It's for me and many others, it's one of the greatest movie noir ever. I realized it was simply a shortened movie made for television and most people drove it, I did not expect much, but you can not help but compare it to the movie '44. Scene scene I found myself comparing to what I was looking at, and I remembered playing with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I see how these famous actors play their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. When it was over, I found out that it was not as bad as I expected it to be, but it is not the original version of 1944. The two main areas in which this movie was not so good for television were: (1) there was no electricity between the two lines and (2) was only 90 minutes; , characters and chemistry among these leaders. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and for MacMurraya and Stanwyck, they just did not mean "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson." If this re-make was held in other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb was great as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, the head of the insurance company. It was also a bit interesting to see that the timeframe had changed, so houses, cars, telephones, dictators, etc. They were all in the early 1970s instead of the mid-1940s. Otherwise, the story was very similar, just diving. However, one impression was enough and I will happily return to the original version for the rest of my view on this classic story and film.
