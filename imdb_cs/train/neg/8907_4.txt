Yesterday I rented it on DVD and I did not realize it was a "character study" movie, so I tried to watch for about an hour before I pressed the Stop button. theme, I just could not get into this movie at all. Maybe it was my mood if I wanted to watch something else, or maybe I had another expectation, but when I put it off I tried to keep on watching but moved away. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not meet to keep me. The only interesting thing was a stolen Sergeant weapon and he hurriedly bought another and splashed it in black to appear as a police problem. I think this movie was entitled: "Who's doing a sergeant gun?" The scenes were well done, but I felt like I was getting stuck together to keep me safe. Because I could not track it, I would say there is some merit for renting this movie. .. maybe. For me, it was a waste of good observation effort and time. I will leave it to you to try it, but it is not one that I strongly recommend.
