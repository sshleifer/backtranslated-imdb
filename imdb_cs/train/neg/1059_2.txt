I watched this film last night and I'm already trying to remember it very much. The story is about a group of criminals who escape from the space colony. It flies to the Moon in the bulk carrier; when there, they terrorize the garbage men who work on the Moonbase. It turns out to me that garbage low-budget sci-fi films often include either desert planets or, like this film, criminals escape from criminal colonies. Why do not I have this? But I can say with some certainty that such films are always devilish. This is really no exception. It starts pretty well with a good credit sequence and a half-pitch soundtrack soundtrack. It then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. So little of the effect actually happened in this movie that I literally try to write a very useful overview, so if you read it, I'm sorry for not being able to illuminate you with the fineness and nuances of the movie. By recording I remember a tedious bunch of baddies, boring goodies, nuclear warheads, and naked women hologram. Besides, I try. <br /> <br /> If you feel like you might be interested in lunar people's activities, then I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend it to those of you who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
