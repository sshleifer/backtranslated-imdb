This show is terrible, jokes are all terrible and worsening. I'm one of those people who have never been a big fan of the corner gas, but at least I liked it when it came to the routine around the second season, all the jokes were revealed and the characters had nothing for them. At least, that Corner Corner was at the beginning of a good, small mosque at Prairie is typically a terrible, fearless CBC comedy that did not have anything to do with what happened from the 1st episode. Who are the people watching this show, do I feel that they are older people or perhaps just people who really live on prairies? Maybe there are jokes for them and they work there? I do not know a single person who likes this show and can not stand up to it, jokes are completely predictable, and characters are even less developed than Corner Gas. Hopefully, it will not take longer, because all the success that this show has seemed to me is based solely on the assumption that this show is Muslim, which is different and could / should lead to a great show.
