From the very first moment, this "thing" is just a terrible sequence of extremely short cuts of blurred camera work. While the overall conspiracy has every potential for the thriller, the story is so wrong that I can not buy it. From the middle of the movie, the action characters are not striking for me. Stop reading to avoid SPOILERS. Ed's idea, for example, Edna's coffee for her after her son's son was shot is under her alleged experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino has no doubt about the fragmented orders he receives from Claremont Williams for breaking the telephone connection. should not it be long suspicious that Williams is turning it? These FBI agents seem to have their minds with only one helicopter on something that has every reason to consider a major mafia shot. Besides, what they do to contain and leak information toward Cigliutti is rather the incitement to murder; it seems like a farewell to justice if the FBI investigates like this. In fact, they would have had a bad case if they did. We see a car accident that would normally be at least seriously injured if they did not kill most of the passengers but left them with a miracle of bruises. On the contrary, the crash follows immediately when Domino loves Choco, which is by no means based on earlier events, but only by being given to eyeballs. The whole sequence of scenes, starting with Claremont Williams' phone call, seems to me like dramatic blurring. This combined with awful, restless work with the camera just makes a piece that I hesitate to call the movie. I apologize for the unnecessary effort of major actors whose talent is useless.
