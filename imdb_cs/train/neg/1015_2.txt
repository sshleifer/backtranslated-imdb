Patetic ... worse than bad movies for television. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, Morgan Freeman's character keeps talking and says "kitten" when referring to boyfriend NSync. Morgan Freeman, who calls female "pussies", is simply unhappy ... What the hell were people thinking about this movie? Too many plot holes that you can imagine in combination with horror gaming, confused camera angles, lame scripts and cheap background music make this movie absolutely unbearable. I was following this flop with little expectation ... but. .. well ... it really sucks.
