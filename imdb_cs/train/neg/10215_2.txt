A terribly unnecessary and worse boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing to say about anything, no characters beyond the most non-imaginative stereotypes, and relying on a clumsy central concept that is neither original nor untrained in a vaguely innovative way. <br /> <br /> Ferrell will be totally useless in what he probably hoped would be his response to the Jim Carey's Truman Show, replacing his usual screaming routine (surely very funny if the Talledega Nights discounts), well, quite a lot nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is just slightly irritating (some of the reviews I've read here talking about an Oscar nomination is ridiculous) while Maggie Gyllenhaal does a decent job with a very weak script that allows nothing but setting up her character as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked it to make people happy. Please. That she ended up falling for Ferrell's "character" is totally absurd. <br /> <br /> Attempting Marc Forster to jam the movie using computer graphics just serves to pick up uninspired material to work with. <br /> I had a choice to watch The Prestige for the third time or see this. I wish I decided for The Prestige.
