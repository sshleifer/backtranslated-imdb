Young and attractive Japanese people are once again getting to the wrong side of a curse, this time involving mobile phones. Different people die until the unhappy ghost behind them, so if you've seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror movies, you can shoot this movie in the dark with your hands connected. <br /> <br /> The main attraction is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. Meanwhile, I was more impressed with low key parts such as City of Lost Souls, but as one missed choice, she was fond of his more familiar envelopes pushing Dead or Alive or too pseudo-Cronenberg style audition. Even though his films are essentially empty, at least they have such merits, or at least something to keep your attention, like Tadanobu Asano, who pretends in Johnny Depp's shiny suits. There is nothing in one missed call; there are very few credits: the acting is dim and average, there is very little (nothing, in honesty) in the way of fear or tension, and in places it's just boring. , there are moments when Miike's glacier, similar to a sense of humor, blends in with mild commercialism; most notably with an example of a television program that was interested in shooting one of the cursed subjects, and a TV programmer who was more interested in his rating than the girl's life. But besides, there is nothing to suggest that Miike is behind the camera; most notably, his usual visual perception disappeared without a trace (and includes his famous gore), although it is more likely that he simply had no enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One missed call is not hostile. It's just a frustrating average. <br /> <br /> Miike obviously loves directing. With his tremendous annual performance, it is clear he will not be 100% worried about all his projects. But even though he was a missed call, he felt he was paying the bills.
