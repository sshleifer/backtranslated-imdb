An interesting idea and a story that did not work. When you see a movie, you may feel unhappy with the end as I did. I did not know who really rooted in the movie, Taye Diggs looked bored like a detective, the rest of the characters look so one-dimensional and uncomfortable. If the victim of Alicia (Mia Kirschner) was rather a pretty girl, we could really be delighted to see the plot unfold and the offender went to court. The problem was that she was just as whipping as the other girls, turning from a sweet girl to a captivating opportunistic coconut. I can not understand the moral message of this film and as a detective story, and the thriller does not work.
