I was looking at the episode. Yes, I've been sitting all over the miserable experience and I have to say that this comedy is one of the worst you get. Imagine Peter Griffin, about family glory. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a (certainly slim and minus eyeglass) woman, except that he lacks something that makes him cheerful now. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he's an idiot. Sarah has no real character, not one of the acting skills that would pull her out. Maybe her t-shirts, formula jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character, can take her alone. Maybe it's a lack of credible foils. Her insensitive, fake personality can appeal to insensitive, fanatical people, unlike the mass appeal that Stephen Colbert has a insensitive, bigot character. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an unpleasant and unhappy character. He misses something that is necessary for the satire genre, let alone all the comedies of the world. What Sarah Silverman misses is noticeable. And if you do not believe it and you will not feel it, it is no longer funny.
