This is not a very good movie, but it is not a smell. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long so you can rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My GF and I have sensed this movie, so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** MAIN SPOILS LOW *** <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is actually fairly simple after removing all confused unconscious dreams about the state of dreams (95% of the movie.) Ignoring junk emails what really happened is this: A group of friends coming to school to rave at night. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone except Cassie and Sean will die. This is a simple version. (That's right, I told Sean that with me) After the crash, Cassie in the hospital is stuck between life and death until the very end of the movie. This is where the dream begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called Soul Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continue to interact with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 witches and Jude) following the accident, along with images of her mind (Sean, the school, and everything else around her). Souls continue as they were defined as: Annie, frightened cat, two wild killers (from the initial scene), father Jude still helping people etc. <br /> <br /> long ride, she showed a lot of pictures (many of them my GF and I still can not bind), but it all goes down so Cassie is not going to die. At the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is again reality. Is fine. The director adds a bit of extra spice by trying to confuse himself again by showing us a little snapshot on a wheelchair. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up beside Sean, apparently still tracing her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Because of the space constraints, we have not covered every little thing, but do not hesitate to email us. <br /> <br />
