The reason for what happened to his filter, as far as distributors and secondary directors, drunkards and receptionists who make the script are overwritten, let's get this film just as it is offered, without any explanation. This movie is terrible. Straight up craptastic. Rather than reformulate what can serve as a conspiracy, I put in my hand a highlighted reel of some curious points that caused me to scratch my head. The class (of 5) goes on a field trip for the history class to the center of the marshland 'anywhere in Ireland. These students may be Canadian or Americans, it is difficult to say. The fact that it was filmed in the Canadian forest rather than Ireland is also obvious. One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically a "stupid jock" character from a number of kick ass 80 movies, except when he sends Randy from Scream. One character can be twins Chris Klein. She has a girlfriend who probably kills, but she's never convinced that it's true. One character is rude and removed from her peers ... just ... cuz ... and then there is a blonde. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has 2 inhabitants. They're cousins. Gary, who is obviously the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called "sir" more than once. She is very ominous and wears knitted hats. His cousin is a nasty porn star with the worst Irish accent on the movie befoul in my life and most likely after him. Picturesque Ireland has many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks that appear more than once cut scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Producers get a discount on the volume of false guts. Good for them. <br /> <br /> They did not know that the terribly inbred clowns have access to the brands that pour new hunting knives. Maybe there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet near the blind and deaf clerk working in the registry. <br /> <br /> I'm also ignorant if you are inbreed for about 600 years, as the story leads us to believe it has become somewhat clumsy, yet surprisingly irritated and fairly strong. Genetics is an amazing game of craps. <br /> <br /> This movie may or may not be more than strange. We refer to "is" and we see the shadows, yet only one strange viewfinder is seen. And when some strange man is finally murdered, it seems that all the danger has passed. I'm going with my initial assumption that nobody thought about making the other man in full composition, so they just used it. That's what's on the screen, anyway. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Also note, except for those shiny new knives, inbreeding snarls have access to some once Richard Grieco cut off his debts, fresh ones are ready to put a tough carriage that gets tied up ... and he also escapes because the chains give you enough relaxation, even bothered to bind someone. <br /> <br /> The dead body in the hut will be overcrowded after it's about two hours passed. The dead body will also have glasses when there are no signs. Curious. Jenna Jameson appears without a reason from the left, the cottage for 2 minutes, disappears to the left. In the middle of a huge forest. This is not unusual because Gary can also get out of the air, which is also known as what's on TV outside of the screen. <br /> <br /> Jameson is sadly dying and somehow her clothes will be destroyed as my hope that this film will not suck in the wind. I offer a special nod to the character "Breeder", a poor girl, who used shashki for several months (or years) for breeding. A poor girl who still has eye shadow and emulates the camera with all the passion and conviction of stuffed chihuahua. The end of the movie was clearly attributed to drunken or someone with a wild mental disability that has been cultivated over the years and encouraged by excessive gasoline. Apparently it was not just the coincidence I discovered in the movie late at night, apparently people heard and even the film over its production. How sad for all of you. I have nothing to say. May God please all of us.
