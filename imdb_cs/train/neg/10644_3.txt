Well, here's another perverse movie. She was very attentive, despite the tantalizing plot of gender reversal. This is not the case. In my previous reviews, I think I have spoken about the general decline in entertainment for Haim's films that followed the 1980s. It's one of them. Only one of the girls is a high school student (Corey Haim) who is trying to avoid her chicane by dressing up as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleader and is born with a cheerleader named Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not hold charade for too long. I thought this movie was a complete crap, and it was not funny either. But according to most reviews, Alanis Morrisette fans or teenage sex queen Nicole Eggert are the only ones who want to watch. If you are looking for a good Haim (or role-playing comedy) feature, do not try it any further than 1989. It's probably what Haim's career has filled.
