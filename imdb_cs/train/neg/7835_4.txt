Man, I really wanted these ideas. I'm starving for some good TV and I applaud TNT for these "opportunities". But, unfortunately, I'm in a minority when it comes to Cinematic Stephen King. How wonderful is what the King wrote, the irony is that he simply does not translate to the screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very few), King's experience can not be shot with the same influence that reading stories have. Many people would not agree, but I'm sure he has to admit in the heart of his heart that the best filmed story of the king is just a pale memory of the one they were reading. The reason is simple. The average King's story takes place in the mind-scape characters in the story. It gives us insight into their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes broken or unrealistic views. In short, King takes over readers' places where you can not place Panavision camera. As spectators watching the filmed king, we remain with less than half the information than the reader has access to. It is not too far to claim that one becomes a figure in a royal story that reads, while one is limited to the small voyeurism of the same personality when filming. As the king writes, Hollywood tries to shoot everything that came out of his word processor, whether or not he should. I do not blame the creators for trying, but it requires an incredible amount of talent and caution to avoid Stephen King's impenetrable adaptation, which works. The task is to turn the lead into gold or some mysterious Zen championship. Well, next time he'll be lucky.
