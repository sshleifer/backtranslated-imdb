In principle, cruel intentions are 2 cruel intentions 1, again wrong. The story is exactly the same as the first (and some lines), with just a few exceptions. Cast is more unknown and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and appealing to me to watch her, I ended up feeling dirty because she compared herself to watching soft-core porn. I'm not sure if I blame some of the idiotic lines on an actor or a writer ... and I always feel bad about it because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically two-hour of my life. It literally amazes me that some movies are being made and that is no exception ... I can not believe they will do the third.
