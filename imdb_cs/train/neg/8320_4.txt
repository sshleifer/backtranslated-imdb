After I watched Awake, I came to the conclusion: the director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the viewer because it is simply a movie full of ridiculous elements. He has a lot of holes and is full of absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniform of the spirit of the main character uses ... the spirit of the spirit left in the floor?) The concept of this film is a bit brilliant, but all holes and absurd things make it stupid and hack film. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all actors bring poor performance. Hayden Christensen has null expressions and the same applies to Jessica Alba. extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is extremely unnecessary for his role. Awake makes laughing audience. It's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that are impossible to take seriously. My recommendation is: skip this dirty movie.
