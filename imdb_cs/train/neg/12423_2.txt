Cage (1989) was another of those low budget events that were made during the 1980s, mainly due to films such as 48 hours. and a deadly weapon. These are the stars of Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as Vietnam veterans who run the local dive bar at random. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in Nam. But Lou was shot in his head and is now quite mild. Even if it's huge, Lou has the baby's brain. One day, some throwers throw in the bar and Lou and Rebb hit the pitch. But the return is the mother. They broke the strip that left Lou and Reb with nothing. Until these two showers appear on the screen (one of them is a really nice guy) who have a plan in mind. Movie is a waste of time. Perhaps if everyone went to try to calm the situation, maybe it could work. Unfortunately, it is not and the audience stays behind the bag. Oh, okay. It's bad because you have all the elements for a great movie B. Much better luck next time I think. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended. <br /> <br />
