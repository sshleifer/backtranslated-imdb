I've seen this movie a couple of years back. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I'm surprised. What really gets me does not make sense, and that's why it's disturbing. Richard gets stuck in chicken wire and Jarvis starts with Richard's girl when she's unconscious. Then Jarvis's friend Troubador plays some stupid song on his guitar. The next morning he shows that Richard's girl is talking to Jarvis and Trouby, and then he returns to Richard and looks at him while he's still bound. Then they play some happy music and the movie is finished. I mean what happened? Did they stop? What did she say to the two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It's mysterious and poor. I can not stand the movies that are disturbing and meaningless. It was the worst film I've ever seen since the 90's version of the Lord of the Fly.
