I'm not sure what HK movies were watching other reviewers but Enter the Eagles is nowhere near the top of the pile in HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be glad to get actor's work in HK because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic warrior (even better with leg fighting than her dad), but her acting skills are also sub-par. In fact, all the English dialog box (90% of the film - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to the Mandarin sound just to save the misery of bad dialogue and the redundancy of English subtitles. Sure, there are some decent clashes (but nothing we have seen yet) and good cinematography, but the cheese's visual effect really spoils action. <br /> <br /> This means it's worth accepting to watch Shannon and Benny "Jet" Urquidez go for it. Spectral and almost worth watching the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, you can record some scenes that seem to be "known to you", especially the "think matrix" shootings and Fitz diving helicopters wearing black fatigues (think MI: 2). I guess someone thought that at least a few things in this movie are worth it to tear apart.
