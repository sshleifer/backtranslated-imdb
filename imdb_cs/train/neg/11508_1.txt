Anything that Guy Ritchie had to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. This new movie is a mess. When I saw it, there was another person in the audience and left for about an hour. (I hope she asked for a refund.) The only reason I stayed to the end was that I never went out of the movie. But I was sitting through this piece of junk mail, and Ritchie might actually think they did a good movie. Dialogue is ridiculous, acting is unfortunate, and the only nice thing in this movie is scenery. Ritchie took Lina's film and changed it to another "Blue Lagoon". It's a movie that would not even waste time watching Cinemax late at night. Time is too precious to go unnecessarily.
