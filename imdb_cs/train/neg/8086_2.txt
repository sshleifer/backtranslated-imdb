When I first heard about the "solar crisis", then I got a load of cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a large cast before. That's when I saw it. <br /> <br /> For a movie that includes the universe, the sun, the vast deserts and the vast metropolis, it is a terribly cramped and claustrophobic element; it feels like they're all hunkered close to each other so the camera will not have to go too far back. And the effects while good are quite underwhelming; we are talking about the immediate destruction of the Earth's planet if the team of scientists and soldiers can not avert the deadly solar radiation. But besides screaming, sweating and red glow of everything, there is no feeling of need. <br /> <br /> Do not let me start casting. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle et al. They're doing this movie without bothering to deal with any sense of material, it's somebody's guess. You are wondering who else did not pay in Hollywood ... And as for the end ... Well, let's say it's tense and interesting, but it's too late in such an effort. If this movie tempo kept in the whole movie, I might have heard of the Sun Crisis before. Two stars. Mostly for lost opportunities and poor careers. <br /> <br /> I wonder how does Alan Smithee maintain his job by doing junk mail like this?
