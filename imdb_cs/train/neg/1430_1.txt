During the channel sweep in the late Saturday night, we made friends with this film. Especially Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as Native American? Seriously?! His accent broke so much, though his character was apparently Scottish. I was also amazed to discover that this movie was created after James Bond / Agent 007 played at least twice. This film plays stereotypes with an inspiring professor. The girl who played Pony should be paid to let go of her kiss. And this movie won the awards? I can not believe that. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we really wanted to watch it for just 10 seconds. We switched to "Kicking and Screaming" and we wanted to go back. We were looking at the classical classics of the 1995 classical "Indian in the box" earlier in the night, which also discussed the Iroquois. The following line represents our desire to escape: "Take me out, she will die." From the "gray owl": "If you do not like it, you do not have to look."
