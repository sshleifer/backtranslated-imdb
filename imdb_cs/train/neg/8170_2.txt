With our friend, we went through several phases that many years ago chose the worst horror movies in a video rental venue for evening entertainment. For some reason, I finally bought this (probably cheap). <br /> <br /> The cheap synth soundtrack is the classic of its time and genre. There are also some very fun scenes. Among them is the scene in which one intrudes and defends with many unlikely objects, at that time I laughed (in retrospect it does not seem to be absolutely funny but you go there). <br /> <br /> Besides, it's a bullshit, she thinks. But it's probably worth watching if you love movies like "Cutting Mall". Yes, I also saw it.
