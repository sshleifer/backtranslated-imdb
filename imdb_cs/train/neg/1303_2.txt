Edward Montagne's Tattoo Stranger is to play as a crime thriller with a little noir film blended to taste. Instead, it is wrong, a blank look at low budgets and non-inspirational filmmaking. The story is absurd, and acting is unbearably stiff and amateur. John Miles, who had a rather thin biography in industry, is angry and pampered, and everyone else behaves in the same way as characters in a film about driver safety. The film awaits shows such as "Let it beaver" and "Father knows what is best" in his unnaturally healthy view of New York in the 1950s. Why does the viewer even see that someone discovers a cigarette in the middle of the movie. The only thing the film is about to do (except for its brevity) is the excellent location coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in favor of the cameraman, while the viewer treats well framed interiors of New York interiors and extensive exteriors. If you do not want to enjoy the movie when selecting settings and camera angles, I recommend watching almost any other movie.
