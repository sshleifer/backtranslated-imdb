But this movie certainly had a lot of hype; From the buzzing at the Toronto Film Festival to the ghastly reviews at CBC Radio. Refreshing, turbulent, cheerful indie film apparently. I've been looking forward to it for months. How can I just say that? It sprinkled it in a very great way. Exercise in the cinematographic lamentation that causes Adam Sandler to look like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was slightly fun and in the worst way of evoking coma. The American script is misguided and stupidly treated into a dirty mess. And what about 500db music louder than the rest of the soundtrack? That was probably the only really weird thing about it. If you want to see a truly humorous, bizarre movie involving strangers, then try Repoman. There is no comparison!
