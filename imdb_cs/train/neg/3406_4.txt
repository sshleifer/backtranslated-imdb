The space camp, which had the unfortunate luck to plan at the time of the Challenger crash, deserves such luck. "Stars" make the mockery of acting, Lea Thomson actually turned to the side when she asked more than her usual innocent, wide-eyed smile, likely to conceal her hidden attempts. The movie is sometimes cheerful when too many of you start asking. The little boy holds a robot with several million dollars in his wardrobe, which breaks when there are too many commands with the hordes of tongs. This perverse and unusable machine, "Jinx," is the main player in the ridiculous assumption of the movie, which appears to be part of the Short Circuit, part 2001 of the Airplane team. I do not understand you, just say you just laugh at it. When we say it all, it's nice to watch, in the SeaQuest, Saved by the Bell kind of way. Romance and technology, beware, are as incredible as any other. Also, if you are the 1980s, it's incredible for the fun show Kate Capshaw (Willie of The Temple of Things) and, of course, Lea Thompson. Also, Joaquin Phoenix is ​​the famous Goonie who is spinning with Jinx. Do not get closer to this movie unless you're a fan of garbage.
