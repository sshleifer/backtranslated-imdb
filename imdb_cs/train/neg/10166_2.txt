If he wanted to be accurate, he had to choose some Frisco natives and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I have lived in my SF all my life and people do not talk about it and they do not say how these actors did. Everything was overwhelmingly dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT Bigg Figg with a little friend like a rapper. No shock that he was the only one in a movie that really dressed like cats out there (his warriors). I have never noticed that someone would wear some Giants or 9ers gear; instead, he has dipped in some cheeses produced by SF or Oakland jerseys that are not sold at all. HP has no bowling lanes, black and Asian gangbangers do NOT use headphones or African-Chinese or Chinese Olympic team bracelets, nor any Chinese gangster wear Yao Ming jeans and try to sound black when shooting a hoop. Additionally, while there is a significant community of yuppie who attacked the mission, everything that was shown was a white dude and self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua." This is not New York! Puerto Ricans here is little and far, and the Latins in the mission are very, very different from the ONE that showed up here, which was undoubtedly from NY. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. The exact screen would show the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as against Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie could be much better if Lee did some other homework and had a better story , with which you can work.
