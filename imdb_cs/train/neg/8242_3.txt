After watching the FIVE EYE REVIEW, I must be honest ... I just did not like it. I've read so many good reviews about this movie but I just got where the reviews came from <br /> <br /> I have plenty of time for newcomers to film that directors will do well for themselves but the budget they had , was the main problem, two cameras were used throughout the movie (which was fine), but they seemed to be really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you get all those girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, everyone talking to each other - it's just impossible to hear what they say. a good idea went, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car and then set off, shortly thereafter they haunted him the car they hit, powered by a mad woman who wants to kill them and has plenty of opportunities to do it! ... and on the other hand, girls have a lot of chances to escape, but not! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just scolded this one!
