This movie is terribly horrible, but it can still be cheerful at times, though this humor is completely unintentional. The conspiracy was beyond ridiculous. I do not think a 2-year-old man would be convinced of the absurd idiot the filmmakers were trying to stick to. However, on the positive side, some of the terrible careless plots of land give a lot of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant bullet hidden in his yard!" It gets worse (and even more fun), but I'll save you. The effects are generally ridiculous. Most children's roles are a little cute, but not very credible. On the other hand, Annie is pretty awful. Adults do not take their role seriously, but that's a pretty good thing. If they tried to be credible, the film would be even worse. Which is difficult to imagine. Once you get through the horror of the film, there are a few extraordinary moments of almost relentless. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son runs with a virgin maid is surprisingly cheerful, though it's annoying disappointment when caught by the police. The Butler character, though very small, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never quite, passes through the darkness. Watching this movie actually caused physical pain. However, there were several redemption parts that made it almost observable without the onset of internal bleeding. According to his good parts, the film itself was about 5; unfortunately the rest of the movie barely deserves 1. So I give it 3. <br /> <br /> This is quite generous, I would say.
