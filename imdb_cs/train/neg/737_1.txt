WOW! <br /> <br /> I just got this movie from my friend, who bought him for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt that they had taken him! This is beyond boring, most scenes are shot in front of the green screen, acting is somewhat improvised, almost as if they did not have a screenplay. Martians are CGIs that look like they're novices, or fans have produced a movie. I can not stress how bad it is to really DVD! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the scenes, martians torture a local woman captured. She goes from the woman in front of the green screen to the CGI copy of this woman. The change is quite remarkable and when you kill it you can see that it is a computer character that looks like something in the game in 1990! <br /> <br /> If this is possible, avoid this movie as a plague! You can download two trailers from their site and see how terrible it is!
