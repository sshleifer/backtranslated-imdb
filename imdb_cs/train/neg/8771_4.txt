Well, I bored and decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that brought the film was that it would be an hour of records, then it was essentially the same hour repeated four times. It consists of 1. gathering soldiers and discussing a plan of attack; 2. back to male women; 3. approaching troops marching in the long line; 4. men running on the hill and firing, usually the first shot in the head, then the three men saved him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call the base to learn about success 6. Men blink back to their wives and sing 10-minute songs. It was a basic film, and the same sequence of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time she remembered her wives, she would show him a man, then his wife, too. There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback, so it took a lot of time. In addition, men could not kill their enemy except bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and it was a lot of action, even if the action was repeated. Overall, I probably would not have seen it again, but it was not too bad.
