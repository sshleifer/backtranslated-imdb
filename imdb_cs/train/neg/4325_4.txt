The second in the Holiday series is simply the least pleasant because Clark Griswold wins a trip to the whole family for Europe. No taste, under the humor of the belt, which worked as well as it did for the first time, is practically non-existent. This mistake is certainly based on director Hackerling, who apparently is not as good a director as Harold Ramis, and a very unspeakable screenplay that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around. Cast does what they can; Chevy Chase injects some form of life into action, but it just is not enough and very funny Eric Idle is totally lost in a small role as a very unfortunate Englishman. Some potentially merry moments are not full of potential and leave observer predominantly impaired. All images of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost no fun (just like the polite SOOO). In addition to several scenes, it is barely laughing in the eyes, and the end of it changes into a complete slapstick. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (like me) the movie is observable, but no more than that.
