It had to be embarrassed for every member of the American-American cast. Every derogatory, degrading stereotype of the black American community is prominent. I will not reinforce the insults by putting them here, except for chickens, melons and cubes. One good song by Ethel Waters (and a few bad ones) and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of eight-year-old Sammy Davis bring the total amount to just under 1 on the IMDb scale.
