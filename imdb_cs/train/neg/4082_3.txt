This movie was just painful when I looked ... not in a dramatic way that makes you in emotional situations in dramatic situations for well-developed characters (yes, by the time I went the last thing when I went on), but just an absolutely boring trip for OVER two hours. Now you all think I'm just an unconscious reviewer who has no respect for Shakespeare or "art film" ... well, you would be wrong in both respects. I love Shakespeare's works, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and I've watched a bunch of "arthouse" films, like surrealistic and well-crafted Eraserhead and Fellini 8 1/2. .. but it was just over two hours lost in Shakespeare's translation, WAY too much nudity (I can understand art nudity in some scenes ... but not every other shot of the movie! It was nasty and served NEVER FOR STORY !!!) and basically just exaggerated film making. I had high demands on this film because it is said to be "very artistic" and was adapted to Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but it was just an extreme fall. This film I shot only three times due to the acting power of John Gielgood (which far surpassed all the non-naming in this movie) and cinematography / set of design combinations because it makes a lot of scenes look like moving pictures ... however, much of this film would it was better because JUST the painting with the scroll text beneath it. Real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli got the headquarters, it would be much better. But this is the opinion of one of the listeners, many others can enjoy much more than I do. That said, if you can not find it in any nearby video store (currently not on DVD), do not try to go too far from the way to find it ... it's not really worth it.
