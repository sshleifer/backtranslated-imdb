Origin was a good movie. I bought them on a tape and watched him several times. And although I know the continuation is not usually as good as the original, I certainly do not expect such a bomb. Romance was flat, the look was old, the spoken humor was simply not. Maybe it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's coming.
