Dil was an unforgettable film that brought celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The film followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja and Masti were all excellent. But then every successful director gives some horrible movies alongwith some hits too. Pyare Mohan is one such movie. Although comedies are well-known, but they do not succeed to laugh. Compared to what comedy movies are being made today, it's stupid. If you really want to watch the movie and laugh, please do not look at it. Because that pathetic comedy will only cry you. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is worth the loss.
