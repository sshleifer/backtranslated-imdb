In addition to his "Tarzan" productive Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many other books, although in addition to the popular "On the Ground of the Earth", several of them were filmed. The only exception is the novel called "The Lad and the Lion", screened as "The Lion Man" (1936), an overly speaking, static, old hat, a slow moving and somewhat boring film, even though it was filmed in real desert places . In fact, "movie" is a bad word. The story does not move, but it proceeds with a snail's pace in a sudden series of dwarves. For example, at least five characters are due to complicated opening scenes and then disappear. Even more frustrating for the passionate fan of the movie are characters that look like (like a girl who is watching the alcohol hall), but are enacted by players who are not credited! Thespian promises usually get worse than unknown. The only exception is Australian actress Finis Barton, who gives a good report of a kidnapped harem girl who will save the young Masterpiece. It is true that most of the cast is populated by the cruel Diary King James, which must be heard to be believed! But the way to play this waste is the tongue on the face, which does not appear to have been one of the list of talented players' films. Perhaps the director of J.P. McCarthy resolved this idea. Anyway, it's sad to see how beautiful Kathleen Burke was forced to deal with people like Richard Carlyle (her dad) and Jon Hall (her suitor). It is true that Mr Hall delivers his lines with much more conviction than Mr Carlyle, but that is no recommendation.
