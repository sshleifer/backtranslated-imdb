While most of the movie is very amateur, the Kosher defeat scene is played, but not untrue. Kosher's law says an animal must be conscious when the blade touches his skin. The Kosher slaughter scene is accurate because someone knows who saw it, or saw the movie Peta showing Kosher's defeat in which the back of the animals is cut and the mouth is cut out while it is still alive, conscious and obviously suffering. We have to remember that history is written by the winners. Is he even even CONFIRMED to even think maybe the Nazis were right? Does not he say anything that the Nazis have forbidden this sinister religious defeat, and the Jews still practice it today?
