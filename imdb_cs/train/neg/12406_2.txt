The DVD Island Treasure Island should be required in any movie production program! It is a textbook example of NEVER filming a movie. Watching a movie and listening to a writer / director's comment graphically demonstrates a huge gap between what he knows about the characters and what he has told his audience. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication and communication is not complete unless the audience knows what the hell the director says. The director's goal is to create a movie that would be empty for "Hollywood conventions". Among these conventions, unfortunately, is the consistency of the nature and clarity of the concept. The director realizes that audiences often do not understand the points where they deliberately avoided the "Hollywood cliché". But it does not seem to recognize that clichés exist for any reason. They are an abbreviation for fast and clear forwarding of complex ideas. It's okay to avoid them, but you have to replace them in a different way by communicating the same idea, not just eliminating it. The film is built on an exciting potential-rich assumption. Two puppets are assigned to create a personality and background for an unidentified corpse to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of the Second World War. Soon everyone starts to cast their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes more and more real. Someone with a smaller show of the "Hollywood Convention" of a traditional narrative could make this movie a great movie. This movie is definitely not! Puppets do everything in their power to bring these characters to consistency, but they are all too often suppressed by a confused and confused script. In particular, Gonzo, who plays a living corpse, is particularly amazed by me. In a number of mining films he always appears as a very charismatic puppet.
