first start by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be praised for having to be associated with this piece. I had to give it 1 I would not allow him to zero. do you want to know how bad this movie is? my mom calls me out of town and tells me "son, I just watched the most stupid movie ever." I answered, as he says, "the tongue killer huh?" she was like, how did you know that? it's so bad this movie is I think it looked like a good movie on the first Freddy pinhead Melinda. Whenever I make it a chance. I settle for the rest of this movie just because I wrote a column for reviews of horror films. time money or even brain cells for this absurd piece of crap to run far away if you see it on a shelf in a Hollywood video clip or even at a local video store, turn it and go .... and I still want to do it
