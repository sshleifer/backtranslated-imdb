I saw it at the premiere in Melbourne. It is shallow, two-dimensional, ineffective and hard to believe, with respect to the subject, boring. The actors are successful, but they did not have much to do with giving a very fruitful and unpredictable scenario. For those who may be worried that Ned Kelly would still be intellectual, you can calm down by saying that this narrative story is totally without any literary depth, say completely on the surface and full of medium casting standards. However, it does not even work as a popcorn movie. His movement is too rigid and his craft is too inadequate to satisfy even at the level of a secular shareholder. I very much doubt that Gregor Jordan could sit and say that "this is the best I could do with this material." Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and so is the national reaction to him. A possible genius, possibly a class fighter, possibly a psychopath, and probably all of these things, has mastered Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Again, his story was unfortunately disappointed on the big screen. That's life.
