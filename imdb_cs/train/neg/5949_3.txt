It's not common to see that American re-production of foreign films that have fallen flat on their faces, but here's the flip side! This is a terrible re-make of the British movie "Wide Awake"! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is weird but fun and fun! "Liam" on the other side is just strange. I have to give "Liam" for one thing, and it clearly shows that I have decided to vote correctly when changing my religion!
