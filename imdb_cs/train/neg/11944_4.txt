I was following the movie and I thought it was a sadly sad version of 1959 that I saw as a child. It was not. I was therefore very disappointed with what I felt was a marginal act, poor character development, and above all an inability to draw attention to the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... "The Flanders Dog" is just the cute "side of" the movie. Get the 1959 version!
