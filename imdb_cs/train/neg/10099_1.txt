Thank God! I did not waste the money I rented, but I downloaded it! This is the worst movie I've ever seen all my life, visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Far from other zombie movies such as Night of the Living Dead and more. There are lots of loops and mistakes in the movie. OK, if you have time after reading this comment, check out the profile of director Ulli Lommel. After finding out that I have my own explanation of why the film is such, I think every film directed by Ulli Lommel gets a score between 1 and 2. And now I'm no longer willing to look at what movies he's guided, but I can finish by you will say one strong sentence. Even for fun or time, or even in an extremely boring situation, please DO NOT USE THIS FILM.
