That's simply the worst movie I've ever seen. It has been around for about 2 hours and the boxing art has been totally misleading. My friends and I leased them because we thought it would be a poor man 300. You know, laugh and have fun. No. There is no sensual film, just pain. Then the movie starts and speaks another language. We think, "It's just the beginning." But no, the movie is falling and it's more like a super-boring book you had to read in high school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the fighting scenes compete with the two kids fighting on the pitch. Omit Cinematography and this movie belongs to the trash. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which is, by the way, a good film.
