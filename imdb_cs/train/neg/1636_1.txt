This movie will hit with those who have sophomoronic, soulless, explicitly boast of sexual abuse and F ... in almost every sentence. Like a good plot? Like a comedy? Like romance or other human values? Stay away from Whipped. It was so bad I left in about half an hour. I saw two kids that slid, it looked like it's about 10 - very damaging - it deserves X.
