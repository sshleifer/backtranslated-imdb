In 1999, he gets a year as a film critic who led the public to absurdity. They first sent us into our eyes. They then improved the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst movie of the year. What is it about? Who the hell knows. He is full of self-confidence and full of misconduct. I always wanted to stay and watch the credits, but when it was over, I could not get out of the cinema fast enough. Most viewers who took part in the show that I was, felt almost the same way. The terms argued with each other as well as with strangers. It's an ugly and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
