I would like to think myself as a man with a very open sense and that's a lot (!) Because I do not like the movie, but this is undoubtedly one of the deadliest, cruelest films I've ever seen! > <br /> I have no idea what happens to the people who gave them such a good rating here (imdb is usually quite reliable in terms of rating) ... the only thing I can imagine is that people had to vote during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. While their mind is obsessed / stoned 2. They received hard cash for voices 3. Under the puff <br /> <br /> I can not believe I lost good 1 hour 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for the film.
