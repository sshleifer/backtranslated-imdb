The black man fights ..... and supposedly wins ... yeah ... 1/10. It's, of course, a fiction. <br /> <br /> So we are presented with a nice Damm title, a real nice tab and even a nice line .. That's where it's going to end .. We move into fiction after that Michael Jai White, a black guy, so do not confuse with the name .. it shows the black guy .. Umm, it's all about the name .. It's so hard to find good help, he had to hire black boyfriends to help cause a low budget , the low disorder of this movie, the shadow of the camera lying down the first scene ... Yeah a bright idiot moment for a guy average like you and me .. but yeah ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. submitted assessment. if you paid for seeing this movie, you got a screw.
