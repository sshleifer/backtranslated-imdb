The stupid and soulless noise of a nozzle collected during a few hours of mechanics who never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chases a Porsche racing car that runs on a 10-year-old sludge powered by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as a fugitive techno - who can McGyver spare parts to a radio receiver that can receive all frequencies at the same time, and who has somehow learned how to get and use chemicals to make explosives in an extremely peaceful society. As naughty as it sounds. The terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can be at least forgiven because it was just his second film.
