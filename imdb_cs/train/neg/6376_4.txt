Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips of "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house she had grown up and recently inherited from her dead sister who was not known to her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who still lives in her. Jennifer decides to sell because she is in a desperate need for Granny's disappointment. She also begins to have an unpleasant recurring nightmare of mysterious ravens. In this movie, no one really met. Jennifer looked cold, distant, unconscious, and narcissistic, while her grandmother looked malicious, sad and narcissistic. The film is good and well done, but no one has to feel comfortable with it; it has been hard for me to take care of what has happened to them. <br /> <br /> My rating: C-
