Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was the champion of this film. He had brilliant to produce a movie with actors who could not act. In addition, he decided to write a screenplay based on a bad acidic trip that was wrong. Put it together, you end up with a movie that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain she caused is roughly the same as the pain caused by your genitals being cut with a spoon and then the whole wounds covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
