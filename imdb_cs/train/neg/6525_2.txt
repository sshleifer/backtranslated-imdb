I gave this movie 2, and although I think I was a fan of science fiction, I found that this movie is very hard to take seriously. It was AMC late at night and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for a couple of laughs, but not much more. Special effects are average for the time period - it's not terrible, not even great. Of course, we know more about Mars than we did at the time, but we really can not argue against it. The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story. There were several parts of this film that I wished to be explored in more detail - the astronaut's wound / condition, the city on Mars, creatures in the lake, etc. Overall, the film is similar to the long episode of the Sixties version of The Outer Limits - complete with a cheese finish.
