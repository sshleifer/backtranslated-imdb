Richard Dreyfuss is really in this film, but in a relatively small part. He is not a "obsessed" filmmaker - he is a business manager / account group. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as stated in the ad, unless the term "erotic" is used fairly loosely. I would not want to consider viewing the film without Richard Dreyfuss being the main character. Perhaps I realized that the famous 60th anthem, "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen, was an artistic influence. In addition to the brief recitation of lines from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and the interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal," I found out that it was a bad attempt to combine symbolic elements and moods immortalized in "Last Year in Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou ". If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic ensemble, there are many excellent films, from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
