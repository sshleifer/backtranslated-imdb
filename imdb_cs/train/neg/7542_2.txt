This movie is supposed to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a fun, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine anyone laughing when Cage coincides with Karate kicking the blonde or taking the old lady's beats. Lines, characters and acting are badly made from get-go. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he made some scary movies this year; it is by far the worst (so far ...). I would not want to watch this movie for anyone who wants to watch an intense thriller with a story. If you really want to enjoy this story, you will rent the original. However, if you are going to follow this, prepare for laughter in some lines and scenes before you take them seriously; this is the only way you can enjoy this movie.
