This is a very special film ... I was not quite sure what it was, some N Low London robbers find a child in the woods that everyone believes is a seer and somehow does it all in its own way, change something about their lives, which usually ends with a disaster. The film ended for about 90 minutes, so I felt quite dissatisfied, almost disturbed by the needlessness of everything. It did not matter to any of the characters - none of them have a chance to see the spectator. What was the message? Am I stupid? It was just strange. What about Runner? Why Emilio shoots a child? ... it did not make any sense, useless. Can anyone help me understand this film mess?
