Here's a review for people like me. This movie is packed from start to finish. I threw the popcorn on the screen and resorted to have fun and la MSF2000. The plot depends on random events and relies on stupidity from people to be smart. The guide drops to the person who seems to him, and is not she that she could get into the fitness ????? And she is rich ???? And she is a well-known psychologist ????? Come on, people. She enters the bar at the most appropriate time when everyone gathers to talk about how she likes it ??? It was so wild that it seemed as if even spectators gazing at the audience were on their face. The rain would be offended. I also admit that I have scorned the dialogue of Mamet with such passion that some people have for carnivores, warriors and furriers. My hate is so complete that it prevents logic. But I'll do it. That it does not really sound, it's okay. I do not care. It is that everyone is talking the same way. Mamet can not create characters; the only thing he can do is to rip his voice to us inexorably through various actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They are confused about the fact that everyone has the same character. (But his later films are improving.)
