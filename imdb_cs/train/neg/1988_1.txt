Okay, I've been through horrible acting. I was through the fact that Lil Kim shakes the cannons and my hands or arms are not moving, walking through the tissues, passing through the colored contacts. This killed me: In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table. Lisa-Ray and Monica Calhoun stand up and then Lil Kim decides to share all the enemy actions by saying "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Hold Up." I'm a fan of the western film genre, and I never heard anybody speak slang like this movie in some of Clint Eastwood's films If anyone thinks this movie deserves more than 1 review, tell me another movie that's worse than the Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I'm over.
