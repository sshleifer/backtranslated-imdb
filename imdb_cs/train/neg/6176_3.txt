I'm not a big fan of stoog, but their history is interesting. I recently tried to try things from every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe shorts does not seem easy; that's all I've seen so far. Some say that quality issues with Joe-shorts are really not Joe's fault, and I suspect it is. Joe as an artist is not far from the worst. The thing that worries me most was highlighted in another note: pitting other guys against the third violates the entire comedy team / Stooges ethos. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived as being responsible for not really wanting to - even though there were no real conflicts outside of the camera between him and the others - and that's how they work. <br /> <br /> And what about the titles of this and some other early stooges? There is definitely a lack of creativity; Was it such a thing or the cause or effect of the shorts on the market was drying up?
