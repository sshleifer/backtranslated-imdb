It's not such a movie as a big television for kids. If I can say, a villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered with espresso beans. It seems that this theory is verified by the fact that subtitles refer to them as "insomnia". When it was first mentioned that civilization was destroyed by insomnia, I thought, "Wow, a Nihilist martial art movie!" but no such luck. Although you must consider experimental cinematography when the villain is strangled by the long white eyebrow of the old man. Zu Warriors makes exactly the same sense whether the captions are on or off. This is not a good sign. I found special effects that were somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
