Bob Clampett 'Porky is a poor fish' is so the cartoon is populated with scary games and one or two nice moments. In Porky's Fish Shoppe, Porky's Poor Fish is placed in an uncomfortable space between the standard black 'n' white Porky Cartoon and one of Merrie Melody's melodies, which were popular at the time. Typically, many of Porky's early Porky cartoons are far away from the star, appearing only in a relatively upsetting opening musical number and climax of the film. For the rest of the time, the star is a frantic cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity to eat for free, but gets more than negotiated. Unfortunately, the audience gets much less to negotiate. As it has ever been in serials with books on life, the reflector is thrown into punning marks that could work as well in an uninvited medium. Laughter is rare, and while the caricature is rather rescued by Clampett's energy, it is very little to recommend Porky's poor fish over any other Porky cartoon that is under the mountain.
