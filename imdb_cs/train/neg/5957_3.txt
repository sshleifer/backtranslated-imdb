The awkward and terrifying horror (haha!) 80 as there is thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered fun if you watch it in the right condition. The special effects are shiny, terrifying and the script looks like it lacks some basic paragraphs! "Brain" takes place in a typical Pacific urban setting, where every teenager is working the same dinner, and where a cold kid in high school launches cherry bombs in the toilet. Here is a TV guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain seek national mind control. Under the brand of "independent thinkers," the huge cheese brain transmits waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is it? Now he's a teen-rebel Meadowvale to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that he never says where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain. There are obvious references to extraterrestrial life, but that's all about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There is not so much bloodshed unfortunately, and the "bad" brain looks like an above-average sock puppet. The only more or less interesting element of horror enthusiasts is to look at the cast and crew who made the film. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who have made "Bloody Birthday" (My Wonderful Pleasure) and "Mor". Both are much better movies and wisely choose to step down from the film industry. The most famous face in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, whom heroic fans will forever worship their role in the re-animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides a nudity factor, and of course she is a great talent? He has exactly three films on his repertoire, of which this "masterpiece" is. In her debut she was credited as a "model of a refugee," and in her "3 men and a child" her character is referred to as "one of Jack's girls." Do I really wonder how she feels in her career as an actress?
