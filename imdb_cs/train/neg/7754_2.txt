Spoilers will be in it. The film could have been better if they had just another scenario, the director and the CGI provider. Is not it true? The movie has a man who opens his own amusement park ... err ... zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... err ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I do not mind rip-offs, because there are no original ideas for such films, but this one just celebrates you face-to-face, it's here. There is even the thing "creating shadows in design". The Sabretooths, who are not according to the sap of Primal Park (just an ancient killing of cats), are somewhat hungry, but the crowning success is the one I call "Sloggy." Because after the elimination of one big cat the hero relaxes a little because there is only one. Enter a strange feeding boy who says: No, we did three, the third is a monster that stretches out with its front legs. Great, groovy. A group of student students is also on the island to hunt the gatherer, there is a test to get into their frat or sort (he always thought he needed a short nickname). Of those who live, only one has completed their task, so I kicked it out. Yeah Yeah, the obligatory "Evil Capitalist Must Die" Clique is in force with no one but two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most ridiculous thing you will see in one of these films as a free Sabrathoth statuette (with kind permission), decreases in several sizes and penetrates the neck. If I could get so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this split.
