boring things have come here. Its 5 minute shorts are better than this. I know why? because there is only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit ... eh .. the last half hour is okay the rest is boring and not fun = (I had my hopes up, a trailer to make it look funny but the pace of this movie is quite slow and sadly not funny Just a tedious klaymen running in and trying to laugh us .. it does not work Maybe the next knox. <br /> <br /> Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding a better scene would a lot of healing but for now its just not good.
