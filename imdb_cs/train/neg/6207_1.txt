This film is committed to what I would call the viewer emotional rape. The movie probably caused a lot of criticism in Cannes, but for me the last scene was just a pathetic attempt on the new director to notice him. Almost a voice in the discussion about the problem of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other problem). The main person's metamorphosis from a good but restless boy to a sinister violent is virtually non-existent, while the rape scene (overpowered, exaggerated version of the rape scenario from the "orange watch") is unbearable, and I refuse to comment on her aesthetic value. There are some things the artist should not do to try to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Be aware of this: Shocking brutality, awakening, and DO NOT YOUR TIME. See "Clocks Orange" or "Le pianiste".
