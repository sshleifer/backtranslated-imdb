There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it was trying to do too much with too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money was not there to make the story of justice. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) writes about "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which was breaking the box. However, the movie had some serious cash from Disney. Frankly, this is a good example when the film does not work. If he waited a few more years, technology would have made it much cheaper. (not to mention that he would find a company with money.)
