The story goes like this, Netflix sent me a late DVD, so I went down to an analog rental site known as "Blockbuster Video". Real bad, have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing experience, yet I never wanted to see any of them. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, and all his lonely self. I like watching movies based on serial wrecks. It's just a part of humanity I never understand, so I want to see such things. Anyway, I uploaded this DVD and suddenly from the first second it upset. I sit there with my b.f. and we're like, "what's that bullshit?" Unstable camera operations, frightening acting - The first scene in which a woman kills you is interested if she rather likes instead, and then the rat fills her neck. I really care if the director has a hard feeling out of that bitch. There is nothing decent about this "movie." All I have to say to the director is "do you have your own tripod?" Each shot was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was as if one day they decided to shoot a movie. They probably collected people from WalMart to show and "act." Just terrible. If you make such a movie, then it's your hobby - what you should do to live - it should not get into DVD renal stores for movie lovers like me. Better at home for your friends when you have a party and exhaust interesting things you can have fun ... Then you break out your BTK KIller movie and say, "Do you want to see this miserable movie I've ever done?"
