This "movie" is a travesty. No, wait - abomination. NO, WAIT - this is undoubtedly the absolute worst film ever to represent beloved characters created and created by other actors. I thought "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers was an absurd and frantic, but even courageous "remake" by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's asinine and money laundering. <br /> <br /> Laurel and Mr. Hardy are dead since 1957 and 1965. Why would anyone even begin to imagine that the appropriate updates for L & H will be in Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain outside of me. I tune in expecting fear and embarrassment, and I was certainly not disappointed. Everyone involved in this miserable, sad shame should be exhausted from anything and everything associated with Hollywood and film making. AVOID THIS FILM ON ALL COSTS - BECAUSE YOU ARE LIKELY ADVISED.
