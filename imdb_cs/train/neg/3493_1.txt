I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential audiences that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not hate.) And I had high expectations for this because I found it listed on many of the "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites. (I am now convinced that the top ten lists are all forbidden jobs). There is almost no action in the movie. Most of the film lies in the fact that we are talking about a plot, which is an amazing performance because it is best thin. And the action itself could have been impressive in 1978, but it is a routine according to today's standards. Special warnings for Netflix users: The DVDs they send are terrible; the picture is terrible and is not even improved by 16: 9.
