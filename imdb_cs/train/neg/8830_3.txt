Just too many holes in this movie are pleasant and GOOD all the bizarre almost hollywood ends that are completely out of context with the rest of the movie (it's not a spoiler, as you'll never guess how it will end!). <br /> <br /> You must also be thick skin on all kinds of politically correct undertones. The conflict between the white and the black was very strong and unilateral. I did not understand why the local black community is acting in such an unacceptable way that it is trying to be racist? A really bizarre movie. Just watch if you want to be really poisoned with the plot holes and like to discuss all the things that may or may not have happened. <br /> <br /> But the positive side of filming and acting is excellent.
