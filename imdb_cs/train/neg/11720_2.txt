I read in the papers that W.Snipes was broken, so it is no wonder he will have parts in low budget projects such as The Contractor. It is just another action star to join the growing club: the heap of a heap star of the 90s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here's the lead of a cheap action movie that was filmed in Bulgaria (we should believe that the location is in London as if it just bought a full moron) The story is one of 1,000 other films: the guy hires the government again to do the wet job - after the government wants to get rid of him - a good guy gets rid of killing bad guys (was it a spoiler? Do not move!) Movie star: little girl (Eliza Bennett) overcomes all the other games! One star for her, plus one star for Lena Headey eye candy, is 2 stars. Only for Hard Snipes fans! All Others: Avoid!
