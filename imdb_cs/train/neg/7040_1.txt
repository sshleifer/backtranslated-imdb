Just buy VHS on this movie for two dollars, I lost my money! Hey, I'm kicking Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan Island" Louise, but hello! This third production is a rehash of ten other biker films; a crazy group of bikers, dogs, go to the hickey city, beat everything and everything and then be defeated in this man by a proud hero. Adam West looks like a hero, but he does not have a cloak and his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's just not the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and scared the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once she was rescued from the island ... LOL! The bikers are a Scandinavian band, and they are known to have ever acted again or at least not. Hellfighters are hell to watch!
