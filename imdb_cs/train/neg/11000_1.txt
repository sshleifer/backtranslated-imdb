Words can not describe how this movie is totally stupid. This is a series of random, non-functional clips of everything, from stupid Batman's spoof to a guy who cares about the dead lady (really worrying). The only distant thing about Underground Comedy Movie follows Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. It is also labeled NC-17 and avoids the only people who can tolerate it.
