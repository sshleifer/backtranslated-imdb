Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen over the years ... I could not watch it until the end ... It's just a waste of time ... really sorry Snipes for ending in such a movie. There really is not much to say about that. Wonderful acting, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how the film should not be. Just say one scene: The police are looking for Snipes and they surround the building with helicopters and cars, they shoot inside the building, but they still whisper, so Snipes does not give up anything.
