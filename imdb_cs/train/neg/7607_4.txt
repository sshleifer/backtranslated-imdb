- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over and is determined to clean the city. Not everyone in the city is happy with what he does. When the sheriff order a curfew in the city, the owner of the local salon (also a woman) hires the murderer to take care of the sheriff. The salon owner can not know that the sheriff and the killer are in love. <br /> <br /> - The Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a pretty interesting concept and combine it with poor performance. There is a good movie somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with more budget, the Gunslinger could have a fun look at the role of women in the Old West. Gunslinger is just a dirty movie. <br /> <br /> - There is so much wrong in the movie: supporting casting without acting, cramped and unnatural dialogue, and assemblies that look like files. But the biggest offender is editing. I was amazed how many times a scene with the actors (and the horses on the same) would be apparently waiting until Corman shouted "Action." The best is the scene of two horse riders who stood next to the building. Suddenly they take off and come to the corner, as if they were driving a few miles. Or take an example of people who can seem to transport around the city. We see that man enters the building and a moment later he appears in the city to join his horse. It's not as if Corman did not have a couple of decent actors to work with. While none of them were great stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all able to transform good performance. But there's not much work in Gunslinger. <br /> <br /> - I saw both the MST3K version and the non-MST3K version of the movie. I would strongly recommend the MST3K.
