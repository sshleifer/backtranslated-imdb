The concept for Sarafina seems good, which is beyond the musical perspective. He tries to combine exciting African music with a story depicting the deep conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. The differences between the two elements are too sharp and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between joy and terror. It was just a drama that reflected these conditions, it could be a good film, but the scenes of schoolboys who are shot down by soldiers are not exactly sitting next to the songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to the poor assumption, neither the acting nor the best, Goldberg gives average performance as well as the rest of the cast. Overall disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
