"Raw Force" is like an ultra-chaotic and perverse version of Love Boat, with other Kung Fu struggles, demented cannibalistic monks, white slaves, energetic zombies and a lot of dirty actor performances. No wonder this film was included in the recently released Grundhouse Experience 20 movie box-set. It has all the exploits that fanatics are looking for, merged in a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script! Production values ​​are very poor and technical aspects are pathetic, but the amount of gratuitous violence and gender is hard to describe. The film opens in a tropically sunny location called Warriors Island, where the army of the monks will pick up the dead for no apparent reason than to turn them into Kung Fu fighters. Monks also buy sexy slaves from a dirty Hitler-looking merchant, probably because the female body gives them the necessary powers to raise their zombie army. Tourists on a cruise ship, including three martial arts fighters, female LA officers, and a number of lascivious but little-loved ladies, are attacked by Hitton's boys because they planned a trip to the Warriors Island. Their rescue boat washes off the island as well, and the monks invite the survivors to battle with their zombies. Okay, how does it sound like a horrible midnight horror movie mess? It does not stop because "Raw Force" also has piranhas, wild boar orgy, Cameron Mitchell in another tumultuous lead role and 70th Duchess Camille Keaton's explosion ("I'm spitting on my grave") in a totally insignificant portrait. There are a lot of badly realized gore, including the ax of massacres and decapitations, hammam jokes and a bad taste of romance. The value of the waste of this film literally leaves you speechless. Brain glimmer remains, of course, inexplicable, nor will he be punished for his doubtful hobbies. Maybe that's why the movie stops with "To Be Continued," instead of "The End". The sequel never came, unless the IMDb is so obscure or not.
