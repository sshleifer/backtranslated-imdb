In spite of mysterious positive reviews and high ratings, it's a terrible movie. It's terrible that I feel obliged to warn how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the final period of Raj, during the Indian Independence Battle. What follows in a ridiculous conspiracy fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist at the time. For example, a young married Hindu neighbor from a local village would have married a married English master who knew well that discovery of the matter would probably mean total social stunning and shame, if not a deadly punishment? It's unlikely, but maybe it is. But would the same young Hindu woman in India's conservative society continue this season as a naked Britney Spears naked, taking part in hot outdoor sex during daylight in an open view where they could appear at any time? It's not just bloody unlikely, it's a slow conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Such an idiot, combined with a bad actress, drove me to leave the movie in an hour so I did not look at the other half of the film. One could only hope that the end will be more intelligence than what I saw in the first half.
