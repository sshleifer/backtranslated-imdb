The screenplay of this film, Columbo, looked like it was drawn directly from the soap opera of 1980. Deeply character based movies are great, but only if the characters are convincing. And in this movie there was only one thing that was convincing, the desire to change the channel. The villain's dialogue looks like it's written by a romantic novelist. Big Lieutenant Columbo himself is not where his famous, dear, self-solitary, crucified self is; and the bride / kidnapping victim is a buzzing, one-dimensional girl in distress (she fears the fear of a small scalpel held in the hand of her kidnapper - come on!) I could shake my scalpel and kick it - you know - what about 2 seconds). In any sense for reality, this character would have at least TRIED to at least fight or fight. And talk about reality ... the story is about the hijacking that the police are working on and solving. Police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows the FBI is taking over every kidnap. It was not NO Columbo, just a shallow and utterly predictable crime drama written by our famous Lieutenant Columbo and extended for two hours.
