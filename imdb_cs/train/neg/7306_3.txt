I'm really one of the worst movies I've ever had. I never took the time to write one, but I felt compelled to see this insult to filming the movie, and I felt somewhat saddened that I had time for such a piece of turd to be honest. There were so many parts that frightened me with their complete randomness and lack of meaning (for example, when would the police ever shoot people with infectious diseases?) When would the hospitals ever earn such people for lack of medicine? when he spied on his wife and wandered when he rolled around the bed?). Also, the characterization - as we have been in such films almost awaited - was terrible (eg The way a blonde guy - I do not remember my name and I'm not going to guess - she completely turned against her girlfriend and ran away to leave her) and ended up being she wanted them all to meet with terrible endings! The production was horribly unsettled and cinematography was nothing to write about.
