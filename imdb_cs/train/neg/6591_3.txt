This is the sound of Stan and Ollie, who are turning in graves. I will not bother to mention the basic mistakes of this film because it is so obvious that it is self-evident. Little things like "All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy", though the stars have been dead for over thirty years when it was made. Something like that. <br /> <br /> The bad idea would be that the actors will play buffoons that will be called Laurel and Hardy. It was just as bad that it could work. For a really bad idea, try to drop two actors to act as a duo. Well, they can say they are nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Okay, forget his crazy alien "Cousin Larry" schtick in Perfect Strangers and look at him in True Romance. But he smells here. It's probably not his fault, and as a director and supporting cast - all who are better than material - he was probably just desperate for the money. There are those who claim that Americans find it difficult to manage an effective English accent. Pinchot did not help this fact. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in the name of the Trademark Statutes is approaching, even though it is flown to the point where you do not have to write home. Gailard Sartain does a little better than Ollie, though it's like saying the worst - going to the dirt at the waist or kick? <br /> <br /> Remember second-second split-time originals, intuitive teamwork, and innate reversibility? Well, that's totally missing, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes that were so wrong you could park the bus over the gaps. While the originals had land that could be summed up in several panels, it has some long-lasting Mummy hokum (and what a miserable title!) That mixes with the brother's boys' scenario. I can not say that I saw each of 108 Laurel and Hardy films, but I think it's a sure bet that even their nadir is ahead of them. the originals were themselves played or at least used their own accents. At least he felt natural and unarmed, unlike the conceived cartoons Pinchot and Sartain. And when did Stan make malapropisms and so much? "I gave you a permanent cremation"; "I'd like to marinate my friend." Stop it! <br /> <br /> Only a remarkable moment is a reference to Bozo Klaun, a cartoon character shared by L & H comedian Larry Harmon. Harmon, of course, bought the name copyright (as disturbing he saw Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-author and producer of this travesty. <br /> <br /> Questions are based. Would Stan and Ollie, if they were alive today, scare gags? Would there be glass mummies with broken bottles? Will you stand in the genitals with a spear and end up on the big CGI final? Hopefully not. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think it was unbelievable how terrible it is. Why was this film the first one? Who do they think she likes it? Perhaps the worst film I've ever seen, the absolute courage I was getting worse with watching the first five minutes. Probably as much fun as having his head trapped in a vice, while red hot humility and stabbing urticaria forcibly place the back passage.
