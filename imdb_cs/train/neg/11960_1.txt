In fact, I left the Asian horror films some time ago after I was completely overwhelmed by the fact that I saw the same haunted stories. However, I have been more and more exploited recently and decided to give them another chance. My first portal was a highly rated director Takashi Miike with a highly rated "visitor Q". I've seen Audition, and while I did not like it, I think it's one of the better modern Asian horrors. So I came into this with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately, he found nothing but boredom. I suppose this movie is really really smart and it just went over my head, but what seemed to me was just a collection of violent and unpleasant scenes with little or no coherence between them. Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blatant for me; everything Miike did is shoot a movie; any intelligence that surrounds him was made by fake fans, desperately looking for meaning. My headache is after about ten minutes (after the father of sex with his daughter for some reason), and it did not disappear until the film finally ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seems. Do not get me wrong, I'm not against film violence, and I'm actually actively looking for the best-known movies in the neighborhood; but even if it can be violent, it is also useless and boring and I have not gotten one of them. Takashi Miike can have a lot of fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope this will be the last time I get in touch with one of his films.
