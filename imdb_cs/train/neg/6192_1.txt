Robert Carmichael's great ecstasy is a bad film in every direction. Scenario, bad tempo, lack of depth of any character, unnecessary partial drawings, terrible behavior, unnecessary climax seem to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I have found nothing pleasant, entertaining, or intellectually stimulating. I imagine the filmmakers thought they were doing something smarter and darker, with mood lighting, long prolonged silences, and vaguely penetrating classical soundtracks. If they did, they completely failed. It just bored me and I wish I could never see it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
