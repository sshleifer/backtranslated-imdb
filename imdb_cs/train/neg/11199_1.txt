The turbulent pace of this film is poisoning us for any shocks it could provide. There was no real tension. Most of the characters were uncomfortable. The crazy Irish priest was as weak as love interest. Interest is misleading. The girl who has decided to provide the sensuality of the film may be better. The central conflict of the main character was uninteresting. This film is completely built. It's like the boring exercise of someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but anyway.
