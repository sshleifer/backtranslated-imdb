*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I'm really doing it and doing it with an incredible role. I see how it is a movie that looks good like a screenplay, but it's complicated, unlikely, and ultimately stupid. I saw a false death that ended miles away. Rene Z. tries hard with the signed part, like Patricia Arquette. Detective, whose name I do not remember (who is not Chris Penn), is a great actor swept up. Find out if you are not smart enough to distinguish between a movie that is so clever that you can not watch it, so do not think you can not understand it. Find out if you like working with friends who make you seaside. Find out if you'd like to watch Tim Roth work with an unpleasant script. See if it's free late at night. Otherwise, hiring the usual suspects.
