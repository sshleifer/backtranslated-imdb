Usually I do not have time to give the comments that many people read about movies that few people will see. However, in this case, I feel like I have to warn all those who can realize it. I just watched it five minutes ago. It's just one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The game is terrible, there is no such thing, and production values ​​are, in the best case, poverty. I know even a low-budget movie can be great, but not this one. It's just a thing that could save this movie for all the horror fans - more on screen gore and slashing! The total sum of three times what happens is off the screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens - especially the end scene - it just is not enough. The movie is too long because it is a minimal content, too heavy a dialogue, and it is almost impossible to watch. What happened? To make it all in a nutshell with free space, three teenage girls irresponsibly and deliberately drove off the isolated area where more than 20 girls had been kidnapped and murdered before. Their car, of course, falls apart and is taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people - one of them a psychotic killer. All three are finally murdered, one after another, out of the screen, after what looks like an eternity of dull, slow dark nonsense. As I said, the only thing worth watching once is murder. Please do not buy it or do it just for it, and do not confuse me as if I was misleading box art and movie description. Save money and time.
