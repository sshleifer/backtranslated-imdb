Such big actors such a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays a terrible character, the movie is not funny at all, the subconscious message is seeing "It's Damn Crap!", "It's Soaked Up!", "Watching the TV Window", and soon. It's just disgusting and unpleasant. In addition to a crazy plot, the sense of humor is different. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. Usually I do not care about the decoration in the movie, but it's been annoyed by "Free Money". Avoid at all costs! "Free money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer does nothing! One watches him at the price of common sense.
