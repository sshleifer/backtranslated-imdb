I wrote some notes here at the first strength, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell-fest ... 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently accused of defeating his wife and serving time in jail. I just hope he can find Armani prison clothes going in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of this film is to see his police detective dressed in $ 4500 designer coats, a $ 7300 designer of a silk suit, and seeing his $ 3500 / month Los Angeles Mace Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) The leading lady Tracey Phillips has beautiful porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seemed to be spinning, and amazing breasts in the second half of the film designer silk sweater that sadly stays on place over her hull even though she was ready to be sacrificed to Satan. At least in the seventies, our demonic killers stripped their victims before they got rid of them, though there is something we can say that we are leaving the imagination a little. During the last ten minutes of the movie I can only think about how her breasts would look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Los Angeles professional psychics can afford $ 4 million on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles, with Brad Pitt deciding to ruin it. In fact, the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one that was seen in David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR., Who at least had a good sense to be his successful film director. The only professional psychics I have met outside of this film are all currently subject to imprisonment. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain in this movie is wonderful and his "How's it go" Buddy Boy? "line could be the best overlooked movie phrase from" Thanks for driving, Lady! " from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under the main metropolitan cities there are huge vapors of dusty acids that explode into giant fire balls if someone throws them into the Zippo lighter, which is why large public waterworks do not pollute There are no signs of smoking even though the idea of ​​smoking around the dangerous water is of course absurd, and since Zippo lighters need to be filled by hand with a lighter fluid that can often escape and be absorbed in one dress, the thought of carrying one of them into a pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci silk suit looks to me more dangerous. <br /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this movie are impressive, the smallest, and one of the fun and things to watch it stays alone that you do not see computer-aided special effects but real stuntpeople risking life and limbs to contribute a movie that gained almost universal BOMB ratings from critics when it was released. <br /> <br /> 7) Movie Satanists always amaze me: Here is a man who has tried to get some luciferous power for action, and yet instead to use it to do something useful, such as being wealthy or causing fashion models to engage in free sex with him, he instead has ladies' bags and have them levitate outside the flats of people. Speaking of being a man who is indestructible, he can fly and be able to put his creature into the body of other people - yet at the end of the film, Lou Diamond Phillips star with ordinary fistfight, but he does not have a good sense of habitation for Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creeda to make sure she wins. <br /> <br /> And farther and farther ... To be seen in the wise junkies when drinking beer. You will have fun until you continually refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
