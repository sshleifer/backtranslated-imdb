I wonder who is responsible for this mess. Jokes would not work for Gilligan Island. If it was going to be a series, they would be Vocus about Auschwitz, or should Eve replace the oven, only to Adolf suggest the type that has 50 seats? Another post compared this show with Lucy. The problem is that Lucille Ball was brilliant in physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was simply wrong and offended by my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage the Nazis did to England and the number of people they killed, I would think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem nasty and most normal people would kill this concept before any episode was made .
