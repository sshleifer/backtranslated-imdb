The movie had a cute opening, I really believed that I was one of the best romantic comedies I saw a while ago ... there was something strange about the alien way the film was made, realistic but somewhat abstract and mystical. But the story has become increasingly unrealistic. I would say the end is CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost underestimated ... The most typical romantic end, when everything goes great for every "sympathetic" character. The scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and chasing the "wife of her dreams" just to admit her love for her before a good crowd of visitors. Come in. Eventually, "good boys" will win, "bad boys" will lose ... You get a picture. WASTE OF potentially interesting film.
