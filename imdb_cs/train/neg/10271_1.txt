This movie had to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The game was terrible, horrible and cheesy and spoke of a predictable plot! He will never watch this movie, nor do I recommend this movie. What a waste of time! First, once the movie started, I found out what I was getting. Everything they did for this film copied scenes from many other horror films, and they all stacked it in this movie. Funny phone calls, halloween night, psycho and one knife! It's totally absurd. I did not worry during the movie, which I thought would be horror films. As for film making, it's pretty pretty, as everyone talks about how this movie was so great and so scary. I mean, you do not realize that movies are, for example, cheap to break away from a "scary movie". At least take some good actors and then it might be downloaded as a good horror movie.
