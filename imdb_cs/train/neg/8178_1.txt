Have you ever sat watching the movie after 20 or 30 minutes, and suddenly you realize that you actually saw the movie? That happened to me with "Young graduates". The videotape envelope, if you find a video, is extremely deceptive. I swear that the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. Anyway, I was born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this movie, or ... it is simply unnecessary junk. I'm strongly inclined towards the other, but I think some have evolved into a relationship with this movie. Hmm ... fence. Plot. We'll see ... somewhere there must be a plot. No, I can not find it. It is quite a lot of the fact that some university seniors behave and do drugs and speak in a language that was obsolete a decade ago. One of the students has their teachers. The teacher has a cool woman (who is actually called an iceberg), so she is receptive to the progress of the girl. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of driving around and unpleasant dialogue and spastic lots of dances. Our cat, BooBoo, was overwhelmed by high school dance children. She watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrus and explode on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
