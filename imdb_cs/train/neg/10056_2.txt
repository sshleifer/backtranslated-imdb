So ... we can see the added shots of Brando ... interesting, but not exactly what they deserve Oscar. Susannah York was not nearly dirty. The new scene, where Lois finds out that Clark is Superman, is a bit unbelievable because he does not notice that the gun comes from a blank spot of real beads. The real charges would penetrate into his clothes and then bounce back to the floor, but they forgot to ... listen to Donner as he likes the Lister version, which makes a more logical sense. The president talks about Zod's "dismantling" Washington's memorial when he was originally Mount Rushmore. Just such a scene made the line totally absurd. The Superman's "freedom of the press" sounded silly in comparison to "Outside Career", which was delivered better and had a connection with Clark's earlier scene at the truck stop. Then it is the end with the effect of "turning the world back into time". Everything came back in the whole movie and wondered where exactly the rocket designed for Hackensack, New Jersey had ever gone because it was no longer releasing Zoda and society.
