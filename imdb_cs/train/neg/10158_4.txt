I could not help, but I thought behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon (a massively stunning movie) in watching this reality for a realistic goal and a great innovative idea. this could be a great movie. acting is ... from some actors alright. from the rest ... it is totally terrible. <br /> <br /> It's a great idea and the format is great. the story is quite good, though it often suffers from big blows to the logical mind. Do not forget that even if it's right? it is, after all, a horror movie. I really want to see this remake ... I really want it to be a fantastic movie that wants to be. <br /> <br /> (and you can not really break the mind behind the movie for this), of course, it's built on the string budget. and FX really hurt the movie overall. <br /> <br /> great movie. ... if you exchange for some better acting and a little better fx. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
