I'll tell one thing, Jeanette and Nelson - though they are hopeless, helpless, painfully painful like this one, still shining. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is there, even though the paper is thin. Even if the score is practically a bouncer, it does not exist depending on a few catchy tunes. And even if the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for fantasy. It is true that he has more chemistry with Nelson than with his own life Gene Raymond in SMILIN 'THROUGH, which was, however, a much better film. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I like Jeanette and Nelson just like other fans, but this is the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more embarrassing in her "hep" number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come out with a blank look when he encounters the hottest situations. <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what it was like on Broadway in 1938. It certainly had to have more joke and style than is evident in this mild MGM production. Edward Everett Horton blows in an unsuccessful role, and none of the supporting players can breathe any mood of life into this mess. It's like an amateur night in the studio, even with a few professionals that have been occupied. <br /> <br /> Summary: The painful rendering of the musical Rodgers and Hart. He can not recommend even the fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And even if Jeanette kept up with her beautiful gossamer beauty, this film is a bad one.
