I'm a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very missing. The original conspiracy and plot of conspiracy were obvious and could have been estimated in advance, even years before today's modern detective shows. It was fun to see crazy models of sofas and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, the obligatory suburban humor that is sold for fun in modern art. High-tech at home is Jetson's or Disney's Tomorrowland version and it's fun to think about writers who invent these "exhausting gizmos." If it's sunny outside, go play because it's a much better Columbo episode. Still, we should be grateful for cable television that these episodes are broadcast.
