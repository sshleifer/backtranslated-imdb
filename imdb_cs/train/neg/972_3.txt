It was a disappointing horror film about a young girl and her nightmares. For horror or "thriller" film and hype, it's too tame. There are only a few tense moments, nowhere near as close to what it should be for the film of this genre. Even those "tense" scenes were not much. Music made them a more dramatic fact that they were in fact. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism, so elite critics call this film a "horror idea of ​​man." Well, if he thinks about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion that I did - losing money at a video store. Summary: a coil that offers an insurmountable lead character and generally poor performance. Excessively overstated and definitely not what is being advertised.
