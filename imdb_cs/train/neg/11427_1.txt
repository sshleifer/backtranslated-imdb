I do not know who is the director of this movie, Sue Kramer, but I have a strong suspicion that A) is a lesbian and that B) somehow scared all the participants in this project to prove they were not homophobic. br /> <br /> I can imagine that everyone thinks: "My God, it's terrible, it's not funny, walker." But keep your mouth shut because of fear of being labeled anti-homosexual or "not getting" a homosexual lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer did NOT HAPPY homosexual people to play homosexual people.) However, it's not even good to evaluate. Actors are all directed to play every scene across the top, so there is no sincerity or credibility in what they do. It's a full clich√© and there's nothing about this movie that's the least fun - much less fun. I hate it, and I'm not afraid to say it. It is a shame that the people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb were not so unhappy in their judgment.
