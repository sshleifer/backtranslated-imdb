I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline-esque ads, but I thought I'd give him a chance. So I watched it and all I can say is that it's flea. This movie was so bad. It's rare that I hate that movie. Watching this image reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman's "The Player" when writers present their bizarre ideas to manufacturers. I would like to know which MTV maker has decided that an hour and a half long video clip Bronte (but this time Heathcliff's name is Heath and it's a rock star and Hindley's name is Hendrix), it's going to be a good idea. /> <br /> It might not even be so bad if they did not get so badly into every other aspect of the movie. The direction had to be "you are lonely, loops for me." I struck out loud during all the "serious" scenes and was bored during the rest of the day. Working with the camera was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that I was looking at a bad movie that was trying to be nervous. My theory is that the guy was bored and went down to the beach with a few beers with his boom - everything I heard in the middle of the scene was waves. And in the other scenarios, I want it to be all I've heard. And when we talk about the sound, what the song "Sisters of Mercy" is doing is totally inexcusable, then it is again inexcusable what Bronte did. On the bright side there was a fun scene - specifically when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl's face - and if you could tell me what the scene was like with the other story, more power.
