There is no real story that we should not talk about, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and unreasonable sex (which can sometimes be fun, but it's not like that). What else can I ... about? Action action when it happens is inventive and there is a cool scene where two characters fall from a skyscraper (one that must be several kilometers tall), but overall there is not much to recommend "Kite". See if you want, but you do not lose much when you miss this one ...
