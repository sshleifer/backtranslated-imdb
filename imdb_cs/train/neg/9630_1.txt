I realize that a few films from Ben Stiller are or will be this year, but maybe they should insist on quality, not on quantity. I was amazed at what the filmmakers considered to be a comedy in "Along Came Polly." <br /> <br /> Reuben Stiller is a grate, no charm, and ranks among the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick starts to bother. Undoubtedly, he has a comic talent, but he has to either find another schtick or take a break, find some material that's really fun. Because his films are painfully humorous to unbearably ill. There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good, intelligent actress with a promising career. Until he continues filming other films like "Good Girl" (in which she is amazing) and less like "Along Came Polly," she will have a career she could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome the ragged material he works with, but it's an unreal task for every actress. Except for a few moments with Alec Baldwin, like Reuben's boss Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben's best friend Sandy, there's nothing funny about this terrible movie. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria is an accent not just stupid, it's terribly unfortunate. The premise of "Along Came Polly" surely showed a promise. Unfortunately, she needed a writer who could really do it out of a good comedy, instead of the lame, boring, boring justification for comedy.
