I gave it more than 1 because I thought there was some moral lesson in this story, and I had some thoughts and comments from my wife and me. And the negotiations and the dialogue were average and I must confess that I felt the feeling It was broken down overhead, that's God, and Christ is our Savior. The film and the story did not need it. If, like me, you are a recovering Catholic or Christian, avoid this, cause you to learn. The film tried to show the thin line between a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker about what might be.
