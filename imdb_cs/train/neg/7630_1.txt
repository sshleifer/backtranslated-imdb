Boring film about a boring town in the 1950s. How can anyone think it's a classic? The producer largely ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several films that were far beyond her acting skills. I think this film gives insight into how bad future movies will be Peter Bogdonovic. Cybla Shepard's career has submerged after several films produced by Peter Bogdonovic. Until Moonlighting, her career began to return. I thought acting is a bad release "Graduate". I noticed that this film was not shown in the US. The only place I saw overseas in Europe was late at night.
