OK, I did not have great expectations, but this movie went down to a depth I could not imagine. While the plot consisted of a priest of an obscure two-member order investigating the death of the founder, the order of the sinner. The Sin Eater allows Catholics to achieve salvation beyond the authority of the Church, and is another immortal in a movie with plenty of ennui. Remember, it does not make sense since Baptist could give you salvation ... we will go on. I will recognize what he does without giving much power: the priest goes to Rome with his friend to invest. He brings with him a mental patient who shot him during the excoriation and who loves him (not a lollipop of this BTW), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller as a cardinal. They get to Rome, find some scary children who do nothing in the movie, meet the S & M slave anti-pope, who the drunken Irish guy knows (who is not explained) and who gives the information by killing people (oh, BTW, he's a bad guy, so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. conspiracy is happening. Heath Winter with a sinner eats to New York with a sinful sinner for nicknames and then something else happens and then (everyone outside the camera) falls antipopes and the film ends. Within an hour in the movie, I really wonder if something happened. By the end, something has happened, but you can not be sure it matters, and because most of the drama takes place either before you move or even feel cheated.
