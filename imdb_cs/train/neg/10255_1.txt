It's got Christopher Lee, he has the huge banks of the 1970s that make Teletype sounds when letters appear on the screen, they have radioactive isotopes that not only shine in the dark, but they emit vibrant noisy sounds, volcanoes! evil aliens masked like nuns! tidal waves! earthquake! exploding cars! exploding coffee makers! and as a climax the whole planet will explode. How did this film succeed on Earth so incredibly, DULL wondered? The answer, my friend, is that 90% of this film is made up of shots, most of which include long tracks, dolls or combinations, or sometimes all three that do nothing except the crew does something. There are endless scenes of our protagonists who get in and out of the cars, go again, walk around, look at things, get in the car, and go ... I just sat there looking at the endless show of nothingness in an angry daze. "Say something, please someone, just say something ... do something ... anything ..." <br /> <br /> The dialogue when it comes is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours." was typically an insignificant line. The script will culminate with the destruction of the world by the songs justified in this speech by Lee as the main alien: "Planet Earth radiates an excessive amount of disease, contaminating the universe All the planets that give themselves up by light will suffer until they are destroyed!" /> This is the writing of the Neanderthal SF scripts. This is the kind of motivation you can find in Japanese 1950s monstrosity suits for seven-year-olds. It is and I gather such things, the richest line of English SF Buster Crabbe's SF has retired. He is losing the belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who always caught me as a smart and useful actor with a certain knowledge of his borders as if he wanted to kill his agent to get him into the stack. I do not blame him.
