Blades, blades, blades !!! The 90-minute fringe-fest, which is 89 minutes long. A mature environment with the atmosphere and opportunity (deserted monastery) is absorbed in a stinking scenario full of clumsy, ruthless dialogue that is bent, so hard to be sideways. Mostly, it's just embarrassing, and gonzo's horror attempts are flat (a demonstration of this film's dialogue: after a demonstration of her artillery, a quick cut has reached out to a detailed observation of Barbeau's alert character: "Any Questions?" Hyuck hyuck hyuck). Badly acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes, and judging from creative effects, the director seems to have watched "Evil Dead" too many times. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends a great time to rent this turkey and give them nineteen lost minutes that will never come back. What is a turd.
