... and I saw some bad ones. <br /> <br /> I have no good to say about this movie. Jennifer Tilly is a poor acting - as you can expect. Daryl Hannah does the job well, but nothing close to saving this movie. The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though on the basis of a good assumption - that the writer has resorted to a "silly hero trick" to create utter tension. When Daryl Hannah had to hide, she ran out before the pursuer. The sick scene is absurd. Without revealing too much of what is going on for the plot, I think it would be difficult for a woman from the bloody small body of the hospital to be pregnant without having noticed her. Lame. Very lame. <br /> <br /> Save time and choose the next movie.
