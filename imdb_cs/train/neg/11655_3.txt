I was very disappointed with this film. I thought "Scary Movie", though not a great movie, was very good and fun. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny and sometimes stupid. Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. I admit I'm at a disadvantage because I have not seen some of the films that parody, unlike the ones I've seen basically. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie was the timing that destroyed some of the good jokes. Scenes and jokes attract the way to a long one. <br /> <br /> The same jokes are also repeated. For example, a talking bird. Okay, it was funny first and maybe the second time. But she kept repeating until the point was unpleasant. The routine between the guy on the wheelchair and Hans (Chris Elliott) was initially fun, but it kept repeating and ended up stupid and even tasteless. Some jokes even recur from the first movie. For example, the "shouting" that you would call Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in the "haunted movie" because Cindy went on to give her boyfriend sex so long he had basically a blue balls of hell and it was funny, when she "cured" her. But this time it was in place and not fun. Bathroom and sexual humor were generally more fun and time-consuming. Tori Spelling was uncomfortable and in fact had no place in this movie. But I enjoyed Shorty (Marlon) Wayans, which, in my opinion, was the most entertaining figure in the first film. The scene with him and the pottery was one of my favorites from the second film. Do not get me wrong, I love Wayans' family and their humor. That's why this movie is so disappointing. . . they have a much more comical ability than endless jokes.
