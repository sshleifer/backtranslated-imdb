Who could sympathize with these two unpleasant protagonists? What is intended to be a light, stupid comedy about neighboring children who can not give up their children's game that dares, even when they get into adulthood, comes more like exercising in cruelty and cuddling self-responsibility. As children, the couple are unbearably premature; as adults are intolerant. It's a bad combination.
