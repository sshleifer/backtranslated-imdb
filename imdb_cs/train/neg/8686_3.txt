I refer to this as a "spoiler" just for some of my comments on the content of the show, not the content itself. <br /> <br /> When I read the comments, it is obvious that these Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but they despise it while the Democrats apparently enjoy their so-called truth. One reader even (so it seems) actually indicates that he believes these events were or could have happened when Bush was in elementary school. But as for content, as I see it, I try to be neutral, it is that the group that made this series must actually be Bush hate. In the episode I saw last time, s02e03, it turned out that the program had to be set up long before McCain became the lead runner of the nomination; because all the other former assailants are all. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of adding to the cabinets. I thought the series had to be safe in Europe not in the US, because in the US I do not know any home that does not have built-in cabinets and probably in the artists' homes. <br /> <br /> When I look at the show, yes, I'm about to capture it, I am amazed when I see what must be the amazing desire of the writers to do what they can to put us in jeopardy. Surely there are problems like most Americans will agree, but that's no reason to be so hateful in public projects seen around the world. Maybe this trend has now been set by this show and network, so if both or Hillary got it, will they continue to produce and broadcast the same kind of "humor" about them? One more comment comments commentator. If there had been any change in the election in 2000, the writer was so sure he would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, pious thought from his side. As far as events 911 are concerned, I believe it was launched when he was President Clinton, and I do not know if Gore would be President, it would be totally different.
