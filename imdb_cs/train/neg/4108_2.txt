Ok, the story does not make sense, the characters lack any dimension, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of the film, the cinematography is grim, and the edits save a little confusion, but Sam "Peckinpah drove the film And that for somebody whose direction is not enough for those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this film is a disappointment, and even a great cast does not manage to redeem the time that the audience with this minimal effort collects. The correct reaction to the film is contempt that director San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young are bringing their work.
