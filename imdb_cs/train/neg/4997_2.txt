... but it is certainly not merciless. The writer-director Preston Sturges is already experimenting with unusual cinematographic effects while telling his stories, creating widely-drawn yet different characters and situations and writing a clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (It's no surprise that the next Coen Brother film will be a tribute to Sturges.) The main problem is that the plot is not yet; lack of surprise, unexpected conspiracy plot, and sudden change of happiness that guessed the audience. The slogan of coffee is a bad thing on which the plot lies, and the end is highly predictable. Frank Capra does it much better. If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" first. If you've already seen them, go ahead and watch this.
