Is good. Is wrong. And then it's The Sentinel, a political "thriller" that ranks among the worst movies I've ever seen. The story of the butterfly in the secret service is good, but never has a movie with such a great potential so completely obscured. Director Clark Johnson, with a "skinny" blushing hand, seems to be working on an autopilot in every movie actor. Even Big Michael Douglas looks bored. I can honestly say that I've never seen another film with so many bright conspiracies all my life. The reversal is predictable from the square and the motives of the characters are so ridiculous that they inspired laughter from viewers. Avoid it at all costs. This is the disaster of a movie without redemption.
