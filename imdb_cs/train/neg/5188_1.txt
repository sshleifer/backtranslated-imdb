TV pilots, do not you like them? Quinn Martin tried to do that because he was successful in many other TV detective films, but this is not the case except in the MST area he belongs to. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head, who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find the super spies Ledyoy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are for ethnic comic relief and not much. The tree sucks like a bad man, despite all the disguises that make it just as usual. There is more than a natural cloth than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970s) and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why did not it come in a series? Explain it, it's quite spectacular. Again, it's fun for MST, but not too much!
