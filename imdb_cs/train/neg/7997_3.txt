Even for a tired movie model like a cycle of nature vs. the man who predominated predominantly in the 1970s, the ants are falling unhappily, albeit somewhat effective (though amusing for reasons they did not intend). That's so scary. These ants, who are near the inn, seem to have eaten poisonous waste for decades and now have adapted themselves to the poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites are fatal. Watching actors of some notoriety clumsily falling in the middle of tiny black spots is painfully entertaining in not so good - but very bad way. So many scenes just look sad: a boy who tries to attack the warehouse while being attacked, Suzanne Sommers horrifies while lying in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathe the pieces of the wallpaper, Bernie Casey pretends the boundary of her legs and the list goes on and on. The threat displayed ranges from ants that crawl from the drain to the black lines of ants across the wall. The cast of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy must have this horror sit on a wheelchair. I hope she found a good benefit for money because it is obvious that this was the only reason why a woman in her family tree should be in this nonsense. Although it's a pretty bad movie, it's observable - once for me, and has many of the seventies's poor film quality - starring actors who are embarrassed about what happened to television and the dreaded creatures of nature on humans. This time, one has to push his hand into a pile of ants to be hit. Really terrible.
