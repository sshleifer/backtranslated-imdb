The story is a bit slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good, and I could not understand half the things she said because of her accent that was exaggerated for that role. Melvyn Douglas plays her usual and insurmountable role, and Constance Bennett is just - except for a few screamings that were fun. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the movie. I wish he had more lines when he disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting to see that Ruth Gordon looks so young. I saw her only in the crazy roles she played from the late sixties until the late 1980s and the frightened old women. Story-wise, the best part could be the last few minutes when we see some stuntman doing awesome skiing things, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes. It was amazing and humorous shots. Overall, I see where this film - Garbo's last - was not a boxing success. It just stretches too much, it's about fraud. It's an unpleasant story. Garbo also knew it and called for it to end.
