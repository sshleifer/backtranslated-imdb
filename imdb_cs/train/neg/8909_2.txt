This film is chaotic and not fun at all. The story does not make sense. Some scientists working on the edge of science open the door to another dimension (perhaps hell), and his daughter sucks him or something, then one day without the obvious reason to come back and now he has big breasts and he wears modest Outfit (I think the demons in another dimension did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but he's gay, so he's obviously interested in his new girlfriend, and they're wondering about this witch (they want to be witches or something?) and the evil spell ends up reading again, which is the way the evil demon comes to the ground that only the bikini top girl and the blurred guy in love seems to stop. There is no Topless scene without reason, and the guy in what my friend says is a well-known wrestler but his part is totally useless, apparently they were doing something just to get him into it because then maybe the match fans will actually watch this insignificant film. I'm sure the girls will not hurt at the top. The special features on the DVD were even more confused than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on, but in fact it just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what do they do? Basically, it's a go-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie, but there are a lot of things (like the second dimension and the book retailer) to be confusing. I did not like the movie, but it was just like five dollars so big a problem. I do not recommend watching it, even if it was just stupid, I can not think of any part of the movie that would be good.
