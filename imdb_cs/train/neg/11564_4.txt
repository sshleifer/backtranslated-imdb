Italian horror / thrilling film about a wealthy English lord who goes out for pubs for those red-haired girls, just like his late wife Evelyn. You know he really loved his wife because he brought them to his home-a huge rotting castle-and abused them and then tortured, whipped, and killed them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that we see the end of the film in some way as the hero of this film played by Antonio De Teffe. Anyway, soon, under the direction of his uncle Robert Malder, De Teffe will settle down with the girl he will meet with his uncle. It moves and begins to do strange things with the fragile state of De Teffe's mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, well, look at the title if you are still curious. Family members and friends also begin to die in the most brutal way. Poor Aunt Agatha (she seems to be even younger than De Teffe and she has her on a wheelchair and tries to look old), meets her fate in love. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there's a whole explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some things quite well: setting in the movie is good for this movie, even though he tries to believe us that England is at best absurd. None of the actors look English. Many who have dark black hair and Mediterranean skin and clothes, the Englishman would not be captured dead. Cars are driving on their wrong side of the road. However, despite the fact that the cipher scene was effectively shot and I liked the Sith resolution. And, of course, every movie with a whimsical, red-brown Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a bar of sexual perversion; however, it seemed a bit frightening that the torture of women was perfectly good and healthy to relieve one of his mental demons. Come on.
