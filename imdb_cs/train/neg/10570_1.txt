Do not let the MPAA be deceived with their "R rated for extreme violence" there definitely is no extreme violence in this dull pizza with * t. I expected some cheap rambo 3 action that the trailer promised but its only boring boring nonsense with a lot of poor slow memories that make no sense. AVOID!
