Part of GEORGE 2 is on TV recently, but I could not get to follow her until the end. It's scary! I do not even remember the plot. I only know that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula from the first film that was bad enough. There are plenty of circles around but the direction and editing were so motionless and torn, it was like watching outtakes or erased scenes. Having the original voice of Ape The Back Ape was not enough to fill me. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst sequel I've ever seen, and it says something. Jeez, due to the 10-line IMDb rule, I have to continue writing when I have nothing to say about this continuation of the krapulastic film for television. Disney, hang in shame.
