I want to put this piece of GARBAGE badly wrong, unfortunately there is not, so I had to give him 1 just to warn you how silly the terrible the cheater of the famous cartoon really is! The characters look as if they were cartooned, no, wait, I saw the preschoolers better! I prefer "the bad story of Flapjack" to this dreadful justification for the cartoon! I probably say what others have said, two words: RIP OFF! Do not forget the episode of the Dexter lab when they were racing karts with this volcano? Yeah, Mr. Fellows even got the idea and failed! They even even suffered Shadow Lugia in the episode that parodyed Pokemon! (He even took part in it)! One of the characters is cheap from Mandarka from Dexter's lab! Mr. Fellows must be sued for legal violation for this cache. Everyone has their own opinion, but those who like Test Johnny (RIP-OFF), you lie your lie. Make a favor, change the channel when this ripping attempts to damage the screen!
