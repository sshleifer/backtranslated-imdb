Ah WINTER KILLS, based on the novel by Richard Condon, which deals with a plot that killed the President of the United States 20 years ago. I knew that Condon also wrote MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, who dealt with a similar topic and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLS left me cold. It's not a thriller - it's a bit of worthless bullshit, perhaps the worst movie I've seen this month, and in June I've seen a lot of bad movies. The problem lies in both the direction and the scenario and see how William Richert was responsible for being totally accused of this unhappy farce. There are two things wrong in the movie. First is the way in which everything is presented at the top. It's not like OTT, as they say something like James Bond's film with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but everything has a horrible edge for actors who completely block their performance. This could be justified if the value of the movie was fun, but nothing is. Like satire, it's very silly, so stupid it's almost inconsistent. Secondly, the scenes seem to have been shot so much that they are useless. Take a scene, for example, where the hero is confronted with a werewolf named Dawson. Dawson tells the hero who has been behind for 30 seconds and then breaks the hero on board the plane. Scenes begin and end with no cold or reason. <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie,
