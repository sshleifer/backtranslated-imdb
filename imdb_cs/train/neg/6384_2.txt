I recently looked at pages that contained movies in a public house. In my long list of films, this film was and I thought I had to hallucinate such offensive title and presumption. No, that's really what it was. And because the movie was only about 27 minutes, I decided to try. If it turned out to be a porn movie, I would stop looking. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of around $ 49, to create a Star Trek movie about the crew of very homosexual men traveling around the galaxy and extinguishing female oppression by killing all women - just as Earth is doing! And in any case, they met with enthusiasm and thanks to today's homosexual men on the planet. <br /> <br /> Tiny, this is not. With some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters I've ever heard, I do not think I can write them to IMDb without my reviews being removed! However, despite the total dirtiness of all, it was strangely observable and worth seeing. But as I have already mentioned, because of gross names and strange subjects (though no nudity) it's just an adult movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me 1001 questions about who would do it, why it will do and WHO was the intended audience ?! Maybe this is not absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's the happiest and maybe even the most offensive!
