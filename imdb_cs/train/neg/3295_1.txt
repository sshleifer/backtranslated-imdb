... then you'd better not watch this movie. They completely destroyed the presumption of the exhibition. In the movie, boys are duchess idiots, Daisy is stupid, Roscoe is ominous, Boss Hogg is able, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters. At least Enos is a bit close. <br /> <br /> At one point, the door opens to get to General Lee - nuff said. The original show might not have been great TV, but it was fun and the characters made sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets a simple life.
