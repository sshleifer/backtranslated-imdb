I got the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday and people always say that the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong. At least with a movie that has already ended. <br /> <br /> Actor's acting is terrible what I expected from Shaq's movie, which plays a magical rap genie that comes from the old blaster ghetto (which was probably a good reason why he was imprisoned there). A child in the movie Max plays is a henchman and a terrible actor. He is bullied by neighboring children, which I do not blame because it's a little douche bag. The story is simply stupid and extremely clich√©. He always works for a boy who is a father and never finds a new friend around him who would improve his life and help him again with his father. Even at the age of 8, I thought it was a stupid idea. It is a surprise that some of the people who worked on this film had a career after departments because it is embarrassing and should never be done. I could have even more fun about how this movie is angry, but you should already know by simply reading a plot.
