Anyone who said that it is better than a Hostel is talking bullshit, believe me I'm not a fan of Hostel, but that's just ridiculous. This is the next shot on your camcorder, right on DVD, low loss of ideas from your time, I can not believe how many of these movies are and still seems decent. In the 1980s, gore and horror films shot out without any budget, but a great story and a lot of new ideas, and especially the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they seem to be exhausted in trying to trick people who are going through Blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing this, so I think these movies will still appear. This movie is so low that it's just amazing how it ever happened that acting is also terrible that its place is totally unconvincing and that the soundtrack is so annoying that it drives in conviction. This waste of time does not happen at all unless you are on the way to compiling a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of the movie is when a female figure shows someone on a gun and threatens to shoot them if they do not come back and see that they do not even notice the trigger with your finger just hold the handle. Absolute joke.
