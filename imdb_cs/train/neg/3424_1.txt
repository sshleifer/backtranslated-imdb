You have never seen a movie and you still know that Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How did that happen?" Because if you exchange someone and tell them to make a movie, they'll do it. <br /> <br /> The question is, "Why, why did Steve Martin let it happen?" I think he needed the money to fight the harassment, and he decided he would not spare him anything. He knew that the sequel would be so terrible that he would not even count on pride in being income taxes. <br /> <br /> The only way this continuation could not be embarrassed was that Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revived the most popular poor black family. And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just plain that you've been working in some sad capacity on this movie and the only way you can feel better in your engagement is to continue as a lonely cheerleader as IMDb user commentary. I prayed for you to become a satire, but unfortunately you really did make the effort to turn around. Why not 10 stars?
