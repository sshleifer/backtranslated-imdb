I can not believe I was watching what she expected more. We'll start all right. This film moves the boundaries of reality so far! At least the first one was somewhat realistic. He renounces the first film and even mentions the Joshua project. Anyone who knows anything about computers hates this movie. But it has one good message, though, EXPOSE TO THE GREAT BROTHER! The film really reminds you that the big brother is much bigger than he really is. That was very bad. Even the make-up on the actors was totally bad. Some actors are pretty good. Some actors are really bad. The screenplay was OK and completely confused in other parts. This movie plays for comfort about every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I watched he was expecting more. I think I will jump in the original to get back to the floor ... Q
