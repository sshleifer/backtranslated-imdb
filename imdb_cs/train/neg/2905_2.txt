Expectation was a bit tall when I went to see this movie, after all, I thought Steve Carell could not really enjoy great movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. I'll start with what's fine with this movie: in some places Steve Carell can be Steve Carell. There are a few moments in the movie that made me laugh, and that's almost because he was given a quiet room to do his thing. He is undoubtedly a talented person, and it is a pity he has subscribed to what, in my opinion, proved to be a total train. <br /> <br /> I will discuss this by scaring the horror. The film begins with Dan Burns, a widow with three girls who are considered a national syndicated council. He prepares his girls for a family meeting, where his relatives are gathered for some time. Family is high on the list of things that make this terrible movie. No family will behave like this. It's almost as if they were transported from Pleasantville or left behind by Beaver. They are a cartoon of what we think is a family when we are 7. They are a place where they become uncomfortable and simply frustrating. Touch soccer, crossword contests, family bowling and talent shows are NOT how real people behave. It's almost bad. Another big mistake is the Carell woman who should fall. Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman, which comes out as slightly slowed down. This brings me to the idea that this movie is taking place on another planet. I left theater and thought about what I just saw. After another thought, I do not think it was a lot.
