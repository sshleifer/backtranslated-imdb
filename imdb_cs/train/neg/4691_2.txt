Great blowing of the film literally. This British film is boring. What an exciting plot! Terrorist places bombs on the train. How could writers and producers of this scent make such a boring story? Glenn Ford, as a bumbleblowing expert, gets a lot of writing material. Naturally, just as he is called, his wife, Anne Vernon, is going to leave him. No wonder we have never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, she would end her career. The older man who loved trains and intervenes is our senile dementia in 1953. I thought it was very insulting to show a man, even at the end.
