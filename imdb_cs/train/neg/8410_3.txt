This movie is lightning and no soul. Actors have put a lot of passion in the numbers, but these numbers have often not joined the movie and felt like separate music videos. And no effort has been made to make the numbers heard as if they were doing right in front of you, each one sounding like his coming from the studio that basically sucks all the life of the songs. On the stage, the performances were all boring and unrealized, especially Hudson, who plays the same fuss, the "strong" (stubborn and selfish) black woman we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth of her character or any other woman. Even though I think the movie wants us to believe Hudson's character faces trouble because of her weight, it's really her own refusal to do what's best for the team that gets her into trouble so the end of the movie is totally insignificant. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she made emotions (though it was often bad, but it was the blame of a writer / director), but when she was acting she did nothing to reveal an already imprinted character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with an arc, and he did a great job, but Oscar is not good. The only actor who really did something in the role was Danny Glover, who took a small, rather insignificant character and made it something real. There's nothing you can get into teeth, no drama or heart, or even laugh. The location of musical numbers was so bad that sometimes the film almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one; the number that Hudson talks to other girls is so long if it was possible that he could go on a family guitar. The film has no idea what it is about, and I felt offended in the last few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and it's really the worst movie I've ever seen in 2006, and nothing of last year was really stellar.
