What does Franco Zeffirelli mean? Was Hollywood responsible for this harassment, or am I satisfied with the idea that someone who did not speak English as the first language simply lacked the point of classic Charlotte Bronte? I do not think I can improve on the comment I read below, so I just paraphrase: "Jane Eyre is a great book, a screenwriter should read it sometime." It is true that the two films of this film were sadly bad. But the actor's regret because the screenwriter missed all the best scenes. A dialogue that makes you understand that Jane and Rochester have a meeting of mind and a common sense of fun ... removed from the script. Marriage proposal, cashier ... gone. Memories, half-joking, half-honestly, Jane as a fairy tale from England comes to save Rochester in his despair ... Excluded. It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt it necessary to completely overwrite the end of the novel and Jane's interaction with the Rivers. It is unforgivable, however, to surgically remove the love of one of the best love stories ever written. Make a favor and go to 1983 (?) Mini with Timothy Dalton.
