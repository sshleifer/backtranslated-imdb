If you've ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compared it with feedback to IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are fake. TRUST ME: You'll be bored! People in the production team themselves write their comments (sometimes even admit). But that's not enough: They also endlessly click "no" whenever a negative commentary is on the film. That's why negative critics are always placed behind the encouraged. The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad behavior, poor lighting, bad script, bad ending. Trust me now! If not, you will believe me later! Brian Avenet-Bradley can be a pretty good businessman. Otherwise, it can not be explained that he finds people who still finance their films. (Well, they're cheap but still.) But as a creative person it's a complete failure.
