Sometimes a new entry from foreign films is given. That's their great attraction. They take their life and feed them raw. American films, rarely dares to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too much hanging and morbid fear of financial failure. An Almighty Dollar determines their choice. Something that European directors call. In addition, viewers around the world are still hungry for "different" films, especially those that offer a spicy bite from a poor, suffering human body. Despite fears from directors or producers, many audiences are fond of beauty, poetry and untouched taste of life. It's the film "On the Left of the Father" that offers curious audiences. The family is locked in the belief that the unity of the family is based on the unity of its obedience to tradition. Yet, when the family patriarch forgets to be members, there are people of flesh and blood, filled with fierce, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then there are two people moving against each other. Selton Mello plays Andre's son, who tries to control his inner passions with his father's philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman who tries to quench the forbidden thirst of family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, an elder brother. The film offers a lot, but it takes a lot of unfairness. ***
