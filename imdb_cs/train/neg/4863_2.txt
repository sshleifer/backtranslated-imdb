Why oh, why do not you just pamper movies at the point of sale? Everyone in the cinema, both young and old, was there to see that the talking animals were making jokes, and while they did, we were all happy ... And then, like Lost In Space, there were two murderous wounds - mood. Who really cared about what happened to the tiger or did Eddie Murphy deal with his daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
