The muscular human monkey in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an occasional expedition team; the beautiful daughter of the team leader finds him first. The much-ballyhooed version of the Tarzan story has OK production but is crippled by one hand the worst direction of the movie I've ever seen. John Derek is deprived of inspiration outside of the slow slow motion action shots and views of the turbulent body of Bo Derek; he has about as much camera talent as Ed Wood. Trying for a sexual nature, Derek's lack of finesse, elegant timing and taste. They have a sense of self-righteousness and bravado leaving (they make gently winds), but after promising opening it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who had all the time a marble in his mouth) plays a major role, but plays the third violin to the ego of John Derek and Bo Derek's sense of self-importance. * z ****
