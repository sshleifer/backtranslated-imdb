The "diary of sexual habits" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsion. Probably movie marketing fraud, this movie is a stylish shot with a good cast and little for him. The bottom line "The Diary ..." should believe that our sexual addictive person has the stupidest woman in the world, staying buck on the side, who have nothing better than to forgive for him to drop his panties and no work without being restaurateur. At best, it could be a good drama. In the worst case, cheap softcore. "Diary ..." is not anywhere else. This is for the landfill. (D-)
