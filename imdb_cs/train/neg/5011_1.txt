... And I never thought the movie deserves to win 1! But this is frankly the worst movie I've ever watched. My wife married her because of the cast, but the story directly from the DVD box seemed quite predictable. It's not a secret or a movie juvenile. It does not include any sensuality if this title could distract one of you remotely. That's just an absolute no-no. Do not waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a group of young people in a similar Gothic setting where a killer is behind. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing to interest me. Max Makowski makes the worst Nick Stahl.
