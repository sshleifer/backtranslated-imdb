Instant movie, which takes place in Mexico, about the screaming man (Scott Glenn), who met with the American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after the hit. Will he pay them to take him to the border? but things were lost. It starts well, but it struggles quickly and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Any twist relationship is wrong and hard to believe. Absence of passion and basically no reason to leave one man after another made it ridiculous - and the end was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
