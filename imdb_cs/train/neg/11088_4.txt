It's a good movie, but it lacks any real depth, either emotionally or in terms of telling the story. The story is based on real events, and it limits the amount of action to virtually none, no real tension. <br /> <br /> Washington is believable at the forefront, but he is a walk through sleep, there is no room to flex any acting muscles for him or supporting the cast. The story just drops a tiny apartment, even never heard of the character of the title the end was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices it has no emotional impact, you really do not care about it and motivate those outside to help look more academic than interested in your welfare . <br /> <br /> There is an effort to make some emotions with the help of the little boy who carries the hero Carter, but that seems to be forced. It's OK, but it's forgotten.
