Another of the many almost forgotten films expelled by Poverty Row in the 1930s, resurrected by the spell of DVD. Cast: Universal player Lionel Atwill (often supporting an actor in numerous Frankenstein films) as twin twins involved in a murderous rocket. One kills the victims (fraud businessmen) and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and is proven "innocent" because he could not speak with witnesses. Of course, where the disintegration is, if it is innate deafness, will not they both be deaf? Oh, okay. Atwill does a very good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one else can really act here.
