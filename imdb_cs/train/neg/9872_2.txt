It is hard to believe that the film from this book could succeed in overcoming its scandal! The story is so conceived and incredible. . . starting with the tone of guilt on the little child to save her pain! Then we have the secret behavior of at least six and maybe more people (including the clergy) involved in what is crime everywhere. We also have a woman who seems to be on the length of a ferry ride because she is quite happy to trace the tracks very shortly. Very uncomfortable and what coo mother, helped, encouraged and supported a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting off the island near the coast of South Carolina did not help the story, even though it helped film budgets. Very beautiful buildings, allegedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry. Kim Basinger, whom I really like, is painfully thin in this film, and her hairstyle certainly belongs to the next decade. There is also no chemistry at all between her and one of the men leads. I did not really want the book that happened, but it all read. The film I still surfed here and there had to leave if the music of the sugar got the power. If you do not like an incredible story, wooden acting, a distorted mixture of religious / mythological / allegory, my advice is to omit this. And maybe maybe a little critical critic, but does not care about the father who carries the life jacket for a small child on a small boat? The best part of this film is scenery
