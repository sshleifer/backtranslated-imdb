He just had to write a single pad, but it really is. I like the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I have seen in recent years. I have a praise for all those involved in most aspects, except the most important ones, the script. It's a tiny story about a small criminal. No amount of fine acting or black and white movie style can exhaust a complete lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he will make another movie about the general. My advice is not to waste your time.
