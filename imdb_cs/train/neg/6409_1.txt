I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the review on this site. Those that give her more than one star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of first order, but I know it's crap when I see it. At each level, this movie is terrible. Technically, most of the time when you do not know where you are in this movie, even in one scene, the POV jumps like a fool without reason. No logic from the movie point of view. Emotionally, it is a bleak smile and tries to be a psychological thriller when it's just confused. Throwing naked-looking red necks in your movie is an inexpensive way to pass the "atmosphere". I kept with him with patience long before the last act, but I had too much fun with my friends to do the MST3K riffs to shut it down. From the moment she left Buffy, SMG has two successful movies, including a "Scooby Doo" listing. Gellar is a great actress, but she (or her agent) certainly will not find a vehicle for her. And to Mr. Shepard, if you're having trouble paying a mortgage, I'll send you some money if you promise not to return to a movie like this one again! (Also, Patsy Cline should sue for defamation!)
