It was not unnecessary animated movie experience at all, but it definitely can not be admired just as it is trying to be good. The combination of Dreamworks animation and computer graphics is a mustache story, later by Spirit (Matt Damon, who provides the first narrative) and his journey across the Old West. In fact, he is born freely among all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then abducted to be used as a saddle horse, able to throw away all who attempt to ride him. However, when he escapes from his cage, together with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), two of them make friendship, and of course he has something for the Little Creek horse. Eventually, after a few leaks that are being pursued by Colonel James Cromwell and his men and eventually culminating in a leap across the gully, Little Creek allows the Spirit to go, and he also frees up his female horse and runs home for their countryside and horseback horses. Also plays Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Leader, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I expected the horses to speak in this movie, but it seems to be something like Dumbo in the whole body, and the song from Bryan Adams is not the most interesting, but it's not a terrible movie. He was nominated for an Oscar for the best animated film and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Song for Actor Bryan Adams "Here I Am". Good!
