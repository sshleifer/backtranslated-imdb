Maybe I'm not sophisticated. This and Closer are two of the most supposedly brainwave films I have recently seen and both suffer exactly the same problem in an unbearable range. The dialog is false false false. Nothing that comes out of one's mouth seems to be remotely believable. Perhaps the way this film is set up as it should be, but it was inconsistent. And boring. I went out after 20 minutes of hiding. <br /> <br /> I will sleep and bananas because of my Woody Allen. If I ever hit a teevee, I turn around and instead try to find the Quincy episode.
