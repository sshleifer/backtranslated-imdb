The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, scriptwriters try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway version), Cameron Diaz will try to step out of the frame as quickly as possible, not to ask Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are trying to hide their embarrassment with this dirty thing. It brings endless, insignificant dialogue and very little intervention. Tulsa is a city with beautiful lobby lifts, art deco church Bruce Goff and the beautiful, extensive estate of Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, watch this movie. It's not a fair place.
