Note: I could not force myself to actually write a constructive review of Prom Night. It just can not be done. Instead, I went through what I was thinking about watching the movie. Things I Thought About Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm so tired of those dreams where these complicated deaths will take place only to wake the main character just before she bites her. Of course, when I say "complicated deaths", I mean the screen's throat breaking or stomach in the stomach. Did not the whole thing "just the dream" destroyed by Dallas? When we talk about it, I wonder if a couple of diggers in the gut will cause an immediate death. The film is only ten minutes and I can count horror clich√©s on both hands. It's not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Even after meeting a friend of the hero, I'm convinced he will die. Does anyone want to bet? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this movie is a teacher who is obsessed with the main character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think Donna is a horrific name for the main character in a horror film?) He spends three years in the maximum security jail before he crashes and finds Donna celebrating his college ball. While there is no understanding of taste, I really care who wants to train somebody as boring as Donna all the time. Colleges allow promises to take place in hotels and not attending students. Apparently, students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go out and out as they like it. I suppose if that were not right, the film would be 90 minutes of bored people and accidentally biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom. I suppose a compromise of their excitement is my utter boredom with everything. I've already played "counting pieces of chewed bubbles under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only 20 minutes away. How else will I have fun? <br /> <br /> -It's not your own: Do not forget the milk and bread on your way home. <br /> <br /> -Watch the screenwriter: You've used enough frightening fears to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year. The 1980 version of this movie was not that good, but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. Jamie Lee Curtis had one of the many horror films after Halloween and at the end she had a little twist. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she was doing more. <br /> <br /> - It seems that there are not many dances on the ball. Instead, girls get into fighting with their girlfriends where they plan to go to college. I have heard that all these colleges are being educated by name, and I can not help, but I wonder who the girls have to cheat on the entrance exam in order to get in. The killer must have a bag of really effective detergents and ruin his mess among the scenes. This is the only logical explanation of why he could force someone to death on a carpet or in the bathroom, and when someone goes to the hotel room, there is no trace of fighting. (On the other hand, note: This is a very lazy killer, Michael Myers went to hunt for his sacrifices.) <br /> <br /> -It's official: the whole theater in the theater rooted in the murderer. What caused it? Was it always when Donna came back to her hotel room, while the sirens were telling everyone to leave the building? Was it her permanent dreams, and how, even after she had walked something dramatic in that dream, she insisted on repeating her steps on the tee? Or was it the convincing performance of Brittany Snow? I have to say that was all. <br /> <br /> - Well, who "lost the screen in the third act"? You win the pots. <br /> <br /> - The movie finally ended. My friend turns to me and says, "Donna was not too smart." This is an understatement of the week. Something like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or weekly power outages are a slight inconvenience. I can not wait to get to Rotten Tomatoes and find out if anyone has put forward a favored review. <br /> <br /> - I can not recommend it. I refuse to recommend it. It's just lazy from a haunted movie like everyone, and the only way to enjoy its cheese flavor is if you're under the influence of at least ten beers. Unfortunately, because of the theaters, alcohol is not provided. <br /> <br /> Rating: * from ****
