The potential was there. I saw Creep and I thought, "Oooh, it becomes interesting" several times. Still, some interesting conspiracy lines have lost unexplained or ignored, as if they never happened. The lead figure was irritated throughout the movie and at one point we and our buddy screamed that we wanted him to die. There are really spooky, spooky moments, but they are deeply overshadowed by moments that have just bothered me. It's another of those horror films that lift you up and intrigue for a while, but in the end it leaves you frustrated and a little confused by what filmmakers were trying to achieve. The only saving mercy of this movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is far more than the leading figure, you know you're on the defeat.
