I was a filmmaker myself and had a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humor. I thought I went on a journey when I got home "My Mischief ..." (not that the DVD envelope gave something, instead she chose for ambiguous quotations from controversial director Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes "). I should have known better and avoiding this unpleasant (and often offensive) bite. The scene in the church is repulsive when I look (especially when we are all too familiar with Morris' deformed attitude to pedophilia from his notorious Brass Eye TV series) and serve no purpose other than shock. How this movie is labeled as a comedy I never understand. The commentary of running sound sounds like a fundamental idea (it was a beyuzer himself, it is often an interesting and unlimited perspective in the filmmaking process), but this is not sad. Instead, he treats some public schoolboy who plays dogs on the film before he thinks that there are not really great movies with dogs. That's all very interesting, but it's not the only shot of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Saying that this movie goes nowhere would be an understatement. It rests too much on its elevated style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, so the viewer is strangely upset and unfulfilled. His over-simplified report - that one should assume responsibility for his actions - is clearly obvious and ill-illustrated. The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafkai's surrealism, but ultimately it can not convince, entertain, enlighten and eventually irritate. If you want to see a really great piece of short film, I strongly recommend Petra Capaldi's "Franz Kafka's It A Wonderful Life".
