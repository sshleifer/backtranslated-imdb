Given the title and the exclusive art I was ready for something. Perhaps my expectation was only a bit tall because I was a bit dry. The film crew working on a soft-kernel movie ends up in a strange house when the fog is lost and the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where was not this setting used before? The difference here is the uber-perverted nature of the sex. It is not allowed to show all the goods (long shots were illegal in Japan, which turned out to be faded) film is trying to show as much as possible to the viewer how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> Some of the sights are a bit a lot, most notably a woman who has a gut pulled over her vagina or another woman who spit her chopsticks ... stuff, but otherwise the gore is a standard fare. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is torn by its own patterns; it's too exaggerated to make amazing horror pictures and horrible work like sex movies. Media can work, but there must be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
