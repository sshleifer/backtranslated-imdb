I'll be short and up to that point. This film was an insult to anyone with IQ at room temperature. Excuse liberals, feminists, etc. No women will ever seal. They can forget about the design or the fight. It will not happen. You see, you can hardly understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact that 2007 is, reality can not change things in order to avoid people suffering their feelings. Men can not give birth or nurse babies (Oh - I forgot San Francisco). Women lack the physical strength to deal with men in combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Finally, I could not put a bloody hail in hell if what I just wrote would upset you. Do not forget - if it upsets you, it just warms my heart. I did not write one thing that was not true. This nonsense film is nothing more than a comedy and dirty movie.
