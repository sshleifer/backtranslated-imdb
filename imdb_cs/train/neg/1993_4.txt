Franco Rossi's six-hour Italian mini-series Quo Vadis of 1985 is a very curious beast, creating a totally convincing ancient Roman world that was shot in reality by fashion (with only a few long shots, no big city scenery) in favor of references to classical literature and history, that the story is constantly losing in the background. The shifting structure (much of the episode one takes place in a voice over the letters) and the lack of urgent urgency makes it a full six-hour version that is both demanding and unpretentious and is often too uninteresting, but it does something for her. The two main strengths are the characterization of Petronia (gratefully called Frederic Forrest, whose voice would almost certainly match his dialogue) as a man who spent so long searching for a clever angle to survive the life of the court that he would not be able to experience emotions and the unique shot of Klaus Maria Brandauera at Nera as a witch actor whose every move and action counts on how his "audience" will receive it. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow briefly appears in several episodes and is rewarded with the most impressive and truly moving scene he encounters when he tries to leave Rome. It's such a thing that the show could do with more, but it seems too often to flatter every potentially emotional, inspirational or exciting moment under its tirelessly low key of direction. Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn does a stunning, anonymous hero that mixes with the walls and comes less like a Roman officer than the quiet, slightly carefree but harmless person who works in the same office as you who never say much about office parties - you know, his name is Dave or something like that. The budget constraints are very visible when it is time to meet Christians Meet the Lions and the battle of Ursus with the bull is so definitely the low key that it simply goes before you before the show just suddenly loses interest and suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> It's not the way I particularly recommend, I'm afraid, but if you let go of it, it's not entirely without its small rewards.
