I was watching this movie sometime last week and I had the biggest laugh in it. The story of the movie is quite stupid and complicated in a poorly created way. The only plus that can be found anywhere in the movie is the impressive abs Corey Savier. Alexandra Paul (I think it is her name) is terrible as a woman of a preacher who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is rough and his character is on top of everything. And as if you think you have sex with your son is not enough, throwing unnecessary saxophone solos on every occasion! The end and culmination of this movie is absolutely silent and also ridiculous. I mean who the hell wants to wear a condom child who tried to think he was your son and that you had a baptismal relationship with him!
