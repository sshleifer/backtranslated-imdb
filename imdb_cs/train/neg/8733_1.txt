</ P> <p> <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I ask why he took the role of a 2000 detective police officer "The Spreading Ground". This movie is upset and I want to tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is a small town that is about to conclude a contract for a sports arena. One Catch: There's a killer and that's bad for business. The mayor agrees with Irish Mob to find the killer and make sure he never gets to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants the guy to catch up, but he's on the level and he believes in the system. He wants to realize that the system is a job. <br /> <br /> This could be quite good. It could be riveting. It was awful. First they call this guy a serial killer. Error # There are specific criteria here and none of them are suitable here. The bad guy killed five children in the first days and I think it was the next day. This entire movie stretches as a 48 hour period .... Seriously Serial Killer action. I do not care what they ultimately do the motives they eventually give him, the serial killers do their job for a long time. It does not just have to destroy 7 children in two days. This is Spree. <br /> <br /> Ok, that irritating side, acting was horrible. The only name here was Hopper, and he's the only one who even came to tear apart his part. Unfortunately, it is a bit typical for me and I think it makes the psycho part a lot, much better. It just was not a good vehicle for Hopper. He did not allow him to do what he did best, which was all scary. It's not like he did it wrong to see him do much better. Irish Mob, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - a long day trip to the night) who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top. Contradiction? Not really. He tries to play on a cold, tough guy and he does so to the point that the character is just wooden. Boring to max did not mean me. He was not inspired by any emotion at all except boredom. I can not tell you how many times I've checked to find out how much longer it was until the end of this movie. The other thing is that it felt like it was a movie for television. You know what I mean. Poor production values, low budgets, reuse scenes to save costs. Just. Yanno? But I feel like I compare it to being an insult. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was also a director and cameraman in this project. He barked more than he could chew. I can not help feeling that Hopper must have this role as a personal favor to a friend. That's the only reason I can come up with. This was Vanlint's first job as a director, the third as a cameraman. Let's hope this was a learning point for him. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy the end if you decide to torture with this, but I mean everyone here was firing the ball. .. even Hopper. In a scene that should be emotionally exhaustive for the detective, it was just ... fool. I did not see any sense of anxiety accompanying all the gear - he changed the guy. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> This 100 Exhausting Minutes and Rated R for Violence and Language. No child under the age of 13 will have any interest in watching this, so there is no worry about it. It's not good for anyone. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this. Later, thank you.
