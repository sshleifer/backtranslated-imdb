<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed on this. He became a joke about himself. Again, we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, harassment in women, and a lot of attidian conversations between characters and dolls mining. It's all for nothing. Because there is no action in this movie. Fudges all his pieces. All actors give such a performance from the Verhoeven movie. In other words, they are always on almost every level. The Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world of the figure inhabited. This scientist acts in the same way. I'm sorry, but soldiers and scientists are not actually created from the same way of thinking. One of the main shortcomings in the plot was that after escaping for one night to do bad things, Kevin Bacons then returned to the science lab, where we had spent more than enough time watching these animated manicures (Elizabeth Shue except) walk and talk. Why not show the extent of what a figure could do in the outside world. How could they watch him if he could be anywhere at all ??? Think of all the different things that could be done with this concept, both from the point of view of the story and from the characterization. Then look at what this movie is doing, and you've really done so badly, and you've really dropped the whole project. <br /> <br /> More insulting is Doco on DVD, where everyone claims that Verhoeven is some kind of MAd Genius. One in two is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing to do with it. Just as the name says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
