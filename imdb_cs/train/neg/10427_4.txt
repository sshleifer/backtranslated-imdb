Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you dissatisfied. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphoman, but she is definitely in sexual relationships with men. She is still exploring and trying to find "more data" to see what she wants from life and men in her, although she seems to have a pretty good idea at her age. (But I can not agree with anyone who says Young is too old for a role, if so, we should all be so nice.) Mostly, this film has left me cold, though it's by no means the worst kind of thing you've ever seen. And unlike the recent "Eyes Wide Shut," at least something happens in this.
