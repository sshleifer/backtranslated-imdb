CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film follows a young filmmaker who makes the film Barbarella-esque. Then the film started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not really. The "Dragonfly" movie, which originates in CQ, has a problem that has no end. This varies considerably from CQ, which also lacks the end (in my opinion). I was lucky to have captured this film at the SxSW film festival. I had a relatively high expectation when I watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I'm also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not easy to get into the movie. If you are not in the 60s sci-fi or slow movies that do not go there, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student movie. If you want the recent science fiction indie Donnie Darko to appear recently, it will not sleep.
