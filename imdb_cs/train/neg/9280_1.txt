honestly, I do not know what's funny, that terrible remake or notes on this album. The tour of the masterpiece had me in tears, it's so funny. Anyway, this film is one of the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for the sequel. The name "Omen" on the title stopped me and looked at it this morning at HBO, but it is faint in the face of the other three, especially the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but my favorite is the guy who caught fire from the juggler at the psychic fair! good times ! This movie is a series of Omen, which is "Scary Movie" for the whole genre. Avoid if you do not want a good laugh.
