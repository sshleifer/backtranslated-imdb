You are kidding that it was HEAVY !!! <br /> <br /> But that's despite the fact that I got this movie and three more and they were all on DVD. The movie starts from an OK movie, but goes downhill. And ending well let's say it was one of the most anti-climatic endings in recent film history. Lots of gore in the final order and if you like the batch of horror, then that's the movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 3/10
