This movie was bad. Bad behavior, bad direction, bad writing. But it was not a bad, humorous way. It was bad. I watched "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be laughter. It was not. Do not make the mistake I did. There are plenty of fun ways to spend an hour and a half, such as watching a dry color or reading a dictionary. Seriously.
