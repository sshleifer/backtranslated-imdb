* Sigh * Let the Finns take a silly idea, throw them out of proportion, and try to sell it cool. Lordi is also an average band and the only trick will get you just that. <br /> <br /> All those marketing idiots out there: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that often occurs when Finland tries to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi is OVER. I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this idiocyth with a plastic face. Sure, he won Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait - won Eurovision. And it is done. I fix my case.
