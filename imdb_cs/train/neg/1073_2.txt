I can not believe that so much talent can be lost in one movie! The gingerbread man starts on his right leg and can make some great expectations for the end. But at some point the film will turn into one of the worst stories I've ever spent. It's as incredible as the enchanted Mallory Doss can pull Kenneth Branagh's figure around his nose. The climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer that has been left out in the sun for too long. Gingerbread Man is probably the worst film Grisham and it does not change by the talented stars of the crowd of the movie. Do not waste time here!
