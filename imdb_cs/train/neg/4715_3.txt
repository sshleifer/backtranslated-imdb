I recently looked at Johnny Test to try to find humor in him. I was disappointed. The Cartoon Network tends to make its shows appealing to all viewers, but Johnny Test is "fun" in its lowest form. Scripture is incredibly predictable, and running gags are nothing at all. Children will love it, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Now it does not mean that it's all bad. The original introductory theme was actually pretty catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton and smashed it with a figural aluminum bat. It's a shame because it was really one of the best things that went for her. Some of the characters could be very interesting theoretically. With a little work, the characters could work well, but they are too one-dimensional. Again, it makes it easy for children to watch. <br /> <br /> The tempo is also a little too fast. Episodes are too busy, so we leave little time for smart writing. It's a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that this show brings. On the contrary, the fast pace stops children from losing interest, and that's really the whole target audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks very good on paper, but it just can not be funny or interesting. This is the show I want, but I can not. There is just so much potential that is not being realized. Children enjoy it, but it is about it.
