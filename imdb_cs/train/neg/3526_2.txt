(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie can not be taken seriously. In some parts it is so stupid that I just can not laugh. Try me for a sequence in which Stallone's character jumps about 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and that's really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by holding him on a stalactite. Yeah, what wicked power did he accomplish? I do not know, but it certainly gives the reality for the money.
