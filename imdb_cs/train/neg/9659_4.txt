After watching this movie I was frankly disappointed - not because of actors, stories, or direction - I was disappointed with this film advertisement. Trailers suggested that the battalion "had chosen a third way" rather than give up or died (Polish information even mistakenly indicated they had a choice between being killed by their own artillery or German weapons, even translating the title incorrectly as a "bad battalion") . It disappointed the right place and I bought the movie. Disappointment began when I realized that the third way is to just sit down and count on the dead bodies that sit and count dead bodies ... Then I started to think "hey, this story can not be that simple ... I bet that this clever officer will find some clever way to save what's left of his troops. " Well, he did not, just sat and waited for something to happen. And so was I. The story was based on the actual events of the First World War, so writers could not make much use of their imagination, but I even thought I found this film really insignificant and even a little dull. And as I wrote in the first place - it's not the fault of actors, writers or directors - their marketing people have raised my expectations well above the level with which this film can cope.
