What was all Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test all actors acting as skills or abilities. I asked for anything I bought to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their task was nothing to sink their teeth, and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and his direction did not even allow him to do enough with his position to become more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sounds of the shootings at the beginning of the movie sounded like the noise of painting machine guns when they were released in the prosecution. It was really strange and did not look like real weapons. Video games had better sound effects than this movie. There was also a really annoying guy at the start of the movie, who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl screaming on lines like "Let us get F # $ to get out" and what do we do to make a man. "It sounded like a girl, I'm laughing for a few seconds.
