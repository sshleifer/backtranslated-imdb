I can not believe that in the previous 34 comments, no one mentioned that this film is an obvious tear of Born yesterday. The man is hired to bring a seemingly stupid blonde according to the gangster's demands. Employed pistols and blondes fall in love and live happily. The gangster is left on the edge. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment, as it is just so much fluff. The transfer of Technicolor to DVD is offensive. Natalie Kalmus would be overturned in her grave. Look at the papers. Will you recognize him? But it is historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is the introduction of Ewello into CinemaScope, a new format at that time.
