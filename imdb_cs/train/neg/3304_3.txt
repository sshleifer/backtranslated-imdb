Greenthumb Grace is left with no money after her husband's death, so she turns to ganja to pay her bills. It sounds promising and still reliable Brenda Blethyn does not disappoint, but the material is thin. There is actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to "Give me one" (toke) and he thinks he's asking for sex and he's doing it ubiquitously. Yes, it's humor, so the bitch would be bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what she wants to be: stunning cinematography and the spectacular pace of memories of Ryan's daughter, while the cheerful whim of rural burghers could be picked up from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but it's too clich√©. The culmination can be unpredictable only by introducing the most innocent Deux ex Machino I've ever seen.
