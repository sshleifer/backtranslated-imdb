The first minutes of The Bodyguard feature a jewel glamor: it opens with crawling text from the Bible (a part Samuel Jackson reciting on his early victims in "Pulp Fiction"), and continues with two Karate school teachers in New York who quarrel about the eternal the question of humanity (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears, playing alone; immediately stops the plane by abduction and breaks the bottle in two with a bare hand. Unfortunately, any value of fun, intentional or unintentional, will soon be crushed by a discontinuous story, a lack of action over a long period of time and the poor quality of any current action. To make it simple, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an intolerable movie you can see: 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are hardly any matches. <br /> <br /> 3) The fight that's there is short and horrified. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is fine. Judy Lee is beautiful, her face is beautiful. It's just for them that I give "The Bodyguard" a second star out of 10. This film is 87 hours of feeling 5 hours.
