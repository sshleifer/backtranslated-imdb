Was this film based on reality? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We get to see what many armed police officers seem to be emptying the same amount of weapons in 2 boys who only got a torso armored. This is a great idea; Focus on your armor! ... excuse me, but what about the big fat unnoticed heads or their legs when you call out loud. Or are invisible tanks protecting them? were they from Crypton? Did I miss something here? <br /> <br /> This movie started quite decent, but after 20 minutes of shots it really takes boringlane. <br /> <br /> That the documentary style did not even work for me, but that's something that a person likes or does not like. <br /> <br /> Very unbelievable things that make it harder for him to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10 for fine adjustment.
