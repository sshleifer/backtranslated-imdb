This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that he has a fragile story is bad enough to be interested in the topic of football violence that is 100 times worse. I have serious doubts about the premise of this film before I started watching, but I also started to adopt the way the writers considered it appropriate to introduce Elijah Wood's mother to the scene of the hooligan. The film, however, casts an inaccuracy over the inaccuracies that each of you is opening harder in the middle of the movie than before. <br /> <br /> Make sure a few things: Hooligans do not tend to virtually break their own pub before running the ball league; they do not intend to kill each other; not only Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, they do). They definitely do not have to accept the exception to a new member of the company, trotting their competing businesses for cake and mash. And I'd like to meet a bum who's going to go and the grass on the top boy of his company to his opponent. (Although you can scratch what I said about how to break out if you kill someone else if it exists) <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I've seen a movie on the subject but it's the same level with the company for helplessness. It seemed ironic to me that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user when it's part of a pack of British hooligan scene. The film decides not to question the morality of the wood, instead of going out of business with coke. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I think I did. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it's very unpredictable and I'm sure if I did not have the whole movie, so I realized what was going on before I did. And believe me, I was well ahead. I have the distinct impression that this film focuses on men, hoping that women will be eager to inject emotional issues that are raised. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the manufacturers failed completely. It's too unreal to enjoy everyone who knows about the scene and I can not believe the woman who is looking for emotional movies would be damned about some of the characters given by their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there any good points? Maybe the battle scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but rarely I have slow action, certainly not when it's a fight, because the point is such that it is so deeply exhaustive. <br /> <br /> There are some fun, unrealistic moments. A wooden trip to school brought me a smile. But a few fun moments can not earn in two hours a complete clot. If you avoid the British as a plague, you do not have to develop further misconceptions about the scene unless you know it. If you are an American, you can enjoy it because it is clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny that the conspiracy is fragile, predictable, and ultimately over the top.
