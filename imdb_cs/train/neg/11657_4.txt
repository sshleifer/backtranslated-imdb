"Scary Movie 2" is given to Franti≈°ek Scary Movie. Scary Movies 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this was boring and not fun. Fortunately they chose their act after this and produced two more great Scary Films. The film is about a group of teenagers who, with their professor, deceive them into a creepy mansion for the night. Things begin to err, and then they realize they have to escape. This movie is not horrible, but few things can be improved. It's a bit of fun and if you like other movies in Scary Movie, then watch it out - but I do not think you'll like it anyway.
