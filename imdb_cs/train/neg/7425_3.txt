This annoying, fertile Las Vegas casino heist movie is almost impossible to watch and engage. It's something you're looking at if you have absolutely nothing better to do. The only two decent things in this movie are both connected to the wonderful Stelle Stevens and one spent the whole program hoping she will fall from one of those dirty peaks she wears. Many great shots from the mid-1970s in Las Vegas (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashion of the day is good for laughs. Otherwise one big yawn. Rhino dvd has a very good transmission on a widescreen, but even under $ 10 it's still not a modest view behind me.
