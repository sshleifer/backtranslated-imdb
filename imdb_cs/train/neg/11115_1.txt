One previous reviewer called this film "pure visual joy". I wonder if he saw the same movie as I did. "High Art" had to have the most tirelessly depressing interiors from "Seven". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the clich√© that they will go to the B & B for their first time. Of course, before they do it, it is necessary to follow the opium parties in which people who are not obviously employed, but can somehow support the thriving drug habits. Not to mention the ice-cold views of those familiar movie types, Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start, who are well aware that they will sometimes fit within a few minutes. The film also states that Sheedy's character has left professional photography for ten years. What did she retire at the age of twenty?
