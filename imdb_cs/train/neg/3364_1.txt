So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) that the administrators always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke, etc. This doctor tells them the scary story of this woman and some children. They're afraid, they're beginning to feel things. Oh, no, the girl sees the spirit. Any other talk then comes this giant spirit and so on. The girl finds out that this ghost has killed the kids and that she has to free her soul, yeah, blah blah. She does, no, she dies, like her. And he goes to heaven while this evil spirit goes to hell. Two people will survive and escape from the house. The script is terrible because one gets his head cut off and Elanor (the one who dies to rescue children) says "no". The game is wooden, the effects are bullshit and the set is a couple of rooms that are used over and over again. Basically, if you like laughing on badly filmed movies, watch it, but if you're looking for fear, you'll definitely do this movie. I was very disappointed when I watched it. Very nice. My sister (who is very initiate) is bored in this movie, it's scary.
