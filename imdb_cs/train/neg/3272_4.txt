Let's say one thing about this movie: there's no peace. You can not be bored watching this. The problem is that it's too intense. There are too many events and needs peace! This is the risk you have taken in modern action movies. You want it interesting, but not exaggerated. That's exaggerated. <br /> <br /> While acting is fine and contains several "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, he still has a "B" movie. The best part is Scheider's dialogue: the only "A" part of this movie "B". The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality, but it has several exceptional scenes. Especially one was a very innovative scene featuring land mines. That was unforgettable. Lack of other scenes has become a long goalie.
