Predictably, he told a thousand times the story with the usual drama between a couple of pretty sexual scenes that mingled with some characteristic paranoia, the 70 random horror of horror, sometimes comic, I could not help when I laughed. /> <br /> I usually like Defoe and we must say that acting is not so bad that the plot is evolving at a reasonable pace and constantly guessing. It's just that it's too predictable, I felt I was watching a TV drama instead of a new movie. Perhaps it's the style the directors wanted, but it has to be said that the reviews I read here before I saw the film could only be written by someone who was involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not wait too long, and if I could get back hours, I would not see it in the cinema. I would like to wait for the ransom bin on the video rental, I'm sure it will not take long.
