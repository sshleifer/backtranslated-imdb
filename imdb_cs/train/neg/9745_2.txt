This movie is spoofed in the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at best when they ripped the movie. Stunning acting, bad make-up, bad effects, cat in the clever (1960's) underwear. <br /> <br /> The villain is hard to understand because of the makeup. Assistant says things like 'not you' that sound like NACHOO! (he thinks he is sneezing). It's just a bad talk. Long eyebrows are funny on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what the Designed Person means in terms of land. I missed it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> What happens to this 10-line minimum when sending?
