A really horrible film shot by a cameraman turned by director Ted Tetzlaff. Sufficiently looking film, but for a time bomb movie completely free of any tension. Ford, as someone gives it, comes with a sleepy leg, though it's with his characteristic smile. Some details are thrown out - the Canadian ex-army or RAF, the suppressed bomb in the war, his wife leaves, - but none of these stories is too much. The bomber himself is a complete secret. Why is he trying to get the shipment down? As to what time we are talking about here? WWII or post-war? I assumed it made the bombardier even more prominent. Generally, however, it's just a terrible movie. There are plenty of good bombs with time bombs. Watch each episode "UXB Dangers" for more exciting time, at about the same time.
