*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw it today, I had some expectations as it will be, not too high, not even low. It was nothing I ever expected, it seems to me that movie makers could not decide what movie to do. At the beginning of the movie it's a bit mysterious and a little exciting, but it will soon turn into some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I watched, I almost fell asleep a couple of times. The end is the most funny of all, but almost screaming / comedy ... I'm not saying she has some good scenes, it's just that the movie will never become "total". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie-Man
