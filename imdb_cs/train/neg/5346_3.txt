I had to watch this movie because the plot was so outrageous and the film survived expectations. In fact, it makes it quite an unpleasant viewing occasionally. Unlike other Meyer's films, sexual antics are kept to a minimum. Some scenes of violence are unnecessarily free and insulting. The plot is chaotic and some actresses and lines are terrible. The film is a special combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of brutality and immorality of slavery, and it fails on all counts. It is as if Meyer tried to cope with sexploitation / blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a little guilty about forgetting the spectacular dominatrix of the early stage connotation that showed Lady Susan in a provocative whip. He then attempts to return to a just path by turning it into a movie about the triumph of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other, you will end up with nothing. Because it's so bad in many ways, it's worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie in the worst possible taste. Perhaps, because it's so bad, we almost let Meyer retreat with unacceptable.
