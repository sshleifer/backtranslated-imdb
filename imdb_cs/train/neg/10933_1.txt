Avoid every stereotype and distortion you have heard of semi-dedicated Mormons and you will see that everyone has played in this ridiculous apology for the film. Finally, Kurt Hale has changed (thank God) and hopefully it will be long before we see some of his features in the theaters. Cinematography was amateur (I think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). The conspiracy was still and very unfortunate. He did not really understand why anyone had done anything. It was as if I had sand in my eyes and a girl weighing 300 pounds sat on my face. It was painful. The only reason I did not make a negative film rating is that I will not let it go.
