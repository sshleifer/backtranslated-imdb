You can not imagine how I was looking forward to the king of ants. As a huge fan of Gordon, I was waiting for the European premiere with unexpected expectations, especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon 's last success - so much. The king of ants spoke here in my homeland and it was Gordon himself who came to introduce it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him for it. The King of Ants is still the strongest and average film ever. Indeed, the quality level has never exceeded the standard of the thriller. The outline of the drawing is routinely routine and, with the exception of a few bad scenes, Gordon-touch never recognizes. In addition, the weak script has more holes than a Swiss dish of cheese! This is a young slave who is hired for murder. So it does. Of course he does not. And of course she falls in love with the victim's wife. Of course, he'll take revenge on himself. Only the sequences in which the guy descends into a spiral of insanity are worth mentioning and they are the only ones who remind you that you are still watching Stuart Gordon's film. Actor's performances are below average with McCenna as a heroic low life, George 'Norm Peterson' Wendt as a bastard bastard and Kari Wuhrer as a good heart bomb. Extremely illogical things happen constantly, and the stinging of the story is very irritating, while makeup effects are not enough to satisfy fans of amateur horror. I read several other comments about the King of Ants and said it was the best of Gordon because it was finally a thought-provoking and mature movie. Well, if it is. I'm rather immature and give Re-Animator another view, thank you very much. Well, I think every good director eventually exhausts and inspiration eventually. It is a pity he also overcame Stuart Gordon.
