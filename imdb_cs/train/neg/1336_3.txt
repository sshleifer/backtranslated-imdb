This movie is certainly not one of the best movies of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it and I was a little disappointed in this movie. For some reason, it seemed to be a movie that is coming together very quickly. In some parts it was so boring that I had to move it forward. She had no bloopers or some exciting parts like other movies.
