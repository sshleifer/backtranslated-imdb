The Christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. So naturally I was excited when this movie came out in 1994. I saw his opening day and was ready to enjoy myself. I got away and resurrected. The prediction that is true in the Christmas story is curiously missing from this mess. Red Ryder BB Gun is better than getting the Chinese top. And that's not much fun at all. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stops there. Bottom Line: 1 star. You do not even have to bother.
