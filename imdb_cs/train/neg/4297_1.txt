Suddenly I wake up when I realize I'm in the sunshine and I realize it's a hot Saturday afternoon. Why am I sleeping? Did I catch my head? Or accidentally swallow all my grandmother's relaxing muscles? Can it be narcolepsy with adults? <br /> <br /> No, I immediately stopped in the left seat while surfing the canals and the stunning lack of humor and talent exhausted my life force at the rate that I lost. head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrug. But I have to give these sad and boring twins for selling this idea. Perhaps they had the same influence on the executive ESPN programmer they had on me, and when he woke up, there were several scary episodes in the can and he hoped that because all the audience was asleep, nobody would be horrible now and can keep an annual salary of 425,000 dollars. <br /> <br /> You were warned.
