Even though I consider myself a fan of the Babylon 5 TV series, the original movie that introduced the series was a faint beginning. Though many of the elements that would later mature and become much more convincing in the series are there, the pace of the gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse yet, the characterization in the premiere episode is bad. Although the rating graph shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I recall that Gathering almost shut off me, which soon grew into a spectacular series.
