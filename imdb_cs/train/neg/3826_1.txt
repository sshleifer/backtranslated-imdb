Hell, I thought I saw some bad westerns. However, this possibility can not be overcome. I think I should rather have eyes that would be open to the Triple Feature (Trinity Triple Feature) to shout out loud. I do not think I can watch Ben Hur again without laughing at me. But really bad. But hey, if you like silly westerns with acclaimed stars, check out Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but much more fun. 1/10
