I found myself very interested in this film, at least in the beginning, and any credit I made to this film is Lacey Chabert, it was fantastic! But where it ends. It seems to me that I'm very good when I find out who a murderer is and I like when the film made me completely dismayed but I felt and lied that all the time you guided you in one direction and then suddenly decided eventually in a completely different direction, they did not do it at all, it is not misleading about writing and planning, someone did not think! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie would be much better if they joined the plot that led you also did not seem to solve anything about why Jane (Maria) burns a professor's house. It's a great shame I felt that it started out as a rather good film.
