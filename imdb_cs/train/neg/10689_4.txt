Kuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent accused of assassinating an American president, I immediately point out that this is not the type of role for which this talented actor is known and this film shows us why. Together with a permanent journalist (Angie Harmon), they reveal the plot surrounding the president's death, and so on, blah, blah, blah. Even with James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon, "End Game" can not take your attention simple and simple; some of the events are good, acting is not all bad and the story, although the clich√© did before, could lead to a fun and enjoyable movie - WELL IT DO NOT! Writing the script and the direction is absolutely certain that it does not reach the story at any moment, nor does it recommend that you give the least figure to a character. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's Boring, Predictable and Dull.
