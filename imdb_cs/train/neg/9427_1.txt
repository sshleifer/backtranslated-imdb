When I rented "Unhinged," I was expecting a gore movie. Box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that had been cut off from the theater release (now I have serious doubts about being released in the theater). After finishing the movie, I was wondering how she could even get a video. <br /> <br /> The sketch is as follows: A group of three young women at a car rental car crashes their car into a tree. These women somehow managed to get into a house that contains an extremely sexist woman. For this purpose, the film is mostly made up of unnecessary scenes designed to film long enough to last. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this movie horrible is acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks as if she read her lines on the cards. The others who act are bad, but not as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is camera technology. Many images are taken with cameras connected to the ceiling. It becomes very annoying as the film progresses. In addition, there is very little gore, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this. My Rating: 1 out of 10
