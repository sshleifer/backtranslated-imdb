In fact, I picked up this film because I saw a great remake of Zatoichi Kitano Takashi and was in the mood of another updated Samurai story, which also played Asano Tadanobu. These two films are remote from each other. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and refuted traditional pianos of samurai films. Gojoe goes from the deep end in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies that have different characters, informing the audience about what the main character is, instead of the character evolving during the movie. "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," says almost every character in Benke's presence, yet this inner stir is barely contained in the character itself. Instead of character development, we get bloody, boring, combat scenes. The Asano's figure is undeveloped and even looks bored and does not know what he's doing there. I know he usually looks distant and cool and that's part of Asan's challenge, but he does not serve this movie. A lot of camera movements are nausea. There is a scene that lasts forever in which the camera turns around the main characters until my wife and I feel like vomiting. The end is ridiculous and somewhat anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that really good samurai movies are not in Japan with this type of budget today. Colors, scenery and costumes were great, but the rest is just a waste of time. I'd rather see one of the Kabuki versions of this myth.
