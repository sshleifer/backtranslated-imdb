I could not believe how dreadful this film was; I rarely look at commercial TV, but she wondered, "Well, Diane Keaton is always good watching." I fix it. Everyone who sees it should be in a shame of hanging heads. I realize that there are not many great roles for women of a certain age, but the scenario was so awkward, clich√© and misunderstanding that I was surprised that she had ever developed, or that Mrs. Keaton thought she could produce this pig's ear silk handbag. None of the characters had a bit of credibility and was so incredibly unlike. The performance looked like an exercise in the BEGINNING class - I stared in open angry horror despite most of that thinking, "What did they think?". Very, very sad that it happened. Do not waste time.
