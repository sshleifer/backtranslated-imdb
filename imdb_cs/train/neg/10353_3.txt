I have never read the book "Wrinkles in Time". To be absolutely honest, after what I saw the movie, I really want to? Well, I should not examine this movie, I'll start with it. Next, I will say that TV movie is quite forgotten. You know why I say that? Because I forgot what was going on in it. I told you she was forgotten. To be completely honest, no television movie will ever be better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How can I describe a TV movie? I have never reviewed the review yet. Well, I'll say they usually have some celebrities. Wrinkle time contains only one. Alfred Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has a cheese special effect, a slightly interesting plot, scenes that make you "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you "WTF". What did I expect? It's a television movie. They are usually not good. Just like this. Wrinkles in time are a waste of time and a great deal of time. To do this, you will most likely forget that it is the second one. Well, maybe not the other is over. But within minutes. <br /> <br /> Wonderful time: * / ****
