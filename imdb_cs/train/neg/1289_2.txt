This was new among all the Western ones. Scripture is unbearably bad, characters can not be accentuated and are either disgusting or insignificant, violence is scary and technically not very convincingly done. And Tobey Maguire shows us the tilting of his talent, he is thriving through his part with those slim eyes and the dirty voice of him, who only pretends to be manners. "Going with the Devil" is one of my five worst film experiences ever, and you never go west in the negative.
