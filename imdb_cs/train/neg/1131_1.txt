The pity that even a talented director, Desplechin, failed to get a decent performance from a totally talented actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks the essence to provide a very brief and clear plot. In an effort to fill the concentric circle of an impending actor, performance and presentation are too fancy and ill-executed to make compassion from the viewer. For too long, the redundancy of Esther's fight is too melodramatic to be effective and to reduce the story to the fragile frame of catastrophic display. The content is incoherent and unreasonable, as Phoenix tries to execute Desplechin's instructions just as Esther is supposed to do the same. We never feel a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel a victory in the Phoenix talent.
