If you are one of the people who find "Jim's" great TV comedy, it will be your rock world. And I could add that Kudos proves that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on a network other than ABC, which prefers flying as an exhibition Jim Belushi year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a big, steamed, brown, German shepherd-big "thank you" for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. It's exactly what the fans of this movie and Belu≈°i deserve. Jim's comic chops and choices in projects are never far beyond his ability to cut the blues standard. Look at him to try to show off all his diverse talent shortfalls in every project that throws out publicly like a grumpy zoo chimpanzee. If you like Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
