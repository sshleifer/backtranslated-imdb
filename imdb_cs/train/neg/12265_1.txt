The special effects of this film, especially for its time, are ridiculous and are used in an overly accented way that you can not deny their terrible existence. Actor redefines the concept of "terrible exaggeration" in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Juli Newman and Andrew Divoff are redefining "bad". <br /> <br /> Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The magic in this movie can be found in two things: The first is an excellent casting by Carel "Lurch" Struycken as a mysterious psychic Gaunt who can feel where and when people die and are always there. that the combination of SF-Western is of course original if it is terrible, but other findings are more original, such as the Zack Stone weapon, which can feel the pain of the people who shoot (though his acting is short here)> <br /> The whole movie. .. you can not see this movie, except if you loved the ol 'hunk-o-brutal Carel Struycken, which everyone should-respect the Dutchman.
