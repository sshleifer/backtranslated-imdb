STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, who beat Freddy at the end of the last film, is now trying to transform their lives. But her unborn baby carries a demonic presence - Freddy, trying to get back to his world again. It is interesting to note that directors who have received their great breaks are directed by Freddy's films, Renny Harlin (Long Kiss Goodnight, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), and Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space , Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin did so well, the Hopkins IMO pad with this item should be quickly forgotten. The story is clearly stretched as to the fact that Freddy is a ridiculous father and ridiculous demon. Even in an hour and a half all this is somewhat tedious and, of course, it is not frightening. <br /> <br /> The only unforgettable position of this "wise very forgotten entry." *
