The premise was interesting, but sadly this film just does not do justice. Casting was pretty good and was beautifully shot - but stylistically a lot of the direction was inconsistent (surprising quick editing was made to make it ineffective .... I'm waiting for Steven Bochca to run in credit followed by commercials), the characters were identified exclusively using coke on the screen (and to the rest of what's left of Boogie Nights for character development), and no personal figures that the viewer would draw into the story. Very forgotten movie.
