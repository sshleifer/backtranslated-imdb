That's true, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books and read the whole series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot. What right did a filmmaker have to defeat an amazing fictional work and make him a mockery of a mysterious genre? If I thought Harry Potter was killed, then Michael O'Hara showed me that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can just pray that another screenwriter who solves this wonderful book will do much more justice. Michael O'Har and Russell Mulcahy: Do not leave your daily work.
