It can be one of the worst movies ever to produce. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning when the guy walks ... and walks ... and walks (spoiler). It is about 15 minutes' walk away. As? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention that there is a lot of trouble lighting up and it's almost like drawing night scenes at night. <br /> <br /> 3. The game was TERRIBLE. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took people who were averted. <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of all the saints, do not lend this movie. If you know someone who owns, apologize to them. The Director should be subject to penalties through the war crimes tribunal,
