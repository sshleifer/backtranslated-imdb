If I could say it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt that my money was not completely useless. Then I saw that Steven Segal was on a deadly plot. This film should see a resurrection on MST 3K. If Santa Claus wins the Martians to get Tom's head off, then one wonders what this movie can do. <br /> <br /> There is a very good reason why Kurt Thomas never had a film career. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> The writers of this T-shirt should be forced to wear posters every day of their life that they say: "Bitch slap me! I was a writer on Gymkata."
