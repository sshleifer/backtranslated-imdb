Some illegal asylum seekers arrive in Stuttgart and find out that the Germans are "racist". <br /> <br /> This is another forgotten steaming nugget on the long anti-German propaganda film after World War II, aimed at making the Germans feel "bad" because they do not know each of them degenerated in their country , so she can look for German blondes and sell drugs to German teenagers. If you are looking for good German movies, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europa Europa" and "Lola rennt." <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> Also, "Das Experiment", with the same male actor from "Lola rennt."
