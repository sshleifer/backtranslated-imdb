While in front of a house where there are evil houses, it may be interesting that executions are directly pathetic. I'm not sure where to start because I have so much trouble with this movie. I assume that a few of them will be named: <br /> <br /> 1. Playing ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, do you know you're in trouble? Not that it would be very important to me, but these names are barely A-List. Susan George may have been in some of the movies I enjoy, but I have never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less he said, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. Ghosts? Spirits or spirits or whatever you call them reminded me of a lot of spirits in a spooky chateau. And they are so scary. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtility is not the property of a house where evil is beneficial. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot? How can one movie be predicted? The result of this movie is painfully obvious as you come across three main characters. If you have not seen where this movie was moving in about 15 minutes, you have to see other movies. <br /> <br /> 4. Comfortable priest? What are the chances that the scary house you are buying will happen across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes, knocking on the door and asking if you need help in removing evil spirits. Absurd is the word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? I find it very difficult to think about some positive questions. I suppose I will make him a point for the opening scene and a point for the architecture of the house. Is this a sure sign of the winner? that architecture as the top of any movie does not say much about the current film. <br /> <br /> I will stop. You should get this idea from what I have already mentioned. And I did not even mention an annoying girl or the invasion of crabs or many other problems. Be warned, this thing is terrible.
