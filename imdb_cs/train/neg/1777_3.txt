If you are such a filmmaker who has original content and intelligent tension ... then look elsewhere, kids, will cause Sleepwalkers to really upset. Usually I'm more eloquent, but ... wow ... that was bad. I especially like when Charles offers Tanya home drive, she rejects, and then she is seen WALKING HOME. Where's his car? Anyway, you just can not see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but my words will escape. Cats jump on people. A boy who was stabbed with grain. Cheesey wraps the proverb "wazoo". You just can not see it. Wait, I took it back! Look at the friend of Stephen King as a guy who owns a cemetery. He is really good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamil and Ron Perlman, the King delivers the best performance of the film. But besides ... wow ... BAD.
