I was looking at a DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the US) and I felt it was a really horrible movie. But the original movie had to cut somewhat or I missed a lot. Sexual scenes had very little vulgarity and not nudity (or breasts), but I read several other comments on IMDb.com, where he mentioned vulgarity and something about the tampon. I did not see anything like that, just a bad, boring film with unrecorded characters and a trite, sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth or Botox into the gill, and her face is touching the expression. And her name reflects on the Taco Bell drink: "I'll have Cola Grande!" It was really fun it was so bad I had to play like I was at my Mystery Science Theater 3000, noticing things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It's really like a silly putty!
