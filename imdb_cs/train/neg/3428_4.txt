Well, if it was not for Ethel Waters and Sammy Davis, Jr. (here billed without Jr.), Rufus Jones as President would be one of the worst performances of the African-American stereotypes I have seen since the early days of the talk, and it would not be worth seeing it for that. Mrs. Waters is excellent singing "Am I Blue?" and "under our Harlem Moon," while Mr. Davis shows us how his childish experience in the showbiz has prepared for his superstar status as an adult. There is such a good dance here that for a moment I thought he was a little man with a ten-year experience. So if you are willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones as president should provide some good enjoyment. P.S. This is the fourth day that I have seen and heard the song "I'll be glad when you're dead, You're Rascal You," which you made in the movie, this time with Davis. This time it was a very popular song.
