Yeah ... it's definitely there with some of the worst movies MSTified, but I definitely saw it worse. Do you think Gremlins was rated by R. Well, I met Rick Sloane at some scientific convention that he was greatly lecturing! It was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes, everyone brought something (if you want to see bullshit, you should see what some friends have brought here). <br /> <br /> He looked like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on the Hobgoblins and even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the version of MST3K! Overall, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it was bad like Mars Attacks. So I think I stood up on this movie and gave him 5 and betrayed all my colleagues MSTies. Excuse me, guys.
