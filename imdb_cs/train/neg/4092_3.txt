I love Fulc's movies, I really do it, and not in a boring, ironic way, but I admit they seem hopelessly awkward and scarred by a lot of people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand in epic fantasy genre and really does not succeed. Structurally, it's like most of the Fulc movie you've seen. Some things happen, other things happen, and sometimes one scene can be tangentially related to another. It's really like Conan without sets, no scenario, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor), no budget, silly looking dog soldiers and lots of gore. hard to get in and I could live without the thumbs of grease blurred on the camera to give her a Hair Metal musical video look.
