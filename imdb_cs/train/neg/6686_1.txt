There's no fun in the whole movie. There is no scary, fun or even interesting scene in this movie. It is promoted as a horror, then it is called comedy. He does not even have ATTEMPT humor. It does not even try to frighten it. <br /> <br /> To make sure the film is not boring, you have to be one of the most talented people in the world. If you like this movie LITTLE BIT, you have no standard for what's watching you at all. I have a very hard time trying to understand what this creator is trying to achieve. It's not funny, scary, shocking or interesting. So that was the drama? Because it was not really dramatic. <br /> <br /> Please do a favor and do not look for this movie. Life is too precious to lose 90 minutes of watching it.
