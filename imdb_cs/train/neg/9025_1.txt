Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV production. I saw a lot of promotional material and I was expecting a professional movie like "Stormriders" - what I was introduced to was a low-budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No atmosphere, very boring, more than worse combat scenes. Some good ideas - no more. I hope I will have the chance to make a movie like this and then show how to make such a movie !!! My Asian Tips: "MUSA - V√ÅLCI", "STORMIDIERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for my bad English!
