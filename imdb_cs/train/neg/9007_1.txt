This movie is one of the worst crap I've ever seen. I literally saw a sharp pain in watching this movie. The CGI was terrible and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-figure-out-anything, except that he does not seem to be working properly on his own helicopter. The biggest problem was working with split screens. I felt as if he was looking at Brady Bunch or something, just not the other people in the boxes, just close up and different views of the same. I can only realize that the actors really needed money, because this film is not worth the film it was filmed for.
