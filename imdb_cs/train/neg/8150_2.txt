If you want an undemanding and reasonably fun hour, it's good. It's not that bad, really. Yeah, it's more logical outages than I can describe here and I can tax the patience of people - just like I do, I have to admit - who tend to throw things on TV sometimes, but it's at least funny. Just because it's not always LOVE funny, you do not have to let it get you down. But if you've read a book - or one of the other Brookmyre books - then you probably are best avoided. I read them all and when I first watched this movie, I scorned it. I detailed them in more detail in another place, in fact. The TV land has virtually no significance for the book and served only to the outrage and fury of many loyal (and frankly) furious Brookmyre fans. Best advice ..? Look at that, then read the book and then just make your comparison and submit your judgment.
