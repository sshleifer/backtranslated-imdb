The only reason I gave her 2 is that filmography is stylized today so she has at least something to express herself about. This movie is asinine. It's like many other 21st century feed fertilizers. Gore is free and just rebellious. It did not matter to any of the characters, but I took care that some asshole was bothering to bother about this crap: I was complaining about the money I spent, but my day and wisely I left after 40 minutes and went to neighboring theater to watch the adventurous and fun game "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably received much higher ratings from me just because I held up for a full moment of "Captivity" for 40 minutes.
