I bought this DVD file, the view invisible and I wish I did not do it. The script needed some serious transcription because it appears to be totally without any feeling and fading compared to the book. Lighting is terrible, very undamaged, but if it was just that I could overlook it. The script does not focus so much on the characters ... it is hardly an introduction to different characters, so it's hard to distinguish who is who (especially on planes - no idea who dies when). <br /> <br /> I have long felt that the key to a good film is to get viewers to take care of the characters; if you do not have nothing. There was no focus on the characters - you never knew them - who they were, what they liked ... what they did to them, what they did. The series is 5 hours long and divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they were doing at this time if they did not see details of attitudes - they put a lot of stuff in it ... I say at least that the hour is spent watching land and take off in LOL aircraft (I think we really need to see it again and again ???). I would give him a much higher rating if we just improved our knowledge of the characters.
