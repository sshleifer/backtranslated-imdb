This movie was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cool. The mother, which is the main character, is everything, but "motherly". Well, she was unhappy in marriage, and she first gave her husband and children. Her husband is dying. Then she goes to visit her son and meets what she sleeps with her daughter and finally sleeps with him. Until this part, the movie is fine. Not excellent, but can be tracked. This guy is charming and who can blame her? OK, it's not too much for a mother to sleep with your daughter's lover, but for blaming her for losing her husband. <br /> <br /> She becomes totally obsessed with a guy. I think that's the part where I did not love the movie. He always wants to please him in an "old way" with a refreshment while working on his son's house (I think it's the only thing he ever taught) as if it were the only one, Attention. The guy obviously does not care much (actually seems to be rather sleeping with her charity activity) and instead of insulting her she still asks him to go with her to bed and be nice to her when is becoming very abusive. "I want to please you," she told him desperately when he was very insulted. What aroused me in this film is the total lack of self-esteem the mother has for herself. He tells Craig something like "I'm just a formless piece" for the first time while sleeping together. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to a female species. If it was me, I would buy a small object that would bring me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
