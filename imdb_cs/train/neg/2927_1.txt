Somewhere there must be a list of the worst gay films that were made every day. One is that they have long camera shots of stars sitting and staring into the space, or one where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti. This motion picture is a story about boys and boys and they live and love, swim and get stuck in grottts and one of them has a depressed mother and the other has no mother and talks and walks, swims and sex and gets drunk and then breaks and someone walks to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and backward and there are long thoughtful shots of one of them staring into the universe or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's a technique of making gimmick films, or maybe the film is so bad that it has to be filled with long, unnecessary shots because otherwise they should rely on plot or story, the film would be about 14 minutes. Do not get me wrong, it's the 30th gay movie I've watched in the past 6 months, and some of them (most of them) were very formal, predictable and boring, but this is really terrible waste The best yet has been "Beautiful thing" I watched this and after the first opening of the shot that remained and persisted, I thought "Oh, no, it will be a creative sinful mah" But I gave him a chance and watched it and then when it was finished I threw the DVD into the basket. I'm sorry I did not like it, and if so, I'm sorry if I offended.
