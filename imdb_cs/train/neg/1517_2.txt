In the title I write that the story is ridiculous. below, I'll work out and tell you why, in my humble opinion, this movie is ruining. Gere and Dan are doing their job, and although it's not their best job, it's pretty good. But the rest of the cast is really bad. I do not think that's a complete mistake of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones who have characters who have even the slightest space in the movie to actually give some depth. All other characters have too little space in the movie to create any depth, or the character is such a cliché that it does not matter how much the actors are trying. The director has a little Se7en complex, but looking only in the direction, I think it does the work OK. But the story. This is a kind of script that is wrong in two ways. First of all, it's a bad movie script. Characters are shallow (except Gere and Danes), villains are clichés, and character action is absolutely incredible. In addition, writers must have a program where they want to return our views and ethics for a hundred years. It's a kind of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they paid the price that society gave them. It's also a movie that says, though only between lines, that every form of sexual deviation should be punished without a court, judge or jury. And of course, according to the film, all that is not sex in the missionary position of a married couple is sexual deviation. So if you want to film school and you need an example of a bad script, or if you write scripts yourself and want to increase your ego. Look at that. I recommend another movie for everyone else.
