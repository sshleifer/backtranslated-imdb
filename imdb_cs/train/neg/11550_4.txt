I knew I could see a cheap movie, but I expected much more from Alex Cox. The dealings of the two leading men were terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should win the Oscar compared to the two. This movie was filled with what might have been in jokes for people in the film industry and a few other jokes I actually understood and made myself laugh loud, which is rare. Without these laughs-off-loud moments I would give this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who did all the 80th classics? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a few questions I had after the movie. Why did the Mexican get to the house of the other boy at the beginning? What was her daughter saying she got 100 people from her last job? Why did you break your own things when she was crazy about him? I think I was supposed to go to Q & A after the movie, but I did not want to get up at 10 am.
