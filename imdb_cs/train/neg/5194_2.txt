Do not get me wrong, I want to see marijuana legalized as well as another guy. I turn now. Writing was unrealistic. PTA Mom, who deals with drugs but hardly claims her drugs get into the hands of juveniles. Give me a break. The very fine spirit of Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not pleasant at all. Basically, the land was nowhere. I understand his only television plot. The hypocrisy was obvious. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mother and I have to believe it ... WHY ???? I just felt that he preached to me a show of wasting seedliness. It's like telling his OK cheating on his wife, but with someone of legal age. OK, it's not exactly the same thing, but I think you do. The fact that the baby thing is saved is great for campaign paths, I think, but it does not keep water in the cable sitcom about the suburbanite mum, as a local vendor.
