The easiest way to describe this movie is like satire. The goal of satire is quite extensive, from the US government to corporate America. This is not a stabbing satir, but rather stupid. Think of this film as a mix between Kentucky Fried, Airplanes, and the Police Series, with a much smaller budget and not funny. I see how this film is the satire of many sci-fi catastrophic films from the 1950s and 1960s. I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton's Mars attacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Genetically modified giant tomatoes are "crazy" and begin to attack people and cities. It is first covered and then blown into a full blown war. The movie features a number of characters and characterizations: Lois "Fairchild" (Lois Lane Clone), very ambitious presidential press secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who did not work from the bay), unnecessary president (only he seems to be able to sign his name and attacking in New York), even an unpleasant congress, a marketing director and a Mason team consisting of an obese East German "female" swimmer, diver, crazy World War II soldier and African American expert disguise (dressed as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler, and finally like tomatoes). I forgot to mention a bunch of tomatoes too? There are all kinds of tomatoes, from small tomatoes to huge plastic tomatoes, broken tomatoes, tomato juice, and finally people dressed like tomatoes. Besides, you have some music numbers too. They are not so good and they seem to be dubbed. The best melody is the theme of the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's a bit catchy and you could eventually buzz or sing in public. Be warned. Most of the film is quite fun and shows the absurdity of different real life situations and different entertainment genres. I do not believe I was laughing, but I smiled and smiled. I definitely recommend this movie for B and C movie fans, but only for rent. <br /> <br />
