I will not approach and criticize the RAW theory. I think it's a place about movies and about whether the film is being produced or is well made, not a philosophy of discussion. <br /> <br /> When he said this, this video actually blows. It's one speech shot of RAW after another. Some of them are archive videos, so you can see how he has over the years, and that's pretty cool. Otherwise, the experience is unmistakably monotonous. It's a strange comparison, but I was thinking about Sunday afternoons when I watched some of the stars of Barbra Streisand * Funny Lady * (another really bad movie). After some time I was so brave to Barbra, I still wished there was one scene in which she would not appear: you know, "yet, other characters in the movie were nothing but ..." a moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well this video is RAW's * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So if your thought of a good time is to look at a few shots and angles of RAW faces while he irritates his theories, he gathers in a lame structure that adds no interest or understanding, then be my guest. He could not take it for me after 20 minutes.
