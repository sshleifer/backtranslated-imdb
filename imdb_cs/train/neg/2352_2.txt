Raw, sometimes stupid - for me, it's the sum of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - page 3. He has no view - just shallow, fun digging for stereotypes. What is the film about?? These are reports of a clan of people (the so-called Types) who are so busy in socializing and progressing in their life profiles - that they do not have time for anything else. And you are either inside her or her. It's not any press that could report everyday events. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there are major newspapers and is just an add-on; perhaps some entertainer to find who is who and what it is. Do not mix these two. And then there is power - it would happen in every life course. So, what you have uttered at the end of everything - nothing - just a few rough jokes merged in a different direction less film.
