This movie I saw last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in my place. I think I expected the film with Gere to be of some value in the end, but never got anything on the screen. The story is a silly excuse to accumulate after the shooting of slavery and torture. There is no character in the movie that makes something like a real life. The editing style relies on jumps, mini-replaying and overprinting to make this vague arrangement of sadistic gangs, which apparently go freely for a long time, to become a "victim" of the executed killer. I do not know how Gere, Buddhist, has been involved in this violent, sexist waste.
