This movie is just too long, too repetitive, and male nudity and sexuality are (as they say gay with their own collection of adult titles) too good and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could be reduced to ten minutes, and it was as effective as the audience's patience (and perseverance). I noticed this film early Saturday afternoon, with a film festival audience; a type of crowd that tends to be more adventurous, interested in experimental or atypical films such as one without excessive dialogue, shorts, foreign films. Most sold out crowds in approximately 275 chairs began to move in the first half of the film, and while most of them stayed on a "paycheck" (which never did), I've never seen any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and other, so many people who left the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily be reduced by more than half and was as effective as it was. It could also go in different directions, with a shorter duration and more effective. <br /> <br /> Because it currently exists, it's not something that could easily be recommended, the desire to watch again.
