I have this movie because I worked in a video rental room so I got a free rent. He stepped in and the packaging looked good. Hot cat carrying a gun, all right, I'll check it out. Oh, man, a bad move. It was so terrible that I spent half the movie that looked fast forward to get to the nudity that was minimal. I think there may be three scenes of partial nudity. Cheese dialogue, miserable violence, bad excuses of characters. I feel bad that this film is down because I know it was made for a cheap budget, but it was also "clerks" and became a classic classic and franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
