This is a movie of tired but strangely childish clich√©s. Is there a Nazi witch who performs experiments in the basement? But please! <br /> <br /> The goal for the creeping sensation of horror and fear is the overall impression of the film of a very immature concept of fear. I have no expectations in advance, I stay with this: old Buffer Xander and a human face heroine who apparently does not know how to act. I said that I only met Adrienne Barbeau in the much more enjoyable "Cannibal Women in the Jungle of Death Avocado". Camera and editing enhance the general impression of the lame.
