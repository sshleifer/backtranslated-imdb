In the United States, only a few films about Rome were shot that were not in or shortly after Julius Caesar's. The Hollywood sword and sandal epics have mostly a Christian theme, making access to earlier Roman history difficult (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and met some resistance in Hollywood because he did not have Jesus in it). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one film that takes place not only before Caesar and Christ, but it is set when Rome was just one of the many cities on the Italian peninsula and just cast out the hated king Tarquin and founded the republic. But this is not a historical film; it is peplum, and while production values ​​are not a rock bottom, it is a characterization and cartonage. I can only imagine what the dialogue was in Italian but with wooden English dubbing it is very huge. At first I got some good laughs. I have not seen many films of this genre because I lost most of the 1960s Herculean films. It's a bit fun, but as the movie goes on, it's a little boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: if I saw this movie when I was ten, I would love to. At that age, I set out for something with the Romans and a sword in it. At least, such a movement caused several children's memories.
