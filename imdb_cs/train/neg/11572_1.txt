Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder Weinstein's company did not buy it. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while shooting and stop producing. There is no way you can watch and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can do a 2 minute movie with this idea is not a feature. I'm sorry I rented the movie. We will never look at what is called Spurlock. It's all waste. The creators of this movie should be on YouTube and will never be given a distribution solution. The film states that American consumers and their purchases are responsible for the current depression in buying and buying products, making money in the system is the foundation of a healthy economy.
