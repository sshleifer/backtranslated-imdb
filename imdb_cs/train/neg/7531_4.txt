This is, apparently, a movie of more grief. As such, it should move viewers and make them empathic with the misfortune of the main characters. However, his irritating postmodern style is almost incomprehensible. The camera is constantly shifting from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the other, creating a torn, incoherent effect. Most characters seem to live a purposeless, unstructured life that is linked to professional engagement. (It also raises the credibility that a person who has just received what constitutes a probable death sentence would mercifully commit a sexual fairy tale to a woman he has just met). The story (if it's a story) is difficult to follow. Overall, the overall effect is somewhat unsatisfactory. Still, acting is generally good and some scenes are pretty strong.
