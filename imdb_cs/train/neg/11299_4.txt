Mummy's tomb starts with an overview of mom's mom's events and then moves the story forward for several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and mummy Kharis set out to cause confusion and revenge on the past who broke the grave. <br /> <br /> Although I absolutely loved the mummy with Boris Karloff as a mummy Imhotep and quite fond of "Mom's hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is a direct prequel to this film), I was not so accepted with " The Mummy's Tomb. " It is made in a style similar to the previous movie and has a rather similar conspiracy, although in a new environment. Lon Chaney Jr is okay like Kharis, but he does not really look. And I think that's my main criticism of this film - it does not look like it. There is nothing really terrible, but nothing really exceptional, so the viewer will stay with a fairly no mummy story.
