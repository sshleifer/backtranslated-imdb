Rounding off "Our Gangs" from 1929-30, "Tough Winter", contains two stories. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a winter day, decide to do some taffy. Little Wheezer brings directions to Mary Ann from the radio show. Problem: Whitheart transmits information from various concerts and Mary Ann ends up mixing with soap! Fun moments appear when the rest of the gang appears to pull out the tafia - and eventually gets around the house! The second story is about Stepin Fetchit, a gang neighbor / guardian, and his interaction with Gang. <br /> <br /> "Hard Winter", to my knowledge, has never been shown on TV even though it is available on home video. The reason is the Stepin Fetchit, which shows a moving, cunning and slow-moving character. Hal Roach, the producer of our gang, called Fetchit a "comic book," and used this "gang's" input as a pilot for the Fetchit series that never saw daylight. It is understandable that Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film was postponed. Although there are some fun moments both with Fetchit and taffy, "Tough Winter" is a fruitful and meandering effort. If one came out of this movie, it was that Hal Roach's studio became certain and experienced that Sound in the movie is good and some of the sound effects are fun. For this reason, this film in part has paved the way for excellent films 1930-31 "Our Gangs". <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
