No wonder historian Ian Kershaw, the author of the original Hitler biography, originally a scientific advisor for this TV film, has separated from it. The film is historically too incorrect. Errors begin immediately when Hitler's father Alois dies at home while he actually died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in fact he actually moved to Munich in 1913. I could continue indefinitely. Hitler's childhood and youth are rendered too short, making it difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important parties from the early days, such as Hitler Dietrich Eckart's paternal friend or philosopher Alfred Rosenberg, are totally absent. Characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. The film is portrayed as a noble character that almost despises Hitler. Of course, the screenplay follows Hanfstaengle's own gloss over his self-centered post-war biography. In fact, Hanfstaengl was anti-Semitic and was foolish with his "Fuehrer." The biggest problem with the film is, however, the display of Hitler itself. He is characterized as a person who is always hostile, has no charisma or magic, and constantly orders everyone around. After watching the movie, somebody is interested in how such a disgusting person could ever get some followers. Because we all know what a wicked criminal was Hitler, naturally every writer tries to portray Hitler as totally disgusting and nonartistic. The fact is, however, that in private it could be quite charming and fun. His buddies did not go because he was constantly screaming, but because he liked this strange man. In addition to all these historical mistakes, the film is greatly made, actors are first class, spot shots and production design provide a credible impression of the time.
