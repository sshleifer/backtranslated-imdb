It was really terrible! She had a terrible story, she was mistaken, and was like the amateur remake of the dead, but not nearly as good. <br /> <br /> I got my whole toughness to live it, it's a good job. I did not have to visit the toilet, I doubt I would come back! This makes the Hammer House of Horror look like a big screen of the Hollywood epic. <br /> <br /> The only value of this movie was an endless offer of beautiful women. It's not bad between them! <br /> <br /> If you want to have a drink with your friends after night, then it's for you ... otherwise it's avoided as a plague!
