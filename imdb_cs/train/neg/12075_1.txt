This Hamlet has become one of the most difficult episodes of the MST3000. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, but I do not believe he intends his work to make this slow and dark. It is also one of the most difficult films to appear, as many Hamlets are mentioned here. Just like I said it's boring. It is black and white, the movement is slow and there is minimal scenery. Actors are all dubbed so it does not help. This is the MST 3000 that I can not watch in one sitting because the way Hamlet plays tells her that his lines can give someone some sleep.
