Is not it as bad as being credited to being (Hooper is far worse)? more disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept, which Hooper never starts with in its economic direction, and even less in written smoke (apologize for word). It looks so ominous and over the top in a dead, serious tone, making it ridiculous and uninterested, leaving the whole pessimistic narrative story / story plot easy to telegrap to end up on something completely sudden. Because of this slow motion, Brad Dourif (cool to see him in the lead) seems to be struggling with an unbalanced performance, despite the fact that he faded through the extremely insurmountable intensity of his indescribable character. Although it is cheaply executed, there is a relevant technical stance. However, he does not appear anywhere else with his idea anywhere else, and instead wants to soak in the ugly bouts (which some work) and strikingly special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper shows some stylish frenetic pictures (rather at the other end), and the camera is quickly maneuvered and the light score is silent. Performances are all around the show with William Prince, Cynthie Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also, Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but fun portraits? especially Landis. Nothing surprised, but it's tireless.
