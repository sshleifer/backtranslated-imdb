If you want a dragon to eat every member's occupation, you know you're in a bad ride. <br /> <br /> I came with very low expectations when I read some other comments and was not released. Unlike some other cheap and unsuccessful movies, however, this game will not remain cheerful (and unintentionally) witty all over. <br /> <br /> -SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> First, it is very inconsistent. Looking at "small" bugs like a dragon that grows in 3 hours, the whole idea behind it is confused. You see, the movie wants us to believe that the dragons came out of the universe in the form of meteorites that were really dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show that some peasants try their fork and the dragon jumps. Later, the obligated "crazy scientist" bewildering about how the dragons survived the dinosaurs. So, apparently, people were around when they were dinosaur, or we had only a small hole. The other major thing is that the lab is blown up by the "half strong" force it used for Hiroshima. Then two guys later go through to check everything, and it's almost undamaged! One more dragon who grew out of who knew what. Overall, this is very predictable. Once that guy said cloning, I think they would clone the dragon. That means our Mr. Smarty pants' safety boy is not as intuitive and smart as the film might think if you ignore that I knew this movie would be, you know, dragons. <br /> <br /> When you postpone it, the second worst thing is 'special effects'. Others mentioned the fake rocks that fell in the beginning, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a bit more than a bit, but it destroyed what he did when he was rocking down the corridor. Because of their astonishment, the flying dragons looked at the beginning from afar (though the one in the cave is probably the worst in the whole movie.) But these things are ridiculous to watch. Scenes showing a million different shots of the same person that are shown in different ways are not. They are not "front" screens with vital statistics. They came to the actors, they were not the best, but I think they were at least trying? They seemed more excited about what they were doing than many of the actors taking part in the recent "BloodRayne," and you have to give them points for it. One thing I noticed was that the woman who played Meredith often had a face-covered make-up that had many tones lighter than others. She looked as if she had a bad assault with a white face. The script is bad and cheesy. You do not really notice the music, but in most cases it's not too bad. <br /> <br /> Do not look at the bottom line if you do not want to see it because you hear it's bad (like I did it), although the only fun thing is the bad effects of CG. In addition, do not waste your time and money.
