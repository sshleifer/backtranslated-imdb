Disney people have a lot of explanation. First and why would anyone think that this material with smaller situations would even have a half-hour film. In the quirky teleplay, the unique idea of ​​the Martians has not yet provided sophisticated X-file treatment. The curious visions of small green men have long since been scattered like ET, CLOSE SUNSHOTS and ALIENS 1-3. Each spell that had this property was mainly due to the exciting relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as an enemy visitor. The spiritual that the martians have an antenna, it seemed, Now seems to be positively idiotic. But Christopher Lloyd's Uncle sports metal pendants. At the moment, the antenna should be a sign of a television station on which Tim is working, thinking "Martian"! When did you last see the rabbit-eared television, right? Disney does not believe in quaint relationships and recognizes this swing with special effects that include a fashionable suit named Zoot! Yes, that's right you read - the silver space suit Uncle Martina speaks. It is supposed to be a really merry cut! Reshap the image. I have socks that are more fun than Zoot. Every action that lags (and continues to fall), computer graphics are put into play to revive things. Tim is here playing dear Jeff Daniels, who can not (or will not) do anything to save this gruesome mess. Cries Christine Ebersole brings some comic enthusiasm to her role as neighboring ladies. Even Ray Walston himself is painfully drawn into the procedures - all without any success. This foreign visitor is dead on arrival. <br /> <br /> Constantly chatting about sitcoms that are spinning on the screen, I just hope that I DREAM OF JEANNIE will not contain a talking ghost. I pray that Samantha's cat in BEWITCHED would not have a series. I live in fear that I love LUCY - FILM will proudly introduce the CG Conga Drum called Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - take me to your leader.
