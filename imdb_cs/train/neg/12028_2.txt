I agree with all the above who said anything that will convince you that you will not lose a moment of watching this amazing amateur film. Very bad play, extraordinary value of production, utter pedestrian direction and scenario so awkward and sad that it should never be written, let alone made. Even the Hollywood "professionals" are probably going to work just for pay, even though no one should be paid for this bad job. Instead, the career should end above this insignificant driving angle. OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so that the jaw looks bad. And Chad Lowe is terribly and always bad.
