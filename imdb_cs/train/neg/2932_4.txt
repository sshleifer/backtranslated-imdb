Not that he would take care of it, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I were, it would be a good chance we would fall if he continued to sneak like this. The problem is that he found a successful formula like a humming, ordinary guy - another guy in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, etc. But he starts wearing thin. Here his character does not have any distinct features, he is rough and uncomfortable, and thinks he's funny if he's not. When I transition from London to New York (and I think that this connection is meant to reach viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), just as its new colleagues are equally impossible. Still, she is surprised to find a transvestite stripper among her cheerful daughters, who appears at the editorial meeting as the revenge of her boss. Still, Kirsten Dunst begins to warm him, though he did not do anything good. Oh, and because she's a superficial man, she falls for Megan Fox at first glance, perhaps because her character is as superficial as his. Everything makes the predictable conclusion of the film, although I do not see any viewer who expresses how it reflects their lives. The pity is that the paper is a cast that is probably worth the attention. Pegg, however, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go through the motions, creating no chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox is not drawn at all. One huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, like Pegg's New York landlada - now if she's been on the screen longer .....
