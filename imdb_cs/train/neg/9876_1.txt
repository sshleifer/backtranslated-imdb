I figured you did not know about this movie and I went in half an hour when I knew all about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm generally a nice guy, but if someone told me he likes this movie, I'd never talk to them. Anyone who likes it is most likely a very dry hermit personality. I will also include that they think they are quite intelligent, just like the self-centered fart bags that make voices for the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like me, but that's fine; I do not think it covers any range of humor. This film is as flat and boring as Wes Anderson's mind. Go in and get ready to leave; the best is also to get money back.
