If this book remained faithful to this book, we can assume that the author did not know about history. Mark Anthony never died of injuries he had in the battle, as shown. He died with the death of a coward by committing suicide, and even then asked his slave to do so. The slave decided instead to kill himself. In a real story, Marek Anthony was ashamed of a grand slave and decided to copy him. But even in death Mark Anthony was drunk and failed in his suicide attempt. He shouted at Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She opened the door on the ropes and Mark Anthony died for a while. If you want the history of this movie not to look. If you want a romantic cripple, you will probably enjoy it!
