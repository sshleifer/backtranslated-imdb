Remake Alejandra Amenabar Abre los Ojos, but this time with a lively breathing mask like lead. For the dubious advantage of the English soundtrack, we sustain the soulless performance of Tom Cruise as usual with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his person, but he usually gives us some character to keep our interest. His empty position negates any erotic energy that might be between his character and Cruz or Diaz. There is an acting exercise involving the use of a mask to free the actor to enrich his presentation of the character by verbal and body language means. Cruise camouflage only painfully highlights his lack as an actor. You see the original Amenabar Open Your Eyes from 1997!
