I am 13 and I hate this movie with her worst film on the ground I was totally useless my time watching it and was disappointed that on the cover and on the back of the film it looks pretty good but I was wrong about it. but when I saw the delta, she was a completely different and bad actress, and she really did not know how old the two girls were trying to be that I was so confused. the movie was confusing in some parts and I did not like it at all, but I watched the whole movie just to see if it was going to improve but it was not, it was boring, boring and I said BORING. And I do not think I would like many other people. I was boring
