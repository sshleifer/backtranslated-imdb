Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where to start?!? This movie gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War running for his money as the worst movie ever made. This is a funny laugh where Manos can only look painfully. Hobgoblins ends somewhere in the time capsule as the perfect film that describes the term "80th cheeze". The acting actor (and I use this term freely) is shameful, Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you've ever seen, and the fight with garden tools must be seen. The film was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and this version is the only way to track this mess. This film gives Mike and boots plenty of ammunition to pull out some of the most entertaining disposable craft ever made. If you try to follow it without Mike and Boti ..... God will help you!
