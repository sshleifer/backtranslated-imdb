I do not understand how the movie might feel like the one who even likes Van Damne. The movie really starts with a promise. I think the action scenes at the beginning of the movie are excellent. Action scenes with the family department trying to save the twins are a great start and a good approach to the main story. However, the film is all down from here. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the director could stay with the original assumption. These are the brothers born in different parts of the world, so they learned different skills. One brother should have experience with martial arts, but the other brother should have experience with firearms. How comfortable when it comes time that a brother who has never hit a gun is a great shotgun, and a brother who was not a learned martial art is suddenly making ruptures and high kicks. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy, action, etc. are simply ridiculous. My favorite scenes? And what if Van Damne faces an armed soldier with AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of filming and filming on Van Damne, he makes a scream of war as if he were fighting a battle ax and running on it. Van Damne continues to pull the gun from the fallen soldier and shoots him ... while he's still about 75 to 80 yards away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointed endings. Bolo Yeung is an experienced martial artist. However, instead of choreography of a decent fight. He was throwing barrels at Don Damne like Donkey Kong. An absolutely worsening film that had so many promises. If your Fan Van Damne saves you time and you will see Hard Target or one of his previous films.
