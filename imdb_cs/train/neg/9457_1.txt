Probably everything in this movie is bad, bad, bad. Take, for example, Mike Myers. It has reached the point where you realized that he had not changed since his SNL for more than a decade. It does the same cute joke in the flow of consciousness and the same voices. His cat is painfully unhappy. He's trying hard. It's a strange type of comic, not a cunning cat to be. The rest of the film is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly - and probably the loss of millions of dollars. (Cardboard cutouts for the backdrop of the building would make more sense than building the entire district and the main street.) Alec Balwin is trying to make a funny big Santini impression but eventually looks and looks disjointed. There is even an inappropriate bread with the faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- which holds in your mind simply because it is the story of Dr. Seuss. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. It's not even an interesting wreck of a train. (I hope they will do Horton Hearse's Who with Robin Williams, and then we will have a bad Seuss movie star with a comic book trilogy.)
