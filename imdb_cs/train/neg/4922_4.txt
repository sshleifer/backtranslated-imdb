DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that has always been shown on Sky movies in the UK, and since it seemed to appear about three times a week throughout the year, I have no idea how I missed it until it was first broadcast on network television tonight. In fact, I see that I'm not a fan of horror films, it was probably my theory that it would be scary. My theory has been largely proven <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 so bad movie is a lot of stupid scripts. For example, at the beginning of the movie, Dracula from London to America (in a twin-turbo-powered airplane) is falling, and one of the villains remains alone in the cargo where Dracula is going to live. The fight is running out, there's a lot of noise, but the bad guys in the cockpit will not hear the sound until the scenario demands it. Also in this segment there is a peak that Dracula can control the weather, but it seems that this film seems to forget the progress of the film. Sloppy scripting and also there seems to be a problem with the structure where there are many character scenes on New Orleans mardi gras, then the characters are in another place like the police station in the following scene, then they are back to the mardi gras scene after it means that the lack of credibility on the plot is reinforced <br /> <br /> Something else that the string has drawn - Product placement. There are a number of scenes where the logo for a certain chain of labels / retailers is full. I will not dare to promote the brand of the company (except they say they also run a train company, which is a national joke in Britain), but I have the impression that this type of advertisement is against UK broadcasting instructions and I am surprised that the BBC showed this film if so it is <br /> <br /> There are some positive examples in DRACULA 2000, such as visual ones. It's a really good movie with a good-looking actor and the boy's vampire cubs were hot, but it's something we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - a very good movie that's very stupid
