Here's why Jane Show will not work. Canadian producers and writers of Canadian anger can not again create a sitcom without having any other spin on it. I think these people in the US are not too aware of a TV that has a sitcom model. No, here we have to do something else, we have to make the Story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful story B that is trying to make up for it. The characters are two-dimensional and the story lines are at the top: Forklift races ??? Give me a terrible break. Here's a little advice for the authors of the show, Do not write funny situations, find funny in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things and not just an improvised monkey.
