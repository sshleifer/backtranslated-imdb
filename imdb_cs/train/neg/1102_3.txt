First, I have to admit that both films I've seen in this director have seen without titles so I could skip points. My Czech is not bad, but after I sat two of his films, I wish I did not even try to learn. Samotari is too cold. Too cool. These are ten different stories that weave in and out together. It's not so unusual in cities with Prague size (small, really.) Major figures are between 20 and 30. They have a job and only one study. The best figure is a young Balkan girl. Her feelings are immigrants every day damned. That's about it. The only great figure. Everyone else makes their own life quite hell. How can I sympathize with such obvious incompetence? Maybe interesting bits with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype movie? If you like great music, check out this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, check out this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, look at the original Jarmusch not imitation. And under no circumstances will you see Ondrice's film, Septe (whisper). That's unless you have homophobic stereotypes.
