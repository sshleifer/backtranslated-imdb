Why am I watching such movies? - besides having some strange misleading masochistic belief that someday I will find a real jewel among all these debris, I can not think it's a good reason. This film was from the beginning to the end - but the semicircular wreck. Where else, rather than a bad Italian dubbed movie, you can find heated exchanges of unbelievably blurred English such as the honest military type and the ominous Chief of Secret X as an organization trying to conceal the "truth": <br /> Man in Black: Silence is best for us until we can prove that UFOs have no religious motives. Military type: In any case, it seems to me that your interference is wrong. </ p> <p> </ p> <br /> <br /> Man in Black: <br /> <br /> I turned the DVD (you know what I mean) a good half a dozen times and still fails this line means something reasonable. My other fake line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be quite difficult for those who are overturning our interests." It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most important details of this boring film film for me were the totally unfolded activity of the photographer at the beginning. Nested in the worst editing of EVER in the history of everything, a man just wandered around, looked like a stunned fish in a bad wig until he had kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of plexiglass by some aliens. Aliens are most effectively seen as a POV shot - a hand-held camera with a fish eye lens - a little scary for the first time but repeatedly using lost power (incidentally, if it's Point of View shot, that means aliens for some reason always come out of the back room ). The film was based in England. This meant that Spanish Italian designers built several English notes on a few English cars and put Union Jack on our hero's press card ... and that was about it. No other attempt to make it look like the United Kingdom at all. <br /> <br /> Favorite moments? When the Foley artists did not notice that the characters that were beating (already such a word?) Were no longer on the gravel, but now they were on the lawn, so their feet are still making loud "crunching!" sounds. Other than that, another complete waste 90 minutes of my life. I hope they can prove that UFOs will not soon have fighting motives ...
