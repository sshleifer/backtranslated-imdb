This movie was terrible, I even feel uncomfortable calling it a movie. It's a typical "mumblecore" movie, a zero conspiracy, and plenty of aimless queens who are struggling with "trying to figure things out". I tried to give the mumblecore a chance, but be honest, it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> I'm not synchronous with the cinema, I feel movies Dogme95, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies. So I do not mind if the movie is cheap, if any (ANY) substance exists. Everything in this movie is horrible, acting, writing (or everything improvised?), Direction, but most of all, over the camera, working with the camera was simple and simple nonsense. The camera was never logical, there was no consistency. I have to admit that I'm a guy I heard was nudity in this movie, so I thought well, even if it's just a terrible nudity (yes, I know, I'm a jerk). With the awesome work with the camera uber you never see anything and the things you see, trust - you do not want to see. This movie wanted to reverse me on many levels. Dialogue made me vomit, working with the camera made me sick, but mainly to the idea that this film praised some legitimate critics, now that more than anything else causes me to vomit.
