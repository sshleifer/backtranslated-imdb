I was watching the film and was totally horrified when I said the film could not communicate with me as an audience. The language would love the streams in the streets. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy; father forced none of his son to marry, seems to be cowardly. <br /> <br /> The idea that a grandmother will ask her big boy to spoil the enemy would only draw the attention of the weak mind. <br /> <br /> ... and I waited for the whole movie to laugh and laugh at my stupidity to lose 3 hours to make sure the movie does not even look at it at first glance. Let's hope it saves time!
