I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budgets, so it was not my problem. My problem is that I felt like watching a neighbor's home movie. IMO It all looked like the guy wrote a quick story, caught the camera and started shooting. I understand how hard it has to be effective, but when I pay the movie I expect to feel like I'm watching some kind of professionally filmed movie. John Schneider has a huge biography, is a great actor and was fine in this movie. The other people were not. I understand how fun and cheaper it is to use friends and relatives as a cast, but that does not mean convincing action. It seemed like the way he was shot, trying to give more scenes a more interesting look, but when it's more like writing, plotting and acting, that type of style is not necessary and it's a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also at the technical level, it has digital artifacts everywhere. In the first scene of all the great cars, when they were scanning slowly, they seemed to shake a little bit back and forth. The problem is not in my viewing device (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal), but somewhere in the production. I have never seen such a kind of artifact in a professionally filmed movie before, then sounded, did not make any voices, which might be fine if it did not sound like a clue in this movie, it sounded like a built-in microphone on the camera.
