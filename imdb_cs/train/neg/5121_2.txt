I went to this movie and I thought it would be a wonderful football drama (in the same spirit as remembering tyts); however, I came to feel that I just visited Ted Haggard's preaching about Rapture. The only thing missing was the request for tithe at the end of the film. In fact, one would probably get more of a television sermon than this bad excuse for entertainment. At least with a TV sermon, quotations from the Scriptures are rather than quotes from populist self-help. The plot was perfectly predictable so that someone with enough attention could plot the entire conspiracy during the first 15 minutes of the film.
