Unfortunately it was wrong. This movie is from the beginning to the end. It was hard to watch because I watched Claris explaining it all day to Nickelodeon. I loved her. Then the other thing I discovered spread to Maxim and was wonderful! I did not hear anything about her until I watched this film by accident. I could not believe she would even have seen such a thing in her name. It was all bad, but it still seemed like somewhere in the team was really trying hard to save the sunken ship. It is a pity that I hope she will continue to act and I would like to see her with a real cast in real movie.
