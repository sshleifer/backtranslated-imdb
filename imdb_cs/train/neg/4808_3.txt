Okay, I've seen a lot of movies about witchcraft and occult, but this was just weird. This movie begins with this cult of witches under the direction of the really bad Orson Wells, who plays the role he wanted (he could not get someone who looked and behaved more like a Satanist) that he simply did not belong to this movie. But anyway, coven will take a new member and decorate a doll that resembles someone and causes it to become a mistake. The lady who had a misdemeanor and her husband will go to a place called Lillith on the bus and the lady will see her sister's picture or anyone who calls her and warn her to stay away from her and never use her powers there or she will die. The couple, when they settled in a strange town, found out that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes a nose and afraid of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things begin to happen when a lady finds a funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly disappears (it was scary) and saw a little boy who belongs to Orson Wells on the playground, who later asks the lady to help him bring him back to life. The lady will soon try to escape the city but only to find herself in passages with her inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring everything she's trying to warn her about. This movie is fine, it's a moment of tension, but it really could do much better than having Orson there.
