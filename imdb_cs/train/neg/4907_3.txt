Spoilery CELÃ‰ !!!! <br /> <br /> I read the book "1. die "and wanted to find out if the film was following a book, so I watched her. For the most part, he did. There have been some MINOR differences (the location of the last violent scene for example), but not much and for the most part the film remained true to the book more than most films. This could be a bug -although the film was perfectly cast-pollen and bellows mainly-I was not so concerned with the book. Or let me take it back. I started very impressed, gradually became disillusioned and at the end was left completely dissatisfied and felt almost gypped. No difference with the movie. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "payout" in a book or movie. I rarely read who did the thriller that caused such confusion with its finite resolution and I was hoping the film would be a bit different. The whole - (did it, no, did it NO. Both did it) - created uninteresting, not fascinating and more confusing, unpleasant and depressing then something else. Add to the fact that Lindsay's love dies at the end (after the disease HER cleans and she weeps on his grave) .. and then moved to the place where she contemplates suicide ... then suddenly she is in the fight for her life a real villain who was erased after being arrested .. but it turned out he and his wife were in him together .... HELLO !!! This whole thing has now become "GENERAL DISEASE" instead of a good old-fashioned thriller. I felt cheated and destroyed by the book and watching the film (I must admit that it was carefully watching me - the acting was very good for television) hoped she would not follow the book she had lost. /> <br /> I still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as a bad taste in the mouth like a book (or maybe it's just that I knew what was going to happen) but I have to say that the way the narrative story was not at all right.
