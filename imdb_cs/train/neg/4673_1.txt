I love the books of Henry James and Washington Square is no exception. I was very excited to see a new film based on the book of this title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the lead role. Albert Finney is a miscast and does not do a good job. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her stupid, awkward role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. I slept in the theater watching this long, filmed and exceptionally boring movie. The dialog has more pauses than Pinter Play. In the book I felt deep care of Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also did not like her aunt's sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> See if you can not sleep, it's definitely a snoozer. Do not look if you're depressed. You need Zoloft afterwards. <br /> <br /> Sure, "The Heire" was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the lead roles. The actor who played his father was like a deceived, cold father ... still grieved for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The movie was not a faithful book, but this is not the case. <br /> <br /> This movie was a flop box. I have no doubts about why.
