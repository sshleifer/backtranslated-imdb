This is Western action. James Steart leads the whole star occupied in the scenic northwest, which is filmed in beautiful beauty. Sceneries and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a rich cattle that runs with disbelieving crooked government in old Nothwest. The main drawback is a stereotypical cynic, which has always become a heroine for Hollywood. Even when this film was made, the cynic was a stereotypical hero, and Stewart's portraits really have little economical mercy. He is kind to his two partners, and that gives him another dimension of credibility and sympathy. But he is so thin to everyone else, it's hard to take care of him or accept him. It's like one-dimensional spaghetti western characters (cut not so bad). <br /> <br /> However, smaller characters are quite nice. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and so on.
