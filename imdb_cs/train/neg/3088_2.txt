1. Aliens reminiscent of plush toys and hand puppets while weapons do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. Aliens have mastered the intergalactic space path, but they do not know how to push the unlocked door open doors but they can open doors that are closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Older security guards know how to get hold of C4 and wait for the right time to use it, let's say when they are suddenly fired for any explanatory reason. <br /> <br /> 4. It seems that the US Army boot camp in the 1980s involved several sessions of "war tools in the garden," including pirate death. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your cozy friend, you have to "save the world ... err ... neighbors" from strangers. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are fucked, either openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Fragile nightclubs look bad. <br /> <br /> 8. The "Scummy" waitresses have doubled as the dancers for The Fontanelles (how did they talk about it?) Who can do only 60 dance moves. <br /> <br /> 9. The army of privacy secretly dream of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. Grenades are probably a place for "flash-bang". <br /> <br /> 11. Being burned alive seems to be leaving only one with minor burns on his arms. <br /> <br /> 12. US Army guards are apparently always in this area and will not do anything about foreigners in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. Aliens obviously "go home", which means back to the vault in which they were unlocked. <br /> <br /> 14. Foreigners are attracted to bright light rays, which probably means that in the Los Angeles area one would assume that the house of protagonists is the lightest thing in this area. <br /> <br /> 15. Showing 16 parking scenes in the movie lifts the audience more. <br /> <br /> 16. The Vans of the 1980s seem to have terrible hanging systems. <br /> <br /> 17. This movie is about to become a comedy. <br /> <br /> 18. Horror is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 19. The film has to be written and honored. <br /> <br /> 20. This movie heals insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Garden tools seem to make electronic keyboard sounds every time they are used, not only in combat (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed it). The simple truth is that this movie just went wrong. Time. There is not much meat on the bones, nor anything really good. Even the average. It is bad. However, I've seen a lot worse and the fight scene is purely comic gold, deliberate or otherwise. 2/10 - Front 4 was worse than this. At least the film has never taken seriously.
