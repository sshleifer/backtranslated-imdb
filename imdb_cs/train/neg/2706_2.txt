Yes, people are racist. People are even racist at college. This is a good question and the issue of racism has been solved many times in countless films. What sets off a higher education beyond the package is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most loud and predictable possible options, which is also at college. This film deals with this issue of racism, the way Frankenstein addresses most of the problems, repeats you over and over again repeatedly in a brutal and slow way. Most characters are cartoon, one-dimensional cartoons (lesbian feminists, an angry black man) who respond to situations as dramatically and most predictably as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes, this film is overcrowded. Angry blacks feel deceived, feminists hate men, etc. (One feminist even holds a sign that reads "Dead men do not have rape." Do you see what I mean?) I do not want to give anything, but in this movie, if someone looks like an insecure loner or the early killer, are likely to behave exactly as you expect. The changes that the characters go through are obvious to all but to the people in the movie. The big plot in the plot depends on whether the neo-Nazi acts behave like violent neo-Nazis. I guess you'll have to look to find out what's going to happen. Another problem I have in this movie is that it's "boldness" and "heavy biting", but the Nazis are bad boys. I agree that the Nazis are evil, but my opinion. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; it does not mean that we are breaking a new reason here. The Nazis were portrayed as villains from the 1930s. The film does not question any opinions and does not make courageous statements. It simply deals with the issues that we all know in a clumsy, extra-curricular, special way. Being anti-rape, anti-racist and anti-Nazis is not exactly a hard attitude to a controversial issue. Higher learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a stupid word. Avoid at all costs.
