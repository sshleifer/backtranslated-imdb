This stupid and unlikely story is only redeemed by the initial scene in which a hard-wired police detective brings some almost audible lines that confirm our greatest concern: He's dead. Perhaps the film would be saved if the director left the brilliant starry power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a moment. The fact that none of the street hackers could save such a thin water film is less likely than any villain who committed the murder by dropping the stones into a quarry for the unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; his promise is enormous. Maybe with this mysterious thespian we'll have more time on the screen if this badly recommended movie goes on.
