I can find very little about what is good about this movie. I'm sure the idea and the script look good on paper, but the filmography and the game I'm afraid of are not the standards I'd expect from some very talented people. I would like to doubt that this is very important in my CV Filmography. Michael Caine has ever appeared in his role as a doctor, and I never believed his character. The plot was unbelievable, especially with regard to the victim's son. Some of the scenes reminded of other films that I sometimes wondered if it was really a spoof thriller. Illumination was sometimes dark, and it helped to make sense of watching a low-budget film with some of the big-name stars and I was wondering why I was bothering to look at it at all.
