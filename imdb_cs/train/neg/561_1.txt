I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than he thought. First of all, the story is idiotic, it does not make sense at all. The script is full of deliberately entertaining dialogues. The audience laughed many times. And the voltage is very low. The actors play so-so, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some terribly bad moments. The saddest parts are when they try to be aggressively sexy and say things like "I want you to be beep" and it looks like, say, a gentle, very mature woman who behaves cruel and not sexy at all. That the erotic tension from BI1 is completely gone. From the Basic Instinct 2 technical point, the average movie is better than typical DVD, but at a far lower lever than the original movie. For example, a scene of crazy joyride is going wrong. Director Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and shows it. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his performance. The script is made by people who have no interaction for Joe Eszterhase. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas. The movie looks cheap and poorly edited occasionally. I'm sorry, but my first thought after I left the theater was: "Why not, did they make this movie before and with original talents for the success of the first film?" The whole original film is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first basic instinct is classic and it was a kind of break-thru in a popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. She had the best performance of Sharon Stone in her career. He had this specific style of Pavel Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an inadvertently entertaining, poorly managed and sure winner of Razzie Awards in many categories. It's a pity they made this film.
