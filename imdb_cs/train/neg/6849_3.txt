This quasi-horror film followed a young woman when returning to a children's village on Shikoku Island to sell a family house and meet old friends. She finds out that one, daughter of the priestess, drowned a few years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learned that Sayori's mother is trying to revive her with a black piece. There are connections between the dead and the living, the weak and the friends and the villagers see the ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike stellar J-horror films, the tension does not really work, the result does not seem too dangerous, and ends with absurdity. This film is like an ordinary white rice cooked too long, so it borders the sponge. Sometimes you get it in poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. Finally, you cut it because you need it with food, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice but almost destroys food due to glue, ruthless taste everything. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
