Ladies in cement are the real course of social anthropology of the late 1960s. Writing, not acting, is at the center. I said - a clean camp! Prepare for insult if you are a woman or gay. Wide and ladies are standard expressions and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (in the camp). Most parts are determined, though there are wonderful performances of very few outstanding actors. The action scenes are secular, but it's fun to see that Dan Blocker is playing a tough guy who likes being afraid. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the top of their career. It's amazing to note that they were 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. Music score, wait. . . was there a score? Well, you get it. Watch with friends who want to laugh good. it's full.
