OK, do not let me summarize my summary. This movie SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie ever? This movie was a terrible way people would not have to play their brains to describe. But it's nothing worse than Manos: hands of fate, hobbobblins, horror of the island of spiders, or a small handful of films. As a review the film is upset, it's terrible. Do not forget to do it without MST or you might experience health problems. But there are worse movies.
