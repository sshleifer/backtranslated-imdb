When someone comes to the film of this type of film, it is not obvious that the overdose of this great, modest pharmacy, Suspension of Disbelief, is very useful. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman Nelson Eddy ignored since the beginning of time, but who is also an angel sent to Earth. My reaction when I saw it, "Hunhu?" Where did I see it before? It turned out I had seen it before, but in a movie that was much later than this movie. DATE WITH ANGEL, a forgotten mass of jersey made in 1987, paid for the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuelle Beart who did not have a speaking line, he wore a blond wig and made hell for a soap-actor Michael Knight. Much worse at every possible angle with extremely low 80s values, but more than a likely updated version of this turkey in 1942. Anyway, it's not complicated, it's not an unforgettable movie and stands as a doorway to the information because it was MacDonald and Eddy last, good actors, but amazing singers would jointly play "innocence" and "clean cut" romance that they were known for. Then you may need a cold shower, not because there are some steam scenes but get rid of memory.
