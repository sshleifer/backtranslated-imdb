It was launched on the DVD Alpha market, and it is for Boris Karloff's hard fans (as moi) only. It is not a horror, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist who agrees to kill a wealthy husband's husband to earn the wealth he needs to continue working. But as soon as the dying victim changes her will and leaves her husband nothing, the whole hell will fall apart. She is satisfying enough to see Karloff as another selfish sinister type and some of the actors are unintentionally cheerful (especially from the lead lady Mona Goya, who is a sad sad revolt as a double-crossed wife). But follow with great caution.
