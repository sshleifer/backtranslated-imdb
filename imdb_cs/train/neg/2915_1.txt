It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only 5 police officers in the HK, they did not use that gun and it makes me like Jacky Han's movie. All the time they used their weapon they pointed only to the suspect. When they eventually use a gun when they kill what a fun movie is. In the movie, it's like all good guys died without reason. They story of the film is also upset, the story jumping back and forth and bored people. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think it's just a movie type OK, I think the American zombie movie is bloodier than this film
