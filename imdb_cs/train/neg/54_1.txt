The only good thing about this film was Goldie Hawn, who stood in her little French bikini legs, and tried to keep a dozen other decayed women to remove her depressed little cotton hill as she giggled and shrugged. Ooooof! Her hips compete with Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and the shot almost killed me. I forgot all that I took in my disobedient Roladex my mind until I saw it on the TV where they actually blurred in this scene, reminding me of what smoky hot woman from Goldie Hawn was in the 1980s. Kurt Russell had to have a fun life.
