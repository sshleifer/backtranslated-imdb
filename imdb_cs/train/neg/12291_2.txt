Humm, an Italian film starring David David and Hans Linda Blair, did not expect me to be honest, and I actually did even less than I expected. It does not mean that this movie is the worst thing I've seen, because I watched worse than this, but the plot was most confusing and uninteresting, and some good gore scenes are the only thing to save. Besides, you'll love some special effects, they're really harsh and bad. Now I want to watch only "Troll 3" by the same director, it certainly will not be worse.
