Only today I took it for 99 cents, just stays today, and I still think I was ripped off. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gym drama, and $ 1 is too expensive for it. This movie is probably just remarkable for 2 things: 1. Has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's directed by Paul Lynch, a man who also made Promo Night. Now for the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo), who is heavily injured by a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, she's often picked up during the classes, and eventually meets some wild guy named Tommy (Keanu played.) Robin, when not in training, works part time with her mother and half-sister, in the laundry room owned by his stepfather's stepfather. Eventually, he decides to compete. <br /> <br /> Overall, Keanu is alone and some catchy 80s melody that hinders me in this one star, and it's not one of the worst movies at all but still far from good. The DVD itself will not receive any medals, as it seems to come from the old VHS and the end, the sound goes out and when the final credits are almost over, it fades to black even though the sound can still be heard. So it may be passed as a bootleg. The DVD does not make any sense because it has what seems to be the recent photographs of Keanu and Olivia, and the background has nothing to do with the movie because it is not in the movie itself, so the cover is of course photocopied. In any case, avoid at all costs if you are not a Keanu fan. We probably will not hang anymore. I'm probably going to give The Cinema Snob, who's a great YT critic. Hey, if any of you have any dirty movies they do not want in their eyes anymore, do not hesitate to give him his show to run.
