To be honest at the time I first heard about this show, though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes, but that's the exact opposite. I realized that this show can help people understand that if Moslem uses such a word in real life, it does not mean it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, watching shows show ordinary people realize that although they may be bad Muslims, it does not mean that we are all bad that we are just trying to live 1 every day, like it was hard for Amair to get on the plane, and using words like "Blow up" or Yaser saying that we're going to the competition and people did it the wrong way. Being a Muslim, I know that such things do not usually happen, but they do it, and many people think of bad things about Muslims, Afghanistan, or Iraq, its the right thing is not. people will see how badly we've been doing with this show and can get them to think about how this action. I'm glad that such a show appeared in the air. There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people like terrorists, many people find it fun for my opioion it's okay to do it now and then because precious much is all fun is about to say that you can not kidding it's unfair, but it's done often and really gives Muslan a bad name.
