Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You can always say that she is just acting. But I like Izzard. The story is terribly boring. The spectator has no real connection with the characters without knowing who they really feel or even care about. A slow, boring movie, with some laughs, but little and not so fun. The plot is not at all impressive or thrilling. You can see that each plot is approaching a mile. What is this movie to be? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You will not be at the end of this movie.
