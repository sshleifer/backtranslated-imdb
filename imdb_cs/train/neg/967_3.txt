In 1988, Paperhouse was considered a "horror film". Wow, you can tell me to sign me. This is a mess. This is a one-time young actress that ranges from 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (dubbed) accent and story without winter, excitement or leak. <br /> <br /> It's not an interesting psycho-blabber. One will laugh just because of his cheap effects and insist that the joker 5. The story includes a girl with a glandular fever that escapes her dream. What you get is not a good horror, arts house, or even a decent out-of-school specialty. After a two-hour point, I found where my two hours went. The direction is uninviting and I wished it could be challenging ... something interesting ... it looks like they were the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the world of dreams, things are boring. <br /> <br /> Short not on this.
