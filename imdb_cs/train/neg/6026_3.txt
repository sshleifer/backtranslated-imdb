* reviews can contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> predictable, campy, bad special effects. he has the feeling of a television movie. the idea of ​​the United Nations as taken over by Satan is, according to the Bible, an interesting step towards the end of the world. The premise is interesting, but its exhaustion falls short. if you want to convert people to Christianity with such a movie, at least it's good! I was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of jump. I can not say much more about this movie because I saw it a year ago, and there's not much to tell about this movie than ..... to skip it!
