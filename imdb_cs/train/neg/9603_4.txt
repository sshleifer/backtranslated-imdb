"The young woman suffers from the illusion that she is a werewolf, based on a family legend, the ancestor's ancestor and killed for being one of them, due to her past treatment, the man travels through the landscape that kills and kills the men he meets. She falls in love with a loved one, it seems that her life improves when she is raped and her mistress is killed by a group of whips. Again traumatized by these latest events, a woman returns to her violent ways and seeks vengeance on criminals, "according to the description of a DVD sleeve . <br /> <br /> "La lupa mannara" by Rino Di Silvestro begins with a full, blushing, blushing, blushing, blond Annik Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes he is a werewolf. The worst part is when the camera captures the fireworks between the legs. Opening "flashback" reveals that her hairy predecessor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature.

As a movie, "Werewolf" (in English) would be better if Borel's character was really a werewolf; with her sexual victimization a lot of characterization. But as for the skin and blood movements in the 1970s, it's hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is either naked or sexi dressed throughout the movie, which contains a lot of unauthorized gore. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and excited Howard Ross (like Luca) are good supporting players.
