A film about a group of filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new kind of surfing in the waters of infested sharks. As an absolute fan of movies, including some malicious animals or monsters, I thought it might be my kind of movie ... it was not! This should be a clue how to do it! It has a lot of random humor and the bad animal is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes to the main characters * rolling *, of course, the feet are waving in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for laughter. If it was just because of a lack of talent among the actors, stupidly stupid dialogues and a terrible stupid crocodile, it would be laughing at least, but it is getting worse: I would have noticed that the people in charge of this film noticed how it is so even though the idea of ​​"sex is selling" ... I mean in total terms without any reason that one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast. And somewhere in the beginning is some pointless "makeout". This is the last component that makes the movie absolute. It's unbelievable how people really spend time making such garbage! If you are looking for real time wasting: watch this movie !!!
