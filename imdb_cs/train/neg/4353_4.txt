The class is a comedy series that shows many 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why it damages me that the class is not funny, even if it has a clear potential. It's not enough corks, just dorks. (Haha.) This is caused by the slow pace and the lack of truly merry punches. Some actors have difficulty in timing. Most of the ingeniously written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but they even seem a little too square for the show's good. On the other hand, the characters I think are the most intelligent are the main character Ethan and the famous twins Duncan and Nicole. What makes me with this series is that the only Latin character Aaron is chosen for his accent (albeit unspeakable, but the same).
