Just regular movie Jason Lee, were some parts of the movie that were fun. The stroke subtone is to live life on the edge, as I think. These are the types of films that I think 14 year old girls watch sleeping. It was a good movie. It's a bit of one of those films you have in the back of the country, and you look up every moment to catch something. I think Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are good combinations and would like to see them in a story with good story and plot. He's just the kind of boy he meets with the girl's movie. This is the perfect movie that would appear on the Central comedy. I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, I'd be angry. But I think I did not see it in the theater.
