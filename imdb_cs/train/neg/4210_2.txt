Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. He does not like to ride a bicycle or climb on his own house because he knows what kind of accident can happen to him. One day he rides a bicycle and as rain begins, he decides to wait in the library until the rain stops. That's where the whole story takes place. It is experienced by all kinds of employees and, ultimately, no longer afraid. The whole story is unbelievable, and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make the story better than he.
