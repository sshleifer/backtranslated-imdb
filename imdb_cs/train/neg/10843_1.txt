It could be done for hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years, The best thing on the whole DVD would be the case! I am surprised that people have done the time to do something like that, and still spend money on it, I'm glad I just rented it. I suppose real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to take care of it without any CGI or other effects, I hope Alex Chandon learned a lighting lesson and SFX to create a better film for the future, that is, if it is still at work. Notes for buyers it is very disappointing, do not buy it !!!!!
