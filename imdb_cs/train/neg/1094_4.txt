It's hard to describe this - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer in the day, you will be pleased to see that Haji still looks really hot, although Forry Ackerman did not do that well (what else does he do when I get to the camera, will he be in my movie? ). It was a pretty fun idea - a superhero whose giant mums are her secret weapon - but sometimes it was not the full length and the jokes were on the level with your average comedy Joe E. Brown (or, Abbott and Costello, if that's your thing) basically just bad punches. I've still found this movie fascinating to watch and for more than two reasons. Good work, but still very fragile production.
