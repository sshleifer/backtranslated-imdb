Diana Muldaur appeared on Star Trek for the second time but this time as a different character. Nobody on board seems to notice - maybe it was hair. Regardless of the fact that this time is not a recipe for God (see previous episode), it is a very famous lady with magical powers that allow her to communicate and see Medusana without going crazy (standard human response). Unfortunately, the person who is most in love with her is a couple of cards full of decks trying to kill Ambassador Medusan (who lives in a small box - it's a miserable way of traveling). And, unfortunately, Muldyr is not injured so well. What happens next is a little stupid, and at the time the episode was the first time I saw her, I was quite relieved. Watching all the men on board, going to ga-ga over Muldaur, he was pretty stupid, and Spock, when he was a little crazy, was quite nice. Make a favor - if you have not seen a show before, choose another episode.
