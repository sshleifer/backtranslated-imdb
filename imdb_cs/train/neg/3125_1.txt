Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old walnut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his friend: "Do not try the doctor, Doctor, I'm disgustingly healthy!" She invites her nieces and nephews to her home and warns them that they can inherit the genetic illness that causes insanity by "shrinking the brain" (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff will end dying and murderous "toys" (designed by his dead brother) will begin killing relatives. A mini cannon will burn real bullets into the face of the guys, a knight in armor attack with an ax, and a dancer Sheikh knives people with a knife. One guy who has strangled makes some cheerful cheeks. At the conclusion, Julissa and her girlfriend find out that Karloff is still alive and hiding in a dungeon where steel gates are separated from the room. He plays repetitive organ-themed music (the kind of deadly whistle that is used for killing), the brotherly spirit begins to speak ("The whole house will come with me!") And the mansion floats in the flames. <br /> <br /> This nonsense mess is too dark, boring and silly dialogue is never compared with your lips.
