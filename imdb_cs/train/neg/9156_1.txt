Ben & Arthur COULD was 10. Sam Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, watched and produced this film. Sam had to give his idea to a good writer, director, and left acting to someone who could act. this is a good example of one person who controls the entire production. No one told him: "Sam is bad, really bad." Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good thing, but with a good director he could be much better, and better actors would work with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad, I think Sam Mraovich should be tied up with a chair and done watching this movie (twice). acting and direction was so bad, this movie has become a comedy. it was enough to laugh and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> The second good point ... would be a great movie. after the first two minutes you would stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
