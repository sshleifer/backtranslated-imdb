Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of the bloody crime scene; with a partial amnesia (or "global amnesia" that one character claims to define as an optional memory loss), the scientist finds a private detective on the phone book in the hope of joining together. A blatant mix very loosely based on Walter Ericson's "Fallen Angel" (shot in 1965 as "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). He was probably too busy for television - what drugs and hippies added to the mix - that NBC initially refused to broadcast it, so this low-budget player was eliminated in theaters. Director James Goldstone gets bizarre with hyperkinetic visual and camera tricks, while Editor Edward A. Biery is wild with zigzag cuts. Unfortunately, their unimaginable color tricks can not conceal the weaknesses of this updated conspiracy, and the acting is pitifully exaggerated. Dillman under pressure to remember the events of the night, going through the seminary of tic, stammer, nose-napkins and crazy pol-laughs, as he launches the dialogue as "sen ... sen ... drugs ... yeah, drugs ... that SOUND ... bells ... help! "As a dirty scientific scientist with a smile at Cheshire Cat, Pat Hingle was almost at Dillman in the Grand Thespian department, constantly addressing everybody in a childhood conversation who floated like a middle-aged peacock and anxiously crunched his mouth . I hope Lange scientist / love-interest is given a short shrift, but not before she shouts to indifferent lover Dillman: "What do I do, talk Ape Man? I want you!" This is one furious "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 from ****
