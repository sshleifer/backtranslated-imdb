The film begins with three people who meet in the bar. OK. He talks about his imaginary lives, always lying, without reason. Still OK. From time to time, they even laugh at you. Interesting. In the first 30 minutes you like it! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing will happen ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, you see only naked old "ladies" touching each other! It's not okay. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top part of the movie, but it's all but that! The movie does not make sense, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at the FEST festival, this film was the most popular of the surveys, of course, than people were watching! I even thought (before I watched): "Cheese, that might be interesting, even if it's a Russian movie!" But, God, no!
