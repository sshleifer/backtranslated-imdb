The film had some nice aspects. Perhaps too much for my taste. It seemed as if the writer / director had desperately tried to get us to the goal of the internal conflict of all his characters. Not once, several times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is a TV work, not a cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen and enjoyed Sascha Horler's performance as a pregnant girlfriend. <br /> <br /> I felt as if Justine Clarke was performing. Her reaction to the matter was forced as if the director had tried to vocalize the themes of the film through the expressions of her protagonists. I can not even believe that the director can make a great Daniel Farinacci into an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the selection of popular music placated throughout the sequence. It's a lazy device, especially where pop music comes from a place where there is no eager film and / or where the lyrics feel embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This means that the film that evokes Australian warmth and local attitude with originality is a good quality. It creates an atmosphere of warmth and sunshine. Especially with the use of gorgeous animation sequences that saved the film from utmost mediocrity, and filled it with passion and hand-crafted charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about why the dialogue seems so redesigned. "Who knows if there is a god like a guy sitting in the sky telling us what to do" or any line. Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was a friend who came home from cricket with lots of flowers to tell his wife that I "give up smoking." <br /> <br /> Against Smoking Advertising? Advertising TAC with some cool animation? I had to leave the cinema in 50 minutes - it was too much.
