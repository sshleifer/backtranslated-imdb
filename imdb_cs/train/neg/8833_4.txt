Without the defects of the actors (all of them great performances), the overall story was not done well. The film opens with a big smile: a crazy old man forces a car from a young indigenous girl out of the way. But then we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new set of characters ... and we do not know why it will happen for up to 40 minutes. It turns out that they are the ones who finally discover the girl's body ... and the story goes from there. While the story rises at this point, it really is nowhere. After two hours, I asked myself: was it a point, or was it just about seeing the characters struggling with charges of racism and stupidity as they dealt with this discovery? The story was eventually unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. While it is well done, there is not a strong backbone in the film that recommends it to be recommended.
