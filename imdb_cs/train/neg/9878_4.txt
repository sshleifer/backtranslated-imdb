There was a lot of love that was given to Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox", unfortunately all love is for herself. He promised that a lot of time and effort was devoted to this ever-confidently strange universe, but if the script had the same amount of time and effort to try to make it fun. What's worrying is that it was, and that's the best thing Wes Anderson could do. The animation is good in close-ups of the animals, however, when the camera goes on, everything gets really harsh on the eyes and is quite honestly looks like a little mess. There was no strange thing when Wes decided to choose his friends and big names over more vocal actors who could probably have the film better. I'm sure George Clooney's voice acting is made up of two portraits in South Park, one of them where he played a dog. The film is too complacent and is trying too hard to be smart and different and typical, despite the film that is in England, they are all a good beast typical of Americans who play baseball, while those evil people are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents. I can not emphasize how much time is lost in this movie. I never smiled.
