What a bad, bad movie !!! I can not believe all the hype that was on this demanding amateur apology for a real movie! I left the theater before the end, amazed by how bad the direction and camera film of this film was! And read the adoring pawns who claim that this movie is true and true when it's all in fact, it's a bold attempt to pull the wave through the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and skilful. <br /> <br /> At least this film once and forever showed that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more of a bad film than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You will want your time back! I know I did it.
