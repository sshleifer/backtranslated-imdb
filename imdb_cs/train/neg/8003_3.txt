Do not be fooled as I was according to the "brilliant" reviews quoted on the DVD box. "Wild Fun." "Seriously scary freakout." And worst of all, "ON PAR WITH JAWS." This film is not one of the above. <br /> <br /> Normally, I will not bother writing bad movie reviews, but I can not believe this game is based on IMDb convenience. It does not deserve it. After the so-called daylight attack that created the monster, and what else, the chemicals that ludicrous scientists were making, this film is completely out of the question and goes down there. In essence and unlikely, the girl is captured by monsters (I give them points for a good creative design, but this is not WETA creation) and her half-household family spends an hour and a half watching her ... in the canals around the Han River. Their search lacks any tension - once again someone called on the forehead with their jaws - and when they find it, you realize that all is useless. In addition, much of the film is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in a funny scene involving a man who spits into a trough before a crowded bus stop. Blech. That was bad. I am not joking. Do you want to see a nasty movie about a monster? Rent a deep increase. At least you will save 30 minutes of your life.
