After watching it, I lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (it passed over time). This film was a complete waste. First of all, they tried to recreate the end of the first "Howling" with an incredibly bad makeup. Then he tries to make that sad excuses from porn porn werewolves! Fake plot and the whole movie is just AWFUL !!!! The brother of the Werewolf victim from the first film (From the point of being OFFERED to be Dee Wallace Stone) joins Lee and another woman to destroy a group of werewolves, led by Sybil Danning, who seems naked all the time. <br /> <br /> It does not really like renting (unless you want to waste your time and money by watching nudity.) Try capturing it on the cable. It would be so broken, it might make sense.
