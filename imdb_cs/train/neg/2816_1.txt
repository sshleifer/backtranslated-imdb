This is one of the movies you see in a video rental shop that you just have to get because it looks so terribly wrong. And we really could not do much. It was a lot of rapid shift. But then we met the scene where Robert Englund leads the female protagonists (her name is somewhat broken at this moment). CRIPES. I have never watched one scene from the movie so many times (I estimate for about forty). And I never laughed a lot in my life. You know, Englund has this thing that he has managed to slip away. I saw the movie the last time a few months ago, but I can not stop laughing when I write. Anyway, it's the scene in which the shots are shot - Englund gets out of the girl's underwear, Englund rides naked and some mysterious woman jumps the snake's head. That's absolute genius. You have to see it yourself.
