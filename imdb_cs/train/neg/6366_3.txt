In this film, he was not the only one redeemed factor. My girlfriend and I both love action movies. Especially combat scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were amazing), but this movie was not fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talk and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is the wandering who saw the battle and is therefore forced to look seriously constipated at all times. The army has disrupted intestinal movements at the height of the advancement of combat techniques. Music is not good either. Fighting rap and hip-hop style streets, as these guys are criminals. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual noise behind the low-floor dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is a classic style B. Actors give their lines as if reading from cards and the lines themselves should be lit and allowed to burn in some rotten Hollywood alley. The film is called "honor," but there was no honor in filming this movie. It was just a waste of money, and the wise spending is something I think honest. <br /> <br /> Let's see Felon instead. Combat scenes and situations are more realistic.
