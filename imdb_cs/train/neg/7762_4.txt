Since John Doe apparently inspired the creator of Kyle XY, I expected his pilot to be quite interesting. However, I probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed. First, the protagonist turned to a spectator who had a crazy idea to show off his amazing knowledge in front of the audience in public space. So after the scene I started to worry that it was just fun. The problem, however, is that it worsens as none of the other characters have been properly presented. They focused too much on John Doe, who made the story much less interesting. I was also a little disappointed with the performance of Dominic Purcell because I found out he did not make John Doe incredible. Another problem was the police story. It really seemed like déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. This leads us to the worst question in the group, the episodic format. I've already seen the fillers coming after the other. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I'm very disappointed and I do not recommend it to anyone. Because of how bad it is, I understand why the show was canceled. Sometimes I think he missed his goal, he developed characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there is potential, like the people he met in the club. Production quality was also pretty good and the casting was right. But I'll never know if it's improved, probably not, because I do not plan to watch another episode.
