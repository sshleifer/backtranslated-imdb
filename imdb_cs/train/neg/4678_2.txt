This movie had some andrenaline kickers, but it's an old story that simply can not happen. Maritime protocols could never destroy so much that the crew would be much less likely to ever go so far against the captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove if I wanted to see this conspiracy. Sidenote - The US Navy did not support this film.
