Think about a non-budget version of Chinese Syndrome driving a movie student who prays John Woo and you get "Power Play". The idea was good, but the executions, the negotiations and the dialogue completely killed it, not to mention the absurd amount of violence and sequences of disasters that were used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of more interesting parts of the film. > <br /> This is the story of a reporter who is investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group that has mysteriously disappeared after coming to a power plant office suspected of causing the madness of the earthquake. Rather, the Cavalier reporter, who opposed what should be a more ruthless group of corporate executives, is persecuted throughout the city (along with everyone he talks with) to "clear" all the irrefutable evidence that could remain about plant defects. br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real sense of urgency because the characters communicate with great hesitation associated with the idiotic dialogue and a lot of terrible actions. Not to mention that a viewer who can only be attracted to the film that is for his genre action activities is forced to withstand an ever-increasing number of bodies and a ridiculous amount of violent firing flashes and earthquakes. All the emphasis was placed on the wrong place to apologize for the lack of direction and the more interesting sequences of events that should lead the story. Perhaps it would be much better if the filmmakers were more focused on the thriller and paid more attention to the development of the corrupt aspects of this story. Spooky villains, naive reporters, and those who try to alert the reporter to bad divisions. It's a formula, but at least it would be fun.
