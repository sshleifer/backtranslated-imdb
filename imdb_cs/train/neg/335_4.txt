Michael Jackson would like to have a place for the best characters in GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves children. It did not work (and why should it be?) So, instead, we have Eddie Murphy to save the world by rescue "Kid Midas". I recommend to all future screenwriters to thoroughly investigate the stupid actor dialogues in this surprising fantasy - adventure - comedy that is a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does, he may be best liked, but do not misunderstand me about his excellent comic talent, not in this movie and the same for DR. DOLITTLE! Violence and visual combinations are reasons to imprint it as a classic cult camp, and that would not make sense because Hollywood and the film fanatics devoted to that guy. Speaking of visuals, they were surprised at the time of the presidential glory of Ronald Reagan. Murphy is much better at AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this still film is not my touch of golden honey for a tasty sweet taste.
