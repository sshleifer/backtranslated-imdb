Special, almost all reviewers are very positive for this film. Is it because it has been since 1975 and Chamberlain and Curtis are in it, and they are forgiving sometimes very bad and childish ways of telling? <br /> <br /> Maybe this is because some people are sentimental about this movie because they read the book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, filmmakers never assume that the audience read a book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because I'm unconsciously irritated by the English speaking actors behaving like their French counterparts?
