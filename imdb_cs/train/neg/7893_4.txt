In the beginning, let's look at the beginning of a secret council of some sort. Everything looks very promising. With some supernatural elements that fall, the mystery becomes more interesting. The main character, who looks like a good guy, gets into trouble because of his claim to money that has the right (temptation) and other factors. You really do it and you want to know what's going on. Normally, a person would have several options in his situation. Somehow it does not have these options. In this film, there seems to be one solution, although it is clear that it is not his fault. From the blue he meets the characters who talk about the Church, prayer and God. And they provide an answer to their problem. At some point in the movie, it should be clear what this solution is. Now tell me that there is nothing wrong with this news. Because it is always useful. However, it was indeed necessary to reject this report. This religious element has actually destroyed the viewing experience for me. While the message is good, it's a simplicity that can not escape the fact that real life needs more to solve the problems presented in this movie. The secret that is presented to us will never be resolved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another topic that basically has nothing to do with the conspiracy. Do not be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. Once a brilliant actor is adequate, but if you watch carefully, you will see that it is not serious at all. He really has to be desperate for money. Otherwise, the actor should have his caliber to play in the movie.
