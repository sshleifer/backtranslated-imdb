I have this movie in a $ 5 walmart basket. I would not recommend following this step. I could give it to one of my friends if I'm angry at them and I want them to suffer for 2 hours. I looked at the envelope and shuffled over and thought it was a war movie. I wish I knew what this movie would be boring before it turned on. It was my fault to think that something would happen in this movie. It is only a group of people who leave from one camp to another. Drills seize the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people to derail the fight in Vietnam. Well, here's my shot about this movie: For me, this film is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies you put in and stuck when you watched them because you want to shut them down, but you hang on to a chain of hope that they can get to an end. Not that. After the movie I was behind it for TV because I was angry that I lost nearly 2 hours of my life watching it and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.
