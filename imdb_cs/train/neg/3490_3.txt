I was pleased with Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", my interest was high, so I tried to sit through this second line that jumped to investigate the death of jockeys - but I did not finish it. Arthur, photographed in a gentle film magazine, needs either nutrition from a former husband William Powell or another shot in marriage, but I never felt for her because this character is just a bunch of jokes (he is a heroine that is prone to comic curiosity, but once is inside the morgue - just like all the women in these 30 comedies - she disappears). William Powell reportedly had the best time working with Miss Arthur, but you would never know it from the final result; they look awkward, standing next to each other, hesitating over their prank. The actor who plays Powell's butler is unbearable, and laughter for the audience's laughter is pregnant.
