(aka: The Bloodsucker leads dance) Lots of naked girls in this one with a few lesbo scene threw in. The film is to be held in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians take a weekend at an invitation to Castle Castle Island. One by one, they seem to miss their head because the crazy man is running. <br /> <br /> It's not too scary or bloody, and the rooms look as if they were illuminated by the headlights even though the candles are shining. Go figure ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dabing is worse than usual and the plot is just an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by actor Alfredo Rizzo, it is one of them. <br /> <br /> Quite boring 2 of 10
