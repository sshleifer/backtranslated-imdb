An unsettled handheld camera was used that probably gave the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to get a motion sickness just by watching it. It seemed like someone with cerebral palsy kept the camera (no misdemeanor was for the sufferers, but I do not think you would expect a lot of work as a cameraman!) The camera of work was so disturbing and so disturbing that my wife and I we considered it illegal and surrendered after 10 minutes of torture. A moment later I checked (it appeared on TV) and did not improve. I suggest that you miss this if you do not have to get rid of the bad sushi you may have eaten!
