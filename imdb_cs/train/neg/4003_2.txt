The main disappointment. This was one of the best British critically-acclaimed dramatic / detective performances of the 1990s that developed the fascinating title character played by Scottish Robbie Coltrane. However, this one-off has little to add and may suffer inevitable slippage due to increased expectations when the favorite show returns after a long break. Coltrane does not really have much to do, much more attention is paid to an unkind killer and he seems to be uninterested, almost bored in what he has to act on. The story of a former soldier is written by books and an attempt to update us in Coltrane's family life seems to be light. Perhaps if the writers had the whole series in front of this two-hour show, they would write it much deeper. As it is, skip it and watch the old Cracrata of the 90s, which is far better.
