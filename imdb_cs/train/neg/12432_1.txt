This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone films I've ever seen! Watch Part 1 and 2, but do not let anyone say it's better than the first two! I mean, you do not really make a movie, then continue with the same characters and actors, and then make another sequel with different characters and actors! I think it would be ok if it was not "Home Alone", but DID did it as a movie at home. Culkin is too old now, so you think you're going to stop! Okay, this movie makes me SICK! Buy parts 1 and 2.
