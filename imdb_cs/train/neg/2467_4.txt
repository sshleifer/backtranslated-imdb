This movie gets from me both 6/10 and 9/10. Here's why: As a standard horror film for a standard horror crowd, where action and gore and fear are taken into account, this movie bore you. It's basically a family drama similar to what you would see on the Lifetime channel, but put horror in the universe. The story and formula are ancient, retreated hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the land structure or minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Remove the zombies and you will have something as melodramatic as the Beautiful Mind, turning on the cheese. That's 6/10. <br /> <br /> The basic synopsis and idea are, however, original and overlapping. It's literally something that you and your friends will joke about when you're half drunk. . . but this joke actually received the theatrical release. The idea gets 9/10 from me. The only reason he is not perfect is that they could still take it, but they did not. The mix of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but like most comedies, it was not that funny. I had my mother and my little sister looking at me, and the jokes we did were more fun than jokes written. There were times of complete genius, but there were moments of pure boredom. I sincerely hope that other films will take on this kind of excessive risk and original ideas. I can not say that it is perfect, or even close to it, due to lack of originality to the land. <br /> <br /> GREAT family film. A great movie you can watch with a group of boys (or girls). A great movie you can watch with someone. . . but if you watch it yourself, it will be a little boring. Other people always make this movie fun and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
