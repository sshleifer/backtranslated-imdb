With these people they make so many shots, they use old shots and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some scenes have been filmed on created sets with actors what to believe? The old film of the country is nice, but the abuse of animals and the deterioration of the number of natives is painful in these films. I know, racism is fine in these old movies, but there's more to this creature than losing the credibility. They were acting like planes, never sailed to their plane, Martin Johnson was ex-vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London to make financial gain while rigidizing their rewards, denying his wife's seeming depression, using it as a cute prop, all making these films unbearable . They were by no means the first passengers to these countries, not the first to write about them. He was fine as a filmmaker and a photographer, but that's about it.
