This movie was on a Romanesque channel, and I thought it might be a 80s movie that would be nice at some level, so I and my brother and I watched it. Boy suck it. The boy crushes the girl - a fix, his * dream * - the girl (apparently the difference, and I'm surprised to realize that it's his fianc√© girl) - was hit with more than 30 feet with her just to show the strength of dreams -Girls), the boy ends masquerade as a woman to become close to a dream-girl (creative in the sense that it is a far-out plan, but non-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions that one could to make up the annoying situation, the fight will take place (everything that seems to take place around the late afternoon - either the place was in some way responsible for this weird illumination, or the actors had to wait until they got their daily job opportunities came to the guitar, I suspect it is the second one). Very unwise, very pathetic. It's almost never fun * at random * so there really is nothing to buy it. If you are not interested in waiting for Chado Lowe, before he eventually gets his piece of cake with the role of HIV-positive homosexual on "Life Goes On" or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably had to look at Dennis Franz's buttocks. But these are unlikely motives - I would say that "systematic disruption of the senses" would be a more legitimate purpose. I'm surprised I watched it all. I think it's such a thing that you're in the middle of the road because of some morbid, self-puzzling inner problem and you think you could finish it so you can tell your friends and family that she was sitting in such a terrible movie, out of the chance to get you any condolences for the dubious state of your mental health. Can * you? * Take the challenge?
