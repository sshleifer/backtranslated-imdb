So this was HBO "Made for TV Movie", huh? Is this the justification for such a pathetic conspiracy and horrible action? Such a pity that he saw Jim Belushi cut down on a role so repetitive (shot, survived, lied, beaten, survived, shot, lied and so ad infinitum.) They say that the script for the British is embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton pathetic or was it just a matter, it depends on how much he was paid for, I think?) an attempt at the Southern Sheriff. As for the other Brit, a bleached blonde, what it is! There is a tendency to celebrate these "English-speaking" turtles recently, perhaps thanks to Mr Madonne's two films, to succeed in entertainment and to justify violence by using irony and humor such as Pulp Fiction. This film, however, discredits and devalues ​​this genre. is definitely missing.
