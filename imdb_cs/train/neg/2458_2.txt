I can not describe how horrible this movie is. Am I the only one who finds his animation completely disgusting? The men from Rohan look 100% falsely with their poorly colored hair, which even fails to get close to what the actors look like. Orcs looked terrible. Why is Gandalf moving wrong? Why can not they say things right? Saruman is not Aruman. It was different that it sounded like the terrible utterance of the Tolkien characters. Everything and everything, I'm glad the studio studio that pulled that out of the socket was just a terribly awkward adaptation. Come to watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkiens work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2/10
