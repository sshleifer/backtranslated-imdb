Even Bob Hope, accompanied by a bunch of great actors, can save this misspelled attempt at comedy during the war because his patented timing has little to do. The film is based on Hollywood film star Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to escape military service at the start of World War II, followed by his mistaken misconception of Dorothy Lamour's regimental trial. Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, is interested in him and all three are participating in various escapades related to training exercises shot in the hills of Malibu, California. Paramount was enthusiastic about this effort, employing some of his top specialists, but the direction of David Butler's usually reliable was flaky, and this had to be attributed to the missing comedy element in the script. Moving towards the end of the film that created Bolton's opportunity for heroism, he was still born with bad stunt work and camera witnesses. Especially, Lynne Overman gets the best line and this veteran strident master is doing very well. Dorothy Lamouro looks beautiful and looks nice and it's a pleasure when you see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father whose voice is unique on the screen or radio but there is little he can save this movie, a curse as it is with a script assignment error .
