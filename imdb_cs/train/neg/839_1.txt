The only redeemed part of this movie was the price I paid. At least everything I lost was $ 3.00, and the time that passed passed through this bomb. The crew member in charge of the Navy left the ship. When the woman and the FBI got to the alleged killer, the FBI gave the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out of the door, the revolver magically changed to automatic. One is left to think if the FBP agent handed the gun to the civilian? I think not. It seems Mrs. Xavier is a very attractive woman. It's too bad that the R rating did not allow a lot to be seen from her. The film editor seems to have lowered what might be the best part of the film.
