Frank Sinatra was undoubtedly a talented actor as well as a talented singer. After all, very few actors today can get the scene in just one shot, and it was largely Sinatro's modus operandi on the set. I feel that when the 1960s dressed up, the quality of the men actually started to float. A number of Tony's detectives in Rome have not been trying to compete with Matt Helm, who was released alongside Dean Martin. Maybe even the James Bond competition, but for those years, Frank really did not work. His personal life in the mud, his music disappeared ... Sinatra looked more like a return to the 1950s. The last big Sinatra film of this era was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
