Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility and aging. Billy plays the heart of a surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha), which causes him to search for his alienated father (Alan King), a film extra who imagined a big star. The script is a nonsensical sub-Neil Simon with a one-time idea, a flat, insignificant direction from Henry Winkler (persisting in the situation regime) and the family conflict. Crystal and King are trying the best, but the King is exaggerated and often timeless. JoBeth Williams has another of her ungrateful roles, but she can transfer her inherent class to her proverbial girlfriend. It's a comedy, I think, but it's the one that burns tears ... shamefully. ** z ****
