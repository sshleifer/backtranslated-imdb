You are not sure why this movie seems to have received such a terrible review. One night he watched "Bang" on TV, bored with a boring random fence that appeared on the screen. The whole film seems to be nothing but an exercise in insignificant, artistic and fartan self-sufficiency on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that a director / writer only has one title only reinforces this feeling of pretense. <br /> <br /> Those interested in indie films would better look for something that would be better written and would dare to say, more fun than this total waste of time.
