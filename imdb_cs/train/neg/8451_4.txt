I have to admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the childhood story, the pain and vengeance was interesting and moving. An excellent Hollywood movie. But ... No one has ever mentioned it (at least in the last 20 comments) when it was scenes in the courtroom, and the figure of Brat Pitt followed his plan to save his two friends who are rightly charged with the murder. feeling cheating. This movie offended my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept their false alibi, which the priest testifies? If these two men were with him, why should not they say that during an investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or a jury member, would you believe that? Is it wise to give away the motive of the murderers? I'm sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak and it excites me. This film has great potential. 4/10
