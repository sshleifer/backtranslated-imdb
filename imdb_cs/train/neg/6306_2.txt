When I work in a video rental shop, I see a lot of movies, and sometimes I try to watch some of those not so big movies. The proud became one of them. The original idea of ​​telling the story of the primary black crew during the Second World War had some merits. However, in less than 10 minutes of watching the film, you will find that the main focus of the film was to tell about the racist tension in the Second World War. The basic story is about the ship, the crew and its capabilities in the war. This primary point is shuffled to the point of excessive incidence throughout the movie. I commend the men who served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the suffering they have suffered. The film was to focus on the achievements these men made for themselves, for the navy and for their country, and not to shoot a film aimed at racism during the Second World War.
