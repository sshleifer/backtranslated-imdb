Well, the writing was very messy, the director was furious, and the editing made it worse (at least I hope it was editing). acting was not bad, but it was not that good either. almost none of the characters were sympathetic. at least 45 minutes of this film was unnecessary, and about another hour was not used anywhere near its full potential. it was a great idea, but there is another unnecessary good idea. it could end up with 3 different places but continued in most of the predictable Hollywood lands. and what was not predictable was done so badly that it did not matter. the end was by no means worthy. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. the movie looked hurried too. the movie just was not really worth seeing, and I paid for it I would be very crazy. maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a really good film and got bad. the film was not all bad about everyone, but I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea so much and I liked one character (justin I believe, super intelligent). and it also had some very cheap ways to cover the holes of the plot. it was like trying to cover the volcano with a cheap camouflage tape, it was not nice. if you see it, wait for the theater or video $ 1.50 if you do not like almost every movie you see, then you will like it.
