Buck's role as The Kahn brings Bob Barker (from The Price is right), who controls the country in the same way as his show. But there is much more to mixing and frying in Turkey. Kurt Thomas, as a "hero" with children, is characterized by considerable acrobatic skills, but not a small acting talent. There are several scary moments (mostly in the village of Crazies) and some slightly impressive sequences of martial arts. But some given film "Ninja" will give you much more fun and you will not feel guilty about laughing.
