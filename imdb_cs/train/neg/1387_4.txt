It is hard to believe that the film "Jet Li" packed in action can be so boring, but it was transcendental waste. The plot is an amalgam of Hong Kong's other chopsticks. Martial arts actions are all special effects and no human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a comic story about a group of super-human soldiers to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of their members (Li) who holds an incompetent army to save them and renews life as a pacifist librarian. A saved killer appears in the form of a quality conspiracy by Austin Powers to take over the world, and Li will culminate in his new life to save the world. The version I've seen has been nicknamed, and it can highlight the slimness of the thin fence and the comics of 25 cents of special effects. But I suspect that even 8-year-old ninja-turtles would find this juvenile and cavity.
