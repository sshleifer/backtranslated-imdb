The ladies man is a funny movie. There is not much thought behind, but what do you expect from the SNL movie? It's really better than most SNL movies (such as Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very entertaining. Chris Parnell was also entertaining in his short scene (one of the funniest in the movie). Besides, the rest of the cast is average and there is just support for Meadows. I definitely saw fun movies, but I've seen those stupid. Again, it's not a deep film, but it's good for a few laughs. It was fun as a skit. Still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this. Do not think too much or you will hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
