I have never seen 1973, an older highly rated version. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, gently acting as usual). This film probably took five minutes to refute the entire plot (I can see that it's going on for dinner dinner napkins) if you can not find out that this saliva has ended in the first thirty minutes, you probably find this movie fun. This is the late terrible routine that Hollywood seems to have dug a horror / mystery / thriller for his genre, unable to give the audience enough credits and to write a new fresh, smart and scandalous script, invent some scary music and throw a few things to jump a little then send the last print to the local theater. At least it did not have a distracting hand-held camera syndrome.
