Let's see where to start ... bad dealings; I'm not sure if I even called it because it was more in line with reading without effort. The actors did not even seem to be part of them, and they look pretty lifeless and helpless. Sure there was a scene or two with nudity, but it could not save this movie from its lifeless. <br /> <br /> To call the rapper's main character is an insult to the people who actually do. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow, and it seemed to be more meaningless. Budget? Does this film even have a budget? They seemed to use less money than I saw in a YouTube video. Bad lighting, props, bad sound postproduction. Bad special effects if you want to go so far that you call them. The story could have been good if people were really interested in it, but this life had no life; I do not care who did it. Last year I saw really bad moves and this is definitely at the very end. Do not waste your time or wish to listen to this objective review. Look at the rating, you'll see that 1 is fast over 10 fluffy with almost nothing in between. I wish I could get a little closer to spending time. What is a suck-fest!
