Audrey, I know you really remember Ted's memory of her husband, but PLEASE do his justice and his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to grant a license to his character during his life for a very good reason. We ask you to stop storing your stories, pictures, fantasies and characters. They are exhausted by the forces that are from Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that forever devaluate the loving warmth and innocence of their books. <br /> <br /> It's actually your property to do as you wish. I just wish you'd listen to the others for a while. Save what's left of Dr. Seussa. Thank you.
