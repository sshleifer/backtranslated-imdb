I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival where he was attending the great Dr. Uwe Boll. The film is simply very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad it's really fun" way but simply bad. The story concerns a man who leads a terrible life (obviously from the previous criminal record, apparently) can not get a job and a terrible 900-pound cheating wife. This man turns to his uncle, who is at the forefront of culture, planning to steal the truckloads of avian flu viruses. Al-Qaeda also has suggestions for toy toy and what follows is less than two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. The game is terrible (with the exception of Dave Foley, who is really trying, despite all this), jokes have never come up against children who are shot in the chest slow, and people who get pretty. It's gotta be a satir, but I'm not sure what. You mean "Plane!" But from the creators of South Park and without a joke.
