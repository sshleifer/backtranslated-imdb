Daraar got a pretty good start. The first scene really left me at the edge of the seat and wondered what would happen next. In addition, the first half of the film is BORE. The first half of the film is that Rishi Kapoor falls to his heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think she's a little old for her? Things eventually begin to taste in the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow it's a madman! He was an overpowering, cuddly fool with really HOT TEMPER! Once defeated the poor Juhi without a good reason! One reason I really do not like this movie is that I can not see how Juhi (my favorite actress) is so abusive. In general, this film has too much abuse and bloodshed; I think it's so bad !!! Anyway, I'm trying to say that if you think about renting Daraar, you should put it back on the shelves where you found it and chose something else!
