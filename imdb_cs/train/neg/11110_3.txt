I would like it to be known that I often do not rate films under 5 years. Originally, I was very excited to see this movie. His numerous bumps on television for several months really want to see this movie. So when I saw it was available at FearNet on Demand, I got popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. The story looked interesting - some bastard breaks down the unsuspecting metro people. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day the photographer sees the connection between some of the photos he took and becomes obsessed with the butcher who followed him, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you, though it was very predictable. "Oh, no, it's dark, look at you," I said, boring in that you were quite excited. The conspiracy, though predictable, was interesting ... it is up to the end. "It was good until the end ... Then it was just stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke on the billboards. And I fully agree. And here they are spoilers ... I saw, I was hoping it was a mad killer, some psychotic person possessed by cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that kept living beings for centuries. Woo. How original. How unreal. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You had amazing movies, but this one sank.
