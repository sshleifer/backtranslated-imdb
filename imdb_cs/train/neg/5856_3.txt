T. Rama Rao created extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who can not afford changing times, styles and fashion. Just like the same old-fashioned movie style. <br /> <br /> Actors are not bad or good. Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly on his two roles as his father and his son, but a faulty script often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she's always good and there's nothing like that. She does the best of what is given, but she always does it. In conclusion, nothing big at all. Raveena is all right, which means ordinary, bad, not good, nothing. The film is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Well, it would not be standard yet. The screenplay is horrible, the film is exaggerated and the story goes nowhere. It feels like a movie from the early nineties, but the script looks even older, the style is like in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> We do not recommend if you are not a fan of one of the main actors.
