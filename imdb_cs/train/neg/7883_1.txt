The deceptive cover, title, and very little hidden print of the power of prayer have cheated me to rent this movie. It started really well and pulled me in. I really liked it. Between the third and third year, the film began to throw things that were not set up and meaningless. My first thought was, "It's not written by someone who knows how to tell the story." I ended up watching the movie again because I thought I was missing something. At the time I reached the last one-fifth of the movie, it was all I did, it did not make sense, did not say anything, and it was annoying to obey; I turned off the sound and made a quick forward to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not collect time with this drive. <br /> <br /> Beware of a DVD called Whitlow Films and level path productions. <br /> <br /> And I'm a practical Catholic.
