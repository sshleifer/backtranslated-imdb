So what is the big boom of doing INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor who is cast as a fictitious guy from a storybook adventure that does not want to go out on an adventure ??? Who wrote the script for JAKE SPEED, he was probably fired, but for whatever reasons this movie is very excited! This does not mean it has no action, but look at the dark side of the image. It does not have to look like INDIANA JONES or other action and adventure excitements that contain cliffs and narrow getaways, and JAKE SPEED was promoted in this way with a clever propaganda to keep me and others interested! Besides, I never heard the guy, so who needs his attention?
