<br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie on Cinemax yesterday, I was shocked that it was made. Cruel intentions were, in my opinion, one of the best teenage films in years. This predecessor had certain things incompatible with the original. (Sebastian's father got married with wealth, so why does he have a rich aunt on a long island?) Today I found out that it was not really meant to be a new movie, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep. After I heard it, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, just like Buffy Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. I think Roger Kumble most likely added the end of the movie after the Fox series did not. It looks like something happens too fast (Sebastian becomes the male version of Katharyn) and I just do not know where to go with another episode, as it would not lead to the 1999 film (Which newer end is directed straight to.) One thing, which I did not like was that he proposed that Sebastian and his father be married to the wealth that was usually in this area of ​​New York, and Katharyn's mother was only her adult version, it did not seem to be something that a woman in her position, married a man who was not a social class. <br /> <br /> As a forerunner, it is quite chrome. But I'd be glad to see where this was like a series.
