From the very beginning, you'll notice how much they've been trying to imitate very smart and powerful "harsh intentions," and how flat it landed. You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by dropping Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second scene you find the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. That means you can overcome the fact that the first movie was not the blonde Kathryn ... Then the movie goes on, you will see a nice romantic tale from miles past and you will notice that Sebastian met Aneta's past, here called Danielle, and Cecile, the so-called Cherie ... How is it original for prequel. Then it turns into a low-budget "Wild Things" that has lots and huge bending. As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he was a bad actor, it's good. He just does not have the charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who, in my opinion, is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, adds. But with all the talents in the world, there is no way to save it. Overall, this "movie" feels like an episode of "Beverly Hills, 90210". The score was stolen from "cruel intentions" and "jawbreaker" ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Could they at least leave that one? You will want to pass on this. If you want more cruel intentions, watch the dangerous connections of Stephen Frears.
