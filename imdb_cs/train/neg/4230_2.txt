Okay, I like B movies ... I know what B movies to represent. But it is terrible. I'm impressed that he has such a decent overall score. The only redeemed features of this film are (mostly) marginal spraying effects. Do not get me wrong, gore relies on this movie - but really few effects jumped on me (like an anal "probe" ... it was great!). I believe this movie was shot on a video camera. C'mon - to hire Betacam at least, I've seen porn with better production values ​​(and better acting). Appearing - Soaked! But not in the way of the Three or the Full Moon. <br /> <br /> Story - Conceived! But that's what you get from such films. Very free! <br /> <br /> Sets and Props - Soaked! My 16-year-old brother makes more sophisticated sets for our house on Halloween. Dabing and dialogue - sucking! Terrible voice acting (I should not even say it is acting) and every second word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". There are many good classical and B rated horror / scramble there and they are not that difficult to trace. Do yourself a favor by not losing time for these bullshit!
