I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not as bad as this. It's a movie that makes fun to bold people, has no real story, has bad actors, is not funny, and much more. Is it a movie you want to see? I think not! <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers were trying to be original and creative, but it seems to have been made by a 12-year-old child without absolute film skills. The so-called fun parts are just as fun as crawling cakes on people's faces or breaking the wind. If it's such a humor that you like, then it's the movie for you! <br /> <br /> Do not waste money on this movie!
