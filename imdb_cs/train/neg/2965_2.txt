This movie was a bit interesting ... I had to look at college about India, but synopsis tells you that this movie is about one thing when it really does not contain too cold and hard information about these details. The synopsis really is not true until the very end, of course, trying to combine all the elements together. However, the gore factor is excellent. Even at the very beginning you will want to look away because the gore is quite intense. Watch only this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and it will make you sad that you have been hearing unnecessary time. I've seen rumors on other websites that this movie is based on real events, but you can not find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
