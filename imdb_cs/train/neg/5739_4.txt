A small town is attacking a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is lonely revenge and a group of survivors. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" released something cult after the release. It's easy to understand why - it's recorded (and I think it's damn charged) with a gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm as it was found in other non-budget cult horror movements like The Dead Next Door and The Children of Ravensback "is actually more infectious. <br /> <br /> Although this may be true, it is unfortunately not enough to save it. The film was shot on Super 8, so the picture is grainy and dark, making it very difficult to see (it would be great if it covered the protagonists of a terrible spear.) The grid is also a soundtrack made up of an unpleasant Casio Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal , what is this with no budget horror movements and bad Death Metal?) While someone does not expect the Oscar to perform well, acting is still a strictly amateur hour because actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened. Finally, I'm sure fans of unhealthy gorefests will love it. Everyone else wants a little more meat on the ribs.
