There was nothing in this movie that really caught me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie, where I said, "Well, that was nothing special" when I saw it. It was probably a drama and a thing, but I just did not catch it, but it was more gray-haired. As I said in the title, it seemed very cheap. The quality of the film itself (images) seemed like a low quality and reminded me of more cheap films made for television film than the acclaimed English filmmaker. Angles and camera shots were, in my view, very amateur. In fact, they did not have close-ups or similar effects that could bring interesting scenes. I have not seen many English movies and the ones I've seen did not really make me more than that and they looked similar to camera work, colors, and so on. "Game" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my reviews "Lola Rennt" if you wish), but it did not succeed for me. All in all, a little indifferent film that was nothing special (at best, I'm afraid) and, unfortunately, over two hours unnecessarily.
