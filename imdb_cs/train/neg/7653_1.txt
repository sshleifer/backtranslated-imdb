First, I would like to say that if I had to honestly rate this movie from 1 to 10, then I would give it -4. It's not like I'm a tough critic, it's just the movie that's bad. Everything from the story, through directing to editing is terrible. The story is not even decent in the middle (you can not expect much because it's based on a video game, something I did not know about going to the movie), but the overhead and editing made it worse. The film shoots in inappropriate places and comes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones. Some, like a fast sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to put into the story to see how the characters do not show any feelings towards each other. You could go into this movie and expect to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'll still be disappointed. Frankly, if you pay for watching this movie, then you lose money, and if you pay nothing, you're still losing an hour and a half of your life. So do a favor and do not look at it.
