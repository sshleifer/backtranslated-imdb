First, this movie was not that bad. It was fun ... at least for me because of all the bad reasons. I have never seen the original so I can not compare it. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of the strange film Christopher Reeve Village the Damned. These two films have different plots, but that terrible disgusting feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both. Wicker man is to be a mystery / thriller / men, please do not laugh the movie of women. I do not know the whole pagan thing and the victim is a little off. Nicholas Cage, his famous bad self, goes to a remote island called Summerisle when he receives a calligraphy letter from his long lost fiancé who claims her daughter was taken and hidden by the other islands. <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and it's a tired policeman to go to an unfinished island that leaves no word about his stay with everyone in the real world. Stupidity. Things become sadder when they see the big Amish-esquire women on top of it and lie about where the missing girl is. His fiancé is not any help that seems to be elusive and tiring all the time. Cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is a happy man who has fallen to come to this island as a sacrifice during the sick harvest festival. In this movie, men are not so well. Worsened demonstration of feminism? <br /> <br /> I found the movie ridiculous at times, especially when the cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit. I think there were too many boreholes in this movie. The whole concept of angry women who find themselves on the island without any interest in a man is fun, but the way he was portrayed in this film was just strange. While most women have some jerk and anger, it is clearly a form of sexism. If the rolls were turned, I would turn the film away with disgust. This movie is something you can watch once or twice. It's not a thriller, it should be considered strange.
