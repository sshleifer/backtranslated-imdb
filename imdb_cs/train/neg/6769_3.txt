Failure. The film was not good. It's a humor that those five years old who will not even giggle. Sure, some parts were fun, but most of them are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and she should work on better movies. The movie should be screened as the original Disney Channel movie, which is FREE. The only thing that was well done in this movie was music. Nothing like a sound accompanying rebuilt rock to help you brighten up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda are Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, the song Beach Boy, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10. If I gave ten, 9 of which will be music and 1 will be a movie. It's not your money but it's a soundtrack.
