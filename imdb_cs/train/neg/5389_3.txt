If you've seen other such movies, they're probably better. Omega Man comes to mind. Student credits have avoided the vast, unnecessary, big technofest budget that typically films this film. In addition, the report and the presumption were excellent: Four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from a staggering infectious lethal disease. What is wrong is everything else! I'm tired of infinitely stupid, careless, furious, ineffective, and arrogant characters in the movie. It pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point. I rented it and found myself crying repeatedly on television: "No, do not do it!" "Why are you so stupid?" "Look at it!" And so on. The real lack of character development is obvious about half way. The film MUST put strong personal connections with at least some characters, so you really do take care of what happens to them. This is not. Also, it should be longer, more engaging to the end of the movie as well.
