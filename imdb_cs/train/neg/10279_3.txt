This movie was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this. Even with terrible sound quality, bad cinematography, and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp has actually managed to perform well (especially to the end). The figure of Marjorie, a drunk lady, was also pleasant. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and it could have been fun without fearsome singing and noisy piano music. Admittadly, some songs (fantabulous) are quite catchy (but not good). <br /> <br /> Open House is a fun movie that can be easily watched because it's terrible! We think it could be a good musical stage (with great actors).
