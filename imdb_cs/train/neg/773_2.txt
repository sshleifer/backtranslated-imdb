No, not GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove". Lifetime must realize what this dog is, because the series was burned out of two episodes at one time, most of them broadcast between 11:00. Friday nights and 1 hour Saturday morning. As to why I was watching the whole thing, I can only beg for weekly sudden spasmodic attacks of masochism. Most occupation is unknown, which is likely to remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who turn to the only decent performances (Jones does not do the whole series - a happy woman). Ward, by the way, ages very well from her days "Thorn Birds". One main theme of the plot - who murdered a hero's father who was wrongly convicted of murdering his father but was released after he was six years old - is filmed for so long and ended up so fast that you do not take care of the dunes. There is a lot of "steam" sex, a few murders, and all kinds of rough behavior - virtually none of them is either interesting or trusted. Most games are not very attractive and definitely not talented. The font and direction are at the same level as the cast. <br /> <br /> If you hold on to the end, there is a postcard (very small) horn. <br /> <br /> CONTINUE YOUR WARNING!
