Steve Irwin. You must admire a man who is not only willing to plunge into a river that is clearly filled with carapaceans, snakes, lizards, lots of screams from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only with everyday but enthusiastic. He had never been able to do it, but he managed to bring his wife. This film does not belong to my parallel universe category of movies - films for people who have just teeth drilled, migraine or have no movie experience and therefore, as a moderate media (currently popular Disney movies). It's too noisy. Well, Steve is too loud. He is still happy, and despite the "teenager" (I hear it now: "the film was such a STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say his enthusiasm is about to go, but if it were, I should have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed that they were beautiful, but I still do not understand. <br /> <br /> The shot was really predictable. The bad guys were so bad, for a minute I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronics supermarket. But the movie was filled with animals and Steve and Terri, so I watched it. This conspiracy (if you could call it) was really the reason to throw another step in the truck. My expectations were low and it remained so. I was hoping there would be a bit of a sequel where Steve and Terri (who worked on their acting skills) have a movie with real estate and other fur animals. I still can not believe we will not see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children will continue to be involved in the Australian zoo and discovery channel. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without any member of the Irwin family telling me how much I like it. Crikey!
