The film uses a top-class title for a lame story. Kill Kill, it would be nice. The film contains taboos so the viewer moves back to his chairs. Scenes are useless and broken. The film is something that a journalist writer could conjure up. Just the loss of film props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it does not cost 10 rows of my time, but I have to urge people to know how to avoid nonsense. If people rely on you to choose a good movie night movie, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not harm it by exposing yourself to this dirt.
