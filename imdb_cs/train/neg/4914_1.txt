I love a good love story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented Love Story, I prayed that the end would come as quickly and painless as possible, and on the contrary, for Ali McGraw's character. Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and irritated me for the first 15 minutes. When we learn that a life-threatening illness has been diagnosed, I could not help, but I was wondering if her death would be such a terrible loss to Oliver, or if someone watching this movie really cares about her. If she did not die that her figure was obvious, Oliver would probably have moved him over the edge and eventually landed in the divorce court. People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 1970s.
