Are there similarities between Raymond Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his latest film "Lantana"? dead body and its effects on already dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered some hope and solution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved in such a way that most viewers leave her unhappy, perhaps cheated. The plot - the consequences of the discovery of a corpse fisherman floating in a distant river - is based on a story by Raymond Carver. This became an element of Robert Altman's classical ensemble 1993 "Short Slices". Lawrence uses this theme to explore and expose relations within the small Australian community under stress. The film contains some questions about morality: "Would you let your dead body discover destroy your good weekend?" and for Australia even more "Would there be any if a dead man was a native?" Acting acting, especially Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, are commendable. And there are elements of mystification enhanced by music, not unlike "Picnic on Hanging Rock". If it all sounds like the basis for a great movie - get ready for it, very slow and the murder is displayed near the beginning, eliminating the element of secrecy. And so we remain with these deserted lives and empty finals.
