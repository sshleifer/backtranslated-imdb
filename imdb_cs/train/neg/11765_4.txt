You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. Sappy, trite verse and it will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You'll get the same with Hallmark. Here's Ernie Borgnine, 90, who left retirement to tell us that he was not really dead, as we thought. Poor Ernie, it's a poor soul who went for Ethel Merman a few years ago, and the marriage lasted for several weeks. Ernie in this view first jumps into her legs and portrays a grandfather who joins her long lost granddaughter. We've seen it before. You could enjoy this movie, but do not say you have not been warned.
