Well, I'll start by admitting that I'm not a John Ford fan. (I was looking at the "Informer" just because I'm trying to go through the list of "big ones.") So if you are, go ahead because you will not agree with me. /> <br /> What is crowded and dated stupid! Let me tell you that there is a good idea about the film (I was thinking about how few movies are about the Irish Revolution), but as usual Ford is determined to bury him under an exaggerated and inexpensive sentiment. I suppose it's a little interesting to watch for a moment to see less than a smooth transition made from the silence of "talkie" - some actors' acting styles are over-quality, movies, and the movie feels like it could play better with subtitles than the spoken dialogue. (Of course, the titles would prevent Ford from repeating six times each emotional battle.) What kind of dialogue usually "they're always happy for me"! a quality that is aggravated by the fact that every actor seems to have been able to use his own version of the Irish accent. Of course, they are just as bad, the accents will help us remind ourselves that we are in Ireland, because the ensembles usually look as if they were attracted to some German expressionist work on another sound scene. (They feel like an eagle saw some villagers burning behind Frankenstein's background.) Techniques are changing. Taste is changing. So I'm not going to look at how crazy it seems to be that this movie was so respected in its time. But he is not one of the classics he holds - rather a "just warning" of how he has simplified malarkey unnecessarily for Ford to pursue his career.
