I chose this movie to replace the modest selection of daily TV and go with the desire for femme fatales. Well, for the previous one, it's better than a daily TV ... though I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It has its own points, but after the first 20-30 minutes, the points stand out and come to the conclusion that they are watching a television movie that was created along with too much time to create something that will together. In short, a terrific SciFi channel film. It has its points as a future is dirty, like the "Blade Runner" showed ... of course it's not "Blade Runner". The captain looks like he feels like actor Robert Forster, the kind of guy he wants to be around. But unfortunately it will end up feeling like a bad "Andromeda" rehash, where the crew muscles are made up of bad copies of smart "Aliens" shooters, Willow's mystic is sexually amplified and the new captain could be just like Jan-Michael Vincent running on "Danger Iceland "in the" Banana Division "; he just wore a uniform with bracelets; it has very few rights. They all rode around their version of power lances inside a ship that looks very similar to "Eureka Maru" because they fight the class of "people" who occupy the universe and are divided into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities ... ... as well like the Nietzsans in Andromeda. <br /> <br /> He might have a redeem with Michael Ironside, but after a while, one gets a feeling like a blast! He probably liked to do it, but the movie does not do much to help. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "okay". Well, how can one look at a DVD without turning it off; if they are following an ad, they will probably change the channel. One could watch it once .......... but a few hours later I wonder what it was they were doing to watch it all. <br /> <br /> It was femme fatale for me. ... ... when she fought.
