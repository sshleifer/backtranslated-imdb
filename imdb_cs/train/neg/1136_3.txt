Every movie from the 1930s is dated, but if you should only watch John Ford's movies, they seem to be more dated than if you were watching others. Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, it's always hard to sell someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). There is always an overwhelming emphasis on serious misconduct. Always badly created, unpleasant and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It is a rather weakened device that adds sentiment. And sentiment is all that's going on. What Ford does here does not mean I respect Lincoln, I'm just wondering how states have ever dealt with a population of complete fools as shown here. Ford started making good movies. It's too dated to make it wrong. She feels totally untrue. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And nobody from Illinois would say the end of "S" or would say "Shonuff!"
