What happened to the British television? From John Major over Tony Blair, it seems that the focus of this genre has shifted from social realism to normal women, focusing on talking about the domestic problems of middle-class professionals. (Or maybe TVNZ is not Let it be what it is ...) The writer's long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is mostly centuries-old clich√©s. Niamh Cusack's performance is powerful in a meaningful look, each kept by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than he deserves. But it seemed to be a bad substitute for the character's depth if the writer did not provide the material with which the actors could work. <br /> <br /> Of course this is theoretically a thriller, about murder investigation; but it is not as important as the failure of marital status and its accompanying problems. Is Cusack's character a complete bastard? Will her son be traumatized by the marriage? Making these central problems is not a sign of sight - it signals a deeply narcissistic identification of the writer and director with a character who should continue to work. Lynda La Plante knows how to write these things so that it feels like it matters, and includes viewers other than home neurotics; Paula Milne is obviously not a task.
