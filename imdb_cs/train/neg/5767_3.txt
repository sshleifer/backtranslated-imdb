As has been said, the visual effects are amazing. They are breathtaking. I personally use Blender and such a graphic is not easy AT ALL. But this is the movie. Not only is the plot complicated, but the overall conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene Proog and Emo try to escape from who knows what. Conflict seems to be between man and nature. Later, as he enters the empty pit pit, Proog explains that "one step is out of place and (you are dead)". Here is a more accurate conflict between careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man when Proog, from nowhere, kills Emo. Proog immediately changes from being a caring caretaker who cares for a lost child to be a "sick man". It betrays us. Not only is it depressing, but we do not care because there is no conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character. It's not a story, through a struggle that gets stronger. It's depressing and it does not make sense, because there's no big truth about the human soul or the world that appears as a big drama. In my opinion, the film is inadequately developed in all its aspects. However, the graphics are stunning, but the film is much more than just an eye candy. There is no truth, no struggle and no surprise ends. In conclusion, there is an insufficiently developed film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
