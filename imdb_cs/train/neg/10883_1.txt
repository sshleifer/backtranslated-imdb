This movie was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I saw it in a speech called "fantafestival". I find it terrible because some scenes look like chaotic and dark music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no suspicion of a movie. Music is completely out of the story and I do not have words that describe visual effects. If you look at the first scene, it seems that the movie is interesting, but a few minutes later, it's a joke. The story is interesting, but the development needs a complete overview.
