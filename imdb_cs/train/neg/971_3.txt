After reading some very good reviews of this movie, I thought I'd give him a watch, and after I was very disappointed with the movie, I thought I'd give him his own review. This is my first one, which was just as naked. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would scare the genre because it's not scary or scary in any way (except for a few poor attempts to jump, unfortunately, one of them worked for me.) I would say that calling this thriller is pushing them because I was not particularly excited! The film is about a spoiled, unhappy girl who feasts several times. During this time he visits the house he draws, after each visit he decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more vivid one of the features is a sad boy who is also badly in fact. When she joins the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world she's created is really better than the real world she's in. Until she adds to the house of a far-distant father, for failure to respect her father, she turns out to be evil and her boy must escape from her connections. Think about his attempt to be somewhat gentler version of Nightmares on Elm Street, but rather like a beach trip. <br /> <br /> Finally, my generous 3/10 hopefully stops at least one of you to watch!
