If during the first 10 minutes of this movie you do not realize that a character who writes a column on life instructions will have tables - so cleverly - inverted and learn some valuable life lessons, then there is probably something wrong with you. The setting is so predictable that it destroys the movie, even if the rest of the movie is good (which is not) <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry between the guides and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not fun . It is hard to believe that Binoche's character would be interested in him. Then it is all wrapped up so beautiful and everyone happily lives after all. It's not that big America!
