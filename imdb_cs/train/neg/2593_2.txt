American Pie: Beta House is a genre between genres. On the one hand, it's a conspiracy-free comedy and some really clever jokes. On the other hand, it is porn that is a bit soft core that really turns on all viewers. Essentially, Beta House is a collage of sexual scenes - some humiliating, humorous humorous attempts - with some thin, conspicuous points ejected in the pursuit of cohesion. The characters are barely two-dimensional, most of the development is based on the knowledge of Naked Mile and the "important" plot scenes are so distant that you wonder why writers have even realized the need for a story. <br /> <br /> In all justice, I did not expect this movie without expectation. I like the original three American Pie films and I thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rents. I thought Naked Mile was almost so good to be released in theaters, so when I saw some of the same characters returning to Beta House, I was thrilled to see this installment. I was aware that in many ways there would be many scenes of disgust and sexual humiliation. And I was fine with this, because in the past these scenes were based on a story and they were well integrated into the conspiracy. But in Beta House, it's almost as if writers have forgotten why the formula worked in other AP films. They spent too much energy in the nudity work that they forgot to really write a story. This film is a disappointment and it's not worth a single dollar. Jokes are fragile, the story does not exist and the porn-aspect is too tedious if it's all that really matters to see.
