The blind I bought this film and I was quite upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say it's worth the rent for some cold deaths and laughter. It's not a good movie, but I have to say I was quite entertained. I think it could be called so - bad - it's good. As I said, acting is terrible, I feel I could do a better job that would show at least some emotions. The story is nothing new and it's better. I think I only have a weak spot for a carnival-esquire movie. I would say you rent it or download it, but you will not buy it. They do not have more than one watch.
