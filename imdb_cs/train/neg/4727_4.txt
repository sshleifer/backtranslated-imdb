This movie is really something of pure egg, well in parts. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the main mistake was his inability to attract spectators' interest in characters and plot. I was sitting on it because I was interested in rock'n'roll and band dynamics, but if I had to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merits as a movie, I would have to put it down, a few warnings: Jason Behr is good at John Livien and quite convincing as a rock singer; the story of his childhood trauma is unclear, although he gives us instructions in Livien's good relationship with his parents, but his behavior is totally bizarre for the viewer (which should not be). Yet the idea of ​​using a personal stage to solve internal conflicts is interesting, even if it is not a novel, nor is it fully explored as a theme in this film. John Lennon's criticisms were irritating, but I confess I'm not a Beatles fan. In any case, Livien and his band reminded more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that something was derived from them. Another frustrating factor in the film was the way he appeared with some interesting philosophical thoughts of lead, albeit at the level of secondary and secondary schools, but left his thoughts only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly when Livien says, "before God , there was music "(sometimes he saw that the advertising for Tia Maria in the 1990s," Tia Maria was a while ago "seems to be an idiotic conclusion and the viewer has no idea how he achieved but is entitled to it Fortunately, his bassist and boyfriend, bluntly agitated by Dominic Monaghan, seems to acknowledge the error of that thinking when he answers "You Do not Know." In all, the limited force of direction and plot could go either to future projects, to absurd banality or to interesting and mature perspectives.
