Standard "color by numbers", which are filled with lots of routine fence devices from the films of great creatures. It's as if someone had a deck of cards with conspiracy ideas from other movies written on them that were mixed and dealt. Any plot and characters were cast into the scenario. <br /> <br /> The characters are so clich√© that you can play the game "Guess who ends up as a monster meal" in less than ten minutes into the movie, and probably get each one right - including the order they get. Many of the characters are so unpleasant that it will block them by rooting the creature. The main characters include Billy Idol clone surfing with sharks, crazy sprat blinking bankrolls, fellow with captain Ahab with vendetta and Achab's girlfriend doing dirty dances at the bar. Oh, and a big, big beast that needs anger therapy. <br /> <br /> On the way, people are arguing a lot, pretty girls are running through wet t-shirts, couples go out on exotic beaches, explosions appear shrine ruins and pirates of fat faces. <br /> <br /> Fun, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: insignificance by character when other people were killed. After one forced extinction they make one joke. I should almost hear the wounds of the wound. Overall OK if you have 90 minutes to waste and want to laugh at the so-bad-is-a good movie. Otherwise, you can skip this option.
