In this movie, after watching the 82-minute "Borat", I left quite disappointed. I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit and I usually go to animated films. When I said that, I found out that I was gone, and at some point I almost went away, but I waited for the film to improve. It never happened. The visuals are amazing and the voice work is excellent, especially in my opinion, from Kate Winslet and Ian McKellena (I had to remind myself that several times was a tiny dirty Lizard Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is one of those animated features for ADD. It is recorded after one unnecessary routine in sequence, a blank space filled with a conspiracy that pulls out every stop in an attempt to pass on an "important message". It looks like a damn Oscar-based bait for the animated category, and given the criticism it coincides, I would not have been surprised if the academy had become ill and offered its hardware. But if you're looking for a nice animated snapshot about rats, talk to the council and wait for Ratatouille.
