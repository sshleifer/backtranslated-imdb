John Pressman (Micheal, who I should call Ditech 'Lerner) works as a regular doctor. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him from people who see he thinks they hurt him. But it turns out to be a movie in the movie, but the witches soon blur when John goes to the movies to kill. Screaming the guy watching the movie do the same. Lerner is right over the top in this, but Zelda repeats a series of dialogues over and over again. This is unpleasant. But it's not as annoying as the two girls who watch the movie in the movie. As a horror movie this fails, it's too busy trying to be smart, trying to pass the message and it seems you forget that the movie slasher must cause a feeling of tension or at least a jump or two. No, what we have is the worst kind of slasher: Art-house one. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
