Yeah, right. I spent the first hour patiently waiting for the film to come out. It was terribly boring, and it consisted mostly of people who accidentally drove down the hills without any apparent direction. Then the hero got into the picture. He was born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Apparently white. He was not close enough to go through the Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely disturbing and nothing helped the story. Useless battles and foolish dialogues. It's an hour and forty-five minutes, and at the end I tried to eat my own face. I was looking at it because the people in the video rental where I work always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have the answer. It's something like this: ahem. "No, good god no, it's hot, do not do it yourself, I'd recommend another movie, maybe fun."
