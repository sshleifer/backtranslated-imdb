... for one of the worst Swedish movies at all ... forgive me for being boring. <br /> <br /> First I did not see the first (I was bored, that's why I'm looking at the 2nd place before the first), I hope the first one is better than this, it was filled with strange cutting scenes and very strange changes conspiracy. For the people who saw it and think that 4/10 is high (believe me), but it laughed me a few times because it was so bizarre that it is so bad and still laughing to think of the punk that came with this the idea of ​​what will happen next "Det sjunde inseglet II". Consequences that are not based on a novel or a book often do not seem great, and it's a perfect example of one. OK, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little, got some decent jokes and humor. But do not buy it, rent it. Just let some other idiot do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director has probably laughed ...
