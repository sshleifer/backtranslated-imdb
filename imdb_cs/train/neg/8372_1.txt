I can say, in all my 51 years on this planet, that it is the worst (perhaps childish) movie I've ever seen in my life. I took my three big kids to see it, and even they tried to pick up a smile in all 90 minutes. Sexual indendo I will leave the next day, but they were as tasteless as the film. You should pay them to look at it, and you will not pay them. It really is really terrible, there is no other way to describe it. The people who shot this film should be brought to the task of taking the money for false pretenses. I apologized for my misspelling, but I was so upset that it spoiled the time I had with my grandchildren. Greetings, Stephen
