Oh, brother. The only reason why this very irritating film avoids getting me a complete "bomb" is that it is at least historically remarkable as the first movie Three Stooges (when they were not alone and were still populated by this painless Ted Healy). But as a longtime fan of Stooges, I must say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are accustomed here as three assistant assistants to Mr. Healy's superior boss chiefs. They are not featured in the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany over-drawn cartoon characters trying too hard to be fun. Most of the teeth deal with Jack Pearl vainly seeks to get a taste of the audience as Baron Munchausen (here's a good example of humor: "I'm going!" "Why?" "Coffee zone!"). His helper is none other than the young Jimmy Durante, but the schnoz himself is a drill.
