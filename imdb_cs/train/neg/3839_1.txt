Some movies are so bad they are good. This is obviously not one of them. Based on the true story, this film was about the story as true as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The game was terrible, the direction was bad and it traveled too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to change and finish with her and come back home. Not even Melissa Joan Hart has ever portrayed me as a talented actress, but every film she shot, budget as well. Like most of her other films, she loses her characters by over-wrapping herself and talking too fast, as if speeding up her words has made her more dramatic. It really makes sense that the crew is in front of her and she is talking to a camera when she should deal with the viewer in her character. It's pretty much the whole movie, and any foot that may have stayed is destroyed. Probably the only good thing about the movie is when she finally learned. But even that was not satisfactory when I conquered my contempt for such a bad film. See if your taste in the film is softer than a dry toast.
