Imagine the woman alone in the house for forty-five minutes when nothing happens. Then it goes on twice. Writing is flat and lifeless, jokes are unfortunate, and bad acting prevents you from taking care of any of the characters, even if they are fighting packs of daggers and are beaten brothers. Anyone who placed this movie more than two is not quite reasonable.
