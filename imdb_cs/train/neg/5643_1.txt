I own 2 home entertainment stores and at that time I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this was so bad that it forced me to register and comment here. How bad was it? Let's say Sofia Coppola deserves the Oscar for his performance at Godfather III compared to Giada Colagrande in this film. It was robotic and non-spy. Her lover just died a month before coming to the Rubber House, which he gave her. Once she shows up, she finds her cheating on her whole relationship, but she does not seem to be showing her at all. One day the relationship begins with Leslie (Dafoe), the manager of the house. Although she is married to Dafoe out of the screen, her scenes with him were cold and neemotional. If there was a conspiracy there, I missed it. Even Willem Dafoe could not save this movie from the amateur wreck of a cinematic train he is.
