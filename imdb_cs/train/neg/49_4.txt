A very lean and boring road movie with the intention of being modern and modern, which is reflected in the style of adjustments and some special angles of the camera, which only leads to drowsiness. <br /> <br /> Casting is useless, the font is stupid and demanding. The only thing that's worth is the top-quality Lalo Schifrin soundtrack, a really great and also introductory sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run as far as possible, bad opinions and comments about this image are completely deserved; it is really clean waste. Of course it has its magic, watching a movie that someone would not leave a beer glass if it was in the fire but save it on a stormy day when you have absolutely nothing else to do.
