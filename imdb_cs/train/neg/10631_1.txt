The views of the Earth that are claimed in this film were NASA fake, recently compared with historical weather data at Apollo 11, and show good agreement between cloud patterns in the video sequence and actual rainfall records in the day. <br /> <br /> It seems to undermine the whole argument presented in the film that the image of the "Whole Earth" is actually a small part of a planet bounded by a space ship window. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that historical weather data is NASA fake, although it would undoubtedly include replacing each archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and those in private hands are still a problem. <br /> <br /> And the answer: "I'm trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA's weather data, which I would say, is a charming, but a weak and courageous argument." The Ways and Evidence in the Movie One wise man once said something about mosquito sifting, and camel swallowing Do you have a feeling that it might be about what you're trying to do here :-) This film is full of irrefutable evidence against the claims the US government once verified that the mission was successful and that this man is now real masters of the universe, things are almost never what they seem to be, just look at the film and I say I can see things a little differently than before. "<br /> <br /> First, weather data does not bear NASA , that is for metropolitan agencies around the world, secondly, data for meteorological reasons undermine the main claim in the film. "Thirdly, far from being" wrapped in irrefutable evidence, "the remaining claims in the movie have been thoroughly revealed, a previously hidden piece of the film, so it has modified it and added its own interpretation, but unfortunately its source movie is a public domain and Siblel bits modified contrary to his claims.
