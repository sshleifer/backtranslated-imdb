MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I just sat up late watching this movie, mainly because I enjoyed and rated some of Singleton's older work as "Boyz n 'Hood". However, I have to say that it was a great disappointment and it's all I hate about conceived, clich√©, the so-called "News" of movies. <br /> <br /> Actor is predominantly poor (pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors ... they notice), the situation is hard to swallow (the victim of rape becomes a lesbian overnight ... please!) but the worst of all is that it strengthens every twisted stereotype you think. The other half of the movie has become a cartoon-like feature, so you've lost any share of empathy you could have for your one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not once is a valid point about the natural causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. The result is just that the stunning results of these problems end up. It is a contradictory message that leads to confusion and a general lack of consistency of conspiracy. As for the conclusions of the films, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative, and offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning," I must say that all I've learned is to never see it. <br /> <br /> If you really want to comment on some of the themes that can not handle this movie then go to rent "American History X" .... if you just watched it for Tyra Banks then go to hire life.
