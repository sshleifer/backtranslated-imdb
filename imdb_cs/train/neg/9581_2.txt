That's the only thing I can get to know about this movie. Cleveland is a star, I was there and never seen the city look so good. Beautiful river and cityscapes. This movie moves forward in a pace that hopes you will not notice the missing real world. People run around and shoot their weapons without any consequences. For example, there's a shot at Rob Lowe's house - two cars are stolen, and yet police do not show up until later in the movie. Murder for rent never seemed so unlikely. Who would write this movie, there should be countless stray cartridges at the end of one of the films. Many of the actors in this movie are much better than this. I check the filming date of the movie to make sure it was not written during the writer's hit, but unfortunately it was not. This movie is currently rotating on Universal's HD channel - if you do not want to get over Low, there's no reason to watch it.
