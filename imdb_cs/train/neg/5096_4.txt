Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a post boy for a match with UBC (that is United Broadcasting Corporation); he is going to work anywhere and offers ridiculous projects such as "Abraham Lincoln Medical Dog", the studio manager - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (like Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr Russell's proposals, but he has no idea how to select a hit show. His secretary, Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who does double service as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee missing from Russell when he wants to watch TV. The monkey seems to be watching all popular shows and can easily collect hits. Russell explores the talent of the chimpanzee and uses it to advance his own career. Obviously things get into hair for Russell and cast! <br /> <br /> Tomas Chimpanzee (with Frank Lamping) has good results; Raffles looks boring and / or scattered over several scenes where the chimpanzee looks interested; these could be corrected by repeating or editing. A slight satirical edge is present - imagine the monkey picked up the hit TV shows! And it's a monkey that gets beer during the ads (drinking in Disney movie)! The view over the cast reveals plenty of entertaining TV actors to recognize and try to place. You could make a drinking game in honor of Raffle's beer, guess the actors and where you've seen them. Here's the Beginning - Hey, is not "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
