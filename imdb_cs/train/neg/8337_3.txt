Millie is soap. She married a rich guy Maitland and has a baby. Then she caught him cheating and divorcing him ... but letting him keep a child who claims he loves it. It was only in the early 1930s that she would have the right to a solid marriage and a child's support, but she would leave that guy amazing ... without support ... what's the soap! Later, when he has a friend and life looks pretty good, he shows he's also a cheater! Wow, he has a heavy picking up of men. As a result of these bad relationships, Millie will change. Now she is a wild girl - she does everything in her power to turn away from her great happiness. Suddenly it has gone through many years. Millie's daughter, who left early in the movie, is now 17, and strange fashions have not changed. An old friend of Millie (yes, she's another evil man!) She pretends to be a girlfriend, but she's got raving suggestions. Millie promises to kill him if he touches the girl. Take a wild guess of what will happen next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is mumbled and often a bizarre mess - a bit like "Madam X", but much, much less focused. So often it seems that Millie's motivation and deeds do not make sense. And it seems the movie has a bit of everything in it - until it confirms the idea that all people are pigs. Unusual, but not particularly good.
