I was not as "happy" as some others commented on this film: I've never seen anything else from ... let's say ... Sarna's "fruitful" mind. I agree with many: some actresses who spend a lot of time without topless and (go-go) dancing are not really as attractive. I like Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so cozy, she was cute! Also, acting was quite obsolete, although routing in the second language could cause a lot of this problem. Trying to follow the plot was a great duty: was there really one? I warmly agree with one more remark: there is not much blood for the vampire movie. Yes, if you want GOOD Bloody Films, look at such classical Hammer as "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Dracula Bride". Most (unintentional) humorous parts are where the ladies doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats ... you never see! ... bats, I think. Well, as waste of time, if it happens, the cable here in Great White North, but for heaven, do not borrow!
