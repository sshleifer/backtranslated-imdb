Tromaville High has become a worrying soil due to the unintentional release of toxic waste near the nuclear power plant. Unrestranged chaos full of absurd violence and gross behavior. Rather terrible, apparently intended to be, a film mess with the creators of cutting releasing the reins to allow untalented occupation of free government to reinforce it. The craft was far below the Troms' list of targets for this bloody sleazefest. Honor company are punks with anxious facial colors and hideous clothes. The German teacher who has become a member has a "toxic kiss" stripes on one side of her face that really gave me creeps. The toxic monster that sent ANNOYING punks to the end is pretty cool, though. </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
