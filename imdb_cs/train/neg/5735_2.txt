Above all, it's a low-budget movie, so my expectations were extremely low. I suppose that most people who look at the information for this film wanted only bloodthirsty and basically it's all. <br /> <br /> Plot? That's not really true. It's basically Saw, but in China and hell much worse. Cast? There is no period. Special effects? In my opinion, I'm terribly terrible ... There were differences and the blood was often incredibly incredible due to the amount, splashes, color, texture, etc. I believe the purpose of this film was to be a brutal, shock movie. Now he had great potential for a bigger budget, but bad scripting, bad dialogue, terrible behavior, what seemed like a video camera, and just an incredible "gore," made this movie really terrible. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are worth getting a chance against some reviews, even b-rate movies deserve some opportunities (for example, the most recent blood I've seen against reviews that it was worth it), but it was just terrible. I hope people who think about this movie will read my comment and decide against it. I am for brutality and shock, but overall unrealism and really terrible behavior make a terrible experience. Save time / money and something else, you will not be disappointed.
