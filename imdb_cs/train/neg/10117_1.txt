Wow. Tonight I went to a video rental because I was in the mood for the bad film B horror and I found this gem. I looked at the envelope and I thought it looked like a movie just for my mood. I brought him home and gave him. <br /> <br /> This movie was not a horror movie I had in mind. That was much worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got was that I did not know that such stupidities existed among the people. This movie looked like a 5-year-old, he wrote and drove it and that's nice. I'm an ambitious director and this movie makes me so mad that someone out there really is paying this guy direct movies. They have to work on the rubbish dumps where they fit the pieces they belong to. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or buying. I'll tell you the same thing I would say to someone who is going to commit suicide. "Do not do it, it's not good!" I really do not have anything good about this movie. Do not do it!
