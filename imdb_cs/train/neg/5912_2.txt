When I enjoyed the previous work of Mike Myers (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations of the 60s bond were quite high. After the first minute it turned out that it was an exercise to be as mad and unhappy as possible. Ten minutes later, I disappeared. I saw it the other day the second time to see if I was the first to be unfair. After ten minutes, I switched it off. It's hard to believe that even the twelve-year-old boy can find this funny. Dialogue is silly, Myers is painful to watch (like Heather Graham) and the sequence of characters including Fat Bastard makes things even worse. In addition to a slightly entertaining title and psychedelic set, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I personally recommend that you avoid this as an epidemic, even though some nice friends liked (maybe they were vaccinated at that time).
