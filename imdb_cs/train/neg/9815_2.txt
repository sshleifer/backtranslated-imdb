This film begins to present some original idea, but later became a big frustration. What is the original launch agreement if the rest of the film did little to prevent the clich√© of the plot? The movie itself is very incredible. I want to know exactly how someone goes to the clinic, gets a nurse, kills the doctor, takes the patient to bed, puts his Chevy clip and leaves? I think no one can answer this question, so they just jumped to the second scene that hid these little details. Performance is just bad. The villain is another "unpleasant crazy antagonist", no deep, absolutely linear character. After 20 minutes of the movie, most of the scenes are unbelievable, they seemed to be there for just 90 minutes because they were totally unnecessary. Doctor sees the woman clearly under strong medication, is refused to look at her, kicks her out of the house, and simply leaves peace? The final scene led me to laugh, only Mickey Mouse would do more. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first let say 10 minutes of the movie.
