After choosing Billy Bob Thornton's films (like the "Sling Blade," "The Simple Plan," and "The Man Who Was Not"), it was inevitable that there would be a strange turkey here. What I did not realize, however, was that one might be wrong. I give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor this movie is - the funniest dialogue in it is like this: "Knock Knock", "Who's There?", "Big Stupid Man," "Great Stupid Man Who?", "Great Stinky Man - you're!". Yes, people, it's really bad. Billy Bob is only about two minutes away (I think he needed a job at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason, although it is undoubtedly terrible, I hate it. This is probably because I've saved my anger at any high budget, special junk ejected effects like "The Fast and the Furious," and not "free-budget" flick like this. 2/10 when shifting.
