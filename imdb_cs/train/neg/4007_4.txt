I hope the one who suffered them has been released. The only high points are some of the supporting characters, 3 out of 5 my favorites were destroyed by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put it into perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story focuses on sex and nothing else. Sex with vampires, homosexual sex with vampires, sex with vampires, vampire sex, vampire sex sex, vampire sex, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we're afraid of vampires, sex because we're upset about vampires , sex, because we have just become a vampire, etc. Nothing against sex, it would be nice if it was a little smoother when we dived into the story. Maybe you have a story and then some sex. But they did not even bother ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzying toothbrush. Either she's upset or her figure is upset, I can not figure out what. Another part of the story I find very unlikely is why the 150-year-old vampire Bill, who seems to have things together, will be interested in someone like Sookie. He constantly flies to him for things he can not control. She leaves two days and she decides she will not "come back" and suddenly she has feelings for a dog-human? Give me a break. She was a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. The people close to her are dying around the world and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just put her card in a friend because she can not read his mind? As the main character of the story, I would hope that the show will do something a little more to make it understandable and someone who invests in your interest, not someone you would secretly hope to be killed or comatose. I can not find anything about her character that I like, and even the fact that she can read her thoughts is impressively impenetrable and not even interesting. I will not waste my time watching Season 2 coming in June.
