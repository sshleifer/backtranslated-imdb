A small mosque is one of the most difficult CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way to produce the easiest comic programming that can be for the oldest, most easily offended viewers, who for CBC mean 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. Jokes are all predictable and so deadly lame I can not believe it. The performances are very noisy and working, but I do not blame actors because such types of one-dimensional stereotypical characters are probably exactly what CBC demanded and demanded. Very lame show with bad jokes that they tried to present as "controversial," and it's less controversial than other boring CBC comedies such as The Hour's 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce, and Rick Mercer's report.
