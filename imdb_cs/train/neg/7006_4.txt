Mark Hamill was uncomfortable with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time he uses a new kind of "power" to regain his dream of ownership, a bright red "Vette." It looks like the other teenage adolescence is rotating in the first half hour and rotates in the wrong direction in the wrong direction, writing and overworking is terribly finished with several scenes , and you are expecting it to happen the same way, and you are also looking for the scent of the late 70's, only a former newcomer, like Annie Potts, could easily clean up the show and save this bad film from repo creeps! you are holding your interest for the good, and that's the best opportunity to see her in your swimsuit ... The horror for Annie! I'm sorry, Mark! I do not think Power was with you this time.
