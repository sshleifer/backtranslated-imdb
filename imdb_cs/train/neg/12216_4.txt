Do not get me wrong - I love David Suhet as Poirot. I like series and movies, but it's enough: Death on the Nile. Everybody did it! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who's a killer. We know how it was done. So I say enough! Mr. Suchet could use this amazing talent in another novel by Agatha Christie. I say that the acting of all the actors was great. The series was amazing and very realistic. I really liked David Soul, but I was surprised how he looked "terribly". I hope it does not look like this in a "real" life! I honestly can not remember other films, whether the end was the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought it was a great touch, let's say Mrs. Christie, anyway. I'd rather have the end, which then escaped in jail!
