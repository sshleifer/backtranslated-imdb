There is a reason why it went directly to the video - the story is crazy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a dirty way - sex in churches and other scenes that border with tastes (such as a laundry scene) devalue this movie. Judge Reinhold is all right, but the film itself is not doing well with the issue of degradation and revenge. But it's a good movie for trivia - because so few people saw it.
