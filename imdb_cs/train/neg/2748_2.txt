this movie gets only a second star because I work in the city center and I like to see it destroyed. the effects were pretty good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean film ever. being the most expensive and still totally terrible causes massive waste of money. I hired myself not to worry too much about what I paid, but it was a couple of hours to never come back. plot of holes. it works terribly everywhere. I do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to watch it, they will run away. I can not emphasize enough how bad the film was. where does the second dragon come from? why did not he show up earlier? how were the dinosaurs rocket launchers 500 years ago?
