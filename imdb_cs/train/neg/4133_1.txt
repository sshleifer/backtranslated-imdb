I watched this film with a few friends a few months ago, still thinking about some of the stupid fools today. Only the first few scenes were funny. I do not want to spoil anything to those who want to see it, I do not want to ruin laughter. No need to say that all the time I watched this movie, I tried to find out exactly what is the meaning of what the characters in this film are doing. Finally, we were all bored, because the initial gayness and the shock of the movie that had dropped this random idea. There is no conspiracy and no trace of decent acting. The characters are as well developed as the "Learn to Read" kindergarten. They even managed to make the lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
