"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be destroyed by pathetic themes like pseudopatriotism. Passengers from the future are trying to destroy Japan and replace the local hero Godzilla with a puppy, a three-legged Golden Dragon King Guideorah. They fail, however, and eventually Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battles between the two behemoths are very cool, but the story of the movie is full of holes and everything about "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not threaten Japan's enemies, so they are silly big blondes who are easily overcome by a clever Japanese. The good thing is that eventually Godzilla and King Ghidora almost destroyed both Japan and they are ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular battles. But until this battle royal, the film was really dull and pathetic.
