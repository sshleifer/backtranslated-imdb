So thank you for being very entertaining for Disney. I was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first films I remember. Now that I was 16 years old and felt pretty masochistic, I decided to go to the movie. So I managed to poison all my memories of the original film with this exclamation of excuse for the film. This movie has everything that made original cute and wrecks until the last detail. In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show her everybody in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the musical number ends, Morgan's witch appears in a few minutes and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not surrender to the trident. And so he gives up without fighting. Eric stands there staring, though Ariel estimates how to use the sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never be near the sea until Morgana is caught. Well ... uh, nothing is missing. Eric is the ultimate sound. He's never doing anything. Ariel is doing something. Melody can bounce things. In addition, animation is a new low for Disney. Computer graphics are inconsistent with the background. Once again, the opportunity for character development is unnecessary. The song bites. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I'm pretty sure that even the little kids will be bored with this skull because they do not do anything at all exciting. They do not want to sing singing. If you can take a copy of this, throw it into the ocean and I hope no one finds it. At all.
