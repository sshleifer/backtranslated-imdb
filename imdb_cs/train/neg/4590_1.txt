Anyone who studied some physics or cognitive science will be disgusted after 40 minutes, as I did with my wife. Unconscious masses can enjoy gossiping arguments and absurd "conclusions" (without attempting logical reason) from real science. I am offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science." I can only conclude that the writers picked up a book on quantum physics, they did not understand the word, then looked at The Matrix a thousand times and started writing this film. For example, the attempted crime at Washington DC was carried out by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A short search reveals the science of their methods.
