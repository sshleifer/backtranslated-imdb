Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about a plot, should be embarrassed by this series. Borg does not appear until Q comes to the Gamma sector, Klingons NEVER see until Kirk encounters them, NCC-1701 is the first ship to be named Enterprise ... Do I need to continue? Berman and Pilliar ridiculed Gene Roddenberry. After he died, they only saw $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ No wonder Majel Barrett was in every episode of the star trek until this series. I can not blame her for not messing with this mess. Poor Bakula. He is a great actor as well as actor. I like everybody, but the story is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just review the rating. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was prematurely canceled).
