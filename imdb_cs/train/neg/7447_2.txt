For the first time I read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! This is the classic historical romance set in the 1960s when the Western countries were a few days away from London, and law and order were much harder to enforce. Obviously, this version of the book has several freedoms with the story and, in my view, it is incredibly disappointing. The action and production values ​​are fine, but the way the story was routed was terrible. Why are TV adaptations doing so? Why would they think thousands of book fans would want to change the story ??? One of the great secrets of life! The BBC made an excellent version that was broadcast on Christmas in the early 1990s and I'm still trying to track a copy! Take your advice, read the book and do not bother with this small version!
