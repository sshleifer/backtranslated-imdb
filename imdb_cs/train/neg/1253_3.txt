Somewhere I read that Hollywood should concentrate on overturning bad films and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. While this remake was not a complete waste, I still wish I had six dollars back to go to the original DVD. Lots of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. It only repeats why Hollywood should leave the good things alone.
