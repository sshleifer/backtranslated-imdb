I, like many people, saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in 1997. At best, it was a subprime film, not defiantly a "masterpiece" that all these fanatics "Titanic" like to do like. First, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter what you look at. People like it because of his appearance. His acting skills basically consist of saying a lot of small lines and trying to act sexy. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: the girl falls in love with the guy, the ship is on the sink and lots of dirty love scenes. Everyone with an IQ of over 50 years realizes that it is not at all genius at all. It's not original either. Plus, the manager felt the need to drag out for 3 hours. I could compress it into a block for 1 hour without losing any conspiracy. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most overrated movie to date. Why he has so much attention and money is behind me.
