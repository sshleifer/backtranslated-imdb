This anime series is great: An interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everything is explained right now, hanging the ghost carrot in front of the viewer, luring the viewer to watch each subsequent episode. Imagine, however, disappointment when you find that a sci-fi thriller / huge robot adventure is just the backdrop for psycho-crazy and quasi-religious exploitation of sermons. If you want to hear "You're fine, it's good to be you." after you are flooded with negative slogans and negative emotions of characters, then it is for you. If you want a good sci-fi movie that's just fun watching, forget about this. The original and alternative endings were a great disappointment for me. All this, And this movie was too sermon.
