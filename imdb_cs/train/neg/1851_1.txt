"A friend," apparently without a taste or class, suggested I look at Ron Atkins's work. If it is representative of his work, I never want to see anything else. It's amateur, self-dirty, dirty and suicidal waste. The "terrifying mangler" of the title is an angry low-budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of tramps. There is little nudity and some erections, but no single element would save her. The lighting is scary, the dialogue is small and mostly shouting and the direction is clueless. During a recent Fangoria conference, I've seen doco on American film directors. Atkins was one of those who stood up. He spoke as though something important in his work, but after seeing it, I can not see anything at all. There is no style, and terrible visual effects (such as sunlight) only increase amateurism. Even so bad is fun. Avoid.
