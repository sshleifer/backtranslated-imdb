Spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, nothing happened in this movie than a woman who inexplicably bleeds. Secondly, it was not frightening. Thirdly, he had the worst soundtrack of a movie ever. Allow me to work it out. Sound was modified by either Beavis or Butthead? I'm not sure what, let's go with Beavis. The film is becoming increasingly subdued and people mumble and mumble, which makes you increase the volume (I saw it at home). Then Beavis will burn some really noisy sounds with allegedly scary / shocking images, which forces you to quickly lower the volume. This happens many times until the film, mercifully, stops. I can imagine that Beavis laughs vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror, observing how the test group always reaches the highway. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after falling asleep, it's a big mistake. But then it is a big mistake. Here's the thought? if you are going to make a horror film, add at least a gratuitous beheading, a 19-year-old blonde who screams to the top of his lungs just before he can take a shadow, a shadow on the wall of someone to eat live from the camera assortment, the cat was worthy of the camera to frighten the audience, some wild strange with maniacal laughter or monster, which looks like a scenic hand covered with aluminum foil (a la TV is lost in space). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt me.
