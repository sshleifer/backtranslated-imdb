you never think you're looking at this excused excuse for the movie. the way it is filmed, illuminated, acts etc., makes no sense. it's so bad that it's hard to watch. the load of the clips is repeated beyond the boredom. it seems that there is no "normal" person in the movie and the existence of the "outside world" is, well, it simply does not exist. and why does that bald man suddenly come upon invincible? this movie is out of silly. zero.
