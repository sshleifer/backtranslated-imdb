This movie is "riveting", but the same is the riot crash ride. It's hard to turn away. Overall, this film is nothing but an irresistibly irresponsible social experiment - and that is a futile experiment. Movie players are manipulative and seem to have no problems what they might be for the lowest possible denominator. The way money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervention steps that the filmmakers forced Ted to attend (a meeting with the Experts) were empty and lacked any substantial attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that it serves to cover filmmakers' posters and to make use of the situation of Ted. The worst thing is that filmmakers stop after Ted after 6 months; and they seem to be totally cut off from the topic they watched so closely a few months ago. If they did, they would find better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, they'd have to let him spend the money without any interference. This film is at best a Jackass stunt and is not a documentary film. It's sad to think how much $ 100,000 could really change the lives of homeless people if they get him in the right hands.
