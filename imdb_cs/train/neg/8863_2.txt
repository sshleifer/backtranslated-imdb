Howling II (1985) was a full 180 from the first film. While the first movie was huge and creepy. The other was dirty and cheese. Production value on this is very bad, and acting is terrible. The brother of an anchoring werewolf from the first part wants to find out what happened to his sister. The "scene" from the first movie was badly re-created. The fragile, simply looking woman is accompanied by a brooch (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to reveal the secret of the assassination / transformation / death of her sister. Christopher Lee appears and disappears, and then as a kind of sage / guides to two. Sybil Danning and her two largest assets appear as Stirba, the main werewolf of Romania. She also suffers from a bad face of a morning face, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad film. There's nothing good about this scab. I am surprised that Philip Mora is directing this film because he is usually a good filmmaker. The movie is so dark that you need a flashlight (no, not content, but the movie itself). To round off the movie, you get a dirty "punk" performance from Damned Wannabe "Babel". Perhaps if they set off more than a few dollars, they could get a real deal instead of imitation. <br /> <br /> The best thing to avoid is if you are not desperate, or you've lost the remote control and you're too lazy to change the channel.
