Effects without cause are not generally possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remak is not only possible, it is necessary. The Haunting received computer therapy with the kind permission of a first-class cameraman-turner-director, who once showed a promise (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since produced a series of large budget garbage (Twister, Speed ​​2) > The actors are unnecessary in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as if they wanted to be anywhere but in this movie. Lili Taylor is trying to add something to the action, but nothing that could be anything is unknown, because the scene seems to be missing half of it. Events happen, good and bad spirits appear without rhyme or reason, and then the story ends with an unsatisfactory event to wrap the previous 90 minutes of infertility. This is not the reason why we see these effects, because we all know that something can now be given on the screen. Why not watch the effects in the service of a good story instead of just for yourself?
