Many films have been filmed on the same theme. One cute girl needs a nice boy to impress on ex, pay her and then (guess what?) Falls in love with him, is a little madness followed by a row before everyone gets to the happy end ... this has been done many times . <br /> <br /> The thing is, I knew it before she started looking. But despite that, I was looking forward to it. In the right hands, with good occupancy and clear script, it can be a nice way to go a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> It was nothing like that. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. A female leader lacking a spell or joke that could not even illuminate my smallest spark in me. I really did not care if she "got her husband" or stayed alone and unhappy. Men's leadership that I wanted to kill after some endless wisdom. Just remove that silly look. I had no idea that the lead life of a little girl is the way to ubiquitous ubiquitous enlightenment. A completely unrealistic film full of unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have a job, all of them had more money than a sense, the bridegroom who continues after the wedding when he learned that his bride slept with her best friend. never happened "!!!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I was wasting even more time on this cliff ..... I could argue about introducing the character just to have a very sad name" woody " but in truth it was just a little humorous about what happened in the movie.
