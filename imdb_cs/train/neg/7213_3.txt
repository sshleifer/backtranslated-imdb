While I definitely consider an exorcist a horror classic, I have to admit I will not hold it at a fairly high level, as many other horror fans do. As a result, I have not seen many Exorcist rip-offs, and if something is going to happen to Exorcism, I have to say it's a good thing, because this movie is boring as hell and certainly not worth it. ninety minutes to it! Like justice to other exorcists, it's often considered one of the worst, and maybe it was not the best place for me. It is not difficult to guess what this conspiracy will be: it is basically the same as the Exorcist, and he sees that the girl is obsessed with the demonic spirit (who becomes the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called to exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, star Paul Naschy, who is probably the best in the movie. Exorcism was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the Spanish Giallo derivative "The Killer Wore Gloves". I did not see any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strong points. There are not many good things I could say about the film itself; it is mostly just a fetus together and the scene exorcism is worth waiting. I certainly do not recommend it!
