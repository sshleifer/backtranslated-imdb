The film is a clich√© collection of almost anything out there. It has no focus, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is shifted over the top, and stereotypes are abundant and outrageous. This film can not resist the temptation of drama when it does not exist. Every little word change immediately becomes a lengthy, unauthorized dialogue that is so typical of the classroom test. Where this exchange is not essential, actors (no matter how well they are normally) can cope with exaggerated emotions, aka "raising bets." Through playing, simply. There is no help here. Nothing can save that story. He is forced, fake and boring to tears. Incorrect punk rock portraits with The Who, piercings and crazy 90 clothes. Characters pass without role, detail and motif. Location is arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum Good Fellas cum Saturday night fever, with sense and artistic outpour. Good DP. I'll give it. Some movies have errors. This movie is Lee's defect. He escaped, like the others. It has become irrelevant. I do not mean anything interesting anymore. I have no desire to see again from this guy (from whom I will not be named from now on).
