Do you know when you look at your collection of old video clips and realize that there are some that you have seen only once or twice, and do not have to remember if they are worth seeing? Alibi is / was one of these films; I found it a long time ago, and I decided to give it a chance too. I'm not quite sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand the film is really bad, on the other hand, now I have another free tape ... yeah, you get it. The plot is predictable and in no case original. Stimulation is wrong. The game is bad, but that's not really surprising, as they are the two leading stars of the former soap opera ... they are used to overcome. Characters are badly written cliches. The film can even bounce the brightest way to impress me (through the movie): court scenes. Even you do not cause single emotions for or against some of the thin cardboard figures. The film has no real redemption at all ... even the dialogue is bad. The point is, it's so cliché that it's ridiculous. And that's the only thing that raises it over 1/10: (albeit unintentionally) comic relief from many clichés and stereotypes. I paid little attention, but every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. One last note: I have been included in the "Tori Spelling can not act" line as a one-time summary, but I think everyone knows, so I decided for the current one because it's more informative. Overall, this is really a bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing to do and if you are on TV. Good for a few laughs if you can. 3/10
