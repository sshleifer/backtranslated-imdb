I watched the unrated version of this movie and I realized about 30 minutes that I never got time back. I insisted in the end, I hope the dialogue will improve, martial arts would eventually look realistic, the special FX would really look strange. I was so bad. I love Horror, I'm a complete gore. I've been several of the eighties splashing movies among the great movies of the world. But this was not achieved in the 1980s, if this movie was released in the early 1980s, the fax could be forgiven because it looked so bad. It was not like he did not have a defense. Dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines that I have harvested when writing rather than shouting for torture. I do not like Hostel, I've never thought it was overrated, exaggerated, and protagonists I felt nothing, but as a side light beside this waste lit up like a beacon. The back cover for Live Feed promised never to show up, still waiting for what was promised.
