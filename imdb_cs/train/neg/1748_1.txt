Do not waste time with this movie. It's a total thrash in terms of acting, direction, sound adjustment, soundtrack ... Some of the very good actors had such garbage. The film does not provide justice to Paresh Rawal, who may be one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also a star, did a rather poor job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I think he should thank God for having a nice face, otherwise he would have won in Razzi in India if Bollywood had such awards. Asrani has a great talent, but he exaggerated his piece just as before. The script, which did not mention Boeing Boeing's tear in 1965, was pretty badly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood simply can not do anything original. Besides, they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes in the film were so exaggerated, they were painful to sit down. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he just is not able to make a decent Hindu film. Audio editing is awesome dirty. I can go on and on this matter, but the bottom part is that Bollywood should be shameful to shoot such a movie. The worst thing is that some people seem to love this movie. What's wrong with you? That's why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood is making more movies than Hollywood every year, but most films are unheard of abroad because of movies like this one. I'm Indian and I'm totally shameful Bollywood for making this piece of thrash. Films like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just amazing. These are world movies that are timeless ... among the best in this decade. Garam Masala is perhaps one of the worst in this century. Time. <br /> <br /> I give her 1 out of 10.
