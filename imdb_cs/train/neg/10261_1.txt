Wow, I just saw it on TV as one of the "spooky" films that show around Halloween. Was this rating G? In fact, there was nothing to be done to make this movie scary or worth watching. Other people also say it's a spoof, but I do not think so. For spoof, you need something called "humor." This low-budget crazed holiday did not have any unnecessary humor, and it did not make sense. Basically, you have a horror-looking monster (a guy in a rubber suit) that comes out of the closet and kills people because you'll never see that the monster is bullying or bloody. The spinning newspaper tells you that people have killed a monster, so I think it's good enough. The army is trying to kill a monster that is not much bigger than a man. They have a very bad goal. Then troops FLEES! Wow, did this film have an American military look pretty or what? This monster, even if it is difficult to kill, does not separate itself and does not say. Oh, and sometimes the other's head jumps out of his mouth and yells. It was a little interesting, yet a complete alien. <br /> <br /> What was the deal with a scientist playing Xylofon to attract a monster? During the dialogue it was difficult to understand because of poor sound quality. So why did the monster deal with the main boy for so long? Why did not the monster come into the wardrobe when he had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make meaningless senseless?
