I do not spend much time, I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is amazing. I have everything on DVD, I added them to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman is ranked best with Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die Hard, you get it. There's not too much good horror, thriller, there's going. We thank the crew many times and present our Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you're interested in how I came across it on DVD. I bought it over the internet, but it's area 4, as you know most American DVD players are region 1. If you own the Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player because it's the player of the whole region. Simply go to the settings and then select the desired regional line settings (1-9).
