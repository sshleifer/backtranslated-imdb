This is perhaps the worst fence, the fight with the sword, the movie ever made. It's not just because the so-called Sports Fencing is bad, but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to throw a hemispheric sex scene and later the anticipated dance groups around the fencing in the fencing club, I suppose to keep the audience interested. What a waste of the talents of F. Murray Abraham. You better serve with exaggerated clapping movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, everything Basil Rathbone has as a villain. As a swordsman, I almost recognize the impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport in the movie, but if ever it happens, it must have fresh, better cartoon characters and conspiracy with greater depth.
