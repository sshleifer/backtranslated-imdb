How this movie gets a 6.7 rating is out of consciousness. It deserves nothing better than 2.0 and clearly should be among the worst 100 IMDb movies ever. The National Treasure is an insult to the National Intelligence Service and just another attack on American audiences in Hollywood. Critics have said about the holes from which you could drive 16 kolik≈Ø. <br /> <br /> I love the justification that this movie is good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come on, it's no wonder people around the world think the Americans are stupid. It must be the deepest, insulting film I've ever seen. If you wanted to see a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately, the National Treasure has gained much more publicity than those amazing films. I bet that most of you read that they have not heard of them at all, because some of them have not yet been widely released. Nicholas Cage is an amazing actor - when he's in the right movies. From time to time I've seen Cage wasting his amazing talent in terrible infallible films like Con Air, The Rock, and Face-Off. When his talent is used as an adaptation of Charlie Kaufman, he is an incredible actor. Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand to the chipper than re-exhibit this visual atrocities.
