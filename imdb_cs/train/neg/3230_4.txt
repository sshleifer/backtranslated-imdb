I just watched the guinea pig - the Devils experiment. I have to say that this film, even if it had a very good FX, better than I expected, was not a good movie. Frankly, I can not say I liked this movie at all. Of course, it is effective in the way of shocking, realistic, twisted 43-minute torture, but I found it to be very boring (and not as cruel as I had hoped). And I also found that the torturers were very poisonous when they spoke and tried to claim that they were desecrating it even more destroyed (and I'm sure there are some people who agree with me). I saw guinea pigs 1, 2, 3, 5 and the best of those that I think are guinea pigs 2 - Flowers of meat and blood. I do not think much more about the Devils experiment than the Great Fx, the descent from the girl's point of view, the poisonous screaming moths, overall I give 4 stars to the FX because they are amazing.
