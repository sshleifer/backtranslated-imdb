I almost broke up with tears watching this movie. Not from laughter, but from the memories of the great film Rodney Dangerfield. Candyshack was his first and stole the film, Easy Money did it best, and Back To School is far from being the classic masterpiece of the 1980s. Then there were Ladybugs and that's when it started to show. Poor Rodney was old (Get to know Wally Sparks was a gentle step up from Ladybugs but not tell a lot). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives, Rodney plays Monte (a name he must love because it was his name in Easy Money), a wealthy (not always) guy who loves women and has been married as his. Well, he's going to inherit a huge plot of land now, and from the time Amish drove the land, he will inherit 5 wives. It sounds like a great idea for Dangerfield. The problem is ALL. The script is so poor that Rodney looks like he says his only camera inserts and all side characters have nothing to do. The movie looks like he was shot on a video with some really bad sequences that apparently are not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who seems to die saying the F word (which should, because the movie is rated R but played as if it were PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute portraits. Do not get me wrong, sometimes laughing at Rodney's jokes, but the poor man is still too old and too slow. We can see his jokes in miles, and the film will turn into a computer that Rodney is no longer working on through the terrifying years of the 1990s, 1970s and 1980s.
