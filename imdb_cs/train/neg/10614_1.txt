This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. It's an art film, but it's really a piece of waste. Her redemption is a beautiful tango dancer, but it can not compensate for the repulsive glory of Sally Potter. The story of this movie does not exist and I guarantee you to start laughing to the end. Especially where she started singing. It's totally unreal.
