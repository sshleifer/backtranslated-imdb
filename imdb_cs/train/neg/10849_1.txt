Normally, when I go to the local Hollywood video, I'm going to B-Horror. For me, the basic principles behind B-Horror are camp values, Heavy Gore, lots of unnecessary nudity and special effects that everyone can put together with a package of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I was a fan of the band since they first released the Demo in 1995. The film started on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask I READY. When I saw a lesbian sex scene due to a lesbian sex scene, I made it even harder. I made the whole movie, and when I did not mix, I shook my head and wondered how a rock star with a few million dollars wanted to make a movie that looked as if it had a budget of over hundreds of dollars. The whole point of this movie seemed to me to attract "Hardcore Goth Kids who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan are the greatest things that were invented by Lava Lamps. That's it. 80.5% of what happened in this movie just happened to be Satanic. This movie had plenty of potential and really could have been a really good movie, but in the end "the movie" is really just a widespread Cradle of Filth Video.
