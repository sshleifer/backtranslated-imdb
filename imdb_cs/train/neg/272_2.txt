When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching bad television. We've all been guilty sometimes, but my justification for tracking things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoon" is this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes the show really worth it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. Twelve years old will love me every unnecessary piece, every row of tight dialogue, every bit of a futile technoble. Scripture is out of the draw; so clumsy and uninformed it is one of Miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show is really long on the worst splash of Trek, you're having trouble. The Stargate movie is a wonderful guilty pleasure grounded in two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, superb music scores and great science fiction ideas. Except for a small amount of original music, none of the fun movie has appeared in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver an observer and legend interesting, seems to be half asleep most of the episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget had to be very low, because sets sometimes look like somebody's basement. Cinematography is not much better than vanilla and boring as a screenplay. It amazes me that shows with much more style (like Farscape) and substance (like reimagined Battlestar Galactica) have a smaller, less blatant fanbase than this pop. It simply does not deserve it.
