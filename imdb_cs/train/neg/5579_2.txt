The 1960s are a fun movie sometimes, most of the fun is laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven and contains many annoying elements. Take, for example, the switch between black and white and color. If this has been done properly, it could have been quite effective, but because it was wrong, it has changed into difficulty, and has just lost its bad experience; much of the movie had a strange feeling. The hearing was not bad for a movie that was filmed for television shows, but it was totally embarrassing again. Many events were not cohesive and ended up confusing. How did this family eventually get into many big events during the 1960s? The end was too uncomfortable for my taste; because it was hollywoodized, it all had to end. I'd like you not to waste time on the 1960s and do something different with your time. I'm glad I watched it in class, not in my time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my restless thoughts about the movie. I hope you come to my advice and stay out of it.
