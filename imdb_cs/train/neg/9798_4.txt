15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the performances that transformed peoples, especially youth. When I was a three-year-old boy living in the Philippines, every Friday I watched this show on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there). When the film came out in 1995, it was all shock and deference to me when I watched it with my dad and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a Balikbayan pack full of Power Rangers (including the easy-to-build Megazord character and stuffed Rangers toys). I even played video games and loved only one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. Anyway, it was a show that attracted me to robots (especially the anime mech series like "Gundam"). Now that I was 18 years old, I'd love to think this show is nice to me. To do that, I set off on a monumental avenue by buying a two-storey DVD collection called "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: Power Rangers Movie," watching both. I was glad: "Uh, how terrible, just another soot in the attic for me." For you all the people of my generation, it's not a show you'd like to watch over and over again. I'm not saying I'm gonna let it go all my life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing, is not it? Instead of "Power Rangers" I recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam", "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots), or even ORIGINAL Sentai shows that they were the basis of "Power Rangers."
