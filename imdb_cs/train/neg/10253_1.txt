Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see all his work. He was known to rescue the films with his presence unilaterally. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers from a low budget and its production values ​​are worrying. Please ... for Christopher's love ... to avoid this movie!
