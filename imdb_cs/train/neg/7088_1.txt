I was exposed to this atrocities by my wife, tried to turn it off after 10 minutes, but was forced over the whole thing. It has to be, hands down, the worst pretending movie ... <br /> <br /> These were great script moments such as: Sammy - "If he gets over here he will get the bonus" Madam - "Boner?" Sammy - "No, bonus" <br /> <br /> Summary: Terrible scenario, terrible acting and incredibly illogical.
