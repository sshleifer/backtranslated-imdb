One of the worst movies ever. Not fun, bad television cinema, bad acting. It is sad to see so many famous old actors who can hardly walk, let alone eat. Leading wife Nancy Young can not act. Wonderful direction. Subpar with bad TV movies. Occasional weak jokes are flat. Even the basic premise of a movie makes no sense. Some way to stop the wedding, but there is no logic behind their actions. Slow stimulation made my wife stop watching, but I suffered. Old men behave like young and horny, but they are based on being sad, instead of being entertaining. How did they get the money to do it?
