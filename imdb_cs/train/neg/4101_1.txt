it can be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not see how it could ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? it's more like a wooden track. scary music is excellent, but because there are no frightening situations, the director thought it would be good to use it for everyday activities such as picking up landings or walking down the stairs. the film had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers thought you were already familiar with them. they would undergo special activities without explanation, or even a clue as to what they thought. it's just one of those movies that say it's one thing and something completely different.
