This acts as a satire during the era of women's rights. Of course, it does not mean that COACH (movie) is an amazing experience. This is in the same spirit as FASTBREAK (which was better but still tame) and is basically a standard fog. What I mean by making this film uninteresting is easy to recognize. Anyone who takes the time out of normal work by training a bunch of fools who get on a path to a sudden victory is waste. It's the same feeling you can watch. A nice attempt to broadcast the opposite sex for the duty of a person, but I expected better things.
