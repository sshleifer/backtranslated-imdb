Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to rate judges lower than 1. What a shame. This scary movie is so bad that I actually turned away the damn thing before the end. The script had several clear moments, but the direction, editing, acting, sound quality, and online timing in particular, were so vile that they made the judges absolutely unbearable. The judges were proclaimed to be a modern western comic style, but in reality there was nothing like that. The most sorry is the dog at the tip of the shoe. You can try to pretend it's ok but it still happens. <br /> <br /> Why videographers think it's okay to wear this kind of crap with constant loopholes in the sound and worse than the middle class drama school meeting is outside of me. We rent movies to see something better than what's on TV. But judges are worse than the craziest original SciFi Channel. I intend to demand a refund from the Hollywood video.
