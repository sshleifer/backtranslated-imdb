As a fan of Altman, I've been looking for this movie for years, and I thought that with such a large cast would have to be at least marginally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's big actors who are tossed together randomly and improvised (or so they feel) hoping that it will all happen in the editing room. It's not. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this step is remarkable only for Alfred Woodard's debut performance that overcame veterinarians all around him. But besides, avoid at all costs. (It's pretty easy - it's never been published on the video - to my knowledge - and its cable show has the frequency of Halley's comet.)
