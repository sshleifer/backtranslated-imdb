I saw a movie that does not know anything about it. The conspiracy was terrible, and there was a great lack of information. The film did not feel like it was a "battle of wit." The actors just exhausted the stupidity of nonsense, and sometimes they made me tear my teeth in agony as they moved further and further. The plot was predictable with the exception of the gastric ill homo erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic, but I made myself physically ill to my stomach), even the end was predictable. And you could say the detective was Jude Law in his costume, everything from a false accent, a terrible dental work, a cosmetic dress on his face, it all turned out to be a disguise. The whole movie seemed to me to be an unnecessary time in my life. This movie had a puppet show featuring Jude Law and Michael Caine as a puppet and house as a show window, really boooring in my opinion.
