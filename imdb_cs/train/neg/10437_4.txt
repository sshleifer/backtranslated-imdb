An admirably weird, though wild comedy drama about a weird young man who hopes to fly like a bird over Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman, guided by a quasi-comedy with eccentric characters, is so overwhelmed by the weirdness that he starts to squeak in front of you. Some of the cinematography evokes, Shelley Duvall is the stitch in her debut as a guide and Sally Kellerman looks every inch of glamorpuss as Bud Cort's vision of "The Mother of the Bird" (imagine that Altman and producer Lou Adler explains that role for her!). The leader is Bud Cort - again after "Harold & Maude" - a true original; not like Michael J. Pollard, Cort managed to be captivating, crazy and harmless, a heavy hit that he avoided. Unfortunately, it's one of Altman's loses. He can put the cast and showpiece together like no one else but let him shoot him with some bad inspiration and spiral down. ** z ****
