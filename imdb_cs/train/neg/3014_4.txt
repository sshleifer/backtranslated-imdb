I have recently seen Made Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film as a photographer because I am both known and a fan of Burtynsky's work. Even though I think the movie is doing a good job when it gets a message, I could not help but felt it was done as a complete idea of ​​photography and then a popular Burtynsky book. Obviously, one of the reasons is the extensive use of photos that contain magnification and dimensions. While it is a good effect in economic use, I felt that 75% of the film was just static from Burtynsky's book (which I already own). That's probably exaggerated, but I felt it. If you own a book or are familiar with its work, you might want to miss it.
