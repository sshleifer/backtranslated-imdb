STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding at his ranch in Montana after not capturing a notorious terrorist. He then turned to the agency again to travel to London to go on. His target was detained and under heavy police protection - but they do not want him to just capture his man - they want him to pull him out. Everything goes well, but the mission gets worse and when the police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance), is murdered, Dial's feet are blamed. She behaves like an animal, wiping herself in a nearby house, and confronting a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who deals with questions of her own life and becomes his unconscious assistant when it comes to clearing his name and working, who betrayed him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> </ span> , it might look like Snoop Dawg tells you to go as if it were hot. But I felt compelled to do it anyway. It's not among his worst, but does not even reach higher standards than some of his better ones (Detonator, 7 Seconds, it says all, really). <br /> <br /> This is at best slightly thrilling, with minimal actions that are on the path of cool dialogue, and Snipes does not feel exactly the best in the lead role. Likewise, it is quite clear in the supporting role that Dance has only appeared on paid control, and it is generally such that none of the actors will scream on the hills about one of their biographies. <br /> <br /> Many times it says that the only contract that takes you down is when Snipes finishes with Sony and ends up with other EL DVDs. **
