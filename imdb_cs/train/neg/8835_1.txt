Before I watched this movie, I read a review here that this movie could be one of the best movies at all! ha ha scenario according to the scene tensions grow well ... from the annoying characters in this movie. From a little girl who speaks inexpressively and tries to drown a little boy to a killer who runs without any announcement (and who was that guy on the beach talking to a little boy?) .. things seemed to happen and then go unanswered in this movie. When I watched the movie look like one way, then it just does not go anywhere but in a new direction ... and on and on ... It works great, but writing is terrible. Every character, in every scene, says or does something so incredible, unreal, and the reactions of other actors / extras are just strange. There are no solutions to problems developed throughout the film, which is confusing and eventually a great waste of time.
