The same twin sister Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen climbed to glory in the series as "Two Pieces", I've never seen them before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, Sisters Hunter Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for Summer Intern, but not long after they start working, they are immediately fired for a series of accidents. But who owns the company they work in, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone) gives them their jobs back and they slowly turn out to be useful assets and talented (fashion) artists and help stop the takeover of a human being. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this movie was shot directly to the video, working with the camera is completely unresponsive and will not help if you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is only good to watch, the sisters' twins are two of the most annoying personalities around, I knew that before they were looking to have no interest in me (or their pretty ones), it was a terrible glimpse of the waste film. Pretty poor!
