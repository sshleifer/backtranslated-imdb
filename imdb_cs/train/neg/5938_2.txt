if you were not in the 90s or heard a rapper EVER! this movie may be fine for you, but everyone for every fan or any individual who ever listened to the rap of this movie was boring and did not make sense in a movie where I said it was interesting or I did not know it. the other thing that helped me was that it looked like something in his life that he did, it was very easy that there was no fight he made to make the murder look easy, selling drugs, and even rapping was not realistic. I think if a movie that was released in about 15 years, it could have even more impact! good rap movies hustle and flow, get rich or die trying notoriously
