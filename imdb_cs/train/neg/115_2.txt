Never fit models and Playboy bunnies in your movies! Boba Fosse "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, about whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to take Sister after a murder in the hands of her low-life husband, is several times more interesting than Dorothy on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not even an actress ... I expected to see some lost masterpiece and la Orson Welles, but instead I got Audrey Hepburn in jeans and haunting "hairy" hair .... Very disappointed .... "Paper Moon "and" The Last Picture Show "I could watch over and over again. This flap I once sat down. This movie was supposedly not relaxed because the brouhaha surrounding Mrs Stratten's mournful death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
