Wimpy Stuffed Armor Armand Louque (played fearlessly by veteran veteran Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of scientists who want to find and destroy the secret technique of zombie making. Armand falls in love with beautiful Claire Duval (Dorothy Stone, a blonde-haired woman) who uses mild juice to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (hopelessly woody Robert Noland) to marry her. Furiously over what Claire had used and refused, Armand used his voodoo knowledge to avenge himself. Exciting sound? Well, it certainly is not. To begin with, the static (non) direction of Victor Halperin allows a meandering and ruthless story full of short stories to develop quite slowly. Even worse, Halperin definitely does not bring any tension, atmosphere, and momentum to a terribly boring drive. The predominantly fool playing from the predominantly insipid cast does not help, just George Cleveland as the generous General Duval and E. Alyn Warren, as drunken Doctor Trevissant is able to revive things a little with their welcoming and refreshing hamrimi histrionics. Falling library book scenarios, painfully obvious stageballs, and gross cinematography are quite miserable and unfortunate. In fact, this weak justification for the haunted feature is so disturbed that even the unrecrured sharp eyes of Big Belo Lugosi can relieve the brain of a dull boredom. Terrible boredom.
