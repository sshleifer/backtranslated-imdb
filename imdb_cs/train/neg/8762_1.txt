The scientist (John Carradine - sadly) finds out how to bring the dead back to life. However, he returns with marble faces. In the end, it all leads to disaster. A boring, utterly predictable trip to the 1940s. It made me foolish when I was a kid, but now she is just doing me. I had to try to stay awake! The only exception is horrible acting. Such bold boring actors! Hopeless. There are several good things: Carradine, through the script, really does a very good performance. And there are some ghastly moments that contain the spirit of the great Dana that goes through the walls. There is also one of the worst looking knockout in the history of the cinema. Still, none of this is fun enough to make it possible. Avoid.
