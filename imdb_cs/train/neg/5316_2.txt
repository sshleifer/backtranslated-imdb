Throw this chubby dog ​​bones. It's so bad ... you can go look. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic bad guy escaping from the vanished super commander of the spacecraft (Jan-Michael Vincent). The collision will steal a shuttle that crashes on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to return a dead or alive villain. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger that requires caution in dealing with these two visitors from far, far. Costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking in intelligence. Vincent must have taken the money and fled. The law shows a single sign of effort. So bad it's almost comic. Also in cast: Dyana Ortelli, P. J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
