A lot of death is happening in the wild. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to find out! But must it become the center of documentary film? What is this fascination with a terrible death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn in pieces by a bunch of hungry lions? Or the cheetah catching the gazelles in the neck in slow motion, no less! I thought it would be the nature of a family-friendly movie! <br /> <br /> And why do not you have the courage to show horrific violence in movie trailers? Are filmmakers afraid to lose money? Then, in a typical, comic relief, we can see that the beautiful birds of paradise perform rituals covering the most difficult and stupid narratives humanly possible. It was unreal! It's as if the filmmakers thought it was only the first and second levels of school trip pupils! Wow! From Wednesday to Mourning in the Heart! If some future documentary filmmakers wait in the wings to read this film review, why not focus on: Animals actually dump; to give birth; storing eggs; bathing; sleeping; mutual cleaning; socialization; playing; emotional manifestations other than fear and anger; unusual behavior such as a mouth; migration; experience to solve the problem; culture (yes, many kinds of animals have what people call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or destroying beauty and why not be much more round - and focus on pleasure and inspiration, instead?
