Did I see it on TV at night? or rather I went over to another channel, which in any case often looked at infomercials when I could no longer look at it. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not "so bad is good" just wrong. How did you get funding? Who thought it was a good idea? One of my boyfriends appeared in bankruptcy and was told he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think what he meant was "save myself and escape from this stack of piles @ # $%." I bet the rest of the cast got the chance. To be fair, acting was hard to judge because of the terrible fake American outcomes. Shooting was tiny. The event was unpleasant and confused. The dialogue was uncomfortable. The saddle thing was the ship. In real life, the Interislander ferry is a deserted boat and does not get well on the film. Instead of making a very unsuccessful attempt to make it look like a new crew line with glitter pieces wrapped around rusty votes, I can not do it, they could change the script to explain or even celebrate the scuffle. Dirty, stupid, stupid. Do not look for this movie or a joke.
