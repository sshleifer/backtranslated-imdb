The story of the film hangs on one important point: that the killer was also a responsible, loving and caring father. Not that he's not a father and a murderer, it's impossible. But this man is exposed to the murder of a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. The girl was the daughter of someone. I do not think the father who cares much for her own daughter could be someone else's daughter so cold-blooded. Or, alternately, he could have been so bloody cold, and still take care of his own daughter and take care of her. And the idea that the convicted murderer would actually ask the parents of his victim to learn and care about his daughter is not convinced. <br /> <br /> It said the actresses acted with conviction. I thought Scott Bakula's color change caused him to seem colder and more menacing than usual. He could not see him at all.
