This is a slightly interesting gore fest of the late 1980s, which contains some ugly slugs with a taste for human blood. If you can overcome the sensuality of the whole thing, you can actually get some lesser experience. The game is terrible and the plot is simply there to keep the film together between the attacks of horrific slugs, but the film is not a complete waste of time. The special effects are really good and the gore is well done. It reminded me of the remake of Blob, probably because it was all dirty. Overall, you would be worse for one and a half hours of your time, but I would not suggest you see this movie unless you have a strong stomach and you are in such things.
