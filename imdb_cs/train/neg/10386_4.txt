Could it be interesting? Japan-set creepy house story from the perspective of the newly installed American family? but it is declining due to the too simplified treatment and inappropriateness of both actors and directors. The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern Renaissance of such a native fare that the spirits prove to be evil without any real reason than expected! Besides, does not that mean it was in the spooks department? a giant crab attack is simply stupid? as a general, spirits inhabit a certain nature and cause it to be totally unobtrusive, such as Susan George seduction diplomat / friend of the family Doug McClure and Edward Albert power-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> An old monk appears at the house to warn Alberta of danger if he stays there? Eventually, they are called to exorcised spaces. However, history is obliged to repeat itself and tragedy is the only result of a tight situation properly created? leading to a violent yet inadvertently fun climax, in which Albert and McClure, holding the ghosts of their Japanese predecessors, joined the improvisation of the karate duel to death! At the end of the day, an innocuous time loss occurs? tolerable in just 88 minutes, but under no circumstances is it essential to view.
