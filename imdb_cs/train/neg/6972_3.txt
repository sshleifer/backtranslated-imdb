When I first saw the envelope of this movie (a huge mistake is chasing several sisters) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I was not in any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this blowing of cheeses, who always does a good job in any role he's dealing with ... FX are pretty creepy, there's not a lot of plot, and I still do not know why this movie called Blue Monkey because there is nothing in this movie about monkeys. But come to the people you expected? It's not as bad as it seems .... If you like the old 50 style black and white bug attack, this is basically an updated version without updating special FX
