1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that you can not wait to lose 2 hours of your life as you see the role of credits. I honestly think I could make a better movie vampire ... and I do not know anything. The only thing that is not just a hall (heavier than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a bit cold, has some mystery and kicks a little ass.
