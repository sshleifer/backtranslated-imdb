... but the keyword here is "usually". It was known that I admired movies ALL think they are stupid. But in the world of rated B movies, this is a Z rating. Absolutely absurd. The thing I appreciate most of my favorite movies is that they do not take too seriously. The creators of such films treat the film lightly, even though it is a difficult subject. But I have the impression that the producers of this film have made their way seriously, as if they were compiling a ten-star classic, complete with poor attempts at dizzying lines and silly camera shots. In spite of all this, I gave him 4 out of 10 stars, because I'm so kind to the movies. If you are a B rated fan, I would try to find this.
