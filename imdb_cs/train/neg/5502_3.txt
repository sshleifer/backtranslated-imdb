Stupid, often ridiculous, about the landing of the spacecraft and the subsequent disaster caused by Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in his orbit. <br /> <br /> I am always surprised by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in 1983 "Conditions of Suffering" as Shirley MacLaine's affectionate son-in-law. When the years passed, Daniels was unable to get his hands on a good, massive role. Instead, he is in rogue comedies such as "Dumb and Dumber." As for this image, it fails due to the subject. At least the TV show has brought about a number of situations. We have a constant scare in the movie, and people become monsters because the government is thwarted to capture Martian Martin. Part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of a film failure. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a Ditty individual captured in situations where the Martian left her confusion. In the movie version, the blonde bomb looks like brown, trying to engage in romantic engagement. TV star Ray Walston plays a small role as a government agent, or is it really so? <br /> <br /> Great disappointment for those who enjoyed the TV.
