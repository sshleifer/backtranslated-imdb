The Japanese sense of running, editing, and musical score must be different from American tastes, but certainly this film could be much more with a little more emergency work. Someone in Hollywood needs to make this film, and I think it would be a big hit. The story is interesting and creepy. There is something about the edges of the city, harsh policemen, earthquakes, sanatoriums, and mysterious salty water murders that are just enough to be breathtaking. But this story has to make a little sense, and maybe about 40 minutes shorter. I have to say that in this film there was "sixth sense" in full force, and that was obvious from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> In the stage, just lovers of Japanese movies should bother to see this oh-so-boring movie.
