I'm sorry this movie is really bad. Reminds me of c-porn movie with one main difference: no porn. Story and dialogue need complete repair. Perhaps bad behavior would not be so noticeable. At least stimulation had to be lifted. Although I agree with the fact that it has a low budget and the director has done a good job visually in terms of how he has little money, he should spend more time on the story or even better, to get someone else to write it. Many of the action scenes were simply unnecessary. It was a complete waste of time.
