This movie looked good - a good cast, a all-green theme and explosive opening. From there he went down the hill. Why was it shot by a handheld camera? It shakes, smells, part of the scene and simply mixes the viewer. Bad choice. As if this is not enough, the worst of the memory will take over the suspect's viewer - mandatory if you want to enjoy it at all. And then he commits the worst sin of all. After the audience has brought all the unlikely and unlikely scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they will bring credits without revealing the revelation - the end - the payout - just like what heck was the motif? How can you expect success by making thrillers endless? Doh! This movie had a great promise and ended up doing the face of the plant in the mud. What a loss of effort. Wrong efforts of writer and director.
