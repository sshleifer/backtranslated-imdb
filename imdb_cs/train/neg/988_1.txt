This movie NEVER offers to anyone. It will not succeed at any level. The actor is a terrible, boring long-haired dribble. Of course, according to the length of the end of the sexual scene, they were trying to be shocking, but they eventually ended in a parody of what the film was heading for. Complete garbage, I can not believe what a ridiculous movie was. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure that Rosario Dawson has ended up in this movie because even if it was her disturbing break indi hit, wowing the NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult will stick to this movie because the movie will look like an uninteresting episode of OC or something aimed at teens. Pathetic.
