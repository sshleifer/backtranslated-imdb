It is important that you are not offended by a lack of logic or common sense, and those who have some "gray matter" agree that this film simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Problems lying in the direction, cast selection and lack of depth in the character building. The word of comedy was very difficult to say when I laugh when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister in mid-30 seem to be well-groomed. They meet a full stranger in the park, and the character Heather Graham approaches to her and asks the most intense questions that even half of a sensible person will run differently or at least shout a policeman. He then walks awkwardly and makes some stupid statement and she drops for him. Then, ONE DAY, everyone was walking together, falling in love with her and deciding to get married in Vegas for a week? Hello, does anyone feel stupid yet? He will come out with thousands of women and meet this person who says about 10 words we see on the screen and wants to marry her. Not only there is no chemistry, it does not make sense. Sure, it's a romantic comedy, and I want to believe it could, but it made it quite flat. Now Heather sinks her head over her heels too, and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (a very shallow character) kisses or more, until it is the deadliest kiss that chemistry can be there. I found out that it is unromantic and unfortunate, and while many say Heather can not act, I think the reality is Heather, he was clearly a wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> It was Sue Kramer's debut as a director, and it was too much for me to chew for her. It will take a lot of crafts to make this film work and IMHO it could be done with better writers and casting and direction.
