This film is one of the worst comic films I've ever seen. I hate these Napoleonic dynamics. Just to face people, that silly humor has already been mastered. Do something new once. All these new comedies are terrible. And when he came out of SNL, Andy Samberg is not yet ready for the lead. I hope he can come back from this terrible movie. And the character Will Will Arnetts is simply wrong. Hey Will, you read the script. The story is really the worst thing ever written. Now you tell me if it's weird. (This is a movie) Dad's step Kimble's family dies and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for a heart operation, so Rod is planning this huge jump to get money for Frank. Just to get Rod to defeat Frank and fight his manhood. Yes, this is a movie, tell me you would spend $ 7.00 to see that a bit of bullshit! <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
