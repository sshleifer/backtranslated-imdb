When I first broadcast this cartoon, I thought it would be at least half of the descent, I was wrong with the boy. I have to admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney before all those years. I watched several episodes and two of them had Batman literally get his ass kicked left and right Penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat Batman bulls and I watched another episode where Batman got his ass kicked again Joker who apparently used Jackie Chan, who was moving in the air like a ninja. Since when was Joker or Penguin ever battling for Batman? and even worse when Joker and Penguin Kung Fu were counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad how the Batman image is shown in this show. Animation is terrible and the dialogue is horrible. Being a fan of Batman since my childhood, I can sincerely and strongly recommend that you keep away and avoid this show at all costs, as it does not represent a real Batman image. This cartoon is more like Wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see the classic Cartoon Batman, I strongly recommend Batman Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing but a S --- T! Get the Batman: Animates Series and do not waste time with this cartoon.
