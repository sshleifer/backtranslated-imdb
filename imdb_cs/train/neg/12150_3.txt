Feeding the Mass is just one of many recent average zombie films that take after your hard-earned dollars. Proposal? Keep your heavily earned dollars and let's say old good TheaterX has taken on this one. Guess what's going on? Zombies take over. This time, however, due to the originality (?), This film takes place on Rhode Island, and to be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen the zombies on Rhode Island. Government-controlled TV stations allegedly maintain a "normal" broadcast so that all the remaining citizens do not think that there is any problem in the world, that is, they never look or go outside. I'll say, however, that several ads broadcast by this station were probably the most amazing part of this movie. It's a bit of a story, but I will not worry about it, because after some time you either do not take care of it or you are asleep. Anyway, it has a lot of scary acting that throws all things "seen all before" topping out before the camera. Believe me, you can find a lot of other things to watch with your time. 3 out of 10.
