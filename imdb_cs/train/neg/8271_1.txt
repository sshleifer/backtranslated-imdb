"Nice guys with bad hairstyles!" "Beautiful girls without any trace!" "Stupid gangsters who can not shoot right!" The dragon dynasty comes from the Hong Kong gangster drama "Dragon Heat". For reasons that are probably forever obscured, the production and relief efforts of this film "criminals on steroids" somehow got both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign up as villains. But they do not have so much to do in this terrible slug-fest. They are two of the best contemporary actors around, each with their own biography and a list of successes, and Biehn especially has the courage to accept some rather demanding and immortal roles. Maggie Q was a super-bad "Mai" in "Live Free Or Die Hard", so "Nuff said." /> <br /> <br /> Biehn is of course known for being a soldier of the future that made The 1984 The Terminator such an incredible science fiction / fantasy romp when he collapsed against Big Arnold, who is now Governor of California! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost lost in this terrible train-wreck of the police drama. There is absolutely no reason why an incredibly complicated conspiracy - given predominantly in Chinese because it is the story of Hong Kong - could be better developed for a non-Chinese audience with a foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Biehn was used as an observer or an Interpol coordinator or a deep-coverage agent who needs to get some splaining every five or ten minutes, it would be great. But no, he was brought up as part of a special group of criminals with special powers who seemed to be freelance with their own corrupt deals, in the middle of someone else's completely corrupt negotiations involving the local king of corrupt deals. <br /> <br /> Yes, I said there. Confused? I also. "Welcome to the party, buddy." In the truly superb crime drama in Hong Kong, known as the Breaking News, there are also many fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad boys and good cops. In this wretched and exaggerated violent return to the world of a triad or gang in Hong Kong, the hot-shot police force seems to be nothing more than a show of ducks in a shooting gallery as criminals jump down. <br /> <br /> So it's not surprising that the scene is almost incomprehensible (several scenes, in fact) where kids try to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game, winning animal wins. And so the hot-shot volunteer police officer will naturally intervene in their name so the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls. There is also an elusive attempt to create a "love interest" between one of the "visiting policemen" and the only woman "visiting policeman". Visiting officers should be witnesses against the gangster triad leader, who has taken his way to his but not his own team, but mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q and some others). These murderers all need something, but we can not find out what it is until the very end of the movie! It was a silly mistake inside the story. You can not build tensions in a crime drama without anything you could get, get up or get away from what you introduced yesterday. /> <br /> Add some "scenes" that are made purely by artistic effects that show the recent past of bad and bad people and all movie fans can easily understand why this barking dog gets 1 rating from this fan of all the movie things with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
