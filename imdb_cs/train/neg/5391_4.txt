I really hate most of the end of world movies. They show what the Hollywood folly people think of the rest of the world, and they clearly think we have a lot of sadistic idiots (or at least the fact that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow fun). I have been in LA many times, I have a showbusiness family, and I just want to say that these are the last people to look for real control. Some disaster films at least portray a clever picture: Children of men, 12 monkeys, but usually it's the message, "People will do anything to survive, everything is dark and sad and useless, we should all be ashamed of each other." /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the idea of ​​a story that examines the discarding of the social order system and testing the sadness of the people in the face of horror, and I believe that some people will behave like this film of portrayed but sadistic idiots aside, I seriously doubt that society simply dissolves into every man for himself, it is simply insulting.
