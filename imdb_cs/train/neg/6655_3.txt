The only redeemed quality of this oversized melodrama is the landscape of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri, who sings the theatrical song. Stephanie Powers is miskast and betrayed by a false accent. As has been pointed out, she is too old to play an eighteen-year-old and looks too young as a grandmother with a college grandson? Lee Remick is good, though she is also aged in her later years. Equipped by talented Joanna Lumley, she will also be looking forever young when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries grandmother Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's uninterrupted arrogance asks you what these women have seen in him. Do not you know how a viewer can relate to his over-view? The most trusted performance is given by Ian Richardson, who looks the rest of the cast as an amateur rank. It raises the credibility that the handsome male suitors in this epic will always remain united while patiently waiting for the subject of their affections to finally agree to their acceptance. Can anyone believe that the handsome Robert Urich will remain the only one for decades and is waiting for Stephanie Powers finally to accept his endless marriage proposals? The conclusion of WW2 between the Wehrmacht and the marquis is ridiculous. First, the Germans did not include the Provence section in France until the end of the war, controlled by the French puppet government Vichy. Can we see the French resistance, which drove the daylight in Mistral's villa to steal leaves, all of which are waiting under the bridge for a truckload of Nazi troops to surprise them and destroy them? If you want to see a well-performing mini-series in a foreign country, do not watch Mistral's daughter. A much better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
