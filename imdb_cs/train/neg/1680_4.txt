Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland does not provide any sense of depth for this film. He barely tracks the incidents that occurred in June 1981 at night. Kilmer is just going through suggestions, as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are hoping to disappear in the other two major roles; such as Holmes' wife and her adulterous girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it is impossible to get any size from them. The film also stars Carrey Fisher, Ted Levine, Frank G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott, and Paris Hilton portraits.
