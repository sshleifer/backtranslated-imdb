This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first was Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict, or any other important detail required to display the story. This film is essentially just another eloquent reason for Toby Keith to show his manly side and "the hard man who really is." All my time I've lost my time watching this movie. The best part would have to be final credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have separated my fingers and thrown them on the producers. The one who in the right mind gave Toby Keith a chance to play in a feature film is clearly on the same level as he. Finally, do not waste time watching this movie, it might be the only thing you regret.
