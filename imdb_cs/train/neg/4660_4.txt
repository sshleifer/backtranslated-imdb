At first glance it gives the impression that it will be a ridiculous blaxploitation movement and contains moments when it will be in this direction. However, the basic story is much stronger than expected, and it is a remarkable effort to portray racial questions in the Second World War. Recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and unused Billy Deem Williams, who is the best winner. But Stephen Boyd stops only by turning his tough mustache into a tough star. The apparently low budget leads to inconsistencies in production values. Location is great, the effects and actions are weak. Imagine if "Saving Private Ryan" consisted of half of the platoon killed exactly in the same way as Caparzo Vin Diesel (except to see the shot because they can not handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns Jeep and fired five Germans to the climax. Yet there is a disruption, with heroic soldiers who have not earned any respect for their success because they are black and Boyd's racist captain is the result, is convincing, as is the Turman character sequence written in the magazine about his ideas, the soldiers had the opportunity to fight instead to excavate latrines. In short, the "Black Brigade / Carter Army" did not take place. But it is a serious failure, not a bad joke. It could be overturned as a very good film and it is an interesting effort at its stage.
