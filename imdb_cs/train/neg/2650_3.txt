When I sat down this television average, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this waste? The film uses insignificant, conceived lines of plot that bring garbage to thousands of households. The film captures the political agenda to a new level. The film was insignificant, and all validity was lost due to excessive use of the stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton was trying to make this film useful, but in the end he must remember the age of the old legend that you can not regret the turd. I hope you have not lost your New Year to watch another soulless movie for television. Now we know why on Sunday evening we started to send out nets to get rid of garbage!
