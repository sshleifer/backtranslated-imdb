Dinosaur films can be fun. Also, films by Whoopi Goldberg. But Whoopi And Dinosaurs? After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex" I came to one conclusion: this movie is evil. Evil, shameful, malicious, and disgraceful to his audience. Nothing wrong is right; it is the visual equivalent of the torture chamber. First of all, Whoopi does not do good action movies (watch "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but movie makers do not know care - it's a hard cop here. <br /> <br /> Did you see a million cops this week? Well, here's number one million and one, buddy. He does not like the cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs ever since the Spielbergev show of them liked them? Is it one of those people who hate car rides, shots, clumsy dialogue, boring futuristic FX and the vision of talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax depreciation? Large tax depreciation? You are reading this review until the end. OPEN the sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No star, not one. And if they really do the sequel to "Theodore Rex," Hollywood deserves to attack a whole herd of wise cracks from foam rubber dinosaurs. Now I would pay for it.
