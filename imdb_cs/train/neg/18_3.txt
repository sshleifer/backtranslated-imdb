It is an artistic film that was produced either in 1969 or in 1972 (National Film Protection Foundation, 1969, and IMDb, 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely seems to be very indicative of this general time period - with some cameras and pop art styles that are the clean ends of the 60th-early 70s. The film consists of three simple images that are distorted by various weird tricks cameras. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. This was probably intended almost as a form of artistic art, and like most performances, it is interesting at first glance, but it quickly becomes tedious. The film, which is still deeply boring, is totally boring and does not care about anyone, but maybe about those who film, family and friends, and maybe just a few people just too pampered and "with him" to be understood by mortals.
