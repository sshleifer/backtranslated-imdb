The film begins with a promise, but it lasts too long in the septic world of remoteness and theft. We stayed hanged, but with nothing else caught the frosty shots of the graves and the thoughtful male faces that boasted. We certainly do not start the wall to help us climb. It's a pity because the concept is not insignificant. We remained wondering why the loving couple - father and son no less - should be so alienated from the real world that their own world is more suitable when it is claustrophobic beyond imagination. This loss of presence in the real world is more obvious and unnecessarily contrasted with the son who joined the armed forces. Why not a circus, so can we at least appreciate some color? We stayed with a nasty sense of loss, but unfortunately there is no enlightenment that is charming because of the movie, probably some form of achievement that nobody is available to us.
