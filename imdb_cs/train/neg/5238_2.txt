I do not understand positive comments about this movie. It's cheap and unhappy at all levels and I do not understand how it ever happened. <br /> <br /> The cartoon character is abundant - Sue's dirty, alcoholic, plain, Irish father is a good example. None of the characters are remarkably sympathetic - except for shortly for Sue's Asian friend, but they even prove to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately uninteresting as they are both, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue would fall into a perfectly creeping performance like Bob, but as they do, why should I expect to take care of what will they happen to them? So many reviews constantly highlight how realistic it is. If that's true, it's a sad reflection on society, but no reason to make it to the film. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie at all.
