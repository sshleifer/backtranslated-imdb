The last of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan's films and also a good thing, because it is perhaps the worst of the 12 films he shot for 16 years. No Mermaid appears here as a beautiful island woman who tries to escape the links of her people who worship God and try to force her to become his bride. Finds Tarzan and Jane trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially dirty Supreme Priest but is not fully accustomed. Also handy and worthy of mention is an extremely unpleasant guitarist / singer, who walks into the song at any moment. Even "great" Robert Florey can not help this. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
