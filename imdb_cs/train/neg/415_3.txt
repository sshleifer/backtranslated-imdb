Let Paul have a "sex on the brain" of Verhoeven to come up with an absurdly dirty and juvenile version of the UNDERSTANDING MAN. If he directed the movie Pok√©mon, I'm sure it would turn into a massive orgy. I do not mind sex or even worry (look at my other reviews) on the film, but frankly, it's obvious that the director has one footprint of mind and could not see interesting aspects about the invisible story of a man than the kinky that comes with him. It's a shame because it could be good if the movie did not take so much time to have an invisible Kevin Bacon's wife. <br /> <br /> The cast of the actors does what it can with a clear cheese script, but for some of them I've felt bad, including William Devane, who is unnecessarily lost here. <br /> <br /> But what can I expect from director SHOWGIRLS, which is much more fun than this dive and bad movie.
