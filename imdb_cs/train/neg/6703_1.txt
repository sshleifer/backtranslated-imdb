I noticed that this film has suffered a great deal of insults. He probably earned some of them, but it was not that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I hate this movie, trying to tell the story. As a drama, this movie could work very well. I just think the filmmakers were judging the way they got when they did it (they should add more fun pieces if they wanted it to be a comedy). With transcription it could be a great movie. But as satire did not work in its present form - many scenes did not correspond to the conspiracy context: for example, the robbery scene has little significance in the story. Still it was not the worst independent film ever made - is it the Top 10 worst? That's questionable.
