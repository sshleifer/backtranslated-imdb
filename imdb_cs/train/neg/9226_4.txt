Okay, the movie festival crowd probably loved it. But your average popcorn, who bought ten or fifteen dollars, is worth seeing the movie these days, he'll probably wonder why he made this choice. If it's "Copolla", it's automatically a great thing, is not it? Poorly! It's a pure spoof of the movie. But it's terribly "in." I'm afraid film makers are more interested in entertainment than the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curiosity and laughs or two. But as soon as it runs in movies and on television, dust starts to grow on film cans and tape cassettes that hold it. Hardly epochal or epic!
