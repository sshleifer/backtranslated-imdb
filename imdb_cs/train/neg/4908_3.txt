This movie is to be held in and around Seattle. Why is Porteau Cove Park P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L displayed? Provincial Parks are in Canada and not in the US. The inspector uses the Palm Pilot complete with a stylus to "read" that someone has entered the department store computer. I did not know it was possible with a database storage device. A woman appears in the film without any introduction and never introduced. We learn in the film that this woman is working in the District Attorney's office. Then, in the correction center, the policeman actually gives Jenks the door and keeps his back at the perpetrator! This would NEVER happen in true correctional settings. The director has really gone wrong - it will not happen in real life. The act is adequate. The plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, many errors found in continuity lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
