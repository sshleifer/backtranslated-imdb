I chased this movie from the library (it's hard to find for good reason) purely out of curiosity. I'm a huge fan of Plath and this film was a complete disappointment. Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is terrible, not because he's getting rid of the original novel, but because he's going crazy without a focus or intent. Scenes are poorly built and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What is the hockey voice over Plato's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is totally unbelievable because Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old) partly because of the casting (she was 32 during filming, Plath was at the time she happened) and partly because she could not act. Hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. The direction is average; the director simply covers what's in there, which is not much. The only reason I'm giving a movie 1 is that 0 is not an option. Sorry Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to tailor your job to something better.
