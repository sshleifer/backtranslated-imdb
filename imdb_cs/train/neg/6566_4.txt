I watched this movie after I had so much trouble downloading it through rapidshare. And I must say he does not deserve it. Parinda was so exalted that I was really looking forward to seeing her. Parinda is one of those films that do not meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers even though they have a great story. It was even more nice to know that the story itself was not original, but it was loosely based on the classical "Na nábřeží". Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he came from America. Direction has not been good quality many times, except for several scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this scenario to some of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deep Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I'm 100 Sure, he'll make a movie. "I'm not saying that Parinda was bad, it just was not good enough.
