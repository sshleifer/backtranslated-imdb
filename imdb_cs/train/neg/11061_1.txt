Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not borrow it, I bought it! Most worrying is that it is not so worrying. For reasons that are known to them, the producers of this film went to showcase the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the term "lickin 'good"! And with all the flashes and flashes I had trouble with the story. The whole performance of Jeremy Renner was not too bad. You can catch him in "S.W.A.T." in which a disgruntled ex-cop is playing. Anyway, I would rate it as 1/10. He gained only 1 due to Renner's so-called performance. There are plenty of books and television documents that can better cover Dahmer's crimes. Avoid it.
