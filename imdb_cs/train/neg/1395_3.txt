You know you have a problem when your watch has many alternative titles. Generally this means that they have tried and repeatedly covered turkeys in different markets. Such a turkey is a brain machine that has seven different titles. It's about a super secret government project that expects to be able to use a computer to read people but instead drives people to kill each other or themselves or something. It's full of B-level actors sitting in a paneled room with chairs on the lawn and trying to act like a script that makes little sense. Its a step of all sorts. Avoid it.
