I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit it was not my cup of tea. Though it is supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. But when I watched it, I thought ... "This movie does not make any sense ..." Where did the guy come from the dark coat? Where were the two guys when they left the girls behind? Where did the shark come from? All of these elements have not been explained in this movie. I felt as if these filmmakers had spent so much time and money on a movie that was so obligated to be so stupid. In my time I've seen many good horror films, but it's one of the worst horror movements I've ever seen. At the end of the movie, I thought I would not have looked at it again. So many pappy shows in this movie, I decided to put my thumbs down! Wait for me! 0 of 10!
