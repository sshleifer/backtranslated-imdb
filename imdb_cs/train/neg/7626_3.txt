After hearing about this movie for several years, I decided to borrow it and give it to me. Let me start by saying that I'm glad that the rental was not in the local library. This step was slow, boring, unrealistic and conspicuous. After two hours, I was ready to go to the city where she was looking out of Texas, and put a set of characters out of their misery. I realize the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all the hype I heard about this movie. Dallas has provided a good detail of life in Texas like this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how film studios can pay enough money for reviewers to convince the general public that the bad film is good.
