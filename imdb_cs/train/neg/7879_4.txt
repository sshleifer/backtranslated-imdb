First I have to say I loved the Animal Farm book. I read it with my 9th grade and it was great. We've also decided that watching the movie will be beneficial. The film was so disappointing to me. The movie turns off some characters and lacks many of the book's main points. It's a lot of jumps and nothing explains in detail. If anyone watched this movie without reading the book for the first time, they would be confused. The most disappointed thing in this movie for me was the end. The end of the book was the strongest and the movie changed it! It was to be the pigs and the men in the alliance and the kind of "melting" together, but instead the film looked like animals that would revolt against the pigs. To summarize, I do not think that this film captured the real meaning Orwell described in his book.
