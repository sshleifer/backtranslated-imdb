A relentless attempt to bring Elvis Presley to this day, but despite the sexy little shower scene and sub-plot of the pseudo-Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by the same old carol and winks clich√©. The woman selects E.P. up on the beach and then continues to take over your life - and does not seem to matter to him! Dick Sargent is exhausted in the side lane, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Hard to test Elvis's two bosses (the moonlight, you see). Some songs are pretty good, especially "almost in love", but if you want to see a looser, swing, updated Elvis sexual comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his fatal attraction get into the bed together, there is a wooden board between them! Remember. ** z ****
