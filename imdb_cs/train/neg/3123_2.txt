I felt it was watching ... but it seems that this is the reason why fools in the family are taking place in this movie. It does not make sense, as the others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films, and that's just his presence on the screen, which gives him credibility at all. It is sad that all the great legends of horror films in the audio era were eventually reduced to playing in low levels of waste. Marginally, Boris dropped a bit better than the poor old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> moment. In addition to Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is dubbed in some strange, sharp, English monotone that reminds of the type used in pornofilms of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I think it's Edgar Alle Poe's "House of Usher," that it's taken over, but in the finished article you would be hard pressed to find a lot of Poe. <br /> <br /> But there are much better movies with Boris Karloff at his best, look for them and make it a wide berth if you do not want the curse of a "shrinking brain"!
