My life is about saving animals. I voluntarily work with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal or sustain my life. I can not even kill a spider, I put it out. The scene in which babies throw stones on a bird until they die, when they are soon participating in an attempt to accept the other children, suffered from me, and since then persecuted me. It simply convinces me that human beings are pleased with the need to accept. The end - foster parents accept earlier - does not buy the display of cruelty to animals. Why would anyone want their child to see this movie?
