This movie was a strange watching experience. The film is apparently based on the game. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works well in the game, but in the movie it's just not really interesting to watch. The film is too "fictitious" and did not even bother to change some dialogues to better adapt to the film. Instead of what is now being presented, it is almost literally re-shooting the scenic game, with supernatural characters and a proper dialogue. For this reason, the story does not really work, and the film becomes almost complete blast and obsolete watching experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a while to find out that it's a comedy you're watching. At first, you think it's the track you are watching, with prominent characters, but as the film progresses, you will notice that the film is a tragicomedy that relies on a comedy genre rather than a dramatic genre. br /> <br /> Characters and dialogue are really things that make this movie awesome and beyond the one that sometimes really becomes inconsistent. Sure, actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but do not really raise the film to the level "pretty observable". The story feels totally disoriented. In essence, the story is about nothing and mainly focuses mainly on the fraternal and sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is that story even? The film feels like a nonsensical and outdated movie that has little. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on the stage, but as a movie it's really inappropriate and it just does not work. Editing is simply terrible and times, and it even becomes laughing bad in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> More was expected from director J. Lee Thompson, who apparently did much better films than this still-unsuccessful, scenic translation transferred to the screen, the project. worth it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
