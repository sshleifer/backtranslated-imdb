Well, let me say that I've always been a Steven fan and his movies are usually great, but it just does not change the rest. This is very stupid in my opinion that I did not like it. The biggest reason I do not like it is that it is very bad and it does not make much sense to me. The acting is very bad, and Steven Seagal does not do good acting, the rest of the actors I see because they are just heading to the movies. It does not suffer from direct action, everything is happening at once, so why does not it make much sense. Ther is hardly any action in it and at all, to make the action movie good, you usually need action in it. Special effects are very bad and you can say they are fake. So in all of this everything has on seagals the worst movie of all, so if you want to see Steven Seagal movie do not lend this one just pretend it does not exist. Just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Total score: ** from ********** <br /> <br /> * from *****
