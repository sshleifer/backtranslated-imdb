I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage, and I never thought he'd work on such a movie. I could not believe the other reviews and I thought it should not be bad to watch it at least once ... but believe me, it is. Stroyнародвайте. but why would they want to make a movie like this? A very basic idea of ​​a good horror film is either to have an extremely intelligent script or to be extremely graphic. This film does not fit into any of them and simply stays dumb. I was just watching the movie and hoping to become interesting at some point, but it's never. <br /> <br /> So this movie is great, not for fans of horror films as well as for Cage fans. You could probably be on TV.
