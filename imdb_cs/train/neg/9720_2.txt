This movie is just boring. He's trying to copy some of the effects borrowed by a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain," but it's too much. Dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I've never proved him too convincing), his father plays very badly, the story is stupid, the end is stupid. I think I do not like the movie from "le pacte des loups" by Christophe Gans (and I'm looking at 80-100 movies a year), but at least the film had some action and a bunch of good actors. I've never tagged myself here (just rated), and when I saw ratings and comments, I thought I had to write something down. <br /> <br /> I think we will not have trouble selling the DVD we were offered: it's not such a bad movie in our (big) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I'm open minded (watching SF, western, drama, comedy, silence, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this movie was so boring that I had the feeling I had lost an hour and half.
