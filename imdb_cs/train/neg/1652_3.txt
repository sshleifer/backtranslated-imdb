I will be blunt and point. This movie is not good at all. The film part of me hated acting, script, story, direction and almost all adjustments. Amanda Peet proved she could act because she was the high point of "The Whole Nine Yards." So you should avoid this ten-meter-long movie. However, the children's section considered me to be very entertaining. If you can forget how substandard the quality of production is, and if you like funny jokes, you should be fine. And for those of you who can not get out of your pedestal, that's your choice. My inner child has not died and I laughed. Even then, only 3 out of ten, because as a movie, it really smells.
