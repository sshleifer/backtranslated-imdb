The thing the viewer will remember is the poor headache the film gives them because of the overly crazy, restless camera work and quick, confusing cutting. I'm not against these stylish devices if they are made as Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their films, but in that case there was too much. It seems to have been the jumps and lightning glimpses that accompanied each time through the city of Mexico and every important scene was there to take you from the realization that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily find out how the whole thing is going to end. For a film that pretends to be violent, ruthless, and morally corrupt, it is inexcusable that the story is so many narratives and more depth and character development. This is another disappointed aspect of the film. If I want to see the top of the action movie, I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing of Denzel Washington's embarrassment, and he had failed to provide any credible performances. For the first half an hour or so, nothing will happen, except that stupid archetypes and clich√©s are displayed, and when the action engine starts, it is so quickly cut that you do not know what's going on. So, the film does not work at the level of an incredible drama / thriller, nor as a purely action movie. Of course, the film is not as bad as some of the totally disordered blasts of recent years, but I do not quite understand why so many people say this movie is something fresh and cool. The movie is too long for the movie and has too little film.
