I could not concentrate more on another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowski. Barney seems to be totally boring and non-inspirational "content". She can make eye candy (and I love candy), but his pretense and basic artistic emptiness just makes everyone happy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar (but really only on the surface) works by Jodorowski or even more linear filmmakers such as Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love the Odyssey 2001 and never been bored to the end of the scenes .. .). Such art as M.Barney's doing adds confusion and discourages viewers who might otherwise begin to appreciate an experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And check his interviews. I just do not buy it, sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I've never been bored to see Alejandro Jodorowski's films, while drawing Restraint 9 was a complete disappointment. Especially when she offered something to be something, actually, say something in a non-linear, unorthodox way (like a beginning and a great choreographic dance and preparations for the ship to ride off.) Boats "meet" at sea ... Ideas (if they were feces) pearl "divers ... Everything could build a big surreal film with some content, but it did not. On those terrible challenging scenes of dressing and fake tea ceremony ... How futile and fossil and philosophically demanding, but empty, can it get it? I have some great scenic scenes, but the whole movie has become so dull and pretentious and totally empty and fake, physically ill. <br /> <br /> And it does not have a good pace, I love slow pace movies but it was just boring in some scenes - because it was demanding and fake - so I was just forced to witness the prolonged scene of artistic vanity ... <br /> <br /> The kind of movies just kills the art and spirits in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowski !!!
