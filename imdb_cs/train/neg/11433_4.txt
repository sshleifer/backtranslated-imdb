The first half of this movie is pure pleasure. Novel. Funny. Wonderful performance. The close brother and sister living in Manhattan will fall for the same woman! Adult. Clear. Witty. What you might ask. As a romantic comedy, refreshment begins. It is located in an unexplored area. And then it collapses. It is based on the fact that it is a universal adult comedy about the approaching story of the coming of age that has been done many times. What a disappointment. As a popular film, it begins with such a promise. Why he must become such a pawn of the film, "I am the one I am." The frozen ending shot that Heather Graham jumped into the air to celebrate "his luck in finding himself" underlines the banality of the last part of the film. It could have been different. It could have been magical. Eventually the same old one ended.
