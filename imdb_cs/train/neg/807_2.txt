I did not expect much from this TV movie. You have to set the bar lower than you would if you had to have some TBS movie with Anthony Sabate Jr. He was still disappointed without being a good movie. as if someone had cut out and put scenes from a dozen films and television programs dealing with big business conspiracies into the script, he leaned back and said, "My job is done." It's all clich√©s, all predictable, and even worse, actors are forced to look as if they take it seriously (even if the plot is ridiculous). Make a favor. Check out "X Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They can do better. Also, let someone know that sitting over "Fatal Error" is just that.
