IMMORTALIZER was interesting. She certainly did not kill me in an hour and a half, but it did not really work. A group of children is carried in the muscle mutant astra (in the scene representing the least convincing cinematographic sound effect) and taken to a decorative house in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team perform brain transplants for their rich old patients so they can have a young body again. Hey, it was quietly remake with a big budget a few years later like FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplanted an old man's brain into another body, will his new voice sound the same as his old voice? With all these talk about pineal glands and the use of glowing green serum, you can almost see the vision of the wild BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR that dance in the producers' heads. But production literally has no courage to pull it off. I have never understood why when someone makes a low-budget horror movie that they do not kill him on the edge of the gore frame. It performs equally awfully, the only good performance comes from Clarke Lindsley as Assistant Dr. Price. He has a beautiful evil of laughter. The only thing IMMORTALIZER realizes is that he has a lot of old people who make their own pieces. Seriously, most casts have serious wounds for old people.
