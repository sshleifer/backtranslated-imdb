I have to say that this is the worst movie priyadarshan (released along with much better cyonki, who was also his director), does not contain any particular story and focuses only on discovering the body by debuting actresses and some stupid comedic sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too repetitive in his comedy flicks, just as govinda and David dhavan did in the past after giving some good entertainers but they also lost their audience. So it will be good for him to concentrate more on the scenario and try some variations of his direction. Please more herapheri and malamal weekly rather than duds duds like garam masala!
