If this series were to be better than Batman - The Animated Series, I, for one, think it was terribly wrong. This character is miserable ... (Catwoman looks terribly terrible ...) But what really annoyed me was that he looked like a bastard from Batman who could not only help himself in the battle alone, even three adjacent ones. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comics, I know Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be but Batman's allies except Robin, but still ... to make that Batman says he needs help from them ... What, can not he get a couple of blows? In BTAS he could easily face ten opponents ... Obstaral? Come on ... One more thing: I really do not think Batman would allow children like Tim Drake to get into the battle soon without having to go through years of hard training. One is irresponsible (and Batman is everything but irresponsible) and two, it's not what happened in a comic book if we want to remain faithful to them. Batman - The Animated Series makes history, with its animations, stories and characters ... It really was a legend about Batman. The New Adventures series transformed the legend into another glimpse of Batman.
