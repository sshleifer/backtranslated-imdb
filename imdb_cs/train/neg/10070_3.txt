Roy Rogers plays as Jesse James and his looking player Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is former Mr. Rogers, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a remarkable team like two reporters looking for stories about an elusive hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, mistaken identity / impersonation is a conspiracy Rogers publishes a "double role". Rogers is charming as usual; but it's nothing to beat his usual performance - any potential to achieve the unforgettable performance of Jekyll / Hyde is going wrong. Better couples to watch are Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye as reporters from St. Louis Journal - it's just a movie. Tracks are all right, though badly synchronized. <br /> <br /> Jesse James in the Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
