What begins as a fairly clever farce of a somewhat shadowy security monitoring company almost instantly turns into the uninteresting and utterly unpleasant mystery of murder. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying to make this train visible, but some things are simply not human. What, for example, will Gale suddenly change from a sweet maternal figure to a drunken bitch at Tommy's parental home? Why would Heinrich, though he certainly have a slegebag, want to destroy the business he devoted his life to, robbing and possibly murdering his customers? Why does the seemingly rational Tommy believe that Heinrich can be a killer (based almost exclusively on a dream), and if it was plausible why would not he go to the police? And why did Gale not activate the alarm when she came home, especially after Howie had been crying out? Of course, all these events are necessary for conspiracy (and I use the term very, very freely) to develop. And that could be beneficial if it resulted in even the smallest comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his rape, to the poor identification of Gale, to the last "joke" that Gale and Howie are still dead, is much smarter and more unclear than anything else. I checked that my notes contained "spoilers", but nothing else I or anyone else could do to ruin the thing that is already doing in the high sky.
