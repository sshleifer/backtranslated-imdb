The earlier part of the film was rather pleasant, but eventually it became a tritem. Although Turturro is an actor I love, his Luzhin often reminded of a bad breath of masculine impression, and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-automatic man was unpleasant. Overall, it seems that this film is trying hard and eventually looks pompous despite mostly subtle performances.
