As I said, the book was pretty good, and it could be a good movie if Melissa Gilbert was not so horrible and incredible in leadership. What kind of accent is it? It sounded like her horrible Russian accent in another movie I saw. Each time she opened her mouth, I pushed. It took 3 attempts before I could watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as a second lead. <br /> <br /> I really liked scenes on the beach. They added some much needed clarity to remember a depressing portrait of Melissa Gilberts. I think they could use San Francisco's views on their advantage. It seemed that night scenes were really SF, but I can be wrong. I do not remember the character in the book so depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of future films that require accent!
