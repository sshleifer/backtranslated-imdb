Make sure that if you rented a STDVD sequel to a forgotten gem of the 1980s and expected it to be better than the above, then you are an idiot. Wargames: The dead code connects to the long-running list of unnecessary sequels that have filled the DVD market so easily. Movies like this do not need spoilers because you already know them. <br /> <br /> "Little" for this movie is as follows: Nerd meets a girl; girl likes nerd; nerd loves the girl; Naturally, he gets involved in the Top Secret computer system; jerk and girl go to another country; a jerk and a girl eventually prosecute government actions in another country; nude and girl meet with some important old man who dies at the key point of the film; jerk and girl are captured; the computer of the top government is going crazy; nerd is hired to beat the top government computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer using the same old top computer from the first movie "Wargames"; nerd saves the day; the nerd is laid. <br /> <br /> Exit. The effects, scenario, effects, scores and cinematography are what you would expect - grade B. Some familiar faces are here, and if you are not a fan of Colm Feore, you should avoid this. He tells you that the movie will not make you crazy enough to see for yourself, so if you like a nice looking STDVD sequel, then you're home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick was too much associated with some "masterpiece" that he could not do that for five seconds. But can you blame him?
