*** Comments Containing Spoilers *** I barely held this show as a TV appointment when they began to poison the music under each scene when Don Epps was almost on fire when Diane Farr was very nasally apparently pregnant (but we did not have it to notice), and when Colby was a TRIPLE agent. But today in today's episode, David is imprisoned with paranoid and walnut employment, who is ALWAYS an amateur with a rifle, in an elevator, and ... CAN NOT REPEAL. A trained, experienced field agent who has been many times on the door and was experienced in hand-to-hand combat, HAS NOT JUST A JOB. Not when the walnut disappears, he looks away, lowers his head and closes his eyes; even when he looks at the fiber-optic cable that swung around the ceiling like a stripper on the pole for 20 seconds. Then came a scene that showed me that as much as I like learning from the modest, charming but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy partner / love Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent differently. Don gives David a "distress word" that is code for "S ** t going down"; David is ready, kills the lights, falls out of the elevator, surprises the work with the matrix and ...... David can not disconnect / kill / kill in handing over the tasks. The bad guy ends up with both weapons, David ends SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm done. I hope the NUMB3RS is fun.
