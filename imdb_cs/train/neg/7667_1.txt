The definition of abominations, as defined in Webster's dictatorship, is "the cause of resistance or disgust". If anyone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than Alone in the Dark, let me know because that's the best I can come up with. However, I do not feel that this word in any case describes how terrible this film is. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with my two roommates. One has very similar tastes, the other is an action / adventure guru. This guy mostly does not care about the size of the plot holes, if the film contains a lot of explosions, he'll be happy. <br /> <br /> It was said that we entered the theater for Friday's tour alone in the dark. To my surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why instantly. It starts with the worst initial scene of any movie and unfortunately I have to admit it is getting worse. The opening scene is 5 minute scroll text, which is narrated. Still, I understand why it was narrated. The director had to understand that only illiterate people even realized the idea of ​​the PLATB to see this movie. Not only is this first scene the longest scrolling text in cinema history, but it does not make sense. We seem to hear the complete separation of films in the same order. One is about ancient civilization and its manipulation with the portal, the other about the crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you read this and you are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then begins a terrible story, acting, effects and camera work. Tara Reid is terrible as an actress. Even for one second, he will not do anything to think he is the curator of a museum. Slater is simply wrong, he's not convincing, and he does not have Reid's chemistry. The story is probably the worst thing ever created. All alone and with roommates with similar taste ask questions like: What is it? And what's going on? In addition to this scraping garbage, we have several inscribed sequences from Slatera itself. They are good? NO. Explain something? NO. We have the slightest judgment as spectators at all times, why should we worry about what happens? Again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a scene with random sex. It is said to us that Slater and Reid are together, but they never act as if they care about him at all. But then BAM ... sexual scene. Again, I do not know. Okay, oh, I do not know, 30 seconds after this terrible scene ends, we have a head-to-head fight with 20 soldiers and a similar number of strangers. This is set on heavy metal tracks and causes more brain bleeding than if it were possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a scientist and there are "strange" things. At one point the scientist controls foreign things and stands on a hill, which he tells them to attack the military base. Why? How did he become the commander of these things? Why are they listening to him? Once again, I have no idea. The film ends with Slater and Reid in the city evacuated. Why was the city evacuated? Did strange things arise? Did the army tell them? Who knows ... and from this moment, who cares? I did not, and you will not. But to the summit, Slater and Reid are attacked by strange things. Although it has been said that foreign objects will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And that's true, you guessed it in the middle of today, and it's clear how it can be. Perhaps the extraterrestrial thing bought some sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care. Now, after the movie, I ran outside the theater, all six feet away from me, waving my hands and shaking my afro to tell everyone to look at this movie. Even my gung-action / adventurous roommate (who would consider a movie that had just carved and put 2 hours of explosion into one movie as the greatest thing ever made) admitted that hole holes were very noticeable in this film. <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST I will give it 0.0 / 10 and would put it lower if I could. <br /> <br /> Clearly the worst movie he ever did. I do not want this movie on my worst enemy.
