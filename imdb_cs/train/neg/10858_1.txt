I did not know if I'd laugh or cry to see this. Only dependent fans of dirt could have a taste for it. It's supposed to be a horror film, but it's just dirt. The most successful scene is a road accident with real special effects from the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at any cost. Just look at studying how bad a movie can be ................
