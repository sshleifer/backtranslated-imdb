It was the worst movie I've ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this film was meant to introduce new comedies to journalists, but all the movie was not credible. <br /> <br /> With all the shooting you would think the police would hit. Even the coin that was Sean's mistake was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is a mistake was not realistic. It seems that this film was quickly retracted. Bad work. Get a better writer. <br /> <br /> Counting to the end was not in sync with anything. It took longer. And what a coincidence if Billy threw Sean out of the balls. I can believe it once, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was fucking. It was so silly when Sean started out at the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
