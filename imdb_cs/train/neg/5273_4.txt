*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this movie, I thought it would be a little admirable story. But like most of the original superstation movies, I was disappointed. This mentally ill family ends up on this "deserted" city to take and find this video camera that shows that these people are doing everything they do and finds that they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious phases and never finds out or show up what the hell is searching for. There are more gaps than I can count on, and they do not explain anything that happens either how or what. It ends when the family gets into a car crash and gets a pose or brainwashing or something (which is never said). Another thing you know is that he hopes to find out how it all happened but ends up completely confused.
