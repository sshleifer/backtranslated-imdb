I rented this movie because I hoped it would be one family to enjoy. Although the film is family friendly, my family did not like it because it gives a false view of God. If you obey God and follow him, you have no guaranteed success. Your football team will not always win. You will not magically receive better marks. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get a raise. Sometimes you'll keep an old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to meet our daily whim. Rather, we were created to celebrate it. Sometimes we celebrate him the most when it seems we have seemed bad. Christ is alive; die is profit.
