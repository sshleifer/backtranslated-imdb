I would give this movie 1 out of 10 if it was not for ms. Performance by Claudio Barretta. and I'm overlooked this time that Kris Aquino is here. and the end. I really avoid watching Pinoy horror films because the stories lack originality, and I really think that some writers do not give enough attention to the characters (and their progress) in their stories (redundant?). it was as if the movie "moved" on when their narrative struck. and my goodness, creative exhaustion has led them to tear off other films. why?? why did this film have a good overview? I would not have done so much merit. the film was COLD, but the movie looked much more strange as it deals with Filipino folklore ... it goes to my list "most likely to happen" category. I just wanted to spend more time perfecting the stories and repairing the flash sequences, and it does not matter if the lighting was soaking, it would not matter if the contents were thrown away ... SAYANG.
