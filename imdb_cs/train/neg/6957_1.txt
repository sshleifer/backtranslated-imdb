Avoid this if you do not want to watch an expensive but badly shot movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - the cardinal sin in the French film. This movie is attempting to combine Western, drug intrigue and an ancient costume epic. What? Consider it. Cowboy music is cheerful when fighting the sword. Or how about a woman in lingerie, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? Someone should do "What is Tiger Lily" on this bomb. Override script, then overwrite or subtitle. Hell, it's almost right now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to the American audience, have roles.)
