** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, lacking a conspiracy, and basically just seeing the stars showing up. The most exciting scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi appeared in the shower and then we saw her TV playing on the PSYCHO scene. This movie really expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah has enough memory to remember where some images were shot and how much! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> At the end, the killer pours out his insides into Shabana Azmi long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah to escape and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BOHNY *** <br /> <br /> It's a bit funny (just a little) to hear the director and the cast members who offend each other and hear Shaban Azmi: "Oh sh-t! " <br /> <br /> Overall, the baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from ********** (2 of 10)
