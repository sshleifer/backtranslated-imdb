The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's well thought out. It was not. The next best thing is a supporting performance of an actor who plays Edvard, the always awesome Holly Taylor and the actor playing Taylor's husband. An actor who helps criticize Messing's potential outfits in the early stages, brings to life a wonderful, absurd yet winning quality. Okay, that's probably on the positive side. Dermot Mulroney, whom I admire, is much more credible expressing Messing's contempt than in any scene where he is trying to be either business or supportive. As others have said, he seems to have no emotional investment in this business than to pack it as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to make a film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. It's reasonable, but it's simply not a strong enough actress who would help without help. Give her "E" for the effort and "C +" to achieve. Because of Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that would help Messing would be a great cavalier of Irons-esquire performance from an actor who played her ex-fianc√©, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, arched and ruthless. If I tried to analyze it more, of course I would pay more attention than most of the people involved. It's pretty harmless for you to take time if you have nothing to do and less unpleasant (and less creative) than a wedding singer, but you were better off looking at "my best friend's wedding."
