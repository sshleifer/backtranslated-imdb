Wound!!! I got the movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed when I found out she had two short scenes at the end. Other than the fact that I basically pressed the fast forward button all the time. Some adolescents go on a trip to Romania with their father and get him bite by a wolf and turn into a werewolf if it's a full moon. He kills his father and his friends. About thirty years, but he does not grow old and enrolls at high school. There he meets a shy teacher who he finally bites and then has children with her. I sucked this movie and I do not recommend it to anyone. Read the place of war and peace. Only Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Take a look at the very young beagle Sageta in this!
