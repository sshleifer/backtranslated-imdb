Coyote Ugly could be much more effective if the filmmakers have done a guilty pleasure / exploitative movie (with lots of nudity.) But because the PG-13 is what all the studios want these days to end up with a movie like this: PG-13 "tease" a movie that is not allowed to go anywhere if the movie should go. The scenario is generic that it is easy to guess what plot point appears 15 minutes before it really happens. The game is adequate, but the characters are so thin that they can not do anything with them. There were also many points where it looked like I was looking at a music-video rather than a movie. The film's only assets are amazingly beautiful women's leads. We see them in some extremely tight and quite revealing suits ..... but just as much could be shown because of the PG-13 limitations. There's plenty of barking and toned, tough bodies that make some good choreographic dance figures, but there's no nudity or sex. Tyra Banks (she is still madly beautiful with age) is also in the film for a very small amount of time. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy for her eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows some real actor potential. The only people I've ever seen with this movie are pretty boys, they're not allowed to watch R rated movies. This audience could get a lot of it from a minor aspect, but adult audiences will feel irritated and cheated. Rating: film-1 female-10
