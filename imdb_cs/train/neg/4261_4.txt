Pathetic. That's what happens when a director comes to work just because someone pays him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great location and settings for epic film. But performance, damn it! I swear that in some shots you can look at the backdrop of the background looking at the camera or watching the actors because nobody told them what they should do when they hear "Action!". Battle scenes are so bad you're wondering - are these people really? They could do more damage just by hugging each other. In slow scenes, you can see that people on the battlefield walk or just stand, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only the foreground actions are highlighted. But what for? The story is so illogical and incoherent, it seems like a random situation in a chronological order, sometimes not. Dialogues are stupid, love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, at best, the ultimate result of all these enormous efforts is the glossy round laser disk in a thin shelf located on a shelf in a video rental shop.
