The film was so harmless that the creators were hoping to bring the classic movie noir a classic title, "Tell Me My Beloved," and think he would consider it a remake. The characters are so impeccable and inappropriate that they deserve a cold income when released for the first time. Time adds to that absurdity. He had no curvature, cinematography, despair, or despair of classical noir, but he relied on a complicated and meaningful criminal plot that would easily result in several arrests in a matter of hours. As if that was not enough, it went into a totally unscrupulous attempt at eroticism in which at least one of the participants did not bother to bathe in a few days. It just made this mess even more painful. Find good classic forty or fifty movie noir instead of losing two hours of this failure.
