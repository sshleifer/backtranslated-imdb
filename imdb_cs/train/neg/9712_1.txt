This film is one of the most wildly distorted views of history. Horribly inaccurate this film did nothing to honor hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved workers that sadistic Japanese were killed and tortured to death. The bridge should be built "over the bodies of a white man," as the leading Japanese engineer said. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors caused by Japanese rescuers are the source of a film where the bridge itself is not even accurate to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not of wood. What survivors are still alive? He hates the film and everything he has to represent. Their friends were hungry, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who have not died of dysentery, starvation or illness are deeply wounded by a film that makes such light from their dark times.
