Give me the money back! Give me your life back! Give me some credit. This movie was good to vomit. Unnecessary and time-consuming. What waste is energy and completely unnecessary. I understand the sound and the idea, but give us a break! Next time give me money and let me spend. Lost child, mother reproaches, blaming my husband! Clich√© yes ~! Get your life! I'm sorry, but this movie was a complete waste of my time, my money and my apartment. I'd rather cook eggs! No real explanation of why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious, but why? The act deserves What I do here Oscar and cinematography And I'm just doing it for wages? How much does this movie do? This stupid fool hired a copy. Enough was said
