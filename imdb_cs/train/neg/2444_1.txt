Two houses, one street, one telephone booth, one car, next to a girl, a boy next to each other and a zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great horror movie. All you need is some blue light, ambient music and ... done. But it's not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "bad movie evenings" from time to time. The concept is really simple: a bit of booze, a little friendly movies and immerse yourself in the worst cinema. For such an evening this dirt pitch is one of the best. Laughter is guaranteed! The bizarre thing is that van Rouveroy still defends his film as if it were a great success. To witness this, you have to listen to the DVD commentary. Again: disbelieving and laughing!
