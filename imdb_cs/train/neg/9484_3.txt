If I have to give this film a linear score, I have to give it a low score of 3/10. But it was fun and there are some good things to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> James Bishop's psychiatrist candidate is assigned to St. John's Hospital for his residents. Andrews is being evicted from him and he wants to "change the world". <br /> <br /> Beginning with a movie that you know the hospital is hiding the wrong truth, James thinks he can change and do not know this evil. The story builds pretty well, you know all the time that it's true what patients say about some evil crime and wondering when and how James will find out. Also, when the break comes, James is somehow hunted by evil, and you feel some tension until the "fight" is over. Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend who arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements and get an image. <br /> <br /> The character is really good, you see most people who are killed, some of them "you know". <br /> <br /> The film creates an unpleasant scene, which is quite good. There are secrets that are revealed - in an acceptable way. The main character, James is very credible - the story of an eager student starting to work is good in this environment. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - modern version "Plan 9 from space" - type bad (bad monster looks like red scarecrow) * Some bad gaming (or probably very little when shooting ) - The main characters sometimes work badly and sometimes good. * Sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> All the time I thought "I could make a movie in my home camcorder."
