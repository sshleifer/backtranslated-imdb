This is a 1974 German film that has something to do with some women who come to the castle and behind them, I can not really tell you their purpose or even what the film is about. I can tell you that there are several women who also have the moonlight as servants of this particular chateau who are passing by dressing body colors and dressing up as if they were at the Goth Kit-Kat Club, and it seems to be a good part of the runtime of this movie. Yeah, there seems to be something devoted to worshiping the devil and the vampire, and there's some girl on the girl's stuff, etc. But the main focus seems to be a painted little girl who moves in the basement. I rather liked the eye-rollover of one of the devil's main housewives / devotees who gave the authenticity to control and make it even more ominous. Was Wanda a bad lesbian (as charged in credits)? It does not matter. If you are not too picky when your lesbian devil worships movies, you may like it, otherwise it is pretty boring stuff and even I could not finish it, I was so boring. 3 out of 10.
