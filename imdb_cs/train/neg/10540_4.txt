Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is the disciple of Satan / serial killer who has the "first power": after being captured by detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, body on body and continuing the murder at will. With the help of the attractive psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, sister Melanie G.), she tries to stop Channing. This concept probably had some options, I think, but eventually "First Power" suffers from routine scripting and film making. It's nothing we've seen yet, sometimes better. There is nothing to distinguish this film from other supernatural horror thrillers. More to that, it is not very exciting and definitely not scary. Phillips is hard to sell as a hard-like-nail, cynical cop stereotype, and Griffith does not seem to be trying very hard; the best-occupied member is probably characteristic of Kober, doing everything to be absolutely scary. The climax is rather stupid and ends very weak. as the average film of its kind, because: <br /> <br /> 4/10
