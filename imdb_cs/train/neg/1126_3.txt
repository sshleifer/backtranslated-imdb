I chased the thought that it might be interesting, and it could be an interesting story, except what was said in such an uninteresting way. Hard to watch, weird adjustments, incoherent story, murmuring characters, all terribly boring time losses. I could not get into it and it did not matter what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm did not save this movie. If you do not need a cure for insomnia, I'll skip it. 3/10, and that's generous.
