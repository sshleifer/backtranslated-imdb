Carl Panzram lived an incredible life and dabbed his memoirs on paper, for he was the only person who had ever done anything to himself unselfish for him. The book "Panzram: The Jungle of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Longe, which came out in summer after Panzram's death, gives the historical context to the American first-class description of home escape to go west and be cowboy, caught, thrown in the boy's house, he got away and went to prison all the time and everywhere tortured and sodomized. When Panzram became enormous and powerful, he tried to avenge what had happened to him when he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and it did not matter what people raped, robbed or murdered because we were all just as worthless. <br /> <br /> This film casts slender James Woods like a thick throat, thief, nephew Carl Panzrama, who is "drunk" in the movie, too dramatically and emotionally, and has never mentioned the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does not even handle anything special about this world traveler and career prisoner (such as robbing former President Taft or being released from Oregon prison until his word returns). In short, I do not think Carl will be too happy.
