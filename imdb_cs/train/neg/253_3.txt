The premise of the movie has been explained, and if you've gotten so far, you do not have to pretend to be a film critic. With that I said my own opinion on the film is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some more (many). The movie seems to get a free pass because it's a Takashi movie and nothing Takashi does can be bad. This is the approach of high schools to the film. For the rest of us we will find and an hour and a half cry for no reason completely unpleasant (and yes, this is taken from the film), the pace of the film almost reaches the level of rigomortis and works ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If a Takashi fan is, you will see it no matter how you top your interests. It lacks any originality (see The Infinite Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of a conflict other than rather superficial. <br /> <br /> As emphasized, this is the first Miike movie was credited with co-writing, but that does not mean a lot, because not what we would hope Miike would personality would spill into the screen. All we get is some of Miike's pictures of the director of photography. The film had the potential to be something great. It is not difficult to get wild. But it seemed to me that this had hit the ground. My suggestion is if you just get into Miike, going with some standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then the film went into your works, such as Blue Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People in China.
