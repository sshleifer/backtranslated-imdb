I feel much less generous with this film than others in his film. The depictions of madmen in this century are always when they are so bizarre that they are a different kind. Their antiquities are so disgraceful that they are completely fictitious. Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or have a fascination with chickens. They are in what they are doing or being beaten. It's as if the script has said what I can do to do it, without feeling like madness or even mental illness. Take a look at the beautiful image of the man in "One over the Cuckoo's Nest" where the illnesses are credible and real. I used to work in a state psychiatric hospital. I did not see any of those boys. They are too smart and expect to be alive.
