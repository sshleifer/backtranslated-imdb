... but it must be the worst adaptation of Christmas Carol of all time. And it does some sort of doing what with different life endeavors. Do not get me wrong - I have nothing against Cichel Tyson. I like it very much in other roles (see, for example, Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes). The script, however, offers no choice but to chew the scenery. And chew to do it, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim, tied to Christmas goose. Give me a classic at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. Except for Scrooged, everyone else is just overwhelming to grasp the past, presence or future of the Spirit of Christmas.
