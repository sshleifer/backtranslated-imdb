This movie has to be the biggest pile of steam C * ^ p I have ever seen what more than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. I NEVER save this "film" and pray that they will never say about the sequel. When you think about it, you should know that the story lies in the fact that two men of garbage are trapped in the rescue of the earth. Films such as The Men in Black were torn and staggered to make this "comedy" happen, but they failed. Avoid this movie (save).
