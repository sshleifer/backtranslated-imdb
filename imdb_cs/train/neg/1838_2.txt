"Envy" is bad for many reasons. Yes, there are similar characters. It is not a problem. That is, they are dissimilar and we do not even care about them at all. The "Rose War" was an insurmountable figure, but because of the correct introduction we grew at least to be interested in their fate, while in "Envy" the introduction is thin, the characters are never believable and the plot only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I'm a fan of his work for most of the time. Stiller tried to make it straight for the video and now I see why. The film suggests that he be "best friends" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we put a footage that apparently shows that Stiller hates Black. I thought it would be a one-sided relationship (a la "The Cable Guy"), but it never means, Stiller instead insists he is his "best friend" and I felt confused when it seemed that he treats Black, "a slut." The movie is ridiculous, but it does not matter because it's supposed to be an exaggerated story of morality. Unfortunately, the message is lost in a mess. Walken gives good performance, but Black is off-key and uncomfortable (and I usually find it very fun). No, it's not a terrible movie, but I still can not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it - it's not one of the worst movies of all time, but it will certainly be much better. I wish Va-Poo-Rize existed - so we could have this movie disappear forever ...
