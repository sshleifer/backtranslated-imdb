All this desperate waste of film needs is Count Floyd, which appears every sixty seconds. Sometimes Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty got together on the set and could not get to five kilometers, about eight miles from a real movie. BOY is doing this thing suck. There is not one original line, idea, shot, or effect of a seamless startup sequence to get helplessly closed. Magic, ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - Boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. Big mistake - boring. If it's a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a documentary film. <br /> <br /> Really - every bad movie has its own explanation of its badness. Typically, these are introductory credits - "Written, Directed and Produced" by one guy. Or, at the very center of the event, there is some bizar without the talent that you know there is one and the only reason why Turkey has happened. Here you will not know until the last of the credits, when cooperation with the twelve sub-functions of the Canadian government is grateful. <br /> <br /> Right now, I'm looking at the MST Taking Animal from Yucca Flats to get out of her mouth. Ghod, what improvement.
