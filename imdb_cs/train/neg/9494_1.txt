The only thing that surprised me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire enormously. The conductors had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a moment I could believe there was something deeper than lust between them. The story just did not mean the truth. Add to the tense conversation, the stacks of stereotypes, and the incredibly slow conspiracy that basically does not lead anywhere, and you have a real glowing effect. Kay Lenz's naked scenes can be useful for those looking for some salacious fare, but otherwise it's a colossal waste of time. My thoughts as I watched the movie was that it would be better called "Cheesy."
