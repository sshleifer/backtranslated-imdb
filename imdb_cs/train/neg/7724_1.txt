When I saw all the negative reviews of this movie, I thought it might be another comic work that was not entirely right. I watched the first two scenes, listened to the general dialogue that Lungren admirably delivered, and all the others guess in oriental actors and I shot the movie so terribly it was funny. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one-liners begin to fly, the conspiracy breaks down, script writers begin to drink and the film exhausts that it's welcome because it will turn into the worst EVER action movie. <br /> <br /> Lungren overcomes his previous efforts in the "Punisher" category and others, as well as all Van Damme films, Seagal and Stallone's non-Rocky films. This movie has absolutely the worst acting (look at Tia Carrere's face when it's in laughter with any Dolph scene), with the worst dialogue at all (Brandon Lee's commentary on the little Dolph is the worst line in the movie) and the worst clothes in the movie (Dolph in full Japanese clothing). Picture of "Tango and Cash" with worse actors, meets with "Commando", meets "Friday 13th" (due to the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is very Jason Voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of the film. <br /> <br /> Good (as it is not terrible) performances go to the bad guy (who still seems to be constipated with all his performance) and Carrere (who in some way tells her 5 lines without losing her laugh). Brandon Lee is just where Lungren's helper is and he's doing a terrible job of doing it. A terrible, terrible movie. Do not be afraid and avoid it. But if you look at it, ask yourself why submarine shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. When talking about underwater shots, look at the scene with lame water and the worst battle scene has ended at all. This film has all versions of the bad scene for those who have a short attention and fill the flashes of nudity. <br /> <br /> A BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
