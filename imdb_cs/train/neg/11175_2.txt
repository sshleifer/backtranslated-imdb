If I'm enlightened, I really do not know what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but it's far from her. This film tells the story of New York's unnecessary story and its troubles. And that's basically everything. When this agent plays Pacino, we have to think it must be something important. But it's not hard to think how this movie is nonsensical and boring. One of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, is the second film of the year (the second one is "Simone"), which deserves the title "the most demanding and most useless film of the year". So what's going on, Al?
