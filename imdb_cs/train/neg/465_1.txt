When I was in the movie the next day, I went to Blonde and Blonder, but it seemed like it was a cute movie. Who knows? I think I'm sure most people hit Roma and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder might be another secret treasure that was released. But when I started watching her: Executive producer Pamela Anderson, I knew I was scary for someone. Not only that, but what was considered to be the pinnacle of heat: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards not to hit them, but in reality they do not age at all and play a role I think is more relevant to the women who should be in their 20 years, not 40 years. The story was simply bad and unpleasant. Dee and Dawn are your stupid stereotypical blondes, they really have no idea what's happening in the world, it's really really sad. But when the girls are confused with murderous murderers, the cops are in their story and actually call genius girls because of their attitudes of "ignorance is bliss". They're ready to make a hit on a guy, and they think it's just "I'll show him a good time," but the real killer is checked out and wants to kill the girls. > <br /> Denise and Pam just look very uncomfortable on the screen and almost the same way they read the script the day before. I know this was a stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid that it was inconclusive and was simply useless. Could I ever recommend it? Not for millions of years, girls are trying to preserve their status as "sex kittens", it's more like desperation, and Blonde and Blonder are the huge blond BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
