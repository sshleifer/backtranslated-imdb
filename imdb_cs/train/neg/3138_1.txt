I see how people wrote about how great this movie was. It was awful! This was a subgroup at best. It did a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the film seven times in theaters due to Leonard. Where the hell got the money? Anyway, I wanted to know more about Titanic; why she sank, what happened to many human minds; maybe a bit of plotting stuff. Does anyone realize that some people did not even get aboard the ship because a fire occurred on board even before it even flew? No, you do not because everything you see is a rich girl who falls for a poor boy and he is painting naked (did you do that dirty piece that at least revealed to you that the movie was stupid?). <br /> <br /> But I cried in one scene. Scene showing the water that was filled on the ship. It looked like water in the pool! I think this movie made all this money and could not even make ocean water really look? unbelievable ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh band played for a while the ship sank .. Just ridiculous. It was the worst film until Pearl Harbor went beyond the "Nothing To Do With Reality" section.
