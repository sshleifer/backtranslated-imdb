What a sad look at the creative creator he does when he exhausts hours of careers who are struggling with a bit of rotting a ship may be more appropriate. All production feels cheap and shabby and is not helped by a "big name" star, barely able to spit out a couple of rows that it gives in a credible way. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting over the material; they are clearly watching the clock. Exhale the scenes, get a check, go home and try to forget about it. It's not too badly written or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's totally anodized and shot in a very limited number of cramped files with a small number of add-ons. Stimulation is a bit bizarre; the disruptive, experimental, romantic partial conspiracy begins only after the start of the main event, making it a sense of insignificance. Maiden Voyage will score a few points for being competently scored and a fun game "in place kiwi bit parters"; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest in production is that this movie is probably their big break.
