This movie seems completely useless. There is no reason why something happens to happen as if it were written by a small child who was bored halfway and thinking "how can I pack it?". And what does Jared Harris and Christopher Walken mean? Did they do it for a bet? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not quite sure there is one that will be honest, but if it does not register there. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after falling down the stairs while rising like you. They go to the house with a very annoying little girl, meet Christopher Walken, who dug an old woman preserved in a peat bog. It brings her back to life for no other reason than she continues the story, and she shows her gratitude by instantly freezing it. It's been a little stupid since then. A few hours of my life I'd love back!
