They will never be a member of the club I should have, <br /> <br /> Especially this is. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is the only mother / stripper who is attacked by a female vampire and left for the dead. He starts to have a cruel shout and meets John Savage and seems to be wondering where he left Michael Cimin's phone number. Savage is also a vampire and wants to let Andreeff join his little vampire family, which consists of a British vamp, a blonde vamp, attacking Starr and green hair dwarfs (I do not do it) <br /> <br / > The family does not want Starr to try to kill Savage and Starr and Starr's kid. Someone forgot to tell John Savage that it was a drama. He spends most of the time on the screen by exposing more face tics than Hugh Grant on the jolt of Jolt Cola, and he reads all his lines as he does the Farrelly Brothers movie. Andreeff is trying to do most of the misspelled role, but the writer / director Ruben goes to clich√© vampires like Starr to eat his pet's hamster's son and buys a lot of raw meat to fought against the desire for blood. The child is also knocked a lot, because those who think that violence is being watched by children are really fun. The movie is extremely nasty, but not in the wilderness, over the upper path like Killer's <br /> <br /> language. " Here is a gore rough and never wronged, it just happens. <br /> <br /> It's just in the budget. Most R ratings take place on Andreeff collaborators who are embroiled in background conversational scenes. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampires! All vampires must destroy their prey here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> and dirty ride. Leave this club and shower <br /> <br /> you need it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, violence weapon, sexual violence, strong gore, severe nausea, nudity, sexual links, drug abuse and situations for adults. <br /> <br />
