Wisdom kills college students, can a new teacher stop madness? <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not care. With a subtitle like Splatter University, they gather that this film is simply not art. But worse than Splatter University does not even fit into fun garbage. Splatter U is so badly made - the story is breathless, the characters are thrown, and the whole film lacks any kind of imagination. Needless to say, there is no tension, no atmosphere or no fear. This disgust is not even courageous to throw some nakedness (for the least excitement of all). So all around this infinitely bad slash does not offer anything in the way of fun (or cheap laughter) and it just becomes a complete piece. The bottom of the barrels - even hardcore fans - will want to think twice before watching, let alone pay for this movie. <br /> <br /> BOMB of ****
