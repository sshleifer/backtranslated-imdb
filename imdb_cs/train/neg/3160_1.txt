You know you have trouble watching a comedy when there are only fun parts of the cast. It is a pity that parrots, Cat & Dog, were just in support and not the other way round, because the people in it were quite ubiquitous. If I was you, Paul, Eva, Jason, and Lindsay, I'd forget to behave and do something else, because you're all as fun as watching a small dry and terrible actor who boots. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the movie is one of the characters screaming, I'm not Gay, which is funny as if you were not, you can change your mind if you had to get together with three handsome, boring and dare to say very thin women they lead in the movie. The worst movie I've seen over the years and hopefully I never see so bad, even if I do not expect it.
