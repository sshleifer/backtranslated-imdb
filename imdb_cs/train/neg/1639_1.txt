"Whipped" has a length of 82 minutes. This review is 82 words long. Three neo-New York Lotharios, ruthless "crooks," end up with this woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This is about the story and the movie. Too sophomoric to be misogyny, temperamental and ridiculous, "Whipped" blends the philosophy of shock jocketer Tom Lykis with the fantasy letters of the Penthouse. Although technically competent, it is dated, grateful, poorly written, reasonable and obvious. People do not like this. People do not talk like this. Really.
