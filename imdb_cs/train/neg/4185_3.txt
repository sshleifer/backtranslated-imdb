I give this movie 3 because it's worse than cult films that deserve the right 2. Does it make sense? Well, it does not have to be. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, an incredibly idiotic conspiracy where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) are fighting the space race of carrot vampires. than this one? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthea with her beautiful Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise Brothers stopped accepting silly roles in silent movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside of many films, at this moment he was in 164 movies! It's true that rarely plays a big role, but still!
