It was a disappointed film. Because the material - army life is always good for laughs - and stars, this movie should be a laugh. It was a couple of smiles, at best. Steve Martin is much more fun than this, and Dan Ackroyd seems to have played a dramatic role where he could watch Robin Williams and one day win the Oscar.
