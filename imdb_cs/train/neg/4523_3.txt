When this film was released, one of the best film reviews of the capsules was: Sphinx Stinks. That's it, but in a charming way. Casting is stupid, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? There was not enough in Cairo, at least because this film was not filmed. But it's really fun to see how they try it. The performances range from mummies (sorry, obvious observation) to over the top, with very few stops between. Lesley-Anne Down's character looks as if she did not find Egypt without explaining her archaeological treasures. This is caused, at least in part, by some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be attended by every viewer of this film. I think films that include a curse or that draw on the basics of an esoteric theme like egyptology are ripe for stupid, rewritten dialogues. It does not disappoint, and convergence proves double whammy. The plot has one driving force of dramatic tension: Can it become stupid and less believable? The answer is usually YES. The location of the shots is beautiful and the designer is generally very good, the only consistent reminder that it was not a low-cost production. This and the fact that there are so many known faces that do the service in such unintentional good-bye. Cheap, no; cheese, yes.
