It was probably just my DVD, but I would not recommend anyone trying to watch this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to raise the volume on my TV to the highest possible level to hear about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some calls still remain audible. If you are from Scotland, you can have a chance, though thin. <br /> <br /> The human voices were drowned by almost all the surrounding sounds, including unpacking, stepping, and even blowing a cigarette. <br /> <br /> When the volume is turned on to a level where voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene turns into a loud environment like a disco. And that you get hurt by diving when the remote comes back. <br /> <br /> There is art and art, even in the area of ​​sound mixing. But this endeavor, in time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as atrocities. After half an hour, I surrendered without seeing anything else about redemption in the picture.
