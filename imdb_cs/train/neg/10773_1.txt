I just watched this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, it's one of those movies you're looking at just to see how worse it may be. Frankly, I do not know how much it can be. <br /> <br /> The characters are made up of one chrome stereo type and the other apparent attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say the smallest. <br /> <br /> I have seen some valuable turkeys in my times, but there is no reason to mention some of them because it is "Numero Uno". Let me put you this way, watching the movie Vanilla Ice because it was so bad that it was funny. This ... this ... is not that good either.
