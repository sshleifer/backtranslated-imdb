My husband rented it from a video rental shop and thought it was a tension. (She never reads a synopsis). Well, it would be weird if the thing was observable. It just is not. The same thing again and again, no intrigues and where did you find the manager? The lead man, Michael Des Barres, is not even good looking, especially for the role he gives him. Also, sexual harassment at work is something if you want to see, rent Michael Crichton's "disclosure". At least Michael Douglas looked good at the beginning of the nineties. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, which is usually observable, plays a tricky scene here. There are also light effects cheaper than your home webcam. Do not waste time renting it. 0/10.
