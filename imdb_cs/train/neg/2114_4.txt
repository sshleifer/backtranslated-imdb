Just look at the files, stagger and edit it easy to say that this project lacked the right budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi has such a thing. The young brides fell dead on the altar after saying "I am doing". Their bodies were stolen by the renowned gardener Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a few of his monster assistants because his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs the gore fluids injections of young virgins to stay forever young ... forever beautiful. Eager reporter local cub (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride had the same rare orchid on the altar; orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be the most knowledgeable. It's a typical storm story about horror movies that a visit to Lorenzo's manor is a little scary; especially with the dwarf and the grumbling hump in the campus. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
