It seems to be a stunning response to this film, however, no one with the criticism of his methodology, which is very wrong. It simply continues to promote journalistic style analysis, which consists in the lack of knowledge and prejudices of audiences, to cause emotional disruption and the explosion of negative passages. Journalism 101: Tell the viewer, and only to predict them to draw conclusions that are predictable. For example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc., was supposedly an unexpected response to the collapse of government infrastructure after Hussein's demise: were these symptoms not at all indicative of an already abandoned culture? doctrinal disorder as the symptoms of these veins of Islam itself, rather than the failure of police force to limit itself and ensure it? Would the US rather declare Marshall's right? I'm sure papers could explode with allegations of a police state and fascist force. In addition to the analytic idiot of the film, it takes a few side-by-side and others leave the claim "so-and-so refused to be interviewed ..." yet the questions they would ask are undoubtedly already answered by the hundreds of inquisitions they have already received. you, as vice president, would have recognized that you would be a writer / producer for the first time, who would have already thought you would have curtailed your words. they could not shake the Condi tape in order to actually show her opinion and answer some questions logistics, maybe they had never met. This is far from a neutral point of view on the ground there. it is another biased and asian approach to journalists who are generally unthinkable herds. Anyone who wants to comment on the war should at least base their thoughts on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN's commentary. these interpretations cover the same vitriol, which simply creates another bipartisanism of those who want to think, and those who want the media to communicate what they think.
