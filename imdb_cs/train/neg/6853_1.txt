Another adorable grade Z accelerates the fruitful Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch space policeman, similar to Clint Eastwood, pursues a nasty flying head on Earth (!) And engages in a gang war in the southern Bronx! Mercifully short, but damn boring, with the most reassuring effects of a 50-year-old woman's attack. They should also shoot for continuity: Note how Thomerson's sunglasses disappear and appear in every other shot. It's ridiculously bad, but that's why we're watching these movies, right? Sequel'Dollman Vs. Demonic toys are reported to be even worse if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (****) <br /> <br />
