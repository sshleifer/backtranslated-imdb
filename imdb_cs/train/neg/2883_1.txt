This movie is so terrible. It is so bad that I can not carry anything other than a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes are done correctly. Lots of slaughter records. Strange cuts and edits. No continuity of conspiracy. Acting is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. This film bomb was clearly set to make some money regardless of the accuracy of the content. Working with the camera is sometimes unmoved and always restless. It looks like it was shot on a video. In fact, now that they get Dennis Rader to life in prison, I wish the guys who shot that horrible film into jail. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think about looking at it. I would give a negative star if I could.
