that's a piece with - t! it looks worse than at t.v. film. and I'm closing to think that the sequel was completed and the results ... the war is prettier than this. jean claude van shame did it again and wonders why his career is right now. no script, no story, no time should be unnecessary for it. I'm serious. 1 out of 10 is too high, too high. goldberg should be damned for this purpose. van shame is no actor.
