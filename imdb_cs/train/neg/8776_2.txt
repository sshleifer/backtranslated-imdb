Michael Keaton has never really been a good actor; in Tim Burton's films, Batman always falls into the shadows of his great villains. Here to play as a widow who collects radio frequencies that look like dead people trying to get in touch with the living ... Well, this should be quite a shocking thriller, but it really is missing around every place where you are shocked. Because there are too many things that end up unexplained, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where is it shocking excitement when everything was so badly made that WHITE HUMAN makes a fool alone? Really bad acting and frightening edits, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries to return to the thriller, but ultimately misses the goal more than ever.
