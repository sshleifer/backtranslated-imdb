SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's so easy. There is no redeemed quality for this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite complicated - in fact, they lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes perforating yourself while watching stolen and poorly crafted scenes running without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, it looked like an aquarium and had the same plants in different parts of the lake. Characters show their advanced teleportation skills, such as Alex Thomas, who falls into the lake (drunk), and then ends up on his ship in an impossible position. Angie Harmon made a poor performance like Kate, which was aggravated by the dialogue about the bursting continuum in space and time, which seems to have been written by the fifth grader. An example would be if she said, "Flashlight!" in a silly way that shows the threshold value how much the human body can break before it grabs it in half. Finally, editing this movie was by far the most bizarre and dreadful I've ever seen. It was like cameramen of a lot of chimpanzees that scientists got their camcorders. An example would be if we suddenly get a detailed light on Alex's car. I bet that there is not too much time in this movie. The end was totally pathetic. Writers, of course, were trying to create some mysterious plot that told the audience "oh yeah!" Instead, let's see some stupid spider painting that somehow engages in the story. Unfortunately there is no prospect of millions out there that could save this film from being a nasty piece of crap. I give it .5 of 10, .5 is from the fact that this film was shot on the film instead of becoming a picture book.
