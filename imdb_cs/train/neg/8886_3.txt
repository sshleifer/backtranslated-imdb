Not too impressed. It is difficult to offer this film spoilers because there is hardly any development in the plot. Everything is clear in the first ten minutes and from there, such as watching a dry color. The effects also seem to be very poor, reminding me of the old black-and-white films from the Maoist era that are sometimes found on Chinese television. Though it's hard to tell with a woman's role, Yuwen, as a story, seems to require only her lap around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of the pale star Gong Li, who has some good reputation as a good actress in the West because she was still on her face. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's 'Blue Kite' movie was a much better movie. But do not be fooled by the fact that spring in a small town was set in the late 1940s. Unlike the blue dragon, the fact that this film is set at a time of twists and turns, meaningless for the land itself, the ruin of the city seems to be no more than a scenic backdrop. I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang simply tries to get into the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeals to a foreign audience who can not recognize the difference between a movie that is "beautiful", "deep" or "hypnotic" and one that is simply boring and irrelevant. If a movie matches the description of "overrated", it is. I see no reason to stop looking after the state of the Chinese film industry.
