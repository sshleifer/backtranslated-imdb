Although many people praise this movie here, I must warn you. It has no logic. I think Basinger does a decent job in acting, but you can not make a thriller if there is a big lack of realism. This scene captures a good picture for you about the movie: while Basinger is persecuted by murderous robbers, he decides to sit down and look at the picture he finds out of his pocket. The film comes from her daughter and writes, "We love you mom". Who does this? What eff? And believe me when I say it's not as silly as some other scenes from the movie. Someone said it was a "hidden gem". Well, I must definitely disagree, this film has been hidden for some reason. And that's not a gem. Oh, and please, I do not even want to comment on the red set of tools. It hurts my brain: D Usually, there is a lack of logic when it comes to a small amount, but this film is basically possible only because of the lack of logic. But I still give it to 4, because even if it's an embarrassing flaw in logic, it has a certain mood that keeps me up to the end. <br /> <br /> So if you decide to follow this, you know that you have been warned.
