This is really new fun. Although they are much worse in a musical movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard to have a compelling story in the Gangster / Drug Scene genre (they do not have these films, I think Sebastian motifs could not be a much depleted and worn clich√©.) Then you would also need to set the characteristic relationships that are believable (this movie is not.) Sure, Tristan is taken away from his family, but why was it again? what about his father again dealing that he must ask for permission to go out at his age? an interesting picture, even when questioning the lack and need for rebellious behavior of children in upper classes. But this film will not go in that direction. Though it might be a possible review of Random Backflashes. He was no longer left and out, why did he do it again? <br /> <br /> So there are some interesting questions that will come here for solid criticism in the socially critical area (but again, this film is simply not because it focuses on "cool" production techniques and special effects, characters a moment to reflect and, above all, enforce the story along the way they want and not pay attention to letting the story of breath and naturally evolve.) He wants to be a drama not to control substance abuse and violence (nowadays it would be politically wrong, right?), but the other the party is nothing but a cheap action movie (like there are so many people) with an average set of actors and Vinnie Jones who managed to completely destroy what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> So everyone in all ... just ... I can not recommend it. </ br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
