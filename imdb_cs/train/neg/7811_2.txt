Here's how you do it: Believe in God and repent of your sins. Then things should turn around the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this film just plays like a bad recapitulation of crushing life. His mother dies. His stepmom is b_tch. His dad will die. Drinks. He got married. She has children. She's still singing more. His wife is going crazy. She disappoints her children. The woman is threatened to leave. Invites the venerable b / c night, wants to kill. After recapitulation, it's like we get the subtle message "Left Behind". <br /> <br /> "He needed a paycheck." This is a phrase that I had to repeat over and over again once the loans began to bloom in order not to lose my respect for Madsen. Madsen drops to his knees and asks for Christ's forgiveness. When he does, he goes out and in fact says he sees the world in a different way. He told his wife he found God, and that's good enough for her. Flip scene four months and the woman is tired to go to church. Quit the movie while Madsen walks to the bar and shows how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. The final moment? He gives a little brave waves to the bar (called Sinhouse) and gives gay, Miami-Vice, extra-curricular special jumping in the air as cameras frozen frames. Do you see why I had to repeat the phrase? "He needed a paycheck." <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. B-Grade 80 production values ​​do not help. The script could easily be an episode of "Touched By An Angel". It could have been eliminated in 30 minutes and advertisements. The game is wooden and never incredible. Even Madsen, who I am a big fan of and the only reason why I listened to it, it is clear that he is his first acting work and does not know his $ $$ from his elbows still in the camera. In 45 minutes I began to discourage myself. This was a homework. I just wanted to postpone it and say it well, I saw it in half. That's good enough. But not. If I was sitting through the Ninjas cheerleaders, I could sit in this whole. The only reason I'm not doing this thing 1 is for two points: 1) I like Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the introductory title "Introducing Michael Madsen". Encourage me. 2) One of the dialogues is so bad that it is classical. We will hold some quotes at the end of this, so you can enjoy too. <br /> <br /> This is about it. To pack it, it's a bit of a crap that should be flushed with the pots left. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, MY BOSS DAUGHTER, etc.). Now I have to take Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a policeman to pay him respect for him. Look at you, kids. <br /> <br /> "These things make me not to see, but I'll just drink it" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "It's all so beautiful!" - Madsen goes out after confession to God <br /> <br /> "I go to the center later and pick up the Bible and I get a cut" - Madsen after turning to dinner because Satan lives in his hair
