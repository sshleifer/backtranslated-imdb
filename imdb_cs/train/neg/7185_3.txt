I was attracted to seeing this movie because of this conspiracy and my desire to watch the horror. To my disappointment it changed into a comedy rather than a horror. The effect, dialogue and flow of the film were badly done. Much of it made no sense. For example, there are about 30 people and everyone is frightened by one person, despite being in a secret place, and all of them are healthy looking young adults and the boy threatening them is haggard. I thought maybe it was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look scary - an emphasis on the attempt. Blood and gore are also badly done. I've seen Halloween costumes look more plausible than this. The boy with his head is clean ... he looks clean - there are no signs of bones, meat, blood, and even heads. A strong punch down with the ax on the corpse should go into something ... it looked as if the guy rocked the bat instead of the ax. Discover who should be the main villain twist, but in contrast to other parts of the story. What was the guy in the mind to make it that way? If there is a procedure, you should at least make it to add secrets and tensions.
