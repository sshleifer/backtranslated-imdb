I just came back from the movie and I'm completely horrified. This film is an absolute mockery for all mankind. The theater I was in may have had four other people. This movie was recommended to me and I could not believe he liked it. I can not believe he likes a reasonable man. There was no land. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about nothing. This film only shows why Hollywood is so laughing. I can just look at the spiral of the "Horror film" industry and giggle. What is the transvestite for all the movies, it's true about all the new "teen horror movements" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's such a waste. Do not support this kind of crushing!
