The tooth fairy tale is about the spirit of an old deformed witch, which attracts children to their home to get the prize for their free tooth and then takes their lives. For the first few minutes, you will be introduced to the beginning of the 1949 dictum legend and will be transformed to this day. Worn horror plot is largely rescued by rigid gambling. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and several other scenes, but overall there were bloody but fast scenes that had a minimizing effect. The eye candy is good for both sexes. Working with the camera is good. Dialogue is fair but cheesy. I expected the film to be bare bones, a low budget, fragility with very few quantifiable factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
