Blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film, but not in any sense. At some point, some children go deeper and explore. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what they find there, and one of them (the girl) says they bet they will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is. Completely insignificant for the story, the only sad connection with the title, and no idea why she would suppose she would find a blue monkey in the basement of the hospital. <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed to remember, but I have to remember, I suppose!
