It's only the second time that I felt so forced to comment on the movie imdb. For the first time, it was probably the best movie I've ever seen, and it was for Memento. Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst film I've had the misfortune to see. Apart from the two scenes that include naked women, there is nothing in this movie that could lift him out of the trash. <br /> <br /> Let's look at it, clickable effects, font clich√©s, bad acting and about 90 minutes long. My wife and I were mostly reluctant to disbelieve how badly. I watched it awesome until the end, as I did not know! AVOID!!!
