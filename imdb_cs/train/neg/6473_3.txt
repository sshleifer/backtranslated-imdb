As a child, the first installment ("Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. She was full of great characters, songs and fun family movies. A week or so I've been watching this movie for the first time. I believe this movie was like most of the sequel and did not go beyond their original. I think I feel so probably because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, it is not a bad film. It starts when Ariel just gave birth to a beautiful baby, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (sister Eurselas), so they're building a big wall around their house lying on the seashore. When Melody grows up, she begins to wonder that she's outside the walls where it's forbidden to go. The problems accelerate when Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. I do not want to get rid of any of the movies so you have to see them to find out. I liked that the voices were the same and again beautiful songs. I think this is a good family film, though overall!
