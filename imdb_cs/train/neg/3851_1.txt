I never thought I was seeing a movie worse than "Lisa Picard is famous," but that got pretty close. As repeatedly in the comments, it was predictable; five minutes into a movie that you know will be stuck when the result is changed. This movie painfully references / removes everything from "Something about Mary" to "The Return of the Pink Panther". Writer Greg Glienn (Meeting with Parents) needs some new material. <br /> <br /> The only step is a distraught friend / police officer scrutinized by internal affairs, but that opportunity is useless. A lot of Seattle Space Needle adjustments to mask the obvious Canadian shooting. Some of the worst rides in the car scene with almost no effort to mask the fact that the car is pulled over the city on a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or brake brakes once. Selma Blair is an inert and short haircut is a crime. 3 million dollars Jason Lee, for what? I guess it's skateboarding! <br /> <br /> So, who should see this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'Islands in the Stream' wrong; People who do not have enough Julia Stiles. 1/10
