I wanted to see it for two reasons. One, it was a remake of High High Sierry with Bogart, two, Bogart part played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with some subtlety as in The Big Knife. But now I wonder why they chose to make this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; just here the actors do not care, the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer thought. Jack Palance is bored looking at Shelley Winters, and Shelley Winters asks himself what he's doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare it to Ida Lupine in the same role. And of course they had to re-use the story of the dogs! Certainly they could come up with different ideas. Perhaps the color is nice when we see the same place where they shot High Sierra, but it certainly does not add any quality to the movie. It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see the pseudo-film noir. As for me, I'd rather die than I ever saw ...
