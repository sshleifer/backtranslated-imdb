Randolph Scott leaves the United States for Greener Grazing in Canada's British Columbia. He wants to start a voluntary ranch with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They are hurling their little herd over a toll bridge built by Victor Jory. Later Jory rains their cattle and Williams loses his left hand during the fracas. From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott created a bunch of good Western themes for adults, some of whom considered real classics. Unfortunately Cariboo Trail will never be ranked among its best Westerns. <br /> <br /> It's more of a material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry could use. The story is sometimes stupid. Williams, who was on the way with Scott, wanted to get gold because there was a big strike at the time. He does not blame thieves, he blames Scott for persuading him to make way for the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie is the scene where Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes capture the Indians. They are running away because Gabby's mulice has learned to step up and he starts off to the Indians to escape our heroes. I'm not sure it would be in Rogers. Additionally, the story really wants to believe that Tycoon prospector Randolph Scott accidentally encounters a golden stroke after several lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes on how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was Gabby Hayes's favored feature film. It would be better if he went out in good western and actually did it with Randolph Scott before that. <br /> <br /> I say this, although no Caribou has appeared, it is one of the few Canadian national films from the past that have no Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I was you if you were not a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take another turn from The Cariboo Trail.
