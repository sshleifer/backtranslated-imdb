This is a terrible remake of a marginal, but very popular film from the early 1970s. I've seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute movie "filled" within 2 hours or regardless of run time. The cheese story, which by the way, is completely different from the original. The main involvement of the government was far away. There is no flow from one scene to another. In the original you could go to the beer or the bathroom and still keep up. <br /> <br /> It took only a few hours to change the oil bathtub in the car. It lasts many times longer than real life. The boys in the car will notice it. Also fools or fools who chose to dispose of a 1968 charger and abuse the Challenger 1970 should be shot in a heel with a dull bullet. The fact that they are not "authors" is painfully obvious and their walk will not be sad. <br /> <br /> The actors had no emotions, everything was cut and dried. One step above the monotone. Barmitzvah is much more exciting and energetic. Last but not least, Radio DJ made a statement that Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). That's total waste. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste time tracking this.
