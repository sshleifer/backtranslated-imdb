I chose this in a video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like this, go alone!") On the box ... it looked like a ringtone ... I was expecting something like "Death Proof" ... no power of actual violence in this, or conspiracy, character, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. Everything is there. Stunts a rock. It goes back and forth. A week or so in the LA band that makes a dirty magical show at a level you might have seen in one of the smaller casinos outside Gaza and a new Aussie stuntman in the city who found his feet ... They work with girls, with. End of the story. The band, of course, needed all these things because they are sincerely second-class and play a style that was already dated in 1978. It must be said that a bit of a piece in the movie is really spying - that the Aussie guy is really something and the film seems to be largely motivated by love and respect for "art". I hung up there to find out what was going on. He just wants to find a better vehicle.
