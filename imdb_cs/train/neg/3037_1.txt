It's one of the stereotypical dance movies of the mtv generations, and I do not see where all the 'not so bad' garbage comes from. The game is terrible, it's exactly the same story as any other "dancing" movies out there. It's scary! The name should shout. "How it moves." Since when can movie names ignore grammar? At least some of the dance films have half the decent dance scenes, you do not even deserve your watch. I give it 1 in 10 just because there is no zero. I really want someone who has more than 60 IQs not to look at and waste your money. 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This film should not even be made.
