Criminally Insane 2 is part of the new Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane, and it's also a good thing, because when I saw the movie and I knew it was a sequel (especially something as dark as this), I'm always curious. Now I am satisfied with your curiosity and will never look at it. Most CI2 is nothing more than "flashbacks" to CI, and Ethel's record is asleep, recalling memories, I think. Proposition 13 is released from Napa State (wondering if she came to see The Cramps game when she was there?) And sent it to a half-day house that was run by a pretty old lady whom Ethel immediately calls her grandmother. All this is shot by a video camera, so the picture and sound are somewhat pathetic and even completed with several "roles". Ethel, of course, is doing her thing to send someone with her and food, especially the guy who witnesses one of her horrific acts and exhausts her dessert. You must also be surprised that some house in front of the assassins has a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat's poison under the kitchen sink. I think this is all a question of "trust" being introduced. If you did not like or disliked Criminally Insane, in any case, there is no reason for you to look at it, just out of curiosity. One wonders why the makers of the matter even bothered. 2 out of 10.
