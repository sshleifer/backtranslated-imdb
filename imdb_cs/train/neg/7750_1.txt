This film was the worst film ever in the world, I like BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics are getting soaked, half of the movie is animated, the death of the hall, and yet I was ready for SUE to the people who shot the movie! PLEASE DO NOT USE THE HOURS OF YOUR LIFE THAT FIND THIS FILM. The only good part was when the movie ******* was over! This film is 50 percent Jurassic Park, .1 percent Sabretooth, and 49.9 percent DUMB! Please do not waste time watching this movie, you will regret it. Want to know why this movie is upset? Well, the rat was getting in, the graphics were getting in, the blood looked like (I think it was) ketchup, people were trying to blow out, college students think it and they can build an animal. I mean, there is a 5 ft tiger running right on a woman, she throws a javelin on it from 100 ft away! Wait, you can really HIT it! Also, acting was terrible. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and it just had to go and destroy it.
