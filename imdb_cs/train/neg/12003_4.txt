Six different couples. Six different stories of love. Six different love. Eighty viewers in the cinema. I look at eighty different parts of the silver screen. I sit somewhere between them and look in the middle of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All the stories have no connection, but somewhere along the way, Nikhil Advani tries to show some relationship between them. I tried to find out a few lines that I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 o'clock for 15 minutes, I found nothing to write. The film is a bad copy of the LOVE ACTUALLY Hollywood puzzle. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. You do not want to watch a movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.
