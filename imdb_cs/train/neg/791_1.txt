Show the scene where a lot of screenwriters sit around and say: "Let the black woman approach the unsuspecting member of the public (also black) on the street and ask him if he is black and then go away." Other writers hysterically laugh until they mark their repetition in each episode. More laughter. Now, if you think the premise is fun and the show includes many of these types of situations, you will look forward to this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more fun like dry coloring. Those who wrote hot news about this show should either get more or be forced to watch TV comedy that is really fun. Another example of humor at the show, the girl is trying to get out of the supermarket when she tries to hypnotize the cashier. Marginally funny for the first time, but why repeat it again and again in different shows with different cashiers? I could give you more examples, but these could just be considered spoilers, and tell you why this comedy is not fun at all.
