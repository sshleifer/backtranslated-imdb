It will never surprise me how you can take a great actor and get him to get lost in a movie like this one. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but he could not even save this movie. In fact, his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can not stand it when the actors do the same sketch over more than one movie. I think it's old and it's here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this movie, but the story was told a million times earlier. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player and his mood is reflected in his characterization. De Niro plays a obsessed fan, but his role in this movie is less than fun. However, because De Niro is in this movie, it makes it draw if you are a fan (no verbs intended) that sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But see De Niro in his best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land" or even go back and look at "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". Do not waste time with this drive engine. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
