The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who is confronted with fraudsters is so convinced that I must assume that it was the desired intent. The sets are artificial and I never felt like watching the movie. The actors seemed to read their lines rather than react to each other. While the film has elements of the early film noir (except that it is in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of this genre. Since the presentation had no appeal, at least I was expecting a nice story. Usually, I'm relatively slow to get up in plotting conspiracy stories, but you've seen what's here for the first fifteen minutes. At the time of "I forgot $ 80,000," I thought this thing was really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist who has proven gambling experience to behave so foolishly, he is not convinced. If she behaved like a normal intelligent person anytime, the whole story would fall apart. <br /> <br /> This wooden production let me cool down.
