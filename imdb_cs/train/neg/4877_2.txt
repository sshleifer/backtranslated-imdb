Creativity Frank Capry must have spent the time he shot the movie. While it has a few charming moments and many great artists, Capra is a complete recycling of not only the script, but the great shots from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is utterly awkward. It is understandable that he would again use shots from the top horse racing, which is thrilling. But he uses whole dialogue scenes with smaller actors, then brings back those actors and obviously expects us not to notice that, for example, Ward Bond is 14 years older! If you do not want to see one of Oliver Hardy's latest appearances, skip him and look at the Broadway Bill.
