This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was deceived when I thought it might be good because some of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want Jason Schwartzman to face that role. After watching this movie I was physically ill. I really do not understand Hollywood. There are so many people who are trying to break that I'm sure you can step off the top and get the best. In this way, the worst movie you make is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge. Gags like a hairy doll and spectacular tearing off denim ads add to the humor of the film. I like to avoid this movie and watch it on TV. This proves that you should avoid having to fly at any price.
