I've been watching this movie recently on DVD and I have to say that I was not overwhelmed. I know it's taboo knocking on independent movies, but it feels free of fun. The assumption was interesting, but his execution did not change. I realized that I think "all right, they just get into it, the story will soon rise". Before I knew it, the movie ended and the story never got up. I can not say that I also managed to act so impressively. It was bad enough. It's not the star of the Star Wars trilogy, but bad, but bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the running time is, I assume two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the film ended, I felt I deserved some recognition for the will I spent on not stopping the film and going halfway. Again I was totally unconstrained, and in the end I was bored by my wits. I'm not one of those boys who need a quick action and explosions in the movie, so do not try me because that's why she did not like it.
