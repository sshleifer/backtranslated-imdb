One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Nirom, the fan is the absurd clich√© of piano movements. He tries to twist or twist the genre with absurd plot lines of a crazy fan that will become psychotic - the film will not change. (spoiler) Do we have to believe that an idiot who has a knife has access and murders baseball players in a rich hotel without witnesses, safety or cameras? The film is a nonsense that tried to drag our heart-strings through the baseball hoop ending mockingly and aggressively. You are not sure what all the actors thought when they got on board this blast. That's as big mud as they come. Stay away if you prefer thinking in your movies
