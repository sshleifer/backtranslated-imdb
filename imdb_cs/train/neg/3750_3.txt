Eventually, after this long wait for this experimental Lynch, I looked briefly ... and unfortunately it is not worth it! Even because of the tough Lynch fan, I find it really tiring ... nothing happens, there are long, long and long painful breaks when nothing happens, a long, monotonous speech where she has not said anything and the whole thing has ended with it that the spectator did not know or even cared about what was all hell to do, what happened before and what happened later. <br /> <br /> There was an allusion to Mulholland Drive - blonde girl and the brunette was very Diane and Rita - a pretty and instantly lost highway with the hints of a major event that has happened but can not be said clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's all very uninteresting and very boring, nothing will happen, it's very forgotten and I think I'll remove it from the computer and forget that I've ever watched it. Excuse David!
