During the filming of the video at the beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II I was wondering if it was the movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately it was. The story itself is ridiculously simple. Ethel, a murdering maniac with a eating disorder, is released into the ground due to overcrowding in the hospital. She is by far the most trusted resident watching while one man gives dead flies to another soup. Ethel is then tormented by one of the employees halfway home with a chocolate bar after intervening to reduce the cost of feeding residents. Ethel defies by stranding the stairs on the stairs and then ... well, you get the idea. If it sounds funny, it's not. This movie was badly made of cheap effects and even worse. The characters are so wooden when they deliver their lines to stand in front of the cigar shop. To make it even worse, half the film consists of playing the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is a bit better. Very bad effort.
