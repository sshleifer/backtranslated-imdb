After watching this movie I was so upset that I lost 2 hours of my life. That's 2 hours, I'll never be back. Ugh. When you start, you can think "Wow it's really good!" But make sure that the first impression means NEVER. I was so excited about this movie until I saw it. This movie is simply pathetic. The acting is insignificant, the story line is something other than the original and there is nothing special except that it's the worst movie! DO NOT ALLOW THIS FILM !!! WARNING!! THE BEST FILMS WILL BE DANGEROUS IF YOU USE YOUR 2 LIVES !!! 1/10
