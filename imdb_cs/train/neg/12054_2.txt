"What happens if you give the homeless $ 100,000?" As if asking this question, they are somehow morally free from what will eventually happen. The makers of the "Rewind of Happiness" film try to get their voyeuristic giggle while masking their antics as a responsible social experiment. They'll take Ted, the homeless in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if his life turns around. Then, with the only rushing guidance and counseling, he let him go cheerfully. What are they trying to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "Homeless are homeless because they deserve to be?" Or, "Lift men - it's more fun to watch him from a higher altitude." They took a man who had nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then watched him burn down the canal. Should that be fun? They dress themselves with some gruesome music and dramatic camera shots, but eventually they have all the moral high cause of car accidents - only this time they have prepared car crashes and they asked, "What happens when you stop signing?"
