I found out that I was wondering what the people who gave it 10 saw that I did not. This movie has a very hard time tracking and / or staying on the plot. If someone tells you it's a comedy, do not be fooled, it's about 98% of the weird drama and 2% comedy. All the actors turn into a great performance that can not be denied, but it does seem to have somehow lost somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and had to be edited down or what. It had the potential, instead it was really a flop. I really would like an hour and a half to invest in this movie, but instead of renting a video rental facility it will not make a comeback in time. Save money and see something different.
