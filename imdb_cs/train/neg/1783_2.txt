There are no spoilers ... Because there is no conspiracy that would be spoiled. Madchen Amick is a living proof that a face can live - no talent is required. The only clear place is some really good one-time gifts that Alice Krige delivered very well, but again is Alice Krige. Her soft, dreamy voice gives a single indication of how seductive beings can be extremely dangerous. It's faithfully scary in this otherwise incredible conspiracy. How they made her agree to this project remains a mystery. Scenario writers had to be treated when they submitted this script. He has great problems with continuity, superficial stereotypical characters, horror writing and simply does not get any sense. The creators, while having sophisticated skills such as "dimming," the question of where they come from and what they are, is never explored. <br /> <br /> Do not collect time for this.
