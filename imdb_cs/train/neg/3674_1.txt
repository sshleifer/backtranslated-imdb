Note: I'll uncover the key part of the plot, but if you've looked at the DVD cover or some promotional material, you'll know it. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old who is not too bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between chemicals and organisms. <br /> <br /> Remember that the UN and the NSA seem to be in Hungary. Forget that when these intelligence chiefs chase after someone who just kills you in a minute does not wear a protective gloves (or gloves). These are quibbles in the context of this movie. In the scientific world in this story 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes sideways. The fact is, people in this movie (except for a few exceptions) behave the way people behave. Almost every time a person reacts to something is inappropriate. A love story (of course, it's one) makes scenes about a soap scene like Shakespeare. I can not believe we've lost a free movie rental for this thing.
