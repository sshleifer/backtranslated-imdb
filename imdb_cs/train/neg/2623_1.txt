Sly Stallone is barely the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother Frank ... well, do these awards now! Mullet hair, muppet Frank seems to think that every part he plays requires him to play the role of an American / Italian refugee wise of a "godfather." Please, someone makes an offer here, "can refuse!" This film has just thwarted this place, even by overlapping, Frank still steals the actor's motives. All people compensate for their lack of talent by screaming at their lines and shrugging their hands and wildly gesturing in a style that comes out of fashion back with silent movies. A plot of what's out there makes no sense as the meteor lands and turns all the women into sex-crazy nymphs, but because it's a 15th film certificate, it just means they get off to their underwear and make stormy sounds like the dogs for the heat. What is happening in the end is not entirely certain because I lose the will to live long before the film is over. Avoid it as a plague and watch "Deep Impact" as a sensible meteor film to hit the ground. <br /> <br /> Note Point Order: When one of the women's ropes goes into underwear, she has her panties / panties under the riders / garter belt, they are over the panties so women can go to the toilet with less confusion. Maybe it's a trivial point, but it shows how silly the movie is when they can not even have the right one!
