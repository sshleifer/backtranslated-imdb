I start writing this review during a break when I watch the movie. It's the first time I've tried it, but I'm having trouble with this trip without occasional breaks. This is not because it's intense, but because it's bad. It's almost painfully lengthy and incredible, especially when the extremely dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on the screen tragic and fake, self-confident and self-pity. It would be a much better film if they just left this character from this story. It adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, a very irritating melodrama. Perhaps somebody decided that if they could not make Ryan believable, they would make it unpleasant to him. The problem with this is: Who cares if a dying, wailing, grumpy clerk dies? Me neither. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character does for him is the fact that he is dying and sorry, but that's simply not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We all die sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy while acting like a burglary. The other two characters and actors who play them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah) are more interesting and their story, without Ryan's self-interrupted break, would be a much better film. But it's not over yet and it's time to hit PLAY again. Maybe by the end something big happens ... <br /> <br /> No. Excuse me. This rented turkey is coming back tonight!
