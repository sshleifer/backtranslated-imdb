I found this movie unpleasant. I felt as if it was pushing down on my neck, as if I could not lift the subtleties I needed a voice to explain it to all of them. <br /> <br /> They have a father who is still an alcoholic, I did not feel it was a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are very lonely people inside, of course, in my opinion. They're hard to communicate, something the main character does not really have a problem, except that he has a problem saying I love you at some point - which was a bit of a little effort when I founded his cool temper. He was constantly surrounded by people too! <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at no time did we really be ourselves with the character to really get a feeling of inner inner loneliness and confusion. I could not associate with the figure and felt no connection to my father. I felt nothing at all when it was over, just the relief that it was over. Kevin McKidd is a good actor, but he's not a tough player! The hour orange thing was as fine as the brick. McKidd was too old for teens, he would have three different characters or avoided the teenage stage and focused more on adult McKidd. On a good note I felt that the little boy was really good at the beginning of the movie!
