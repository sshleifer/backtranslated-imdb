This movie is as flamboyant as "demons," and that's the only thing that makes the film worth watching. The game is terrible, the action scenes are speeding up, the scenario is almost painful and the budget does not exist. If you think this movie is good, then you did not see a real horror movie, skip this and get a copy of movie demons.
