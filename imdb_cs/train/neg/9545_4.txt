Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, a supercomputer computer designed for a potential terrorist profile, watches him because he's hacking some money from a neighbor's next-door bank account to pay for a Philadelphia chess class trip . The other neighbor, whose Willa's computer was repaired, has relatives in the middle-east, who are sending money to a neighbor's bank over the bank, and Ripley sees terrorist connections. Ripley has the power to call rocket attacks. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of war games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 1980s. The electronics industry has a lot more work today. Makes sense. So, the movie dazzles us with a fantastic CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, Ripley's predecessor, is found to be operational, the computer is still being watched against the computer, and people are tapering and hoping to pray ... oh, oh-ing, OMG-ing, and more attracting the hope that things will go in the way. In other words, we are now experiencing TV movies and it's Oh Hum Time. Go back to the eighties and watch the original War Games movie. It's much better. <br /> <br /> But we really have to ask the question: do we make too smart computers, where will one day, in time, rule? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: No. Nudity: No. Language: No
