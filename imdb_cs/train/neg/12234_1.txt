I think it was just futile to produce the second part of the movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good film, but it is ridiculous to make the second part of the film in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story ended after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to continue this story. That was pointless!
