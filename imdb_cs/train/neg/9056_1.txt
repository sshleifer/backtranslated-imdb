I've seen some miserable movies in my life, but this one has to be among the worst. Certainly the lower material 100. (Imo, that is). We are watching two couples, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in one car on their way to Reno. Lonnie does not seem to be too happy with her sexual life, so she cheats on his wife and Candy, who is desperately trying to have a baby. Roy is not yet pretty sure if his sperm is all right, so the doctor can control it. Now I read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not do it. After about 20 minutes, she shouted, "Oh yeah, she's going to be pregnant, but her husband can not have a baby." In place, because this movie is so predictable. Just as boring. And unpleasant. Insignificant. Offensive. Grapes. An example of how much this movie has thwarted. Two couples set off in their big car toward Nevada when two police officers stopped them because they did not stop at the stop. The boys know each other and ultimately support two beer officers. Not only is this scene unnecessary and not important (or even relevant) to the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking, talking and talking without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I have to think about how it ends. It seems Roy NIKDY does not have trouble there, so he's the baby's father. How many times is it happening in movies ... try something new! The deceived wife finally forgives her husband and best friend for having this affair and everyone is happy to live after all. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best movie scene is at the end, with several Grand Canyon shots. Why could not they just hold the camera on it for 90 minutes? One would expect more of this cast (though Thornton really tries), but you can not really blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
