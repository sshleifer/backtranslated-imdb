This film strikes a fine line between satire and stupidity. While the bridge system, which has no rules, can support marital harmony, it certainly can not support the winning bridge, so satire did not work for me. But some things I found pleasant, especially with a great bridge between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. This is considered very much like a master boxing match. Not only is the competition being eliminated in a square space, such as a boxing ring, the contestant appears among the contestants, and the Roscoe Karns radio station carries events continuously. At one point, he even reads "One ... two ... three ... four ..." as if the four diamonds were an event that caused a knock. And people were stuck to their radio for everything, a common event for championship boxing matches. This spoof worked really well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors provide the comedy needed to maintain the intended satire. Paul Lukas has no comedic touch and is a martyr; beautiful Loretta Young and the usual comedian Frank McHugh were not good enough; Glenda Farrell has a comic role at the beginning of the film as a forgotten blonde, but has practically disappeared. What a loss of talent!
