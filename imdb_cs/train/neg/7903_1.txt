I think I watched this movie, but do not tell me because I could sleep while watching because it was not exactly "to grab my excitement and imagination." At least I know I watched her so much that I knew I would not see her soon enough. Or sometimes. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talk about lame ... really lame. Completely lamela. He would not have to rely on six years. Basically, it had no dramatic impact. Zilch. Nada. Only the shlock turned into shreds. Comedy? Should it be a comedy? You might be horrified - ee-ee ...! If the aliens were greedy carnivores as in the movie "Critters," we could have human beings a little deeper than being totally adorable cute ... like screaming and shouting and running on their lives so they would not eat so the story could be something more exciting than watching the color dry. this. It's not worth it. You can find something more interesting. Just like observing the dry color. Or fall asleep.
