Two years before writing and directing the film "Arthur," Steve Gordon had a small hit with his script for this comedy for Henry Winkler and TV "The Fonz". 1950s College (and all-around jerk) woos co-ed and married without employment prospects on the horizon; to meet the end, turn to the spectacular world of matches and eventually become a celebrity "Beautiful George". Thinking Winkler about enemy madness probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a way to separate it from his television alter-ego), but jokes and situations are often mistaken and insignificant, rather hurriedly directed by Carl Reiner. Especially brutal is the victory battle that includes Herv√© Villechaize ("Fantasy Island"), which features moves on Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). As a beloved Henry, Kim Darby looks a bit of her element - especially when surrounded by all these TV ham - which means the romantic aspect of the script is insignificant. * 1/2 from ****
