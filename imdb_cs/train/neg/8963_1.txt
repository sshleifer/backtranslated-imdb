The murders in this movie are not that bad, but it's definitely a movie. It's even worse. It's not even the cost of wear it could cause when you move it to your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Nor does his wear on his shoulders be borne by the DVD shop, not to mention money and time spent renting and watching. Worse. It's incomprehensible how someone can say something positive about this movie. It was just a barely masochistic tendency for me that made me stop watching and add to the group pressure of my teammates. Manuscript is terrible, direction even worse, and acting is clear contempt. I hope you do not see this as a losing passion, I'd rather see it as a fair warning: Do not waste time tracking this waste!
