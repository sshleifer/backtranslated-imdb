This step reminded me of crypt stories. It has the same kind of idea that people get what they deserve. I think it's always in the story of the Crypt. The same goes for bad acting. Very bad acting. I enjoyed the film because I knew most people did not like it and I did not expect much. Whenever I look at Stephen King's film, I do not expect much, because all his films are terrible compared to genius novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love Carrie playing as if it were a true story and the whole book is a lot of news and theories and such. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels are not like movies. The endings were very different from the movie versions. I suppose from these two novels that all of his novels have changed dramatically and the ends are always cheesy. Finishing thin is the worst. So, Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the real end. I suggest to anyone who intends to read Stephen King's novels to watch their movies before, so you can compare them. And so you will be very happy in the book. I intend to do it with all of his novels that have been made into movies. I'm sure that if they were filmed, they were really good books ... and the script was terribly disappointed.
