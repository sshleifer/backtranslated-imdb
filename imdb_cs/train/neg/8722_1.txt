They should not be confused with the "Alligator" (1980), which is in fact an excellent film, "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" will end the exotic trilogy of Sergio Martino from the late seventies (including the more observable "L" Isola degli uomini pesce " so good "La Montagna del dio cannibale".) The subtle story of "The Jaws", the script fails to create any tensions that ever, Creation is ridiculous and its victims are simply contemptuous, Stelvio Cipriani's lame melody ill illustrates the adventures of these stupid tourists presented from the very beginning as obvious objects of reptiles, no excitement, rather laughter, and we found this pitiful glimpse, which was quite funny if the dialogues and appearance of the natives were undoubtedly inspired by pure racism, very soon giggling stops for the sake a feeling that witnesses such a patronizing attitude. We could be human take badly made movies and poor FX, but not such a mentality.
