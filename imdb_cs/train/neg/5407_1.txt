If you want to watch a true "quality" movie, contact The Eden Formula. This amazing movie had to cost $ 50. It contains a slim scenario, dirty sets, lighting and camera work and a stop motion, paper-mache monster, which is totally ridiculous (it looks like they sometimes used guys in a rubber suit and / or puppet marion for a monster - but they were all just as awful) . <br /> <br /> The actors all talk about their lines as if they had never seen them before and read the teleprompter. Special effects are much more terrible. And the only sad thing is that they have dropped from the genuinely original title "Tyranasaurus Wrecks," which sums up exactly what you get for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard that you break into the raw material that lies beneath it. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute.
