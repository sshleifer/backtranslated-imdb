Maya is a woman of no interest. She just dreamed her life away and wonders why she did not feel filled. That could be an interesting topic. This will require a good story, a pleasant environment and good dialogues. He has none of them. This movie is totally boring. There are only longer and no peaks there. The only culmination is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I was his huge fan, I could not stand this movie. He can not even leave this movie. The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle," and if you are a fan of Art-house or you like it, maybe you could. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching. My recommendation: Do not look at it.
