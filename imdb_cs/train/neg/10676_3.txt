Working with the Camera - Why is the camera in this movie so nervous? This is unpleasant and disturbing. Editing - Still image flashes were too short. Many other scenes were too short. Just blinking. Sound - background music was too loud and the voices covered. You should not have to go back and play to catch what has been said. There is no one to check these things and get them to do it again. Reduce background music volume in the future. Is the adjustment of relative sound levels to Julie Wong's job? The conspiracy had too many free ends. The baseline story line had the potential. I think the film needed more work. Was it a hurry? Maybe they did not get the money. Like a lot of movies, it started so well, but eventually it started. I really do not understand, you know that you have a story before it goes into production, so why does not the free ends on the storyboard. I'm sorry I'm so critical.
