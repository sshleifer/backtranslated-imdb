OK, except for information about the psychedelic background, there was good information here. The music I could do without (not that it was bad music, but that this film does not answer at all.) As for the content of the film, the director often comes - skipping a pagan perspective on Christ's existence and a surprising comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life vs. the lives of mythological personalities / deities such as Mithra and Dionysus. Then it brings the chronology of the origin of Christianity and represents the "ok" case, but not the one that fired me away. If the director asks for the facts and continues with them, this film would be good. At this point in the film, however, he falls into a group of personally pleasing attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ" and a Christian private school that the director has visited during his youth. During an interview with his old director (who appears over the course of time that the director was based on false pretenses), I felt the director behaved a little childish. He was asking good questions, but like the film itself, the interview broke down in attacking the rules of this private school, not in Christianity. Overall, if you are interested in some information, look for about the first 30 minutes and then turn them off.
