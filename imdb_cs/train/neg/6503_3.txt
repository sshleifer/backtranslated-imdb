Hopkins's success as a writer and director makes us feel we have no idea in the film. But perhaps the problem lies in it. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from a very deep space, but he is so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who he is and therefore there is no investment on our side. It could be a scriptwriter who would associate himself with his own characters. It is so? Maybe. I do not think Slipstream is ambiguous; I do not think that's a word. Hopkins' film is an experiment. On the face, it could be deduced that he is a potential screenwriter who, at the very moment of his encounter with fate, realizes that life is hit and missing and / or success is a blind chance because he is thrown into the "current" of collisions between points in time , dreams, thoughts and reality. However, it is so fearlessly brainless that it has no room for any hint of emotions, even a small, relatively rudimentary range that will allow us to associate with its character. I did not think that a joker and a charming school with restless, machine-gun cameras and edits told me, but by the reflection of the film I began to realize that she had a lot of work to do with it. There are so many films from the past ten years when the cuts or motion of the camera have sound effects as well as other technical doodades degrading the atmosphere. I think that in this case it was justified by the fact that its aim was to create an impressionistic dream response. However, when I was watching, I did not know anything about Slipstream, and I went out the same way. And I do not care because Hopkins did not make any effort to take care of us. There are interactive movies, and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knit, unconscious of your presence. Slipstream is the second.
