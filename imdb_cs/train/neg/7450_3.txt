I saw this movie in the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so badly that I had never seen any redemption of the virtues in my movies: Dennis Quaid was occupied as a policeman who never smiles or smiles, while his smile and smile are two of his protective stamps. Danny Glover was a bad guy, but - again - most of the spectator imaginations could not go far enough to believe him in this role. Also, Jared Leto was not faithful as a former student of medicine. The tension was not there because the killer was known very early. The final was neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me liked what was going to happen. Everything we could expect was the end of the movie. Overall, the disappointing night is spent in the cinema.
