Before I go on, I must admit that I'm a huge fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, this is what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I would probably buy it as a great horror fan and enjoy the first Vampire's title. But that's not half so good. Jon could not save the film. My main problem would be that it's just not scary. In addition to Jon's character, Derek Bliss, none of the other characters impress you, and you do not have to worry about whether or not they die, especially the vicious woman's vampire / drug addiction. The female vampire is simply not frightening or sexy. Rather looks like an anorexic 14-year-old girl, no wonder she's so cruel. Another huge problem is that everything is "too clear". There is no atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampires who were in New Mexico were not just a twilight zone, but they managed to be dark and predictable when needed. This film has no such tension. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to walk in the daylight. The story, however, has less great bits this time. There is no wow factor that would know that it is the master of all masters - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really do know who or what this is. There is no army of lords. Instead, it is hidden in an old ruin that looks more like an attraction in Disneyland and then in a haunted temple. So you really have it. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story. I actually dismissed for myself.
