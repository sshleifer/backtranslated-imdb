Rich Harvard buddy falls on poor cats Radcliffe, up to the horror of his tough father (Ray Milland). Syrups, a sweet and especially sappy story about the battle of "classes" when a wealthy boy Ryan O'Neal brings home to the library for his hideous parents to ridicule. Ali MacGraw is a social abandoned with dirty mouths while John Marley plays her determined Catholic father but no one in the movie is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his fanciful portrait as Harvard's Yuppie Champion. <br /> <br /> The next 8 (!) Years later "Oliver's story".
