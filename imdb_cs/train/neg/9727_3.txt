Another of my jumps to the basket, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - the fear of a terrible horror complete with screaming ladies. It all started so well - I liked a small intro with "newsreel" about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear explosion, and was completely absorbed until the first person took the fire ... Since then, the film has finally come to utter stupidity and sometimes it became almost embarrassing to watch. When the heroine turned out to be affected by the same condition as the main character (the ability to illuminate her own fool without the help of a match), someone seemed to throw the idea at the last minute ("That's good," you almost hear them say. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film has appeared as a cheap tat - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for being done.
