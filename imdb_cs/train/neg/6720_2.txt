Now there's a movie that could be comic in Australia. It is sad and unpleasant, here it is, muddy and cheesy and overcrowded from Lal's country. How did the di-erector get so bad? Well, mainly because he's really interested in a job so surprising that no one could take it seriously. If, of course, they were not gay lonely gay clichés (but a little cute) ... or that is cliché cliché. No value in the story that almost seems to be the predecessor of GERRY Gus Van Sant ..... and with titles like FLUFFER, how is it all that weight? The Auteur must have a mad crazy thing that he first got to Burt and BOOGIE to make his own. Reversible and undeveloped, in addition to the theme of "unwanted love is a hole" that has remained from the faded Streisand, we have only a moody beef cake and a TV series. The unnecessary fourth act of this long-lasting drama is really terrible when the film goes as Gerries into the desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 1990s he created a similar, but in fact a cheerful movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as VENUS FACTORY, it also suffered the author from being more horrible than Orson, so once again they shot half of that, they got a ruthless TV editor that cut him up and down for 72 minutes and hey-still ... comedy tonight! Learn when bad movies are refreshing. I would say FLUFFER has relaxed and after doing it, I can understand why.
