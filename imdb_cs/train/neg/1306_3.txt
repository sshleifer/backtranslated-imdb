(also known as DEMONS III) made for Italian television, although it was shot in English and never considered a continuation of earlier DEMONS films. It had to be simply called THE OGRE, which is the way Lamberto Bava gave it to her. The American family rented an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has herself the same dreams as a little girl who goes down to the old wine cellar of this villa and encounters a structure similar to a hood hanging from the ceiling. It is lit and covered with a spider web and has what looks like a spider or insect's legs hanging from it. The drop looks like a green color. <br /> <br /> Of course, my husband does not believe that. The villa is old and screaming and makes strange noises in the middle of the night, and she should simply ignore it. But then OGRE himself appears in what looks like a 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf head attached to it and it is attracted to the scent of the orchid. The movie is not really that bad, and at least the dialogue is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous, unpleasant phrases that the dabing would bring. There is no real gore other than some skeletons nesting in the basement of the pond, which really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. The OGRE itself will simply disappear after the Jeep Cherokee family crosses it. <br /> <br /> The copy of Shriek DVD I watched was flawed, with the image black for a few seconds about half an hour into the movie, the error I hope Shriek has since corrected. Further information includes a brief interview with Lamberto Bavou explaining how it was not a sequel, etc. Atd ... along with some trailers for the next release of Shriek DVD. This is quite a standard thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3 <br /> <br />
