For life, I can not understand blind humor and devotion to this absolutely incredible film ... and I think I'm qualified to say so ... I'm a former soldier with special operations with 14 years of "lifestyle" ... This movie was totally unreal and apparently written by someone who did very little research about life in the army, in combat or at the level of teams or platoon. <br /> <br /> Three EOD guys trouning around Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real ... No Command String ????? Get Real ... EOD Clearance Buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Qualified Buck Sergeant ???? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed the evil and then let the two boys get me without firing another shot or being wounded at all ??? Get the Real .... Carjack civilian from Iraq while I'm just armed 9 miles, break into another civilian house, get punk with his wife and then go back to the camp on foot in the middle of Baghdad at night without the same scratches or confrontation ???? Get real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no compliance with the {Army} military protocol and no similarity to any army unit I've ever met. Totally unbelievable and disrespectful of EOD men and women who, unlike this poor film, are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos, but highly qualified professionals are doing incredibly hard work.
