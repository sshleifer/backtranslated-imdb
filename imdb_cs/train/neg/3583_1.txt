If the scale was below 1, it would be -10, in the footsteps of Godspell. The actress (if there was such a thing) was terrible, a conspiracy in that sadness. And Rene Russo was in her role badly sweet, enough to make her come alive. Ten inches for silly film. Saving of grace: kudos for the costume period.
