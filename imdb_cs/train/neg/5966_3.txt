Wow! I saw a trailer for this and although "this is not for me". I saw my husband and your friend during a trailer, and I knew he was a "kid". I mean, halo! a bunch of chefs who dance - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started to watch it, it did not look so bad. so I watched. I've seen it over. what a wonderful movie. if anything, it's a cat. these girls have a stance. it's a really good movie and a little love story. really leaves you pretty. <br /> <br /> In essence, the story of a small bourgeois girl who is big in the city after passing through the usual big city c ** p was a couple, it's almost an urban legend. but it also thinks about your life and what you have achieved. well, anyway. I think that's because all the work in the bar script is very famous, not only for me but for many people I know. Do not trust this trailer - its goal is to bring men.
