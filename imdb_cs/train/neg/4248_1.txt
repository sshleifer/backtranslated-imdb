This film had scripture, laziness and thoughtlessness all over the world. If you make a movie about vampires that has already happened a thousand times, then you should do a damn good job. I will be the first to say that he simply did not cut the film. Some horror / horror movies just do not break the form of "let something forbid and leave for fun because all the stories are just lies" cliches. This, sadly, was no different, and like all the scary movies, once you find yourself on this path, it will not come back. And the end? How did the heroes get the same job throughout the movie, but they are mysteriously packed at the moment and can not do the job? The end was very counter-climatic and wrote Part 3, which we will never look at. A horrible movie.
