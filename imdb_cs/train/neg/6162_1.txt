"Smokey and the Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but no one wanted it to be. It was low ash, but it had brains. She had a very intelligent script with definable characters and fun. The people smiled at the theater. "Hooper" does not provide any of that. There is no reason to smile. If it is to be a tribute to Hollywood stuntman, it makes them look terribly lazy by providing nothing but a bad choreography of combat scenes and one of the most unconvincing jumps I've ever seen. Everything looks like fake, badly shot almost purposefully. Poor Sally Field (as a girlfriend with her hands on the edge) gets the weakest part without having a funny or smart line ("When you do, I will not be here when you get back"). Burt Reynolds is still looking at the camera and blinks, but the joke is on every audience who sits over the "Hooper". * z ****
