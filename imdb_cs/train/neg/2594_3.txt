Though it's R movie, I really doubt you really like it if you're not a teenager. Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has a lot is nudity. Tony and tons of naked or almost naked chickens (pretty nice to add) to keep my eyes wide. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why this film has the title American Pie, because it's just a bad combination of erotic film and comedy without being one of them. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chickens but you are too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> It was 1/10 for 2 smiles I had in the whole movie and another 2/10 for nice chicks
