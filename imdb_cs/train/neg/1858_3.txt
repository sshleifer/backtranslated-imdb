A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets into a frozen Frosty snowman. Then he continues killing. Interesting plot. Sounds terrifying. And it's scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's a little raw. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I did not pay the money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie that can become a cult movie. I'm sure he has a loyal fan somewhere. I'm just not in it. Although I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes I thought were fun. For example, a scene with a bathtub and an explosion scene with a Picasso link. It was also nice to watch many ways the heroes try to kill Jack and he does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-cost B-movie comedy, but a poor low-cost B-movie horror.
