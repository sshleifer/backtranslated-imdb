I left in anticipation that the film would be stupid. With so little expectation, every form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the film, but the entertaining fun of the nonsense that happens in the single wards was also fun. It was said that there were many things about The Singles Ward that were totally annoying. The whole movie was badly nicknamed and watched his mouth very irritating while listening to their voices. This lack of professionalism has been overcome only by cameras of celebrity Mormons who have no business activity. This movie will work well with Mormon, especially in college communities where there is a single department. However, the conclusion does not offer hope to the poor losers who become free. (Only the pretty girls in Singles Ward get married, fat, ugly not, but all the ugly men do) Finally, we realize that the whole movie was an ad for LDSSingles.com
