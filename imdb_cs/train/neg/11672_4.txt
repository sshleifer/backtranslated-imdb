The three writers attempted to adapt Jane Stanton's Hitchcock novel to the trumpet, but this television film was eventually injected with too much melodrama and simply did not know when to stop. Fighting artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds himself busy with the rich, mysterious Ellen Burstyn, who longs for painting on the walls of her unused room. After learning about the last gathering that took place - Ellen's daughter is approaching - Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never thinking that her daughter has died mysteriously before she started to work, or that she and the deceased resemble one another! Two gorgeous actresses offer their services an incredible yarn that is not subjected to careful examination that can not match a woman in emotional intensity. Burstyn's role in the teeters in the camp while Tilly gets stuck making dreams with the eyes-waif routine. The only sequence late in the movie (morning after the wall painting is finished) is full of sincere feelings, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
