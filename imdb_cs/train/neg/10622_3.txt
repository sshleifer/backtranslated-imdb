Actually, I have a liking for Christopher Lee, but it just was not on his other performances ... and he was one of the better actors. The movie does not work according to its prerequisites. It's not scary, it's too melodramatic, and it's draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, you get a good part," the good part never worked. Evil is not convincing at all. Most other characters were also deep. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I were in the right mind, maybe I would enjoy some MSTie filings at the expense of this movie, but ... Naaahhh ... It did not seem to pay. It was not very good, it was not really bad, it was just average.
