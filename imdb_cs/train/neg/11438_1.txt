If sometimes a worse comedy appears than a "gray matter", I do not know about it. The New York Jewish comedy is a "funny" assumption that Sam & Gray siblings are mistaken for a couple and so they decide to fix Sam with a girlfriend just to find that Gray is equally attracted to their goal - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly homosexual is obviously just a surprise for her. There is a profoundly offensive wedding succession, a deeply embarrassing "drunken act" from Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would be embarrassing forests everywhere for its timidity by Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek has a complete inability to make a comedy and will want it to be removed from her sequel. Molly Shannon plays a home friend with a lumpen insunciance. Only Alan Cumming will appear with any credit, but he is seriously under-employed and has done nothing to work with. The whole catastrophe ends with Graham's bizarre opening performance, culminating in the penultimate scene where she wears a comic hat and a coat despite a scene in a lesbian color. It's amazing that this movie has ever been released, has no redemption and should not be ruled out at any cost.
