As a Turkish man I now live in Sweden, I have to admit that I often watch Scandinavian films. Mostly I never understand them. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week, I watched a film called "Polish Wedding" along with my Polish friend, and we both said it was the worst movie we've ever watched. Unfortunately, I was wrong about this movie, "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the female so-called Star Helen Bergstrom. The story is so stupid that no one believes it. I think the whole thing is a mess from the beginning. a lot of bad acting besides Selldal and Wolter. Ahmed Sellam
