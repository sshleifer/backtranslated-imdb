"40-year-old virgin" exists in a world I do not understand. The world where an e-commerce employee can tell his boss he's "f *** off" and broadcasts videos from his naked ass in the whole store and he can not punish him. A world where it's really fun to drive under the influence of alcohol and break into other people's cars. A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually bother his subordinates. A world full of furious and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And the world without humorous jokes! I am absolutely shocked at the seemingly choir of viewers who liked this film. I thought every scene was like a bad drawing on a Saturday night alive - first of all meaningless, and extending beyond reasonable thoughts. Chest-waxing scene continued FOREVER. <br /> <br /> The characters, except Carell, were a one-note note. And the romantic elements were completely invented, especially the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. It was just a chrome. And I also found the "Aquarius" sequence totally unpleasant and excessive. I hated hating this movie hated!
