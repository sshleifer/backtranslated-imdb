I left about six films for my life. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not know how I stood for an hour. That night I had to be in a coma. I saw it in the theater when it was released 8 years ago. I could not even remember this name, but I knew Penelope Ann Miller was in it. I had to really influence it by thinking that my time was commenting today. Yech! Vomiting! Barf!
