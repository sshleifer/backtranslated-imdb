Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, watch this movie, I've had a lot of fun <br /> <br /> It's a movie with silly stuff and silly songs !!! <br /> <br /> Mehbooba ... Complete insult to the original Holi ... well .. that was fine! thanks to tradition Every film had to have one! Chad Raha hai Nasha Anything ... A very useless, stupid song Jee Le ... It sounded like a song Playboy Stupid song ... <br /> <br /> Other than songs. The movie was fine This was Ram Gopal Verma customized ... If you think you will like this movie <br /> <br /> But this movie depends only on the Browser and on his judgment whether the film thinks it is full Copy He / she would like to hit her head at the Seattle cinema OR IF he / she thinks that the directors of his own view, he would be relaxed and look at this film Anyway I looked at both ways I would congratulate and abuse Ram Gopal for the disaster he did ... Well some other things that bothered that CAST was incredibly bad Amitabh Bachchan Like Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own film Remake Funny, what the director said) Ajay Devgan Like Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could be better) Prashant Raj Like Raj / Jai (Abhishek was for this role Appearance in Meboboo song) Sushmita Sen Like Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right Tabu was right for this role) Nisha Kothari Like Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha Deol would be great) Mohanlal like Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute .... Oops Sorry, hehehehe, it was ok I could not think of anyone) The film would even be FAIRED If she was fine, the movie was not even exciting, the movie was fine, just for watching <br /> <br /> Overall rating <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I got some credit for Kinematography .. 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 Unnecessary in the movie, could be better, Easy on the ears that are played in PC and iPod and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
