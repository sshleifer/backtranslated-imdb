Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no business as leader except a low budget. He really does not have charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more presence on the screen and unfortunately is not really the main character. Most of the time on the screen goes to the Brick Rooker. Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5) plays his daughter and she is cute and fun, but she is written as not too smart and one of her stupid mistakes comes to one of the main characters. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are in interesting roles. Just watch what happens to these characters is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare for the local Mafia Godfather, and it's hard to tell if he's working on the film as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It seems that every very low budget is a direct-to-video action movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this movie has made it feel like a spoof. Is it a parody of Yakuza? At some points, it's hard to say. There is certainly very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> Support for Thugs and Goons casts is threatening and well occupied. Some of these types of films have Thugs who look as if they were working in a local comic book store or as a boys in stock at Piggly-Wiggly. Overall, this film is very uneven. At some points, it looks like comedy or parody. Then in other places it acts as a good action movie. Then it is sprayed to the end. Without contributions from Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this film could, in my opinion, be rated by Zero.
