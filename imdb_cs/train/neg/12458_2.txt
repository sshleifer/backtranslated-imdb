The premise of the film is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire with high oil vapor and whiskey would have trouble understanding if someone shouted over the proverbial parking lot. In short, the oil deal is in government with the government (or Gummint if you prefer), Gummint is in Middle East despots and the CIA is a unique, angry pool of double sons - (insert word) willing to the fingers that come in the way . The only people who have finished are good as Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty that globalization creates when dirty multinationals chase the world looking for a tasty takeover or three. This really suits the September 11 caretaker profiles. In Syrian, this light tissue of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is disturbed by the nasty vermicelli of stories that turn, turn around and swirl through the difficult surrounding of their own insignificance, until the poor spectator stays alone by saying that: <br /> 1. "Director" (good joke) should never be left near the camera again <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt might know how to act but certainly do not know how to select the script. 3. If you want to see a movie that deals with corruption in the big business and the state, go and see "L'ivresse du pouvoir" by Claude Chabrol, who is grateful, entertaining and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The empty, lonely thing turned away from the evening crash.
