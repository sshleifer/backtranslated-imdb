The creativity of this film has been lost since the beginning when writers and directors missed a good storyline just to replace terrible strange influences. This film seemed to be aimed at fun children, but it did not even make it. Many small, low-budget films have the potential to become great movies, but this film is not where they are coming. Fortunately, it will be another movie easily made and easily forgotten. This movie was probably an opportunity for actors to make a little money on the side until the chance for a real role in a good film appeared. Anyone who has an exasperation of the movies should avoid seeing this movie at any cost.
