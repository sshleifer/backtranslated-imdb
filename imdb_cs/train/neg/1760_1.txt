This movie makes a few mistakes. several Spanish actors in Spain and Spanish actors speaking English. The English "Spaniards" are all right, but the way they act is all very unpleasant. dialogue throughout the script is very weak; it can be a Spanish script, but translates incorrectly, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into the English language can be good, but not on this flop. You will find the film in the first 5 minutes, it's so pathetic. then the rest is bad. much waste of time, lots of needed UN land. Oh, I mentioned there was one of the Baldwin in this.
