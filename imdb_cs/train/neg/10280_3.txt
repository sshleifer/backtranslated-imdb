HeidiJean actually saw this movie? Big Christmas Movie? Not even close. Boring, indefinable and completely without imagination and heart. I was still watching this movie and wondering who the hell think Carly Pope could play in this movie leader! The woman has no obvious personality and gives very little performance. Baransky was as good as usual, assuming it was the only interesting subject. Probably her engagement was the only reason why this project was lit green. Maybe I'm expecting too much for Lifetime to play 15 days since Christmas, but I sat down over this thing thinking that with another director and overworking JJ with an actress who could at least sympathize could be a pretty cute little movie.
