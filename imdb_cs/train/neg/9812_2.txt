Not only was it the story of this movie, which was easy for both psychologists to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking her sweat, but it was a terrible breakout of "Misery." The main reason I shot this picture was such a low rating because it totally disgusted me. I'm not someone who would be easily shocked by what the filmmakers were washing and always had a love for horror, but this film went too far from the point of view of violence and torture just to gain points in a shock factor. I think most people, when they look only for the first ten minutes of 'Hide and Seek', will find themselves in the distance.
