Oh, my God, it was so bad! The story was weak - at best - the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This movie is too serious ... of course not to be funny. I saw it last week at the London Science Fiction Festival and the whole audience laughed at each scene. I think my favorite is: "You should not study medicine at Oopsalof!" And I also think they are trying to see how many times they would be in the character of Nical's one line "we'll be together ... that's our destiny." I apologize, but for the first time, the words lost all meaning. And what about the apple? I recommend it as a lesson to the Americans: You can not animate, so please do not try. You just suck.
