A week before I saw Iowa, I saw an art school intimate in which a discerning student makes a movie and can not decide whether he wants to be artistic or violent exploitation. Iowa can be the movie he did. I see elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to art, both of these films had good character development and a coherent story of the line. Iowa. This film has an absurd end. I have to admit it's consistent. This movie is bad from start to finish and is by no means worse or better. Actors all did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows she is very talented, very entertaining and very sexy. But why it must prove it in this spherical ball.
