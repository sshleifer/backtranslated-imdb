I'm a huge fan of Ted In Mikels and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason why, but it is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the great cast of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Life") could not save this worthless waste. This film should serve as a lesson to all past, current and future filmmakers ... When you have the film as successful as the original "Corpse Grinders", you should probably let the sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize for more than twenty years Later (if you do not have financial support to pick a great sequel such as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with "Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat") Even if you decide to do it, you probably have to spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for God ... NEVER play a movie on a video ... Why filmmakers even try to do it when everyone knows the quality will go ominous ... I personally see one film made in this way that is even worth that the powder throws him into hell ... if you can not afford to do a sequel that is better than your original film, sell the rights f ilm to someone who can ... and what did Ted V. Mikels think (or smoke) when he wrote this god - and wful script? I mean, come on, dog and cat "aliens" from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding the human body ... bones and clothes and everything? If any of these actors, except Liz Renay, were paid more than five dollars for their abominable performances than gross overpayments! Avoid this movie at all costs and instead look at the original.
