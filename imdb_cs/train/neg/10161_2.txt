I really did not expect this movie because he sees people from Parkersburg WV, which is that I lived and acted in it. This city is boring and so is this movie. There were some decent scenes in the movie, but I was scattered by all the dirty landmarks they showed. This movie could have been good if it really worked, but it was not. If you are not from Parkersburg and you are interested in seeing what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie. Dialogue will take you to sleep, acting will lead you to tears, and Steven SÃ¶derberg will lose credibility after proof of such stupidity. It's a predictable movie without surprise. What you see is what you get, and that's a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg in West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
