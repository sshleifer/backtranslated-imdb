This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. actors are low and the story is very funny. I respect the fantasy, but the Lord of the Rings is a fantasy ... Conan ... it's fantasy ... THIS IS NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why it's got this splattered language, it all makes things worse. The only good thing is cinematography and the work of a cutter.
