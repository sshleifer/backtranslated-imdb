When I first heard of "Down on Earth," I was quite excited. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially cheerful at the dogma. But this movie turned out to be disappointing. The performance of Chris Rock was not as good as his past performance, and the film was simply misinformed as a whole. First Chris Rock. The whole movie plays like a comedy routine. Obviously, it works well in scenes where it should do a standup, but it is not in the rest of the movie. Even when he speaks with another character, he seems to think he is trying to laugh. He has some fun moments, but mostly they come to the stage of the standup (no wonder they decided to make his character a comic). As far as the remaining part of the cast is concerned, there is almost just to talk to Rock, none of them stand out. The film was also misdirected. The film has basically one thing: an old white guy who acts like a young black comedian. While I prefer films with more than one joke, it could still work and it was quite funny. The problem was that we saw too much Rock and we did not have a pretty old guy enough. It was funny because it's the white guy who says Chris Rock jokes but most of the time we see Chris Rock, so it's not that funny. Several scenes where the white guy who says Rock is going to show us is actually cheerful. If he showed more, the movie would be much more fun. Overall, a few moments of laughter can not deny the fact that "down on the ground" is badly acting and misguided. This was quite a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
