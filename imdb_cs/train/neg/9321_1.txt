I rented this film roughly 4-5 years ago and was instantly disappointed. I wanted to see the movie movie slasher, but it ended with my eyes. The game was similar to watching dry grass. I've seen better acting in the softcore movie ... The idea that a crazy killer comes out of nothing, I'm confused. How was this horror movie? <br /> <br /> The value of this film production was, at best, ridiculous. There was no fear. It seemed that a high school student got a new video camera at Christmas. The conspiracy was everywhere, if it existed. If you're bored looking for a bad horror film to rent, skip this one. There are much better b-movies out there.
