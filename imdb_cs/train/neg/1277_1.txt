This movie is still crashing to my bone that thinks about it. This film was not just bad, as in low budget, poorly performing, etc. Although it certainly was all. The problem with this film is that it seemed to deliberately try to bother the audience and do it with great success. I want to know, is this horror movie? I mean, it's definitely scary, but not how horror movies should be. I saw the first segment trying to be horror and failure, but what the hell is the second segment? It's just unpleasant. The third segment is like watching an artistic student film, which is incredibly the least painful segment. It's a betrayal that this movie is not so low on bottom 100, so you get your voices (1/10) in people! I know some people gave this good review, but well, they were lying in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Believe me, it's impossible to enjoy this movie. The only benefit of this film is the amazing life-widening effect: it feels like you're watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has elapsed.
