In fact, it's a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Did not Bug's life do it? I think it was on Disneyworld in the tree, so I say before they go and use it as a logo. Shrek 3d was also a Motion Simulator in Universal Studios. They should still consider it a movie because they appeared in a "theater" and could buy it for a DVD. The movie was cute, at least the tiny flyer. I like IQ. I agree with the animation, God made the work of shooting the film out of something that is just an adventure out there. I recommend it to families and children.
