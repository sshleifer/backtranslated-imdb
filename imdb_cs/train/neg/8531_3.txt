In this unforgettable little thing, Norma Shearer plays 40-year-old girl toys in Monte Carlo, captured between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame that this film is unsuccessful on a blunt rock script or director George Cukor, who never cares to revive the overall comatose state of the film. Shearer, who desperately wanted to continue playing the "young" parts, is usually the fault of herself until she gets it. Unintentionally, it causes her lover "from Cardboard" to be a bizarre memory of a woman's futility.
