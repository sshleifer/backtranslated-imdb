In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things - Tyne Daly and the fact that a version with the original script is now being shot. (OK, Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But it's all for me. It seems that most of the cast is going after the show - Chynna Phillips does not know who Kim is really and no wonder people are following Harry McAfee while playing George Wendt, who seems to be returning to Boston's bar stool. Jason Alexander is acceptable, but this wig has to go and I've seen a better dance in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned earlier, it is good to have the script version now, but I hope that young people who have never seen a musical instrument are NOT JUST.
