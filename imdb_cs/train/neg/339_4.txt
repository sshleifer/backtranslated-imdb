Unlike the "Buckaroo Banzai Adventure" or "Great Difficulties in Little China," or "Conan Barbar," which are horrible movies that have a certain cold and suicidal humor that changes them into cult feelings, the Golden Child is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> The assumption itself is not working and there are some fun moments. But here Eddy Murphy's "flip posture" simply drives every sense of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are so silly that it will cause more damage to this tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are more luminous than forced to be forced. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something is at stake or that the characters are facing real dangers, why should we care? </ br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
