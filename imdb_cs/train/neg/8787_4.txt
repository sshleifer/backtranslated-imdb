I first heard about White Noise when I saw TV advertising. Before, I did not even know it existed. I saw the trailer online and decided to go and see it. Now that I'm a fan of movies like Sixth Sense, I thought this movie would give me everything I wanted. It's got Michael Keaton and the rocks. Unfortunately, the film did not provide. He tried to be another sixth sense or a mix of echoes and unluckyly failed. It has a very promising start, but the middle just returns to repetition and ends up with a really bad twist that some monkey might have come up with. Unfortunately, like most "Scary" films, today they rely on loud sounds and bumps to jump audiences. This movie could be much more. It's a pity because it was a good idea.
