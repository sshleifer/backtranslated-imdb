"Giant" is one of the most demanding, too long Hollywood shots at all. Many scenes look absolutely fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this great Hollywood production. The central concept of this movie that a rancher would sometimes resist oil drilling on his soil is absurd and I know because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean serving coffee Taylor, will buy this otherwise boring movie. For a much more accurate and interesting view of how modernism has changed the ranch in Texas, look at "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's big shows) or "The Last Picture Show."
