Amazing. You would say if you were sitting through this movie. Simply, incredibly amazing. It's really so amazing that someone was stupid to dump money to make such a monstrosity that you just can not believe what you see. That, my friends, is a really scary movie. Someone thought it was a good idea. <br /> <br /> Well, here is another amazingly original story: a college student (sometimes looking like a college teacher) has a fucking mother, lives in an outpost and is an "artist" who is mocked for his "to be all different ". Well, of course, this poor laughing boy is finally killed and, here is his original part, his soul is inhabited by a scarecrow (under which his youngest younger Jan is killed). Then he said goodbye to the standard killing of all the people who had hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> - This and the sequel to Wal-Mart $ 5.00, so just a little overpriced. </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One person is punctured with corn. <br /> <br /> - They hear they're doing some effort in music, but it does not really match the movie and it's not that good. /> <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - A little, terribly acting. When it ended with a lot of pointed slashers? - <br /> <br /> - Dirty story. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow bites one liner that would cause Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger to blush. <br /> <br /> - The standard basic love story goes nowhere and is badly done. Some of the people who were killed seem randomly selected? you never know who is someone and then they are killed. And you just suppose they had to come. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average price of slasher, just with a murderous scarecrow instead ?? Well, that's all the other bullshit. - Just as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series that are all better than this athlete. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The scenario is loaded with a level of slowdown that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious here, it's a complete step beyond terrible. Do not get me wrong, but it's funny, like the hell, but I've never heard more asinine banter, even in "Slumber Party Massacre III". This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. A man who kills a boy who becomes a scarecrow: The worst wig ever. Dialog matches. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> Cast: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Camera: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 , mum bitch, girls wear no bra) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low Quality, Average Amount) Dialog: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, so it's bad it's my first rating for dialogue in each movie! > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , like me who are looking at pure bullshit, or finishing the movie Slasher, it's not a good movie at all, the funny dialogue and characters keep it from really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
