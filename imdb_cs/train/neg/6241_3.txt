Something that does not really exist with the theory of Al Gore (and his followers) is the whole thing about "consensus." If such a consensus existed, why is it "believer" in the ubiquitous global warming feel an irresistible need to try to scare anyone who doubts them. Why is it that everyone who is not on the edge of global warming is satisfied with the occasional allegation that he is either stupid or on a pay list of oil companies (apparently a professional global warming researcher, does not mean you are on someone's wages in this amazing world ...) Why is there a need to tell everyone how to deal with the whole question of when the true nature of science is honestly questioning assumptions? If you have any ideas to answer these questions, read Prey from a well-known oil offender, Michael Crichton ... oh, wait, he's rich and not on the wages of oil companies. He just took a huge career risk when he did not hit the line of green and other Kyoto worshipers, and he said the truth when he examined it. By the way, do you know that compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would cause almost no reduction in temperatures, according to its own supporters? Just a few questions that Al Gore has assured him will stay away from not getting every penny from the ecological lobby in case he decides to run again. So who's the stooge ..?
