Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about shark sharks and / or crocodiles are still going on these days. They make these chubby "blades" - copies from the 1970s, it's not like they get to some better shape. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts killing people. First it removes some secondary characters, then begins to attack the main characters, usually played a few nobodies except for someone who was a little more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the other animals somehow kill, usually with a blast. Then we usually have the last picture, where we can see that the animal is still alive, or puts eggs, etc. Atd. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same excessive ideas, and nothing at all makes any fluctuations. If you do not take into account the fact that the "specialist" is the captain in this one variant, then your standards are relatively low. It's funny that he played Duncan Regehr, though he liked it like Zorro.
