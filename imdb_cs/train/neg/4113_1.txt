I have to finish watching the movie as soon as I start, no matter how bad it is. This movie was nervous when he was sitting. "Sparkling" bullets, a "ninja" motion picture reporter, the way bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of rounds, and it just seems to have hit innocent surrounding audiences, predictable results and all bad gambling were terrible. Just like the girl who finds a reporter in her friend's apartment and goes from "what are you doing pretty here (you hold the bat)" to "hey, you are cute, you want? #%! As 1.2 seconds ... just wrong .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go with the children (or dog)!
