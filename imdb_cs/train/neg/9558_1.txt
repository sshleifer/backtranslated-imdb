I thought it was a sequel, and it was originally from 1983. But the sequel does not include the original conspiracy and nothing. <br /> <br /> Actually, I had very little of this movie, but I just lost 95 minutes of life. No tension - I actually feel clairvoyance, bad acting and so full of technical mistakes, so I just could not believe as a computer geek. They tried to create a mix between generic warfare and 24 hours. But it is not worthy of a low-budget television film. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie, it's a complete waste of time. Instead, you get the original. The topic is still valid. Do not leave much power in the machine. And acting and plotting are far reaching and more convincing.
