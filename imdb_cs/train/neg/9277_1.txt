I saw the flag when I was 11 on TV. I liked the trilogy. So when I finally looked at the cinema, I did not do it. I went to the cinema because I knew that what I wanted to see was not cinematic but made for television. However, he is a fan I could not resist. But this Omen movie, which I saw at midnight projection, did not make cold, brought laughter. Risible Dialogue as "it is written that if a child yells during baptism, they will deny God there." What a nonsense. Faye Grant, so good at V, is disappointed with this script from hell. No surprises and no fun. However, I laughed a few times on our bad ones. Really Pathetic.1 of 10
