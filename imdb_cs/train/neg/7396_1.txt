Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critic written in Halopa. For a short film, cinemas, costumes, ensembles, sound, editing and everything else are very, very good. This may seem surprising at first, but I was told that the technical crew working on it consisted of professionals, so quality is expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> The thing is, it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in a cinema, SHOW THE STORY), you need a plot and a conflict. You need things to become protagonists: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he can not get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. It is a kind of supernatural entity that follows mankind. And it is done. So what we have here is pure exposure. Instead of telling you a story, we just learn about this person, Tim Watcher. Of course, due to Tim Watcher's peculiar nature and short film time, it's hard to get enough background around him to get the film to talk about the voice. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense to provide information that would otherwise have never been gathered. In fact, if it were not for VO, we would think that the character is just a playful old man looking at things. To make it worse, VO also explains what's going on on the screen! The pictures we have seen are just decorations for the text we listen to. I could say that this short film would create a good video for a group or something, but because it is not in itself, that can not be said. What's left, of course, has value as a measure of the crew's technical abilities (not incredible, but good) but can not have fun, entertain, excite or at least show the story.
