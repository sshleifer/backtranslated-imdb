This movie is primarily a pursuit and special effects. The land is very weak. Most computer calls were just mumbo-jumbo. I looked at it because I was a great fan of the original film about military games, which was based largely on a computer fact and real computer terminology. This movie had nothing to do with it. Most computer scenes were not only impossible but also unrealistic for real computers and networks, but only lame. It's like it's written by someone who has no knowledge of real computers. <br /> <br /> Different game was chrome and was basically just an arcade game. No real hacking, what was it about? The film was boring. Lame continued.
