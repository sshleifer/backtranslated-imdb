I absolutely love all the books by Tom Robbins, so I was very excited and interested in seeing the film after one of his books. I knew the movie would not be able to capture even half of the Robbins spells, but after seeing the movie, I never wanted to read the book again. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not contain the eighth of the book's content and seems to focus more on the loving link between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Together with the incredibly weak line in the movie, I think better actors would definitely be chosen to play characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played a role in Robbins' roles in the book are Julian's friends in a five-minute clip at the beginning of the film. Those who did not read the book could look forward to the film, but as a huge fan of Tom Robbins, this film was nothing but disappointment.
