This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some fun moments and jokes, but you can not start the whole movie! <br /> <br /> The characters are too stereotypical, there is no real story-but short episodes with strange side characters that are not enough freaks to make it right. <br /> <br /> Shame, because most actors are recognized in Hungary, which is the secret why they took the role. <br /> <br /> This is not a new hope for Hungarian film. It was boring, though it was supposed to be real or unique. They could try it harder than this ... 2 of 10
