Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this film. It's hardly in it. Most of the time the unlucky jokes control the screen. One running gag is that the character is called Jerk Off. There is also a lot of erection jokes, where the punch line is someone has an erection. This movie is as fun as the British accent Kirstie Ally is convincing. This film began as a weak action movie: five minutes of a miraculous story and then bam! Funny jokes. But, in addition to horrible writing, the film is also misdirected and acting is terrible. Also this film makes an old bad comedy clich√© that has a lot of well-known actors in B-film. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some people who spend more screen time than Rodney, even though he is charged as the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in a five-dollar drug shop. That's too much.
