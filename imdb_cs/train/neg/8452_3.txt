It's the first time I commented on the movie because I felt that if the right person reads it, they can wake up and do something. Over the past few months, ABC Family has begun to broadcast a new movie format. I saw the last three and I was looking forward to them. They were involved and made a trick. My wife likes these movies. I was looking forward to viewing "Jane Date". Trailers looked great and sounded great. Unfortunately, it is one film where the book must be light years before the efforts of the writers and musicians involved in this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was just as interesting as a lane ride in a department store. It was disturbing and no emotional content was added to the movie. It was working against it. I work in film and television. I enjoy having fun. This is one case where I thought it might get worse. The script had lines from the next decade, and I know these women can act, but you would not know this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end has let me shake my head. Advice to Disney Executive, ABC, ABC Family, and Producers: Under no circumstances should you please send a composer or music supervisor to take on any of your future films. They have lost their impression and need to understand what the word "present", "present" and "present" means when describing a romantic comedy. It's the world that walks you around. Overall, there is a huge disappointment from people in Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
