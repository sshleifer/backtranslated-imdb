I just read a book about Dillinger. This movie was terribly inaccurate. It's like they got a list of names and they just did everything. His robberies and escapes were well planned, until the other - when time had elapsed, they left whether or not they had all the money. They had notes about every way to go, etc. Purvis had never seen him in the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger had paid for his food after Dillinger had left. Purvis never even told Dillinger before Dillinger was killed, just his photos. The way his members died was fictitious. Dillinger never left the bank alone, just like in this movie. If I had never read a book, maybe I could enjoy the movie. The meeting was a bit over the top in the places. The action was exaggerated as well. At second thought I doubt I would enjoy it too much, even if I did not read a book.
