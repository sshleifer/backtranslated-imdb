(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women during German Nazism. But it's too long, it does not touch and sometimes it's boring! There are too many clichés and there is not enough good acting. Story (storyline) is bad. Just like Titanic James Cameron, the old woman remembers the events of her life. Well, now we have an opinion. There is another woman who did the same thing. Silence is that they both recall the events of other people's lives! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of the basic story ... How can Riemann know about the mother's mother's fate and her interrogation, for example? Scenes are displayed in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, the scene proposed by Riemann to Fabian. When did it happen? The scene looks like it was set in the 1920s ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's figure is, of course, a talented pianist, well, it's even a baroness! Wow. Her brother returned from the eastern front, receiving "Ritterkreuz", which shows in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a great man who has kept his conscience. And he gained knowledge of the massacres committed by the Germans. Even some pictures! And so it goes, cliché clichés accumulate and that's why the film does not work. Essentially, von Trotta made a kitten for what might have been a decent film. And finally it's all very easy. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels into bed and - yeah! - Everyone is free. This is not a historical fact, but pure imagination, despite the "true story", claims at the beginning. Like "Sass", it is vaguely based on real events. It's sad but true, it's a typical German film today. It is bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
