I thought before I started with these movies that it might be good, but when I started it, I found it terrible. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film is filmed in India. you can see Indian cars. you can see lars drink bisleri (Indian watermark), Hindi written on the road, you can also see the temples in Afghanistan * hahah * it's really funny and many other things that prove it is not shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his time watching this movie .. clean waste time .. I recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie, or it may be a heart is a better idea but do not look at this waste of time
