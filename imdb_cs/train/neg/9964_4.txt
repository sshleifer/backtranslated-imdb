In the recent biography of Alec Guinness I could not find too much about Paris with love. I'm sure Guinness made a film to get Paris free of charge from Paris. The film has no other reason to exist. Paris, of course, is beautifully photographed with the magnificent opening of Guinness and his son, who traveled along the Champs Elysee with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes downhill. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Guinness and a young girl with whom Paris has a short trip. According to a recent biography of Guinness Piers Paul Read, Guinness, a positively hostile girl, found her behavior unprofessional. As for what Odile Vernois was thinking about her star, there is no record. They have as much chemistry as two castrated cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in a movie that was directly from one of his comedies Ealing as he climbs on a tree trying to get a badminton bouquet. But I would not expect a movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec brought a trip to Paris from Paris.
