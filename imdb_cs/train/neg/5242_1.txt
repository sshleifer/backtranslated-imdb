well, I hated the crushed, I despised a 40-year-old virgin, and this little jewel is a worthless piece of the basket of the film. do a favor and leave it out. I admit that I do not like actors in this movie and after my 18-year-old son showed me a DVD cover, I was sorry: "I would not want the movie," but on his insistence, I decided to try it unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I've turned it off for about two minutes, I was so offended. it's just nasty. every decent person would be offended by the dirt in this movie. call me old-fashioned, but you pull your hand in your hand that relates to your friend's face to know you have some, in my opinion, is above the level of decency. Yeah, that's how the nasty little movie starts, and I just can imagine it's getting worse. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he's proud. Imagine if you could get worthless roles as if you got it, would you stay in movies? despite the salary, no. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; next time I will.
