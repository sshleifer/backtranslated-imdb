Nothing will happen. <br /> <br /> Then characters without personality are not developing. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes because there is no beginning or no intermediary. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that are not beautiful because they are not even allowed because this movie is not even. There is no "is" in this movie because there are no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion, dialogue or point. Nothing is there! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But adjusting the sound is such, and your own movie is such that watching does not even pay your time, so if you really are interested, I recommend going and buying a soundtrack or something. You get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headaches and impatience. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
