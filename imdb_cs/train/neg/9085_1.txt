One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Efficacy was terrible for both children and adults. Most of the characters showed no, little or no emotion. The lighting was awful, and at the time the film was filmed there were too many confusions (in the river where they had just destroyed the ship, they were four shots, the sheriff and dad in the evening, Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming, it's supposed to be in the evening at the banks of the river, and Dr Beatrice and Simonton at night, but they do not get out of the boat tonight.) The best acting in the movie was probably from Sheriff Cappy (Although the pulse detector is characteristic of what's happening when people die, beeps * shows that Cappy has died, is still moving until it can hear a beep and while the sister checks his pulse manually, then it shows the pulse again, and then it finally dies.) I think it will not be perfect because it's independent movie, but it can still be better. It is not worth it, even for children. You could also watch something good like The Lion King or Toy Story if you see something you can remember.
