This show was pretty good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like the police series, but somewhere in the production this program went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> First, writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it ALWAYS !!!!! It makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and is by no means believable. I know they want to be hard, but that means stupid and bad boss. The crimes are uninteresting and unsettling, and that's just cruel. As mentioned above, I hate it ... <br /> <br /> Overall it was a great disappointment and very bad ...
