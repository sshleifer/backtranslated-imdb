When I was expecting to go inside the theater with tickets in hand, I was expecting an interesting sci-fi fantasy film that eventually could feed my taste for the film about robot technology, instead disappointed with every aspect of it, once again proved that the stunning odd the effects can not help boring land, which in my opinion was worse this year. In this film, I was also pleased that Will Smith did not show anything new in this film, but I have never seen his acting change from a "black man," which was his only success in my opinion. Since then he had to retire without spoiling his title titles such as "me, robot" and "men in black 2". 4/10
