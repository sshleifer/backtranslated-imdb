It was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all I'm from Kansas, the movie has nothing at all. It's like they took the name of BTK and made the rest. Besides, it looks like someone is like I just got $ 20 here to take it and make a movie and oh, you do not have to worry about exploring btk just doing something. seriously clean dookie should never see this movie. Cows with defeats and making his victims eating things and describing the killing of animals BTK did not do any of these things, but the movie does so because love for God never sees this terrible movie. Made for TV are much better and more accurate
