This movie could be an interesting study of the character and could give some insight into its subject, but the real problem with this film is that it has nothing in it. It does not provide any information or solution to the problem. It's just a portrait of the "old" male sex addict and the problems that this creates for his everyday normal life and family. Why would you want to watch it? It's totally insignificant and meaningless. It really does not help that the main character is a wrinkled 50+ year old man. You will have difficulty finding out and sympathizing with yourself. It looks like a dirty old playboy, which is a constant hunt for woman and sex. She has all kinds of sexual intercourse about three times a day with another woman, and not just with prostitutes. It also does not have a bad visual style, even if it feels a little forced. But it's all better than most other direct videos. Who knows if movie makers get better material to work, the film would deserve a better faith. The story is really ridiculed occasionally. There are really some absurd conspiracies that are often more laughing than they should be. I'm talking about a number of Ordells for example. Things get worse as soon as the film starts to end. Also, the whole story is narrated, alternating back and forth between the events that have happened and the main character session with your psychiatrist feels a little cheap and simple. But when it comes to bad movies, this is not one of them. It's nothing better or worse than any other random direct video switch that has similar notions. It still seems strange and quite amazing that they managed to occupy Nastassu Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. simple little insignificant production, what this is. I think they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
