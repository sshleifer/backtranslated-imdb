I saw this movie back in the first theatrical release at a justifiably empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this film still holds in my mind as the worst film of all time; or at least the worst thing I'd like to watch. The performance is far below the standard set by any random group of drunk high school students who set out on the streets and are forced to learn their lines for 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first uneasy shock, we laughed for a moment, because each scene hit a new low. But after a while, this dubious pleasure was lost and it was really sad.
