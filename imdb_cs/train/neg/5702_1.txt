What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but it was even worse! It was very tedious and unbelievable, and at some point I found myself in a tight and yawning order. I can not believe people really liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The entire movie felt like a great tour of the most popular American buildings. Never stopping the flow of names and combinations was too convincing. I stopped my attention for about 30 minutes. What was to be a happy night was a complete disappointment. What resistance ... I think I've just seen too many movies to enjoy the National Treasure.
