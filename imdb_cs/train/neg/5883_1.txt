This film does not contain humor for anyone who lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my life experience. This movie was a male version of "Mummy Dearest". It shows graphically and precisely the life that many children of a mentally ill parent go through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and to behave like God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it's funny. By no means, I say! It's the worst humor. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best for this movie is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe what we families actually experience.
