About the Child: Why was not a big brother supposed to be hungry after a bottle or some nutrition or change in diapers? He should scream continuously after hours without care. Definitely stupid to take the child out of a safe place when he did not need it. And why was the journey miraculously clear whenever someone wanted to go somewhere? I could not imagine that the cops on the barrier could not immediately watch any young man who would collapse him, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> That being said, it was nice to have a movie that children could safely watch for change.
