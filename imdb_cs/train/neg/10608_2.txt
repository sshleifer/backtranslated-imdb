I do not think any Van Damme movie will ever be a Universal Soldier, but I never know. This movie was good, but not as good as the first. VD returns Luc and must fight again. They try to have fun, but maybe they are laughing. VD has a child this time from Ally W., it has clearly shown that he is one of them. 2. Goldberg was cool, making his famous move - he forgot what is named because I do not watch the match. VD and Goldberg had some good matches. It was the first, but not so good. VD makes his best move in his career, as always - HELICOPTER KICK. Although the ending should be longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing, but it's never going to be original.
