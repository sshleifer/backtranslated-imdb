With the inconspicuous, dimensionless script of Neil Simon and the insignificant direction of Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a mysterious showcase for Mars Mason, who received a third of the four Oscar nodes for the second chapter, and gave the same performance as in Cinnderello Liberty 73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Just when I laugh (81), but this time the child does not have to pull. Chapter Two is the third and final feature film for Moore, which previously directed Neil Simon, The Cheap Detective (78) and Murder by Death (76). Caan is a miscast, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialog is too analytical, and practically there is no detail. The first half is less than enchanting, meets the cute, cute romance between the glittering Caan and Chase Mason, and the evil second half awaits you in the first half. NYC places like Joe Bologna and painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. And last but not least, playable plays during credits.
