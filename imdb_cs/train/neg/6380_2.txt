Well, what can I say about this movie. I'm not wise. I could continue how stupid this film is forever, though the only thing that really told me was music. And at the beginning, all of them commented on how much they liked. All I have to say is that he was ripped off by one of the best martial arts films of all time Fistsof's fury to play Bruce Lee. If he was still alive and sometimes appeared in this film, he would be horrified. the rest of the film is absolutely absurd and the tape is lost. I say a tape because such a movie could not be shot on a movie. Now I feel more stupid to lose 30 minutes of my life. The only reason I even saw it was that my roommate withdrew him from morbid curiosity. What the world is coming for.
