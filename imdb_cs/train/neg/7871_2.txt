In 1993, "visitors" to France were a huge hit. So the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not keep its promises. In fact, it's supposed to say a single story. Jean Reno must go back to the twentieth century and take Clavier back in the Middle Ages to keep track of his time. The problem is that Clavier feels completely restless in the world of the twentieth century, causing him to return to the Middle Ages is rather difficult ... Instead, the film continues in several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. As a result, the movie sometimes becomes muddle-headed, sometimes a little mess. But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into a trap that they can avoid in the first film: they go to the top and become annoying. So why did film creator Jean-Marie Poiré take Muriel Robin in the lead? She made a mistake because she seems hopeless and she is totally pitiful. The other actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel does not exist and Christian Bujeau is unbearable. Of course, the film contains several good moments with effective gag, but it often falls into vulgarity and lightness. Some sequences and dialogs are affected. It also looks hollow because Poiré took back the elements that ensured the success of the first film. So, a young girl takes Reno as a close relative of her family and asks him to attend a wedding. <br /> <br /> A challenging and disappointing sequel. What is the interest of this film commercially different? <br /> <br />
