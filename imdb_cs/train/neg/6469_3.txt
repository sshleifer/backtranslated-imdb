When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really good in childhood, so I decided to continue. This is an example of why some movies do not go on because the first movie is usually the best and it is. Basically, now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed out of the house because they are afraid of Sister Ursula (octopus with legged villains from movie one), and Morgan gets to her. When the kid comes out, he asks Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, like her mom. This causes Ariel to return to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just a story that could be thought a little more. Adequate!
