It's interesting to find out what was the shape of Pierce Brosnan's career before Bond arrived on stage. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays a gentle Patrick who works in front ghettos on "confidence courses". He romanticized a woman who has a standard mop-top mid-90-year-old boy called Eric. The woman's drunken ex-husband soon comes to the scene and begins to be mistaken with Pierce. In one phase Pierce is innocently making "vegeburgers". The husband enters. Pierce continues to produce vegeburgs. The husband then attacked Pierce. The small chunks of the half-empty Vegeburger's call fell from Pierce's mouth. The struggle suddenly ends without showing the result. It's as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
