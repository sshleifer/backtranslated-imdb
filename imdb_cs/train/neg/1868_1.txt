This movie is terrible. Each line is stolen from 8MM (at least in the Italian dubbed version). If you like baskets ... real baskets, try it out; but be careful: it's not "so bad that it's good" kind of movie. At your fingertips it can really look like porn but trust me if you are looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even a common erotic thriller, go find something else in the store! I'm telling you this because completely unintelligible and unconvincing filming, playing, plotting, dialogues (the only good line, as I said, are those that stole from Joomla Schumacher 8MM!) Will bring you to tears for a few minutes and the "happy end" is absolutely rebellious! I will give her a star: half a sudden shot at the back scene, a monologue "victim's eyes" (also stolen from 8MM) and half for the sexy body of mom and daughter (who failed to get me upside down when watching this turkey!)
