his costume drama is misplaced and spellless. George Sanders was an outstanding actor. But there is a strong improbability, such as the leading, dishonest of the eighteenth century known for his philosophy and great looks. His costar is of all people Akim Tamiroff. Some Frenchman! Then there is Signe Hasso, in a dark wig, like a virgin daughter of a wealthy family. Carole Landis is the best. The film opens in silhouette. She is a brother and she is a naughty girl. It will disappear for a while, but it will appear in an unlikely situation. But it's good. She was always an attractive actress. Here it is occupied closest to its usual roles. It has to be a little rude, ooh-la-la. It should have a light touch, but from the beginning to the end it's a lead matter.
