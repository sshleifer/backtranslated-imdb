In some respects, the concept of happening is an interesting combination of several typical types of films in an interesting combination. But no point in this movie was so obvious that he did not deserve the lasting shots. I had the feeling that I was overwhelmed with a so-called mysterious explanation of how disease causes killing people. It seems that the writer simply picked up clich√©s from other films as a replacement for writing lines tailored to the real characters. The actors did not help. No chemistry. I think there should be some attraction, just because it is a crucial element of these stories. The writers, however, did not work very hard on the development of chemistry. Sure, they are both attractive, but whether they attract each other seem to be an open question. The character of Turner's confidence appears in a Sabbath developed too quickly and without a special reason. Sabato's character should be a discredited physician who simply can not play the rules. Think about the character of Jeff Goldblum in the "Independence Day". Usually, this kind of character demonstrates some talent or shine. The character of Sabbath is not. It's Cassandra with the crazy and all the prophetic skills of the magical eighth ball. He seems to be right by accident. <br /> <br /> Death scenes are funny. Each actor really tried to say a little more than to prove the suffering that was caused to them. The symptoms looked like bad plumbing, something like the 80's video, Peter Gabriel, I think.
