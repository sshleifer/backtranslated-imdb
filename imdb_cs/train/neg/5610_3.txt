This document begins with an interesting premise - it is an interesting and convincing argument that the history of Jesus, as is commonly believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, after doing this, the film will shift speed and become more than a continuous attack on Christianity, and it is quite focused on easy targets. The writer / director clearly has some problems with the church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the film is disappointing.
