In the 1970s, when I first saw it, I was in high school. It was great. Now, as an adult, I look at it and I say ... well. What was so funny? It's time, but it's a little and far. It is so dated that jokes are no longer worth it. Show this to the young crowd and they will be completely lost. If you like this type of humor, you might want to keep Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. The Vision Tunnel as well as the Groove Trumpet are too dated for today's viewing.
