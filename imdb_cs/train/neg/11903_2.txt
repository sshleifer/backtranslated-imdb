Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel. I do not know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​the situation after spt11 and the view of American society is promising, making it 2 out of ten. But it's not a movie. It's the best he can do with a big idea (the conflict between West and East). In the Middle East, important things are being done on the MAC * screen with the fingers of the American girl, which is actually stupid (because they are simply ignored about facts). and the most important thing is the idea that is given by religion is a bit funny for me. On the final scene, Lana says you just leave silence and try to listen. And the music in the background says "... I will pray". This thing is not about religion actually. But it ends up with it. How do you see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray. The light shines on the truth. that nobody wants to see it. ps: "My home is not a place. They are people" The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is the sentence. But that is unnecessary for this film. (by the way, as "someone" mentioned below, America's best young man is not the best, they are just "poor" and "hopeless" those who have signed up to an army that needs good payouts, which is not ensured by the government!
