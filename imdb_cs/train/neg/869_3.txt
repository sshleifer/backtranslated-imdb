Where to start ... If this movie was a dark comedy, I think it's FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me and for anyone who has free time and a lot of money (he thinks it was the price I paid, he got it from Wal-Mart), this film was considered a thriller. The only THRILL I received was watching Kirkland's miserable rendition of Anna Wilkes of Misery without a snow forest zone. If you want to laugh good, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least half-decent, then do not even bother. <br /> <br /> For one I enjoy dirty movies, the worse, the better in most cases. But Wow ... It means WOW! The only person in the movie that did not drown him was the boy who played Vincent Berry. The only reason I gave him three stars is that he did something to me.
