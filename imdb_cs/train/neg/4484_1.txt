As soon as I started to see the posters and heard me speak about this film, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was unbelievable and I could not wait to see the other, especially after I started seeing trailers for other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater very disappointed, just like many other spectators in the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always, there were few of them. In the first film, constant fights were held, but the other had much more (and much unfortunate) sermons. To summarize, there was not much that was not expected. The machines kicked towards Zion with the intention of destroying it (that's not a spoiler, they all saw him in commercials). The film's dialogue was absolutely scary. If you are not a psychological major, you will most likely not understand most of what is said in the film, and it just will not matter. It has become a rather romantic film that portrays the events that take place in the life and relationship of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, because he was as bad as in the first film, seemed to receive all religious and sermon. Personally, I do not have to hear or pay money to listen to it. The film was a serious loss of my time and I do not think I can watch the first one. Dialogue and constantly boring and dry monologues of the essence of every character lost my interest in the film quickly, and a small number of good fighting scenes pushed me closer to the edge and the end of the film pushed me right away. Which movie ends "Will it be closed"? How original it is people. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn midnight oil to come up with this one. In the end, the film was bad and it's over.
