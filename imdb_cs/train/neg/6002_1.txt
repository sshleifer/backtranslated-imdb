"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is garbage. The actor is awful, the atmosphere does not exist and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this bottom piece is that most IMDb users gave him 10. That's really scary. I do not understand, no tension, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("Evil Dead", "Intruder") is totally useless, supporting the cast is also terrible. Some people may like this image, a mainstream company, but horror fans or gore-hounds will not enjoy this piece. I personally hate horror comedy, I prefer to watch serious horror films such as "Cannibal Holocaust" or "The Last House on the Left". the real horror film is supposed to be spooky, overly bloody and disturbing, without stupid humor, which usually destroys the whole concept. This is not scary, not horrible, not comical as a comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
