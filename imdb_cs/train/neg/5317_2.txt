In the first 20 minutes or so (I watched PS2 so I have no idea how long it takes) Alienator sets an interesting premise. I do not think I've seen movies that are getting weaker, with a stranger from another planet like baddies. But interest soon turns into overwhelming infidelity when you realize that the "alien" is a huge woman who builds a body in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is obviously ridiculous. Do not think I'm against it. In the world of shark-horror, it may seem ridiculous to have a good signal. However, the flamboyant stupidity of his assumption is the whole film really go for it. The Alienator is funny, but it's also a top-ranked Shambalan suckfest. Actors stack of unsuccessful attempts at seriousness, the potentially brilliant lines of pure dialogue cheese hit the nerves and the inability to sum up one or two decent sets. Until the movie is completed, you can barely see the original concept through the hay of a complete tribe that's accumulated on it. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that 'Alien' is killing people by evaporating them, as opposed to doing any "slashing" as such, and you have a huge pulsing bunch of good ideas that are left behind on rot. You will laugh at Alienator, but AT, not with him. If it's your thing, go ahead and look at it.
