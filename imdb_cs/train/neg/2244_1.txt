There are two points that I must make clear at the outset. First of all, we all know what the Oscars this year really was doing. It was the way the academy showed people they were not racists and they were never. They wanted to eliminate all prejudices about themselves. Secondly, it is useless to make notes about the show, because really, what difference does it make? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year when I became a destroyer! I will never look at an exhibition. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins "Gladaitor" when they should be the real winner of Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie, watch and agree. Eyes Wide Shut, when he was released, received no nominations. And as for this year, bad decisions were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann does not get the nomination "Best Director"! Are you kidding me!! "Beautiful mind" is for "the best makeup" ???? "Day of training" is your name? The film was terrible and it seemed that Washington did not even repeat it, which proved to know how to use four letters! That's why he won the prize! Put down your tongue and I bet she almost plays herself! I liked "Gosford Park," but I really did, but why were there 7 nominations? And how on Earth they can not give it to Altman too! I mean, if we make awards to people to clean up some bad feelings about Altman? The man is 32 years old and not Oscar! It was many, many things that bother me about this Oscar, but I will live with it until I ever have to watch the next show! The highpoint (and only) show was when Woody Allen first appeared at the show. It will go down as one of the greatest moments in the history of the show.
