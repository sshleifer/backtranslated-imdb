This movie is about a very sexy Olympic star star who is hired a coach of a basketball team of colleges. Like WILDCATS from Goldie Hawn, Cathy Lee Crosby plays the title role and is doing as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would be a better choice, but because the film is an obvious TV movie, they probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great in every shot, but we'll never see her naked. The story is quite predictable, at least it does not offer any surprises. Young and happy Michael Biehn has the main male role. He is the star of the team and also a love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has several fun scenes as a rich old man who runs an athletic program and does not think the woman has a sports coach. This point is raised throughout the movie and it is useless to say it is dated. It is ironic that Cathy Lee does not do his team through unorthodox workouts; he will not do anything that a male trainer would do. There's a fun subplot that includes a tall and not so bright player who undergoes hypnosis to go through his class and play as a professional basketball player Sydney Wicks. It looks like everyone has a good time doing this movie, but the only real reason he sees it is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not such an actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair and a very rotten body.
