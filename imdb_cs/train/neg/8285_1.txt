This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson lacks any acting skill, but the script is incredibly shallow and chaotic. You hear a serious dialogue that says, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." After the first half hour I stopped watching the movie (online), I could not take it anymore. Her "Southern Girl Magic" simply does not work and is quite unpleasant; her humorous attempts are falling, and she delivers the lines as if reading the script directly from the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did not he read the script before agreeing to do it, or would it fall for Papa Joe (Jessica's father and film producer) to promise big profits? Let's hope he knows more than signing up for another movie like this one. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing his painful expression on his face when he suffers a bad conversation. I also think the previous commentator gives this film 8 out of 10 probably either in some way involved in the movie or hired by Papa Joe to get the movie better. Nobody in his true mind would actually find this movie. Jessica has a lot of money, right? Can you buy some acting lessons?
