Dr Mordrid is frightening. I do not recommend any adult or child to see if they have not sinned the killers. There's so much filth in this movie that it hurts my yes. When we talk about the eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against the background of the stars. Only the devil himself could imagine such a bad thing. I borrowed every copy of the local video rentals and crushed them with a 5 pound cross. The film should be locked in the 4th cellar with all the other disgusting hell animals. This is where the movie belongs. I suggest if you want some scandalous fun, go and rent all the dogs go to heaven, or angels in the open field. These films are worth seeing. If you want to commit sin and love terrifying movies, you have to see Dr. Mordrid.
