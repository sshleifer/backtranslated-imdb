Basically, what we have here is just a bit more than the remake of 1970's 'Death Line' classic guitar horror, which ironically resembles these pavements, also partially shot on the unused Aldwych underground station. from the already unexplored Jubilee Line platform in Charing Cross and the aforementioned Aldwych, this movie contains essentially the same plot - the dodgy murder of a mad zombie in the tunnels that enjoy the lost passengers who missed the last train - the originality is not a strong point. <br /> <br /> There are really strong points missing. Gore ranges from poor to unnecessary over boys, while the sub-Gollum nutter is never fully explained because it seems to be little more than a developed fence. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has little to do with a thin script than running a lot of tunnels and screaming every so often, really like everyone else in this movie, a small dog and a pack of rat rats. movies located on the London Underground are the bag or you just want to play the "place of the tube" they choose on the DVD when it falls on the shirt. If you are looking for the classic horror, go and kick a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat). If you are looking for a quality well-written and feature film, you will have to change the trains .....
