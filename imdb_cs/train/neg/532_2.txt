Just PPV this one. I do not want too much time to waste it, because most of the posters gave it better than I ever did, but I wanted to say a few things. I did not know, it was more fun: Redgrave chased small moths and slipped out of her sister; She closed her "precious" kid (whom she and Mr. decided to be drunk loser) had turned into a road; that tone-deaf Ann schmozed with Peggy Lee; or the terrible CGI cryptan Annie who looks at her younger self! I never bought Danes as a younger Redgrave. I did not buy Richardson and Collett as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, she should get her mother to give her a few lessons! I had no idea why a girl (or Buddy) could become a fool of the stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughter is as buzzing and rude as she is, Luc is a slow crack robbery, and I did not care about any of them! In the evening, Chick Flicks gives the wrong name!
