Fine casting can not resurrect this routine story of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact, in this one-sided story about novels and murders, there are more questions than answers; and as we only provide one of these questions to the prosecution, none of these questions will be answered. This is a type of fare that appeals to America's "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs. As mentioned, it is the story of an innocent woman who has just become "caught" in romanticism with a married, prominent lawyer. Is it possible that if she were not two friends who had a boyfriend and a relationship with a married man, could he avoid a possible murderous and cruel incident? When you look at it, do not worry about going into the refrigerator, it will not miss you.
