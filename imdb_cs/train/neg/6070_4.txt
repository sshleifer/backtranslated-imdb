Tony Scott manages a sports thriller to attract fans who are not athletes. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too damn slow. Get up well! The outside looks like a dissatisfied merchant (Robert De Niro) while inside is a fan of the psychological San Francisco Giants. Next comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and a designated rescuer from irritation. Our trader carries a murderous obsession when a hard starving star falls into the worst fall of his career and the giants are afraid of falling apart. De Niro is terrorized. Snipes seems to be very natural as a ball. Other prominent personalities include Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... so enjoy yourself. Violence and a very strong language can be expected and you get money.
