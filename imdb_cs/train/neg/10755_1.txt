I can not really think of any redemption of the features of this utterly bad rendition of Asimov rather than the artistic direction. Forget the disaster of product placement, unconvincing performance from Will Smith and gargantuan holes. It was not just ridiculous and painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mix of MTV inspired production values ​​and a totally bad dialogue is likely to be directed at very young children. What a pity that sci-fi bad can still be made after we had Bladerunner, the Minority Report or, to a lesser extent, Dark City (the same director). This really belongs to the list of 100 most important. Really terrible.
