It was a pretty scary movie; I found the music to be effective. The photographs Mario had taken from the village were also disturbing. But I have three problems with this movie. One of them is that the lighting was very dark, so sometimes it was hard to tell what was going on, but that might have been my copy. The second is that the very beginning is not very well explained, and I still do not know what's going on. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but apparently some people are doing it. Of course, there are also the usual problems of people who are doing stupid things, and male leadership is in the 70s. Everything in all, observable, but not so close to being popular.
