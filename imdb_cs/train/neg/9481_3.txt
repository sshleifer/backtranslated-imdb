James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a "mental illness facility" for a medical headquarters with Dr. McCortem (Bruce Paynes). There, he realizes that many trainees are killing "The Ripper," which takes their souls to the devil, in a cult supported by Dr. McCord. This story is so absurd that it is impossible to write a summary. Dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, the blond fiancé of James Bishop, comes to the asylums that it is almost unbelievable that the writer has the courage to include them in the script. And what about returning James to the hospital to bring in the files of the dead patients? And the cast composed of ham actors and actresses? Frankly, I do not know who and who is the worst in this movie: script, director or cast. The correct answer is certainly everyone. I've seen this movie on cable TV and I'm surprised how a producer can spend money in such garbage. This horror movie becomes very funny because of the absurd conspiracy. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): 'Demônio' (`Devil ')
