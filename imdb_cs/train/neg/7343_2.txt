Have you ever heard of Taiwan's horror? Or some Taiwanese film? Apparently for some reason. This was really boring, even though he had black magic, including the dried bodies of a baby and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. When I read other people's thoughts, I was looking forward to some violence and gore, but not much at all. Some bleeding and other fragile things, if you expect graphic ghosts or some ghastly effects, will be disappointed. They clearly did not use the blast of eel and other things to their maximum power. <br /> <br /> Nothing good about this movie; the only character that was not completely dull and a few OK black magic spells as well as the eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The figures were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horrible aspect did not work at all, the most frightening thing was an albino girl (not so scary). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
