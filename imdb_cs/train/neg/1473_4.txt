Thematic kinematic cinematography since its founding consists in a genre involving seductive women whose burglary and means attract sentient men not only into their hands but also in the various circumstances that will generally endanger the male victims, together with the uncertainty of whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medication, and Susan Lucci appears here as a siren, though her actor's chops from the pedigree of soap making are not enough to make her performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), the nonconflict wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a passion for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), just for him but a hearty affair for Richard, apparently enchanted by his mistress, while she uses his ardor by engaging him in risky conspiracies that are projected into the murder scheme. When Davis becomes convinced that Isabelle is the victim of a physical abuse managed by her husband, she desperately tries to free her from what she considers to be a marital trap to take her alone and believes that the only clear solution to his difficult situation will appear in the rudimentary an essay on recruiting a professional killer who will have allegedly violent Stewart. Due to the attack on Collins, who is about to strike, two police detectives, starring Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, are becoming more and more curious about Isabelle's involvement in this crime, while reality begins to shine on Richard, to pay a dear price in exchange for maneuvering his inamoraty. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly occupied as a viable pair of conspirators, each of which gives a boredom that makes it boring rather than a charming set of turtles, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer a strong twist in a movie that suffers from a script, non-invasive directional and structural elements. Released on DVD Fremantle, this predominantly hopeless affair, which portrays man under the spell of magic, benefits from superior visual and audio quality, and although no other features are available, superior production quality enhances the capability of cameraman Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
