As a person reading the book, I can say that it is considerably worse than the big American version with Gwyneth Paltrow. There are different reasons for this. First, Emma is too uncomfortable. Yes, he has mistakes and is not the simplest guy he likes - but the viewer should not despise it from scratch. Secondly, Mr. Knightly is bad. His excitement and melancholy in this version are better adapted to the adaptation of Bronte or Gaskell than Austen and throw the mood of the whole affair. Thirdly, Samantha Morton is too much an actress to be doomed to the role of Harriet; and why should she look so bad? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she had to end up on the next scene. Fourth, the structure was broken and the scenes were shortened. In the end, when Emma decides he loves Mr. Knightly, he finds it completely incomprehensible, because this story has not been portrayed enough and carried around the film. Fifth, what is actually going on with Mrs. Elton? It was based on the fact that she sounded like an American actress who was trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, all on the American halfway and then back to English at the end. Finally this was dragged to the end. The book and the big film version ends with the famous Emmy and Mr. Knightly. This version is sorry after the announcement of marriage without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a rather random attempt. Read the book or instead upload the Paltrow version
