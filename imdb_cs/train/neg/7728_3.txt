.... this mini does not improve with age. I saw it and it was a continuation when it was originally broadcast and like so many others were blown away. At the beginning of 2002 I borrowed novels for WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. Then I decided I had to see again and invest $ 200 plus on a DVD set. I was looking at both mines again with painful details, and I realized I had done things back - I had to buy novels and borrow a DVD. Do not believe it is totally wrong? Read the novels and see yourself. Do not you think it's dated? Take a look at it for someone who is not old enough to see it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get (warnings - reactions from such people range from screaming to laughing). this mini-Dan Curtis himself has chosen Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Production Quality, Music Scenario, Dialogue - A great story has been transformed into the late 70th edition of the series by an overly ambitious producer / director who was overhead. This thing was dated when it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great when it was originally broadcast, and those of us who saw them drew a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days. IMO - This mini fails to meet its reputation and is really disappointed.
