This image reminds me of Keneth More picture of 1957, The Admirable Crighton, "while on the ship was a servant and became a master on the island, and after he was saved, he returned to the servant, when an image appeared, Madonna can not act, this is it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it was a fine copy of "The Admirable Crighton," but it sure looks like it was, and if that's the case, then Hollywood must have some ideas and it's sad to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just that it failed in all corners and details. <br /> <br /> The script is relaxed and the acting is average and the script should be placed through While many of them have preserved Madonna for her acting, I think that in films like "Their Own League" quite good and pleasant and "Who is the Girl" showed that Madonne's style is not see Madonny's other movies are not so fun and I'd like to see the Madonna series Animation with the character "Who's the Girl" I love the music of these two films, but the "Death" stayed at the bottom of the pile here and it will stay. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a bomb in order?
