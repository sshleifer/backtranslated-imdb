This movie is the worst movie, but it's very high for me. So it should be a movie slasher. It takes place at a university where there seems to be only a handful of students. Teachers are stupid than a hammer bag. It is filled with a good Catholic priest, sexually suppressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clich√© that it's hard to believe I could predict the lines in quotes. Slashings have some creativity and they seem to spin around the sting of people in the genitals. Lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for fun time. Get a cheap beer case and a couple of friends, watch it and laugh.
