When this guy can make a movie, then I'll definitely do it. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> 2) I will not do too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find that it's just a dream I think HorrorVision he had about four scenes, and since the movie was just an hour long, the ratio of dreams to film was quite high, and if I decide to make a dream I will make sure that you wake up without clothes I want to tell who's sleeping in <br /> <br /> 3) I will not rip any movies like Star Wars or Matrix, because I will know that my budget is small and I do not want to mask my contempt for high-volume Hollywood movies by adding satirical links about me. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, I do not have to Undead to mix modern technology, I think a palm pilot might be just as scary ... at least, that they turned it into a bad gauge before the screen exploded or something. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.
