I'm on a "bad" horror film, but it was just a bunch of dogs! How can someone call this movie cool or decent is outside of me. If you like hurry editing that covers special effects, bad gaming and bad scenario, go for it! There was no tension and the gore factor was ridiculous because it was so fake. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek into a pile every day. My partner walked away in about 20 minutes when he knows he has one stink. On the other hand, I was stupidly sitting around the movie just to wait and see if it was better. No luck! I did not watch his next Torched movie and I doubt if I'm bothering now.
