Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a chef for a pirate ship that took over the captain after murdering the previous one. Although he witnessed a treasure burial, he began to lose his memory, and the treasure map he got was empty. So Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with the clergy (place an advertisement on it?) And help guide the treasure. It's awful how anyone could bankroll this nonsensical movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan has replaced Medaka as the director, and due to Medak's talent in The Ruling Class, you may have guessed which of the mature, illuminated scenes Milligan had in the director's chair. Peter Boyle appears briefly in the film as the first ten minutes as a captain of the pirates. He is probably quite grateful that young Frankenstein was released the same year he was filmed and preserved to save it. Franciosa looks modestly like a handsome mechanic behind a scraper, but he and the dealers both look pretty desperate, even makeup and the Sellers' hair looks pretty awful. They had to know that this film was bombarding even though they were filming. With such lines I understand any possible difficulty: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (probably hanging) You pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I will do it for free. And that's one of the good jokes. I am amazed that most of the sales materials are still in the vaults, but it was available on VHS more than 15 years ago! What if someone joins a plate and releases a well-received British television program "A Show Called Fred" in the US, played by Sellers, Milligan and the great Richard Lester?
