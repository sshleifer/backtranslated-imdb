The female idea was a terrible actress who caused the film to be average. When she first appeared in front of the cameras she smiled too much to talk about her daughter. This should cause her to suspect the police. I would be uncompromising in the same situation. She seemed to be quiet for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was like she did not want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would play her role better. And that would mean much more money for such a controversial and important subject. Everyone else was great. I do not know where she is the main actress, but I hope she has some acting lessons.
