It's a rather boring film about a scientist who creates a teleportation device and is terribly malformed when using a machine to transport itself. A simple plot made earlier in flying and more. Not only has he disfigured, he can also electrolyze people with a touch. What's really silly about this movie is that we think we think the place this guy is working on is against him. He could probably make millions for the institution he works for, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his teleporter at every step. Eventually, the person who is projected electrically curses three people without reason and goes after those who have hurt him.
