Something that I really love about the short films of this woman was the obscurity of the subject - especially in "Life with Happiness". This movie has some nice beginnings - an unusual location and potential for special film therapy, but it can not manage with clumsy interpretation dialogue, disordered performances and very television coverage. It is again a charming TV and a very ordinary cinema. Thoughts are so developed that they almost feel like they're TV commercials. But the feeling is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I really would like to see that this director shot the whole animation and tried to work with a producer that does not require so much boring clarity.
