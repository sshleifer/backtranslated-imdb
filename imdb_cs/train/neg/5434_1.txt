Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few people. - The script removed two main characters from the book. - The plot was grotesquely changed. - Voice sounds as if they were directly raised from written passages (they can read well but are not the same when they talk, especially with the Chabon style of writing). - The acting is more wooden than log. (Esp. Bechstein) - To be determined in 1983 ??? He feels more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I could not wait for this movie, so it's possible that he himself redeemed ... (sarcasm). I really hope that nobody will pay this, or at least someone who reads the book and hoped to be something decent (and la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but ASHAMED should be this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No stars.
