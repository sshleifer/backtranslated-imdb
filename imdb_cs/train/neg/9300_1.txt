Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (no heart). Flashes are terrible. Music is very bad (piano and orgy ... come on!). Acting is ... well, there is no acting! There's a man who actually goes to the forest to look for his missing wife and spend time with sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat, insignificant clown who could not overcome the turtle! <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is stupid and the director effortlessly puts on the film all the cliches of the slasher films. <br /> <br /> The end is as stupid as it ever was. Think about it: The kid (ken hebert) who plays the skill is probably the same as his (it's the brain behind this flop), invites a co-worker and two of his buddies to his quarters for a week and kills them. On Monday morning, she returns to the office as if nothing happened. The tragedy is that Mr. HÃ©bert attempts to make us believe that it is a family matter that continues for generations (his uncle is a clown killer), so of course the police will not be doubting what his coworker is missing ... < br /> <br />
