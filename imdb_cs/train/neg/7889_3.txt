I just watched this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I'm really disappointed with it. I do not know why anyone would shoot such a movie. It was marginal fun, but I feel that the people who did it had lots of disagreements about what they were doing. The Monday writer was in charge; Tuesday, Director; Wednesday, the one who gets the coffee; etc. It almost seems like they really wanted to make some different movies, but they only had time and money to do. Someone else commented that acting was really good, but I would disagree. And again, if actors could keep a straight face during the shoot, they may be better actors than I give them. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie is a secret ... something similar to the historical law and order or national treasure. It starts this way but then nothing happens to the wrong episode of the Twilight Zone or ... what was the next show that was not that good ... Bad Episode The Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it's just played. There's a bad guy with white hair. There is an interest in love, which when it first appears, the wind actually blows its hair. Seriously. Once you realize that it is a Christian film, the end is also quite easy. Cinematography was badly done, especially in the opening scenes - a way to put your best foot forward. For most of the movie it was not ugly, but there was sometimes a frantic bad shot of the old lady, praying, arms in the dark room, while the lighting is amazing - something that just a little embarrassment to watch the movie.
