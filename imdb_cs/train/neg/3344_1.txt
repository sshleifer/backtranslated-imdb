I should predict this by being a fan of Dolph Lundgren. This person will show some of the most entertaining action clich√©s that can be imagined, and detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler *, although there is no such thing as a spoiler Dolph, because scenarios are as pointless as the beginning: chase scene with a handicapped child carrying a gun versus a fellow on Harley with a machine gun, over a high school corridor and the child wins? Good game, Oscar goes into custody. Dolph, if you read this, thanks for laughing, an old friend. Overall: An amazing film that is a guaranteed laugh. I suggest that I summon some friends for this and force them to sit with him. Hilarious.
