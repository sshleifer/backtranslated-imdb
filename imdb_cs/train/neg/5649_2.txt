I do not think it's bad at the show under the right conditions. First I tolerated the first season. Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not lawyers. God forbids anyone to really go to law school on the basis of these performances, which I heard when I was watching some interviews about the show. It just made me upset a little. Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be stars of the show, are the most unpleasant. While it may be a compliment in some situations, it is certainly not here. Their constant harassment at the show is fun first. But because that's what they're doing literally all the time, I realize it's as deep as watching the show. I'm trying to distract some serious, dramatic and even torn moments amid this mockery of a real show, I can not compensate for the progressive loss of interest I've been experiencing when I look forward to the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore is a spectacular and gratuitous "public service announcement" where he reflects his views are impressive. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for the writer's show due to Crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit. I give two stars because there are moments when I thought the show was trying to deal with some of the current problems were done with care. I think the show's writers have realized that the sexual harassment that Denny and Alan have demonstrated has come to those who have become more accustomed from the beginning. The thing is, I do not care if the treatment of sexual harassment proves to be good, but I just felt that the author insulted me with the artificial implantation of sex shows throughout the show in the hope that my libido would keep me back for more. I'm no longer a teen, and I think this show is promising if its goal is not to satisfy the lowest common denominator to get a rating. Of course, I write it on my own, realizing that she really does not improve. It's a pity because it's one of those shows I'd like to love.
