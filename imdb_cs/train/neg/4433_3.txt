I really wanted to like this movie much more than I did. It's because I like dirty foreign comedies - especially the strange ones that surprise you. However, although I was often surprised, it was almost never a pleasant surprise. I reminded her of the park that almost every social norm was violated until they were the only ones to go through, too ill to be entertaining. For example, after examining adultery, drug abuse (almost any kind - from pot, heroin, speed to bonding), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc. The film came to the fun theme of pedophilia. Mom encouraged one son (who looked about 12 years old) to sleep with the neighboring men. Actually, at one place in the movie, this dentist gives a dentist instead of paying for dental work! Funny?! Are you kidding. This movie goes too far and interferes with the "black hole of comedy". What should be the fun of other, tumor or rectal tumors?
