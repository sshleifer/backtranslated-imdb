Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually unbelievable animated film in the current release of home cinema. The works of art and effects are revolutionary and I recommend that you thank this film for the visual effects itself. And now for the bad news. I really do think that when I say animation is the only thing that this movie is about. Maybe you remember that "The Spirit" was badly seized last summer by "Lilo and Stitch". The first person to claim that it was because Disney is more well established and has better advertising can write me four long essays titled "Why" Lilo and Stitch's script did not squeeze. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For all the incredible new animation technologies on the Spirit display, the story is almost * awesome * boring.There is a lesson and (not to be mentioned) that it does not only apply to animated movies. exciting visual effects that sometimes love the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and more important, it does not matter your attitude, it's a bad movie Simple Animation is still exciting I can not wait to see what someone is doing with greater imagination.
