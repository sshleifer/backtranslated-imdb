OMG is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of being a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie should be in this movie? Did she need the bad money? I like AJ and saw almost everything that was in the past so I watched this was 2. It was bad! neither bad nor bad. It had 1 or 2 funny moments, but it was all bad and a loss of 101 minutes. I can not even say that AJ looked good because I did not. This conspiracy is predictable if you do not expect repeated narratives of Romeo and Juliet, then his no. Everyone is disappointed. Maybe if it was 12, it could be a good movie, otherwise I really do not recommend it.
