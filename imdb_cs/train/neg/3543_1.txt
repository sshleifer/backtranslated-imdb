He's lying for several years. I have never been moved to broadcast here before, so maybe this movie is worth a star but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD when I did not want it in movies because of illness, and I've never been able to watch it until now. I have not read about it, I have definitely never thought of the film in some months. Just what a friend picked up at a store was watched. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The shot I was talking about in the summary is in the trailer and the poster. Jason Statham has brown hair. Just like in any other GR movie. Or some JS movie I've seen. At least not in the quantities shown here. And Ray Liotta in lingerie should be warned in advance. It's terrifying and fun, but not ha-ha-humor. Its more in almost TheOffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failing-sort-of-humor way. Each of them says the same thing: "This movie is not as you would expect this movie." Based on previous, extensive film watching, I expected this film to be a few things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> > () Something more important than a varied bunch of poorly implemented bytes of what is just a standard Eastern mystical ideology, dressed as "a cool, modern, self-confident artistic form"; <br /> () Hopefully it is better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you probably thought according to your tone, you could not thoroughly check any of the fields above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Badly modified {pace all over the shop, 70s amateur high-8 jump cuts, incomprehensible "conspiracy" "twist !!!" (x) It is roofed as if compressed by a 14-year-old goth who has just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard. (x) So with my own interest in the whole motif "I'm really smart, I", it's determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so just to make sure stupid people (ie, everyone who does not like them) in the audience Make sure they get it <br /> <br /> (x) Real time wastage. <br /> <br /> As for the indisputable ability of some people to "get" something out of it, all right. I'm glad you enjoyed it. One poster said something that attracted me: under 25, it probably seemed better for editing. Perhaps, but the adjustment should make your work more accessible, no less. As for "Genius is only recognized by enlightened" brigade, go onions and grow up. There is nothing more confused and self-serving than people who say that another person does not know great art because he does not understand the "craft / materials / moon cycle / fibers of the highest rational thinking" that "auteur / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant" to explain his "vision / spectacular scheme / unity with Gaea / the great big bucket of dog patients". For me and many, many more people, their garbage. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, anything designed to be viewed by other people is to be involved and moving. In any sense, be metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you have yourself. The only way he moved me was forward in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable extinction. "The biggest trick you ever drew was that you think every part of this movie means something for everyone." And now, please, please toast for me.
