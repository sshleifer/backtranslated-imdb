Can A-Pix ever do anything right? This movie was to be seen on television in a mailbox format. Since A-Pix does not even believe in imaging and scanning, we see the whole scene where the shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks with the shoulder on the right. Of course, you are not too much absent. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very hard to enjoy a movie where the characters were screaming at the top of the lungs during 80% of the film without reason.
