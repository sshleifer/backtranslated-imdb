This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (Still working on it.) However, despite being true, it's still a movie and that's a movie. I realize that independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only, even average, is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he could not compensate that all the actors (including the one who played him as a young man) were utterly shameful. You have admitted that the script was terribly clich√©, but you still have to get a few decent actors! I do not recommend anyone because it's so bad in every category. Read some books about the true story of S. Mason because they give these men the respect they deserve.
