I am a big fan of old horror, and since the middle ages I have been filmed before 1970, most of which were made in 1920-1960. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception to Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could recall the stories there, but I really really enjoyed the monster in the boxing story with Hal Holbrook, and also the really pure guy was a great end. All the stories were great. So why did I like it so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was wrong, the horrors were reinforced with a narrow face with terrible fear and the funny bits were really funny! This continuation is either completely missing or completely missing! I'm writing it only because I watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like writing a movie review on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamoure get a top-of-the-line invoice, he tells you something ... 4 of 10. Also Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they had to call him to tune to the standard PG ád innovative ← do not pretend, There are no translations available.This is a new version of the Human Mediation Assembly. Count data: It is shown on the Encore cable channel if you can do it (yuck yuck).
