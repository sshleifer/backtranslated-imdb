This movie has a lot of great adult stars, but you can not care how the adult film should have. Among all the stars you could not get your kicks from all the scenes. The film is shot in a middle-aged dream that is embarrassingly cheesy. Playing is worse than Keanu Reeves, sexual scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor about their child at college, and the dialogue is worse than I've seen in the movie. The plot was also ten times worse. I would join the amateur journey. The audio comment was useless because it is a skin film, but it was also bad. If there's no passionate Jenny Jameson fan, there's not much. 4/10
