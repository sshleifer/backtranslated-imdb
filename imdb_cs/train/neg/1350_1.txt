This film is basically about the arch-nemesis Dr. Claw, who has returned to the present-day peaceful city of Metropolis after many years. Claw's plan is to get rid of Gadget once and for all, using a new "colder" criminal to help destroy the popularity of Gadget. The film is sadly disappointed, the series was great, but 20 years later it was revived with tragic results. Without the voice of Mr. Don Adams as Inspector of Gadget it simply does not cut; Dr. Claw is not only visually less frightening, but rather sounds like a cold wrestler than his original intimidating self. Since it's a kid's movie, the story is so painfully weak (heaven forbid, let's mention animation) that it fades compared to the original series. Someone has decided to update Penny also for two decades to speed, she now has some quasi-punk insurgency clothing and is not playing half the role she has done in the TV series. Gadgetmobile speaks, as does the engagement angle that focuses on entire calls. Maybe I'm just a little boy who loved the show that grew up, but I thought the live version was more painful than me, but now they're going and going full watering of good-quality TV shows to us. It's more than I can take.
