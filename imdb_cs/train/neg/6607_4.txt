It's not as bad as some of them make it, though apparently pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as a villain Babban Singh - try not to compare with Gabbart in the original because it obviously did not show the same effect. In addition to some scenes with average action, the rest of the movie is flawed. Character development was bad and story development was hopeless, with lots of gaps and missing information that I would not know if I did not read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the film was the supporting role of Nisha Kothari and, in particular, this new friend named Prashant Raj. Nisha is simply annoying from the moment her lips opened for the first time. As for Prashant Raj - seriously, who is that guy? where does he come from and from where he is present in the film studio for someone other than serving drinks? His acting ability is zero and has the same tone, dialogue delivery and a solid expression in every scene, whether it's action, comedy or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions have changed, which is more than I can say for his partner's mistake. overall, Aag RGV is very attentive to Amitabha's solid performance and also a very sexy Matuskar in a special form.
