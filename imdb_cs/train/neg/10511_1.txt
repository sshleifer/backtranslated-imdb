Note for Horror Fans: The only horror is when you realize that you have lost 95 minutes of your life on a movie that is so worthless that it is insulting. I was looking at it because: <br /> <br /> The premise sounds faintly promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same bits of other low-budget slasher films that were also not good. <br /> <br /> The promise of bare forest nymphs sounded pleasant, even if the film turned out to be terrible: It's not so. Amateur cinematography ensures that "fallen angels" are about as sexy as average homeless. The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He is the king of low-budget special effects and a lower budget. Think about it, Savini should be the reason to watch this movie. It's not like it's bad, but it's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in "From Dusk Till Dawn," and he has made milking on horror conventions ever since. But let's focus on the positive: Forest the Damned is a great example of how NOT make film. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously, the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all after the first 10 minutes. But clueless cultivation; the way the director regards "plot" and "characterization" as a harassment that he thinks no one cares about; and unbelievably long and boring rides, walking and natural sequences (undoubtedly added to increase time to qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of ability for film and narrative in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of the number one way you can find out if the movie is wrong: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect the garbage.
