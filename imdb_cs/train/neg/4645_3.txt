Belmondo is a hard cop. He goes after a big drug store (played by Henry Silva, normally a big villain - he sees "Sharky's machine," but here he is clearly dubbed, and he misses his usual charisma). He goes to the saddest places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, beats some people, gets names, goes to more spectacular places, asks for more names, beats more people, etc. The whole movie is a punch after a strike. It seems that the people who did it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50, has some good pieces at the beginning; except for those "Le Marginal" is a violent, episodic, tortuous, shallow and forgotten cop. (* 1/2)
