Even with cocaine tethered in 1980, it is pathetic. I do not understand why anyone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells on the audience to do so. If you do a comedy, do it funny. To film such waste, hold it for yourself. If you are going to relax as a joke like this: DO NOT GO !!! I think it was a joke, right? Somebody tell me it was a joke. Please.
