this movie was terrible. I could barely stay awake. I would never have seen this movie if I had been paid. The so-called horror scenes in it were incredibly predictable and playable. There was nothing in the movie that would make it original, or at the price of $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Do not stay on it, do not borrow it, do not read it online, because some of these things would be a complete waste of time. Sarah Michelle Geller has performed poorly and she really ought to be ashamed of defaming her good name with this film. Let Sarah endure for joining this terrible, terrible movie. A horrible film does not have to be seen at all.
