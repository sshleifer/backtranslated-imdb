... when he remakes Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). The reworking of Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help the scenario that was "dated" at the age of 34 50. This sad movie has entire scenes raised from the original with many supporting actors recurring their roles if they were not dead. Although older, it did not seem to matter to the directors. Neither the cars and the 1934-style plates did not look as if they were in the 1950s. Even the singing "der Bingel" can not redeem this effort. <br /> <br /> We rated both original and remake IMDb Four **** Stars. Frank's touch was long gone, and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Capra. After he began working on some educational documents in the 1950s, he finished his career and transformed LADY FOR DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again, the subtle cast was released, that the IMDB Six ****** Star Efforts also compares the originals of the Eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it's better to stop when you've been ahead of us, right after the UNITED STATES (1948).
