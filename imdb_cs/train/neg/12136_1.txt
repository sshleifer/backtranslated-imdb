I saw this movie at t.v. this afternoon, and I do not see how anyone can sit through this waste. It's not funny at all and it takes I.Q. several notches. I know this movie is for children, but that does not mean that writers should consider their intelligence as a matter of course. I bet the writers sat around a large wooden table and thought that a) The word "poop" is equal to a big laugh. b) A twenty-five-strong kid can rely on a ten-foot basketball net. c) Children should always fight the gunmen with armed weapons because the hijackers fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to defeat the so-called "ninjas" with swords. One good thing I can say about this film is that it contains the weakest suburban "gang" in a world that can not scare anyone. Perhaps the guys from MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh. Do not bother with this chrome pretext for the movie.
