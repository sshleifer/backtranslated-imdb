Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a pistol in her mouth that blows her head on her friend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of the rock band "Demons and Death," who could not shake the sad feelings of her friend's neglect to her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve it differently than to make a bullet on my head). She returns but has the soul of Dory (Jill Small), her girlfriend to replace her on the vocals so the band can finish the album with the premature death of Cassidy. But Cassidy has made a deal with the dark and the souls are gathered ... it is ruined by this anger especially against Neal, but all band members or somebody in the music studio are dead when they become prey for which they believe it is rather upset by Dora. Cassidy return to return. Lousy micro-budget horror movie looks cheap, has a cheap cast that should make plans in a different line of work, and boasts cheap kill-scenes that are not effective one bit.
