OK, when I saw the previews of this movie, I thought it looked really scary and I was quite excited to see how it was a group I was with. Now I live in America, especially during these elections, I see some very deceptive things, but I have to say that these insights were at the top of the list. I do not understand how so many people might be afraid of this movie. I only really did record two real jump scenes and I just jumped to one. The whole movie was extremely predictable, and it may have spoiled some jumps for me. As for the sound effects of so many people who were so scared, I thought they were the best in comics. Ah and uhh catboy, where did it come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie must be a strange moan. How does anyone scare you? I can easily do this noise. Do not let me go bad I always loved all the really bad scary movies that were just going down all the way, but I did not even think that's what it was that was just bad.
