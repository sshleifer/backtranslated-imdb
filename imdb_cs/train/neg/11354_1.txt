I, I have also stood for hundreds of children's films in the past, I think it is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I hate that today I have to explain to my children that Russia is not "bad people". Also, the mocking Russian names like "Poopchev" are inappropriate. 2) The birthday grandfather's scene lay in quasport, in which he suggested that men drank beer and women talking by phone. Two other flies also use the word "bullshit" unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole movie boasts of 1950 stereotypes and propaganda, which I thought we as a nation were proud of going upstairs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In all of this, it is just crude, badly animated, still badly written, and it is not worth the time for a tour.
