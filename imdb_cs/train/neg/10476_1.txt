I am Christian. But I have always been skeptical about the films that the cartoon has created. As a rule, this is "know-how" in terms of film production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus positively and honestly on the screen. However, they do a terrible job of doing so. The game was terrible, and if the Bible did not happen in any way, one could not understand what the movie was trying to get. Not only was the film scary, but the people who did it even had some bad facts. However, in this "critique" these facts are inevitable and too deep to submerge. In short, Omega code is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen, and I would not recommend it except for the comical relief of everyday grinding.
