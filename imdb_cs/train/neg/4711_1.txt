I really do not like this show! I watched one episode, and I knew this show was terrible. Story lines are badly written and executed, and jokes are really bad ... I think it's just the job of Dexter's lab and Johnny Quest, an unpleasant boy with fiery blonde hair with twins of a genius nurse and a talking dog; home father and intelligent, super-busy mom ... Like oh-my-flippin'-God! Their father is mother-f ** kin 'a crazy home creator, not so gay! If my dad is at home, I would personally die! With the shame that is ... I really would. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else ... this travesty but only 3 words; count them 3 words to describe: <br /> <br /> · Lame, · stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I can say to people, I'm definitely making my list of the worst animated EV-ER series! If I had it.
