Blue Monkey (1987) or "Invasion of the BodySuckers", as it is known here in the UK, was a pretty boring horror film about an old man who hids some mysterious toxic plant in the greenhouse !!!! The man got into the hospital where this worm as a creature comes out of his mouth, of course it turns into this insect monster and continues on. Despite the fact that Steve Railsback and John Vernon are in the movie, I find it boring, with a flat predictable story, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects, and lack of action !!!! Horror fans do not really have to watch this rare movie down, you will not miss the power to trust me! I give this movie 2/10.
