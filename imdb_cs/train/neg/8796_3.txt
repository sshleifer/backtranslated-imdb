Average viewers who are looking for some sense of inner coherence in the movie should probably pass this passage. It creates the same feeling as looking at the curious set of individual pictures that seem to have a relationship to each other but never flow into totality. While this insulating approach to creating some kind of cinematic assemblage can appeal to a few students or critics immersed in the inner language of contemporary filmmaking, it is absolutely irritating and condescending to us ordinary people who have just fallen from the haywagon. Apparent avoidance of availability can be a deliberate feature of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but it is up to me when Andy Warhol warmed up. The only redemption I find is in the production value, and you just will not just cut it all by yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions that you watch and listen to and anxiously await and vain for some clever development of thought or thought to keep all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Excuse me. Calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to crumble, just as your interest begins to mix. I have the same big yawn and let me read what I think are very well informed and thorough comments about this movie that never make anything really understandable. Ideas and images without any external context are not my idea of ​​entertainment. Call me a philistine who is roaming in the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl with a knife bitch. <br /> <br />
