In half an hour, I probably remember how I thought: "Hey, this could really be Bill Reban's best ever!" The initial sequences are atmospheric, some horrifying moments immediately appear, and our director makes a playful reference to his own notorious "Giant Spider Invasion" arsonist. The concept is stealthily stolen from a "house on a haunted hill" by William's Castle with three old and extremely bored millionaires who attract nine losers to an isolated castle and win a $ 1,000,000 elimination game. Of course, participants are starting to disappear quickly and one by one, and the remaining greedy bone men take too long to realize that the old people are sadistic ... or that there is another killer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange storyteller who tells a lot of senseless things that are not relevant or even interesting for the plot, but there is some nice T & A in the first ten minutes, a silly bumbo (Shelly, I believe it is called) really watchful. After the first half of an hour, it naturally becomes inevitable, and "Cold" turns into a Rebane textbook with delayed conspiracy plot, deepest dialogues at all, and a complete lack of excitement. There was no budget for bloody murderous sequences, but our multi-talented director (?) Is trying to compensate for the endless record of disco dancing and amateur rock bands. The film also has four or even five different culminations, and none of them are satisfying. Maybe it was the inspiration for LOTR: Returning the King? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
