He has often voted the biggest Chinese film ever by Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from outside, and frankly, I do not know at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodrams I had imagined, steadfastly steered, and acted with full horror for the heroes. Wei Wei (laughing) is a turtle, a young married woman who has suffered for several years along with her tuberculous husband (Yu Shi). It's after the end of World War II and they live with a teenage sister husband (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house with not much money (the man was rich when he got married). Next comes the old best husband (Wei Li), who was also a wife when they were young. She thinks she is running away from her husband while her husband is unconscious and thinks she can join her little sister with her boyfriend. This is the setting and it's not anywhere you would not expect. Actually, I saw the remake, director Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian. It's running about half an hour longer, and it's actually boring, but at least it was nice. This supposed classic is quite unbearable.
