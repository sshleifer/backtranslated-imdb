I saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. It was rated X for a short scene involving oral sex, but played in the main streams (it was an "artistic" movie). I suppose it's the first movie ever to show a respected actress in an explicit sexual scene. What I saw was a boring story about a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (of course) with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As already mentioned, Detmers is very beautiful with a good body, but she also has a very good performance. Pitzalis was (poorly said) very poor. No wonder he never made another movie. Yet, despite the infamous sex scene (which is clear but very short), this slow moving boring story, which bored me stupidly. Good deal with Detmers just helped to a point. Mostly I looked at my watch, patiently waiting for it to end. If she did not have this sequence, this movie would have long forgotten. Boring and slow. You can skip this option.
