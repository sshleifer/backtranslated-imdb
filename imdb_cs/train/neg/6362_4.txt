I am a great fan of Italian films from the 1970s and I would not hesitate to have a beautiful Barbara Bouchet among the favorite actresses of all time, so I got into it with hope. In the meantime, however, it is obvious that this is a mostly unnecessary film that is not coming anywhere. Obviously, nobody would have expected much more, but the fact that it was useless is more annoying when you think it's also a bit boring and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on "rogue"; in this case, the one who steals, raises and smuggles things. This is basically the whole conspiracy that this movie has. The film has the true style of the 1970s and the idea that everything is very carefree is coming well. Sometimes it seems that directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson are trying to overcome some point, although what's in place is not very good. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and that's also the case here; she is definitely the best on the movie and the sequence in which the car hangs naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the style of the 1970's but unfortunately has little to offer.
