I saw this movie and I thought it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. I was so bad! This film was boring and apparently aimed at men who like to look at the corpulent women. The story was so ridiculous and unlikely that I totally lost interest. It seemed to be in the same genre as the films Ed Wood - the bottom of the barrel.
