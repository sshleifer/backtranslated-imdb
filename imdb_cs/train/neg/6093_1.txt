This must be the BEST movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD and it did not work, well the DVD was working fine, it was not really a movie, it's actually so bad that I thought some of the actors had worked (or before acting from acting) since then. There is no real plot that we should not talk about, and no real horror. Production values ​​are garbage even for low-budget film where some external scenes are hard to hear because of the wind on the microphone. Overall, it was such a bad movie that the viewer could think it was that which would become porn if they did not know better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie that are fun, both of them are about a transvestite prostitute. (Although barely worth watching all 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> As far as DVD marketing is concerned, I feel confidently deceived. I think I read back, I expected it would be bad: He chose his weapons. He chose his victims. He raised his nose. He has changed to GIRL! But I thought it might be funny. Also, the case claims to be digitally reworked, I'd like to see it in advance, the print is so grainy that you can use it as sandpaper. The case also says it's an absolutely disgusting movie in which sense ?, disgusting production, acting. This movie remains welcome in the first five minutes, (if you are thinking of buying this I would buy 'bad taste' instead it is a much better movie and it's funny, also it has Peter Jackson the director of LOTR in it.) By the way, if anyone knows anything about any actor (or director of Patrick J Mathews) and what have they been doing since then please enter here how would I know just to find out if there is a worse movie or if someone in this movie ever bothered to learn to act
