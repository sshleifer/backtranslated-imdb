!!!!! KURZU JSOU SPOILERY !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screen-writing workshop to exclude clichés in horror films: Female protagonist - Check for bad things that happen to drug recipients - Check Heorine for tapping the villain - Check Heroine for not seeing the bad guy, which recovers unconsciousness. sequence, so we can see that a fallen villain creeps behind a hero - Check Unfortunately, it seems that someone sent this list of clichés to the film studio instead of using it for the class. Dear, dear, if only London traffic was as regular as the clichés that appear here. In fact, there is so much cliché and it was all seen before a moment when nobody thought that he would get into the details of what is creep of the same name, or how long he kills people underground. I am convinced that it is the result of a human experiment, and perhaps until that night, it will decide to avenge humanity, but everything is so vague that it makes no sense. Not to be completely negative, I very much doubt the producers thought they would make a movie that would be screening Oscars this year, and there is always a horror movie market. Likewise, I doubt if it costs too much production and has one eye on the DVD market, rather than the distribution of cinemas, and I say it's a bit better than the 1972 DEATH LINE, which also featured murderous cannibal shelters in the London Underground. it's just that if you think all the clichés were used in this movie, another cliché comes to raise his ugly head
