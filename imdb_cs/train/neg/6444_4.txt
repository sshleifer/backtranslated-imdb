Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of the academic community, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their interviews are held with their classmates and college faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is an excellent example of a disillusioned student who assesses the entire community on the basis of limited contact with a small number of its members. The documentary focused on a small group of people who were portrayed as representing large groups of people. As is customary, people who scream the most get the greatest attention of the media. Apart from the good judgment of the community in which the film was filmed, the document was well worked out. My only controversy lies in the fact that the feelings and upheavals that appear in the film are attributed to the whole community rather than just to the few people who have expressed them. Naturally, it is important to explore such a discussion and to make people aware of the differences that exist between political considerations, but it is ridiculous to involve the whole community of people in the action of several radicals.
