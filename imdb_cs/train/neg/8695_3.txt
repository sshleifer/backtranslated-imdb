Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of the entire law and the ADA, and her acting is even worse. Her attempts to accent Texas are amateurish and unrealistic. Neither can she sufficiently excite the intense emotions needed to play the mother of the abducted child; sometimes, when her daughter is missing, she can only ring in annoyed anguish, as if she can not remember where she left her keys. This is an important true story, so it's terrible that the horrible acting of the acting manager turns away so much from the news. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but simply can not overcome Rohm's tendency to simply lie on a particularly strong imitation of the southern seizure whenever real action is required.
