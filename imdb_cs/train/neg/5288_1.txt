My God, was it "Run, Lola, Run" adaptation of Persuasion? It was awful. It is useless that the "scriptwriter" (and I use the term very loosely) cut and paste a dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and the story hurry: But Anne Elliott runs from place to place in pursuit of Wentworth near the end of the piece was the abomination ! Austen must rotate in the grave. No worthy young woman would do so in a terrible way. And the actress who played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of Austen's remakes are bad, they turn off a new generation of observers. If you want to see the perfect version of this (otherwise) gorgeous novel, get Roger Michell in 1995 a guided version of Amanda Root (whose expressions can speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds. It is brilliant.
