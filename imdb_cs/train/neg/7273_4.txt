This early role of Barbara Shelley (actually her first in Britain after working in Italy) was made when she was 24 years old, and she is certain she made a wonderful debut in 1957 "Cat Girl". While blondes and brunettes are receiving great attention (I will always love Yutte Stensgaard), the beautiful, starred actress with a deep voice always radiated intelligence and vulnerability (one example being "Village the Damned" in 1960, whose screen time was much smaller than her husband, George Sanders). It's the only reason to see this uncluttering "Cat People" update, and there's a big advantage in it (it's hard to say, a better performance.) His character seems to be asleep naked and we're exposed to her delicious, bare-sightedness when she wakes up eight years later in 1965 in "Rasputin-The Mad Monk"). The movie is a wonderful wild miracle (I do not see what it was dressing for, but I would definitely want it). Overall, the positive proof that Barbara Shelley, in a badly written role that would defeat most of the actresses, rises over her material and makes movies permanently observable, and a real test of stellar power she would soon find in Hammer's studies in Bray for the 1960s .
