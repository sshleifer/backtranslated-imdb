I feel completely torn. Someone has to return the $ 4.95 I spent in Blockbuster to rent this home mess. This is not music, it's a complete waste of time and my night. What I do not have is why this has been divided into the first place? ... someone had to do some heavy drugs at night when it was. I saw a better film coming out of film schools and I was at a film school so I can say it as a fact. The quality of this work is also very bad to see ... shot on DV ??? Nuff said. Tracks are not songs, but just so it sounds the same in each section. Want to see a good musical? DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILM.
