I admit that I have a pretty awful feeling about ghost films, and while I sometimes use the genre when it comes to horror, but in terms of comedy, it must be really crazy to be funny. "Despite her dead body," it seems to take a little too seriously after death, and in my opinion it fails from almost all the aspects I think. The story is, of course, absolutely incredible, and I could not convince myself either in a comic book or in a sentimental register. The choice of major actresses was terrible. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the ladies' taste of his characters seems to need a serious improvement because Eva Longoria looks too old (apologizes) and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (again, I apologize). A romantic story without a good reason for romance is due to a failure from the start. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were really better, but they only had supportive roles. The rest is uninteresting and unintelligible, with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful television comedies. Nothing really worth watching what to remember.
