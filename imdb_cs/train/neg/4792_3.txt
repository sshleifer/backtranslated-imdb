Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... amazing. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. Although I would like to keep this film, I just can not. It seems that the movie was "sold out". First, bad signs appear when the video has trailers for other movies (something that others have not done). Also too many unnecessary characters, an example is a boy (who is cracked, first humorous, but soon you want him dead), a woman who uses karate to bounce the balls (it will not work, or rather should not) and blooming zombies (what the hell they do, they do not even apply to other phatasms). Also there is a heavy lack of dwarves running around. The only good bits are a crack start and of course Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Maybe SPOILER is coming up) <br /> For me this film looks like a filler between II and IV as other characters just let the end can continue with the 4th in IV. Overall, very disappointing. 3/10
