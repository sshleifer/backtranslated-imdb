It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store and the envelope looked like it could be a decent horror movie. I knew a little bit that the cover would be the best part of the film. Where to start? The shooting of the film was scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene where no one speaks, just a car that leads to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, only quietly. The whole movie is boring, with annoying, incredible conversation and basically no plot. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it could be a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run it.
