I checked it on DVD for the dollar so I could smile at how this horrible movie unfolds. Every time you think it can not get worse, it inevitably does. The game is terrible. Fence does not make sense at all. The title "cold revenge" in the American version of DVD has absolutely nothing to do with the script. Action scenes are so obviously taken on their first departure. There are a lot of mistakes during dialogues that suggest that he does not intend to do more to at least try to cope with this film. I can not remember I saw a worse movie, and sometimes I'm wrong - well, except for the unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, I'm kidding while bad, Unstoppable deserves the Best Picture of Oscar in comparison to this bite.
