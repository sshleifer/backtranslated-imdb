There is no reason to see this movie. The good idea of ​​the plot is solved very badly. In the middle of the movie, everything changes and nothing can be understood from here. The reason for killing is not clear. The game is terrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was great in the bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson of Buffy must one day change her character. Even those of you who love sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this movie), there are no scenes on the DVD, which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts of the characters. /> <br /> Do not waste time on this.
