From terrible deadly scenes to the guns they burn without talking to a sign called Fiend. It's all a tedious, slow-moving, non-imaginative disgust. It was okay to see the man with the cloak and the hunchback lurking around. Visually it was scary and probably occupied by the viewer of that time, but even in 1936, someone would think it would be a bit more fantasy and verisimility even for such a movie. I just waited for something to become of any significance, because people stood around talking and behaving as if posing at an office picnic. And then there are the bullets, as the previous commentator mentioned. Perhaps it would be best to find a waterpot on the pocket of one's pants.
