In the name of Pinter, each knee bowed - especially after the acceptance of the Nobel Literature, which was only a little repetitive, after consuming, according to the number, the sixth form of anti-Americanism. But it's even worse; it's not only a path of hopelessness of integrity, a great example of how to get away with your old reputation for decades, but it also represents the carving of a great piece of work. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of his kind. Yes, it was a theatrical candy, and it's easy to see how much better on the stage than on the screen on the central fence, but it still worked great. This is marionette Michael Caine, but tell him, Caine is not Olivier. Not only could he not fill Larry's shoes, he could not fill his slippers. Correctly named Caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their long life in business. It was good Harry Palmer, great at Get Carter, but that's a lot, buddy! Give it a very wide berth and keep a great original. It's half-pinter.
