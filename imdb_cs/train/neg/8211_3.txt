I read a book "7 years in Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer and I was fascinated. then I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember seeing it for the first time in 98, I liked it. Well, I've been watching it again with the full knowledge of the book on which it is based. and soon I realized how badly it was said: When they enter Lhasa, people start to pluck their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that this is a way to say in the studio in Tibet, so they greet .. in the book Harrer explains that tugging is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet, and they can do it in front of the Dalai Lama but certainly not for these two Europeans! not only the mother, but also the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses in public. in Harrer, he mentions that nobody in Tibet at that time wore glasses (I'm sorry he forgot the reason, but he explained it in the book). The young Dalai Lama did it, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what does Mao tse tung look like, destroys mandala in front of the young "living Buddha"? childish ... and Tibetan dress made by Harrer and Aufschnaiter, which are not European designer suits! why are so many events that have actually happened excluded from the story just to fill the time with a fictitious loving interest (a female tailor ...), which is totally unimportant? just like the whole story about the Harrer's son, rolf. not a single word about him or a family member of Harrer in the book is mentioned. but it was okay for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about a harrer person. its about Tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet that heinrich harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for cinematography.
