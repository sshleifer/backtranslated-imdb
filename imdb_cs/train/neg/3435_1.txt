I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. Like an eternal fan of horror, from the 1980s cheese of American slasher to European zombie films, I thought it would be great! I can not tell you how bad I am. At first I thought it would be much worse than in reality. After all I heard of this movie, I was almost afraid to watch. The murders are boring. Arranging ... forget it is not acting! The story, though we care not, is incredibly bad. They seem to be trying to catch your attention with strange sex scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately this movie does not help. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing. It's a bad film shooting from point A to point B. Although it's extremely fun and fun to watch with your friends and a lot of beers, do not make any effort to get them. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste time watching the Necro!
