The music that sneaks up like nails on the board makes it so zombie, it was a shame to empty the cast by not making the second movie; in which all the players are like real zombies - with the occupation of Sabrina Teenaged Witch as a hero ... a movie so terribly horrible that if stoners were still around, it could be considered a cult movie --- but oh oh so amateur , the scripts could also be passed around the actors, their lines read as they slowly blended into the movie --- banal, illogical sets modeled after the LA subdivision, props directly from ToysRus! Was there ever a film that was so completely and totally awkward? Logic flies into the wind in this fertile, senseless, senseless and "monster" so stupid and uncoordinated that he could not capture the turtle in the ice box --- down, legs --- and amazon! All attention paid attention to me; how severe a continuous chain crash in a mist involving more vehicles keeps observers at the very end ... because after a meaningful struggle with a jet in a jail on another planet, the pneumatically disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced reward hunter is pursuing a retarded alien fugitive --- THE COUNTRY! Do not let anyone p ** s on your popcorn, you can really enjoy watching this. It's so bad!
