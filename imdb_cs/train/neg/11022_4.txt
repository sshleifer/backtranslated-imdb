Mister Foe (originally and more appropriately called Hallam Foe, I do not see his title character as a "master") is a homage to good acting. As Jamie Bell, like Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles, as Kate, his loyal partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. The problem comes when you try to combine your roles with anything that's going on in real life. A young man who spies intimate details of the people's lives, as Hallam does, would be deservingly defeated by pulp. And the woman in Kate's situation would be frightened and frightened-she would probably call the police. But these things are not in the movie. Poor mother Hallam died, and his father married a woman with whom he had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets him know. She has sex with him. Kate is an employee who places Hallam in dishwashers and plays sex games. He looks like his mother. Everything ends happily when Hallam "solves" his "problems". Forty years ago, the game and the great movie that is afraid of Virginia Woolf, a similarly optimistic end, with characters becoming wiser and better when they break away from each other. The problem is that it does not always work, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is possible due to the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mrs. Foe, the emotional revelation never happens.
