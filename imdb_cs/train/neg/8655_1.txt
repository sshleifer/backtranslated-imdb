What a terrible movie. Bright. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from some shit-shuffled reviewer. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh. It's not Roger Corman, I hate it, this is a painful movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from Homoeric's computer graphics? Which is another thing, the CGI dried out loud; I hate the movie horribly. This is undoubtedly the worst Roger Corman B-Movie and probably the prettiest B-movie. It's - it's --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I had to hurt some fools in those moments. It's just a horrible movie ... 0/1000
