An amazing horror movie about a rich man (John Carradine) who dies and leaves everything to his four children and his servants share the same. One condition - he must spend a week in possession to get the money. And if some of them die, others will get more. Guess what's going to happen ... <br /> <br /> I've seen a whole new print of this movie on the cable. The colors were bright and lively, and the house itself looks beautiful. That's all the good things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> There are just some of the problems in this movie: the murderer is blatantly obvious; servants are called Igor and Elg - come on! Some sound recordings were so bad that I could not make a dialogue (no big loss, I'm sure); the gore was thin and very poorly executed; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains some really nasty action - so bad that you look at the screen in disbelief. Even Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only fairly good acting act was by Faith Domerge (who deserved better) and John Carradin (who looks painfully old and fragile here). But I have to admit that the final line in this movie is a gem! Why it has been renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there's another horror movie from 1978 with that name! br /> <br /> Whatever its name, it's a bad movie. To avoid at all costs.
