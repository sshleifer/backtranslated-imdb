The only relationship that this film has to the horror is that it's terribly inconvenient. I'd rather deny my rusty nails before I sit down again. Even for television, it's flat. The cast is boring. The script is just as exciting as a bowl of sand. As two directors conspired to create such a film, they will remain one of the great secrets of the 20th century. There is only one scene that is even much needed for inclusion in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in a bundle and shortened to the expected payout. If it tries to see you, insert it, set the alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfortable. With a little luck, you will retreat quickly and the alarm will wake you up as soon as it is worse. This is the movie.
