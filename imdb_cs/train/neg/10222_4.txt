In addition to the great cinematography of great James Wong Howe in combat scenes, this film is a real glowing. This is the second film I've seen in recent days directed by Alexandra Korda. The first was "Rembrandt" by Charles Laughton. It was so bad I turned it off. I'm afraid it's not much better. Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as a virgin queen was good for the 1937 standards, but when you compare it to Helen Mirren, it is not a total match. In robotic fashion, Robson sets her lines. Her battle message to English soldiers is so spiritual. <br /> <br /> Even the lively Laurence Olivier can not save this total boredom. <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivien Leigh has a supporting role here, and in fact, she does not say anything here. Think Scarlett was two years later! It is a shame that the history of the Spanish Army is so boring in this film.
