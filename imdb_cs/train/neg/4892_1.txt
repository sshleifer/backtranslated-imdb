have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> At first I doubted it, but when I saw an embarrassed cloud, I changed my mind and I was finally convinced that they had sex with watermelons, people dead or alive. safe sex of course. (terribly ugly) the lead man draws everything into the lady's mouth after making a dead lady. never heard of HIV? guess no. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mainly boring, but also incredibly repulsive. in fact, in parts so disgusting that I could not take my virgin eyes off. sex with dead people! how is it rough? and what is the message behind all this? We need water, we need melons, we have to be dead to have sex? I'm sorry, but this has smitten!
