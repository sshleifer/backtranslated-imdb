I am the wife of a young shepherd and we have made some youth to see this movie. We spent an hour trying to explain it. They did not get it, and I did not like it. It is based on the concept that has gone through all three major religions of the world (the Bible, the Torah code and the code in the Qur'an) and is so debatable that it is ridiculous. This is not a step forward for Christians in art, it is a step forward for those who believe we are checking our brains at the door.
