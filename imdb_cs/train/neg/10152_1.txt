As a fan of cheese horror films, I saw it in my video shop and I thought I'd try. Now that I saw it, I want it without a living soul on the planet. I get my movie rentals for free and I feel like I did not have the money. I've seen some bad, fucking horror movies in my time, damn a fan, but that was just an insult.
