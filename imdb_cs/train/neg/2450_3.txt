I was looking at the Lord of the Rings version from Peter Jackson when I read two towers and I thought it was great. At this time, the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DVD, but I thought I'd finish reading Two Towers and Returning the Kings before I watched it (as I thought it showed the whole trilogy). So when I finished the trilogy I went and brought the DVD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was boring 20 minutes into it, which was really weird because I like the book and I'm shaken that the creator of this movie might even think about placing at least 1 and half of the 2-hour 8-minute movies . None of the characters had any emotions when they spoke, and I seemed to have read it on the page, even my favorite character, Gandalf, did not seem interesting. <br /> <br /> Animation was the only one in some parts of the movie, with the exception of the orcs (looked terrible) and Aragorn and Sam's face. was released because it was not the right end, but maybe it was good that the producer had run out of money because the movie could not get better. <br /> <br /> I just hope nobody judges books with this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
