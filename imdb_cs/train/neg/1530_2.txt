I wish I could record THE MACHINE IN THE WHITE to see it again <br /> <br /> "What do you think you really enjoyed Theo?" <br /> <br /> I do not think I could watch it again to find out if it was so slow, stupid and embarrassing how unfortunate I remember it. A lot of people said it was done for kids. Can I suggest that children do it? because the entire script structure lacks any kind of discipline on the part of producers and writers and much of the pieces seemed to be included because it looked like a good idea at that time Cast did not help but really regretted them . You can honestly believe that during filming he had to draw his families to filming a hardcore porn movie, such was their embarrassment when they had to appear in something so unfortunate. To give you an idea of ​​how bad acting is every time BAYWATCH babe Donna D'Ericco disappears from the narrative, I patiently waited for it to appear again, then a few seconds later I forgot it was in the movie. I have it ? The star from BAYWATCH will appear and in a few seconds you will forget that they are in the movie. It tells you everything you need to know about the standard of men in white <br /> <br /> It fairly strives to be a live action cartoon similar to THE GOODIES (although DISMALS would be a better attribute for this film), although perhaps the film deserves some credit for never falling into the humor of the toilet, but given that this is a children's movie (it did not stop the ITV broadcast it at 11 am) then it should not be near the knuckle humor in it anyway
