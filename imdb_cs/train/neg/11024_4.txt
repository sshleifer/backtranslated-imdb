I first saw this film in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited by the Censorship Committee. But then in Poland in 2000 I watched it in full form. So what? The story is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive a genetic catastrophe and find themselves on a planet full of feminist, strong, direct and fundamentally strong ladies. Men are now trying to fight him, and then they are followed by a lot of extremely silly clich√©s - sex drive, constant male desire for sex, feminists who are portrayed as complete idiots (maybe you agree or not, but idiots are certainly not) . The performance of the star Jerzy Stuhr is wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls out the failing faces and repeats it when he says phrases such as "I'm in the elevator with the girl and I did not do anything to her!". It was supposed to be a comedy, instead it turned out to be a faint farce, full of predictable jokes and undervalued passports. Do not waste time on it - it's bad.
