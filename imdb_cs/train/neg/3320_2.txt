I honestly had a lot of expectations when I first started watching this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most demanding movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and it's not short). I'm sure Jane Austen wrote a book, did a few long pages, filled it with a description, and did not want people to read one day or drag it and lose his appeal, which Emma definitely did. Now, "Sense and Sensibility" has this slow rate error, but at least it has lively lines to match it, as well as some good performances! This leads me to error # 2, which is, of course, acting. While I do not think I'm really interested in someone involved in this movie, I'm sure they are able to work well, but I have not seen much in this movie. It was as if people were trying too hard to be funny, too hard to be "upper class", too hard to be British (well, some of them), so everyone just came out like a lot of actors and not like people . <br /> <br /> # 3. The theater, as I said, seemed just as actors and not as the people they played. Maybe it's a good thing, because the people who really played were not so nice. Why do everyone like Emma for example? Sure, she was pretty with the rich, handsome people in front of them, but it was a terrible gossip. If her friends were "ugly," then she did not bother to go behind her back. So why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to laugh?" Of course, the snack did not even make it. I have enough trouble with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" has not changed my mind. Well, it's easy to see that I was not interested in this. I'm sure it's a beautiful book and all, but some books really should not be made for a big screen and "Emma" is one of them.
