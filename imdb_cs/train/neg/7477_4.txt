A predominantly dense road movie with a comic relief from the outstanding John Clees (although he is actually broadcasting his performance at Fawlty Towers). It seems to have turned from the top tile to embarrassed sentimentality on a drop of hat, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn must "find" who they are, etc. See it at their own risk.
