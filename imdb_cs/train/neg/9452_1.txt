So I was looking forward to seeing it when it was in production. But it turned out to be the greatest. Far from the Random World of Dr. Seussa. It was vulgar and unpleasant, I do not think Dr. Seuss would approve. As Grinch stole Christmas, he was much better. I understand they have fun funny jokes, but my kids are still catching up. While the Cat in the hat screamed the vulgarity, they caught much more than I wished. Getting it with Doctor Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got to the big screen. Look at what he's doing with Horton, he'll hear who I hope will do to Doctor Seuss for justice.
