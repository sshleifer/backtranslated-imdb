Despite what many other people were thinking about the first film, I liked it very much. This one, though. How to summarize it in one word: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's look at it in parts: Here is a plot: Finally, the old queen but her successor: Snow White has problems of another type: Judge-Jester, father of her son, went mad, while super, Spliss, goes to the extreme, fights with gray hair and sells royal offspring for some blonde and full of hair. In despair, the snow white seeks help from Bubi (Otto Walkees), who first has to find another six dwarfs and then tries to find royal offspring or at least try to find the name Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole conspiracy seems to be written for the weekend where the writers were very drunk, but they were under pressure from the studio and wrote the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part or for fans of any of the other actors, it really is not worth buying a DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rescues the film from being completely forgotten is the performance of some actors. That's why I put step 3/10. It's sad that the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them together can solve this bad story. For example, at one point they even go into our reality and sadly .. they do nothing laugh while they are here. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, a lot of great actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen (especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as Mirror, Helge Schneider and many more but sadly , all these comics are not able to bring this really bad scenario to life. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's fun for some hardcore fans, but for regular movie visitors or DVD Renters or buyers it's not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I'm even sorry to rent the film.
