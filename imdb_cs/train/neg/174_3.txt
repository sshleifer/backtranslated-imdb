* A possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> 'Return to the lake cabin' is an unnecessary movie. The game was not good and the conspiracy was not even remarkable. <br /> <br /> "Cabin by the Lake" is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good at the first film and made much of his personality more than this. He did not seem to be interested in continuing. His acting was good, but it could have been better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast because I do not even forget. But I'll do it. Alison's character is not even visible in the first part of the movie. Suddenly, Stanley Caldwell is the center of attention. This role was meaningless and should have been a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her acting was rather decent, and people who cast themselves had to look for someone else, someone else. Director, Mike, was a confused character. He seemed to have an intention to exist, but his death seemed unnecessary. Playing for this role was good, nothing great, but better than Salem. <br /> <br /> The plot was really miserable when you think about it. Stanley, who is considered dead, sets out for a set of "Cabin by The Lake," based on his screenplay. He touches the director and shortly the director is dead, and Stanley runs the show. Yeah, no one comes to see this stranger coming to the picture and finished the film when he did not know anything about it. There are some murders, not a lot, and those that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actors on the TV series pulls down the scene while shooting. The next figure gets a chewing motorboat. And man will fit into the plant before drowning. These writers had to be excited for excitement. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not overwhelmed by the shooting of the film. The way he has ever changed from looking for a low budget back to normal has started to irritate very quickly. Also a new chalet near the lake was badly created. We are not shown, but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the string in the basement was useless. It worked in the first film just because it was shown much more, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. Everyone, except for a few, had no reason to be there. The effect of what was little shown was really bad and ... they simply did not have any purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, "returning to the cabin by the lake" upstairs from where it first left. The "cab near the lake," which I can take, but it was not very impressive. Judd Nelson should avoid this and you should. It's nothing like the first, and it's too slow. In the first hour, nothing happened and continued to the other. Not to mention that writing was terrible. Give it only when you need a sleep aid. So we see that Stanley rejects death and is still alive and well. By the way, she says, it sounds like maybe a third installment of a movie that would be good in itself. Quit running in the sequel and maybe we're fine! (They did not know the film makers that they showed us how they were filming lakeside scenes from the first one - all made in the tank - never show the secret of shooting.
