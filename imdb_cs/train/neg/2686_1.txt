First, I'm not an American or Middle East. Second, I have no religion. The closest thing to religion I have is sports and movies. Since then, I think I would best serve my opinion to be neutral and without distortion. Most of these short films are utterly shameful. This terrible event should be used to remind all innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbarian and uncivilized fools. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films was a restraining attempt to get different political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) The Ken Loach segment. Sure, we are all sad that this buddy had a hard life in his country, but what does he have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Do two wrongs do not do the right? It does not matter! This movie should have subtitles for those who have difficulty listening to a partially incoherent Chilean-English accent. 2) The Youssef Chahin segment is most worrying. Obviously he has problems with logic. He justified murders because of - America's democracy and because some Americans voted for politicians in power, then all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions of their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy real? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Midwest is; some even do not know what religion they are practicing here; and most do not know the real political issues behind the scenes. ### Mr Chahin, the reason we have all these problems in the world is that there are too many people with your logic. The innocent victims of the Twin Towers came from around the world. Murder firefighters, rescuers, office workers, followers, and air travelers have nothing to do with politics. And yet we can not go about our lives because "some" thinks that everyone has to choose a party or religion. We are perceived as a fair game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its own bombed victims. Another filmmaker who uses this event to pursue his own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of "me, me, me." Sometimes they are different people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idrissy Ouedraogo is a joke and a different political point. They obviously need money from the international community by emphasizing their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film disparages the memory of the "Victims of September 11, 2001". The best thing about this is TRASH CAN.
