A stupid and simply weird movie about a guy who gets traumatized when he finds out that Santa is not real (???). Grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart), who makes lists of people who are merciless or kind. One Christmas is going and trying to kill naughty people - dressed as Santa of course. Boring and just a bad killer Santa movie. If you're looking for a gore, it's not here. Only a few of the murders are shown and it's not such a boy with very fake effects. Most of the film contains only Brandon Maggart and speaks to himself and is slowly going crazy. The script is sad, the acting is terrible and leads to the ending, when I was watching TV. I really had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I was not hallucinating! Really really bad. <br /> <br /> If you want a frightening Christmas movie, rent "Black Christmas" (original 70s version --- NOT its terrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
