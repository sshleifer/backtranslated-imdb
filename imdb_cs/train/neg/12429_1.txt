The memory of the filthy details of this unpleasant "film" resembles digging into the chest cavity with a rusty, salty spoon. Maybe "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a little on the predictable side, but this nice apology for the film is just one of the most unfriendly commercialization offers I've ever heard. A boy who fights with spies / terrorists when he is alone in the suburbs of Chicago with smallpox? Ridiculous! Why does this film have to be done? I am the one who believes that even horrible movies are not time, but rather learning. However, it is actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
