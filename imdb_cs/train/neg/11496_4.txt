an act / manipulated document about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. just as fun, safe ... but a sad place, there were a lot of sex workers playing in a soccer team, gathered in what looks no more than a week! the main focus of the document is to prove that society repels this kind of "laborers", although it has never been possible to solve these poor women, except that the people who documented them created some "stars" (as the title says) for being used to make this reality a document. but it has its own documented reality ... but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main story. I would not see it again; but I recommend it only for general cultural purposes.
