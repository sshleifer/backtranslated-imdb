Remakes (and sequels) have been the basis of cinemas since the beginning of the media. It's really hit or miss venture. If you take what's good from the original and build on it and update the key features too current standards, you can be successful. Note that in their attempts such films as THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) succeeded. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail, miserable. <br /> <br /> SHORT COMPANY (1945) is a template for this movie. It's as perfect as it could be done on such a subject and we're evaluating it IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, accidentally found innocent and tragically lost. Why this happened to only two (2) representatives involved at the wrong time. These are portrayed convincingly and sensitively by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. They are not conventionally leading stars but qualitative acting actors. See the movie for details. <br /> <br /> What happened? The T.V. film, a practically modified scene for actors with names like RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN, should have scored at least IMDb ****** Six. But the actors seem to be uninterested, they just show to hit their clocks and pick up their checks. They are neither with their character nor with each other. You do not believe they are in love, or when they finally separate, it's a big loss for him. That should not be, and therefore his intention was not. Sometimes it's better to leave things alone.
