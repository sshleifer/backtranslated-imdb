The film is a complete crap. We have two good actors who are the mischief and the main hero of actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is crappy. Characters wrongly sketched. No story telling. No editing speaks. Ajay Devgan as a rock star ... it's a dream in itself. The film stretches along the decadence point. The whole charity that Arjun had brought his Manna to London, gave him his girlfriend and let it play on Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan is over the edge of acting or pretending to be too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all the directors are becoming prey for Box Office ... created by Mumbai Media Morons. It's another crazy movie in the ranks of "Wanted" with an idiot actor like Salman Khan who does not have a place in a good Hindu cinema. He is good for Indian film as Titanic was for Winter Cruise Business. Positive Note - likes Asin's character dancing Bharatnatyam when he changes to Western style dancing when the teacher is not looking.
