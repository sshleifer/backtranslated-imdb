I see the little girls who are looking forward to this show, but the call to this family show is ridiculous. I am amazed how well he remembered it was after all these years. It is an extremely unfortunate and stupid show about the widow's father of three people who live with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school and others as they are born. All fence lines usually have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is crazy about someone else and every episode they make, ending with a light-junk joke. As for the actors, I did not even like them. Bob Saget was painfully unhappy like daddy with a mother of responsibility. Dave Coulier is one joke, 30 years old, who makes cartoons and acts like a child, and is horrible. John Stamos was the most difficult figure, but he was a cliché that it was difficult to watch. The oldest girl, DJ, was really a bad actress and she never experienced emotions. Midwife Stephanie was too cliché like an annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses are the Olsen twins. It is always possible to find out when they turn them off. The story lines too many stories were so unrealistically stupid that it's very good. It is a "family" show that has tried to replace any good cute and loving cloth, and although they are needed for the idea of ​​family, they have over-exaggerated. It will be remembered as my most popular sit-com since the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> My rating: A terrible show. TVG 30 min.
