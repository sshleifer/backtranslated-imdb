Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki Ardelean" is too late. We've got enough, and we want something new. Major directors should have no trouble seeing their time, not behind. Why do people view Romania as a post-revolutionary country? We have just been born, not reincarnated, and nobody is talking about old times. Most people remember or do not want to remember and the new generation of movie consumers does not understand a little. This should be the first day of the novel, not the final song - priveghi! Maybe younger directors should take this step.
