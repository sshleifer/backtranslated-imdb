Herbie, Volkswagen, who thinks she's like a man, is back, now being run by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing on the way is the current Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. The original love bug was not that good. Even as a child, I remember that I did not like it very much. But I had some hope of continuing. I think the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it look like a pretty funny movie. Unfortunately Herbie is not better than before. The film is dazzlingly weak for people over 12 years of age. He'll probably have fun with the kids, but that's all. I realize that this is a children's film and everyone else could make the film a bit more interesting. There was very little laughter and it was boring to the end. Most actors also seemed dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was okay like Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon did the best performance of everyone. He was as good as bad, though he did not have much to do with him. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and doing nothing special. Angela Robinson drives and she does a good job. He tries to keep the film interesting but works with a weak screenplay. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote a script, and would it be a surprise to you that they are also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make bright movies, but they really can not make interesting or pleasant stories. It's not their fault, but let's hope they will try again next time. Finally, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie that is worth watching if you are a child. Everyone else is better off jumping. Rating 4/10
