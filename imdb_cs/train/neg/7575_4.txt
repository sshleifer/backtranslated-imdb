The retired diplomat, played nice by Michael York, goes to Russia to avenge a Russian gangster who murdered a sympathetic cop. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. I remembered the old 1980s action scenes that always portrayed the Russians as bad bad boys, the just US government. It is interesting to see the Russian guy this time as a hero. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, it's typically a "B" action move. Michael York lends a certain class to this average movie. Alexander Nevsky, playing a Russian policeman, is a little "blah," but surprisingly he has some chemistry with Michael York. Face to face, Michael York is such a good actor that he has chemistry with everyone he does with the scene. Disappointment is the nice Adrian Paul killed during the first 15 minutes of the movie. Had Adrian Paul been in this movie longer, it would have been above-average "B" action moves. All I can say about Adrian Pavl is that it's really nice to see the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical villain. In this film she is very blonde and very vile. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you do not watch TV. It's alright. It does not matter too badly. Action scenes are decent. The game could be better, the conspiracy could be much faster, but hey, you can see what Russia looks like today!
