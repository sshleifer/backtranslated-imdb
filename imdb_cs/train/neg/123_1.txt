Oh, brother ... after hearing about fourteen years about this ridiculous movie, everything I think is the old song Peggy Lee. "Is it all?" ... I was just an early teenager when this smelly fish hit the United States. I was too young to get into the theater (even though I got into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then it turned out to be a screening at the local film museum - eventually I saw this movie, except now that I was as old as my parents when they snapped to see it! <br /> <br /> Only the reason why this movie was not condemned to anonymous sandy times was due to the obscenity case caused by its release in the US. MILLIONS of people gathered for this smelly man, thought they were going to see a sex movie ... Instead they got a lot of details of courageous, repulsive Swedes, conversations in the streets of small shopping malls, political prejudices ... and weak who cares about simulated sexual scenes with confused, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historical artifact ... whatever it was, crush it, burn it, then bury it in a lead box! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> Instead, the title "I Am Blank, Blank" rhythymed repeatedly endlessly for years as irritation for pornographic movies (I'm curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I'm curious, black - for blaxploitation movies, ) and every ten years, the thing is rising from the dead to see a new generation of burgers who want to see that "the film of the naughty sex" that "the film industry has developed" ... Yeesh , avoid it as an epidemic .. or if you need to see it - rent a video and move it to the "dirty" parts just to get it. <br /> <br />
