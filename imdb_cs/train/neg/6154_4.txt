Portly pretty boy falls on a sweet blonde; she likes it, but not for reasons you think. Little comedies from writer Pat Profta feature very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, yet it has no lasting impact. It's just a quick determination directed by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even on the level of B-comedies, the "Eating Raoul" is somewhat better bet. There is definitely a fun setting-here; unfortunately, he has no image in his second act anywhere else. An interesting exam, but it gets worse. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
