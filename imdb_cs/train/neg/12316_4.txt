Director Jonathan Lynn has made some undervalued comedies in the past, such as "Greedy" and "Clue". This is not one of them. More similar to the movie "Police Academy" than its inspiration, Steve Martin's star in the old role of Phil Silvers as an army sergeant who forever attracts scams under the superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilkova and his lazy platoon looks embarrassed when the old enemy visits a base that has the task of catching Bill in action. Nothing happens. It's totally boring. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman make a few smiles, but they are all better than this, and it's very painful to see how they work with such a thin material.
