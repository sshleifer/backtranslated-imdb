There are a lot of negative reviews about "staying away, Joe," just can not remain silent and leave this injustice. Here is a page you have not heard before. Elvis Presley films are, for my reason, guilty of guilt: they are perfect movies for pure relaxation because I do not have to think when I watch them. That is, I do not have to worry about the missing complex plot, because there is never the right conspiracy there. I can start kicking shoes, grabbing beer, sitting down, shutting down brains and enjoying all the general robbery and catchy and easy rock nylon melodies from the most extensive decades of all. <br /> <br /> In his books "Stay Away, Joe" certainly falls into the category "so bad it's good". Now that you and I appreciate the "waste value," it's the final experience of the camp in 1960. It's so bad that it's almost surrealistic to watch and just think that it can not be even worse, it will surprise you in the most probable ways . In the end, you are so overwhelmed by all the new levels of stupidity that you simply do not know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I love it because it's so amusing that once there was a generation that actually shot such movies. I will still give 1 in 10 - although it will hit bottom 100, it will immediately become a bad classic movie.
