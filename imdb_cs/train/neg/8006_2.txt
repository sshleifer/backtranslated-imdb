What this movie does well combines action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that is more irritating to audiences than a typical horror film. Unfortunately, with unrelated stories, frustrating holes and controversial scenes, this film has mainly caused frustration and is hardly the "greatest monster." <br /> <br /> Let's start with good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the movie Get-go, this film starts quickly and irritably. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - is camped and fast, rewarding the classic "ecological" catastrophes that have given birth to so many other monsters. The move is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often absurd dramatic scene opening from other knocking monsters and allowing the film to jump right into the action. Within 10 minutes you get "why", "where" and "how" an animal and you are ready for action. This movie is available. After another short and well-filmed sequence, the characters will be introduced: a lazy son and his premature girl, a kind grandfather and a talented nurse (aunt) and, of course, a monster. The characters are presented in context and their conflicts are immediately apparent and allow viewers to feel when the monster suddenly appears confused in the area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The Monster looks great: Alien, yet known - like a dog and fish squid off the squid. The effects of the creatures are insignificant, and although it looks strange, it is credible, and at any point in the movie you can not see that they are strings. "Even the movement of the monster was terribly familiar, like the rattweiler growing on a linoleum, the monster rising through the crowd, sliding on the surface, crushing and eating those in his way. a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge, but from there it begins to reveal the film. <br /> <br /> After the beginning of the dynamite, the film quickly loses focus and continuity, the backgrounds are introduced, abandoned, the characters change their position for no apparent reason, and the comedy merges into dramatic scenes that confuse the intention, while the obstacles appear and will disappear.As for comedy, let me say this: I am willing to accept that a lot of humor is probably cultural.I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe they were lost in translation. As an Asian university student and as someone who has lived in Japan for the past 5 years (still here), I would like to think that m I have better grasp Asian humor than the average Caucasian. It has been said that there are many parts of the movie that I understand to be funny, but it was not for me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack when a young daughter is lost, the family is a funeral; everyone is sad. A new figure - a brother - will be introduced and the tension will rise even higher, as it is clear that both brothers are in conflict with each other. They both begin to mourn because of their loss, and the winds compete against one who is mourning hard. This competition is fun in the core: two brothers who do not like each other even compete for a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of the family love common in the Asian comedy. This delicate slap-stick comedy, which tries to make fun of the family and ritual sadness, is funny, but it seemed to be out of place in the context of a lost girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then the holes of the plot come. there are so many points in this film that are never explained or worse, they are only explained and bothered to be helpless and unreasonable. To find that the obstacle is not an obstacle, it may be a good thing for the character, but you expect some commentary on this character. Instead, the audience is struggling with moments of climax, when the problems are "not there" and nobody makes it clear that it would ever be a problem to start. So I ask you: why even bring it? <br /> <br /> This was predominant over the film, as the problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the film is full of opposing forces that never solved each other. Of course, the introduction of new and bigger problems is a time-honored story that says tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to the violent shortening of another, you expect that at least a new arc gets a full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it was like having a few stories, each explaining only 20% of the way, and eventually the parts never finished to complete. <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm willing to accept that much of it can be "cultural". Maybe it's in the Korean tradition of stories telling the comedy inside the tragedy. Perhaps it is normal that stories will go everywhere as a child that colors out of rows on each page, but never ends. Maybe it's okay when you submit a problem to make a plot, but you accidentally remove this problem without any obvious solution or catharsis. Or maybe they are all the characteristics of careless work and bad storytelling in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
