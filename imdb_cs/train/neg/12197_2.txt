Beast Wars is a show that is exaggerated, exaggerated and overrated. Let's look at the characters of this unpleasant show, whose makers had to be on acid to try to make such a show. Cheetor - Seriously, this guy must have censorship. How is it that the audience with the same voice as Taz does not stop? (at least Razzoff of Rayman 3: The Hoodlum Havoc is Expressed Slip & Slide) Action Blast - If you want a series of shows that suck, get the G4 Tranceformers Cybertron-A show that should go to the toilet. Creators of Good Work (Sarcasm) Show it self-delayed and boring (at least Super Mario games are better) This show has a lot of supporters who said they would bring it back, but I believe it was canceled for my own good.
