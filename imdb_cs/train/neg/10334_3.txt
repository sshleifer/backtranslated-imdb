The Story of Stunning Kidnapper kills "The Psychic" over and over again. The characters and the conspiracies are totally uninteresting (just like Fuldy's mad camera work, which is usually a redeeming factor in their films), and any grasp of tension is nowhere to be found. It is put into an unbearable degree - you will not be floating with enthusiasm, but with boredom (and perhaps even an uncontrollable desire to fall asleep). The performance of Jennifer O'Neill deserves to be cast in a better film. Fulci gorehounds keep an eye out - the "The Psychic" does not do much. <br /> <br /> 3/10
