It's a horrible little production, capable of giving nightmares and headaches. It's an unsightly mix of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not so fun, a strange trip that one could expect optimistic. It's cold, inhuman, hostile, sick, even a scary kind of weird. There is no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney has done fantastic work with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall made things much more attractive with a stop. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, it's French production. As such, he reiterates the stereotype that French does not have a creepy concept.
