Others have already commented on the "decay" of Toba Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of selecting good projects (as he did by playing in the same year "Exorcist III"), so why did he agree to come up with it? Sure, he gives appropriate dementia and the film is not bad; it's just uninterested, uninteresting and uninteresting. These are three "no" too many. (* 1/2)
