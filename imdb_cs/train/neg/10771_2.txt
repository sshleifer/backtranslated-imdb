I have not seen children for several years, so I came away "Here come tigers". (I never saw the "bad news of the bear", although in the 1970s I worked for the guys who organized funding for this film, "Warriors," "Who Would Be King," and "Rocky Horror Picture Show" among others. ) Now I like to look at old or small movies and find people who have enjoyed great careers even though they were less than a great movie in the early film. Only a few minutes into this movie I could not take anymore and jumped to the end of the credits to find out if this movie was a young actor who went into bigger and better things - at least watching his appearance would cause some interest because conspiracy and acting did not work . Yeah, and I saw the name of Wes Craven in credit as an electric gaffer. He has made two or three of his early shocking, but he has not created Freddie Krueger or made Scream movies. Perhaps he owes his kindness to help with this picture. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in casting credits as "Aesop", a funny character in the movie. F.J. Lincoln, from the 1970s a few years ago, appeared and produced adult films. He was associated with the adult spoof "The Ozporns," and only the title is funnier than all the "tigers" attempts to humor altogether. Keep the fact that the adult actor was placed in a child's movie, which would mean the people who shot the film had to sleep behind the wheel.
