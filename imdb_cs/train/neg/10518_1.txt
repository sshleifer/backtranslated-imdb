Oh, man, where am I supposed to go with this one? Actor acting, weak conspiracy, stupid death, unnecessary nudity ... <br /> <br /> It's not fun ... it's hell. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste money, time or life in this evil pit. <br /> <br /> It's just ... damn, the movie is terrible! Tom Savini, why ?! Why would you bother life on those bullshits? This movie is not worth it. I'd rather go away and break my head against the wall than watch this ... this sinful act again! Please take your advice and stay f # @ k from this elephant turd movie. No, you know what? I should not even call this thing a movie! Just stay!
