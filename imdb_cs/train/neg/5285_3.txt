Somewhere on this page somebody wrote that in order to get the best version of Jane Austen's works you should read them easily. I agree with that. However, we like the adaptation of great literature and the current strike of writers reminds us that without good writers it is hard for the actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of PERSUASION by Jane Austen shows us what happens if you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the version of 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, who was well controlled and preserved the essence of the era and character limitations (except for the bizarre show and kissing in the street scene in Bath). In 2007, the twin Anne appears, which looks terrifying. The other characters were not too developed, which is a crime when they realized how Austen could paint such amazing characters with carefully selected underestimations. A series of events that made sense in the novel were completely absorbed, and Mrs. Smith, Annein co-founder and impoverished classmate was going to Bath-as did many characters. The power of Captain Wentworth's character and intelligence, which caused Anne to love him for the first time, did not appear to be written to Wentworth Rupert Penry-Jones. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to see much more than P-J managed with his poses. Overall, the 2007 release was a disappointment. It seemed that this novel reduced the gaudy, costume melodrama to questionable value. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagance to Austen's work, they should do what they do with Shakespeare's adaptations: adapt them to the present. At least "Bride and Prejudice" was removed from the historical and localization settings and was entertaining and watched as well as "Clueless". It was not PERSUZION, but they did not know what else to say.
