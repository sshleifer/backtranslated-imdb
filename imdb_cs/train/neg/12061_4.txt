Charles Bronson plays as Lt Crowe a police detective who declares war on a Duke (Juan Fernandez) who kidnapped the daughter of a Japanese trader who is the man who sexually harassed Crow's daughter (Amy Hathaway) in this stupid but stylishly painted thriller of revenge. Kinjite does not have to be a bit disturbing plot for everyone, but it's done well and really fun.
