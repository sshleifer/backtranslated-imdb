Admitting fantasies about Brad Pitt is quite difficult to accept for heterosexual doing. But what can I tell you? Perhaps the famous thing is what everyone is talking about and forms a star of the star. It goes beyond this barrier. It will take you to an unknown sensory and emotional territory. Brando had it in the pictares, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course, and recently Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor, and Billy Crudup. The women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts, and Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt unambiguously reconsidered this concept. It's the only reason to go out, get in the car, find a parking lot, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into the theater to see "Troy". If you like Jupiter's Darling style epics, you can use it. But if you do not, go anyway, we want Brad Pitt to do business.
