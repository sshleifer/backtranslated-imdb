A lot of kids have created a theater to have the whole night horror film marathon. However, as the night continues, someone is killed one by one. Who is ... and why? I saw it in the theater back in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but man! It did not work at all. The assumption is good, they have a very attractive young cast and some professionals like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but that does not work. The story stops making sense in the middle (it could have been due to some huge editing before the movie was released), killing is relatively bloodless (as it received the R rating behind me), and demasketing the killer at the end was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - this movie has the potential. With a better script, it could become a great horror movie. As it looks, it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassing (I've heard Stone will not talk about it). I'm giving it 3 and that's just for the cast.
