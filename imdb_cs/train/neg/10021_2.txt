The worst movie I've seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, no! Action sequences look more like a number of Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up random ad stitched together. Heavily influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but very poorly executed. I did not do much, but watching this movie is an irritated experience that brings you to the mysteries of "What these guys think The only thing you can remember when you noticed it is anorexic Karen in bikini The reason I did not give a rating" 1 'is that every time I think I saw the worst, Bollywood did me wrong.
