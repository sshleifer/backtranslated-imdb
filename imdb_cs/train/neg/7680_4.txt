Snow is, in my view, a bad film from an artistic point of view. The plot is largely predictable, characters are stereotypes, editing is too exaggerated. The film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think it's a direct commercial thing. Including a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the group he is in the film - SENS UNIK) seems to be aimed at a larger audience. Equal German Swiss film would not be sold in the French section - and vice versa. What really made me nervous was the placement of the product throughout the movie. Sometine scenes remember advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme 'young people using drugs without other goals in their lives' is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be treated with greater attention. I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White to show his next film his real artistic skills.
