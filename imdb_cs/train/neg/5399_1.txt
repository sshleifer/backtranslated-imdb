SPOILERS: Too often, Shakespeare's Hollywood Adventure Entertainment Cinema. Beautifully roofed, well-interpreted and faithful text. Films including Branagh's "Henry V" and 1993 "Power of Nothing" are powerful works. Watching "lost love is a job," it's such a huge disappointment in expecting it to be so badly thrown into waste. Sadly, "Love is Labor Lost" is terrible! King Navarra (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends for three years left the drink and women focused on their studies. Plans begin to crumble when the mysterious French princess (Alicia Silverstone) and her escort arrives. Soon, love is in the air and philosophy is gone from the mind. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, you realize that this film is not entirely Shakespeare. Cleverly moved to the musical work of Ken Branagh from the 1930s, the plot is still there and the screenplay remains, but now it is sacrificed in favor of horrifying musical taste. Classics like "The Way You Look Tonight," "Let's Face the Music and Dance," "I Am in Heaven" are being destroyed by a faint singing and a strong feeling that they just do not belong here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> Ken Branagh and friends could look forward to filming this movie, but they provide us with a stomach that changes into a role collection. The top eight actors (four men and four females) are all equally awful and the only positive one in their favor is a huge improvement on the really terrible Timothy Spall. In fact, only one individual leaves a movie that deserves some praise, and it is always a wonderful Nathan Lane. Lane has proved to be a comedic genius over the years, and in that position he again adds to Costar's jester. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves a slight praise for Branagh's original acceptance of the old story. Unfortunately, that's where it ends up positive. Weak effect, performance, singing and construction, "Love is Lost Work," is perhaps the weakest adaptation of Shakespeare's forty years. It should be avoided as if it were a plague and should never be made. Poor, disappointed with Branagh, and I hope his efforts will be better.
