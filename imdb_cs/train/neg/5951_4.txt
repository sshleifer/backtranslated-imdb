Written by excellent McGovern and directed by Frears this film was a slight disappointment. It seemed too short. He spent too much time creating the atmosphere of Hovis and laughing at the Catholic demands. Then you will very quickly discover that fascists and socialists are trying to make the family's attention and a terrible conclusion. Still, my wife thought Liam was cute.
