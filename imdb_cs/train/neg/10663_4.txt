The film was not a waste, except some boring scenes between them. But the female cast gave a pretty good show than the men who were ridiculous. But Christina Allen really rocked in the movie. Her voice was so inflamed and sexy. The scenes in the bed that included Christ had to shorten, but it made it so observable and sexier than anybody could do. In fact, Christ is one of the best in such roles. He has also taken it well as baddie in the last 5 minutes, an interesting part of the film. Burt Reynolds was not that good and it was not as good as an action star. He could choose a better scenario than this. He really thinks he did it for money.
