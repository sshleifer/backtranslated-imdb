It's obviously a horror movie DTV grade Z. <br /> <br /> But with a line like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have many times" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading the book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting" <br /> <br /> "You made your way here, now you can go again!" (after you guided the man to the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what they are singing) <br /> <br /> - It's not so clear what this film made in the time known for poststructuralism , it's about, or if it's just a bad movie. It's acting horribly, but some actors I know are doing this? <br /> <br /> The old house, clearly cut by the current dwelling, is the place of murder. A (bad) movie is being done on the premises and telling stories again.
