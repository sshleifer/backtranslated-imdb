From the beginning, this film had a few flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a wealthy young mogul who inherited his father's wealth and power and tries to both fill his father's shoes and cut apron strings, mother (and co-executive) remains too tight. He also has a heart disease problem waiting for a language that is a registry of organ donors. There are also small stories that most of your first instincts ignore, which become more important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle class girl (Jessica Alba). Unnatural story telling, but not bad, to destroy the movie. The only real "oy vey!" the moment was Lena Olin's name. Horny woman named Lilith ... fine! <br /> <br /> Surgery scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated that people who find scary scenes do not have to. The horror of waking up during anesthesia has done well. You're looking at emotional agony because Christensen yells through the chest cut and the ribbed spreader. The moment irony comes from the trailer comes when he is one of the unfortunate few to be up in anesthesia, he is also fortunate to help him learn that his surgical team plans to kill him. <br /> <br /> But great action is very predictable and sends the film into conspiracy and its memories of the little signs that were there, but he, like us, was initially missing. <br /> <br /> At the end there are two more twists that include his relationship with the mother. One of them is an impressive gesture from Olin, which is unpleasant due to poor writing. The second is the secret of the past of the family, which seemed to be very restrained and unnecessary. The originally well performed anesthetic famous drama is lost in a badly written plot. One last attempt to come back, which falls flat, with him the whole movie.
