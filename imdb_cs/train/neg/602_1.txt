Another example of a complete waste of UK lottery money. How commercial this movie did. The film council that funded this unfortunate garbage should be stuck at one of the London Underground stations because this clich√©, the shy specimen, has to devote itself to the film, half of the mutant that consists of all the horror films the director saw and they felt like imitation, most notably Deathline. Among his many sins, there is a clear failure, so that the leading figure is distantly compassionate until the last moment. It's a little late. Certainly all of these development managers at the UK Film Council could have noticed this in the scenario scenario. Add horrible acting and the ridiculous appearance of the creature to this, and you will get a great example of how to frighten yourself.
