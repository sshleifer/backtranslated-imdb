I think Cliff Robertson must have been one of our best actors. She has half a dozen classics. Here's as good as it is, but the direction is so bad, and the fuss is so tedious, it never gets out of the mark. The story begins well, yet I wonder how he can count on how the woman leans. Still, the pots are well and carry things. To death is double. First, if we considered that a number of people who spent walking from one room to another or from one part of the house to another should eat about a third of the film. Add Robertson's figure to her, who sits in bed in blue light and looks confused and can add another piece. I agree with those who said that half an hour shorter would make it a decent, though insignificant film. The biggest weakness is only a complicated conspiracy that, when everything is said and done, leaves unbelievable questions. I do not give spoilers, but when they're done do not think too much. I can come up with ten fifties without getting sweat. It would be better if it were a story of a spirit.
