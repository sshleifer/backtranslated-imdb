What is unnecessary cast. This is one of the most disappointed films I've ever seen. Normally Roger Ebert will not let me, but after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> The only excitement is to see Elizabeth Bank in the bra. I'm sorry about this movie. She had so many promises, but it was like a dry ripple of transvestite. <br /> <br /> This is the self-absorbed claw. <br /> <br /> I can not deeply express my bitterness by sitting in this movie, and I hope to warn you in advance of the same disappointment.
