My grandmother took me and sister out to see this movie when she came out in theaters in 1998, so we happily bought tickets, popcorn and soda, went straight to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience was not very reluctant, I remember hearing a few people saying they did not like it at all, I did not like it, I thought it was rather stupid and not worth the vision. Eddie Murphy was in this hysterical situation, but besides him the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at those parts in this, I also remembered that the other people in the theater were almost not mixed up. And what I really thought was wrong was to talk animals, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, live action movies, they are utterly sad! I said that besides Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist, this film is not worth watching, it's quite stupid. I saw Eddie Murphy in several movies and I thought it was funny that I just said it was the only funny part of this movie, I also did not see Eddie Murphy in the really "great" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie I would really recommend to see because you might not like Eddie Murphy, especially because it talks about animals! <br /> <br /> I give this movie a rating of 3 stars of the possible dozens of stars.
