For all the humor of this film, I kept an open mind, which I would think in the end. And although it is sometimes slow, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few "old times" that make one overcrowded and unbalanced. In fact, I thought cinematography was excellent for many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, it is its culmination. The end of the film and the revelation are apparently MILES APART from his body. The story falls completely into the face with the illogical conclusion and answer I sought most - what really happened to Emma? - not clarified! The reason for negative energy was the most absurd way, and in the end I felt very fraudulent. What could be a great horror film was, in the end, a haunted, scary ending.
