This is the most depressing movie I've ever seen. I first saw it as a child, and I think about it. I know it was at a time when life was hard, and I know that these people are poor and the crops are vital. Yes, I get it all. What I find difficult is that I do not remember a single light moment throughout the movie. Maybe it was life, I do not know. I'm sure that acting was excellent and that the direction and quality of filming, etc. It was great and I know that every film can not have a happy ending, but as a family film is, in my opinion, terrible. <br /> <br /> I do not answer it to anyone who wants to be entertained. I can not stress enough how this film touched me like a child. I talked about it recently, and all the sad memories came back. I think it would be all, but without a heart he got to Prozac.
