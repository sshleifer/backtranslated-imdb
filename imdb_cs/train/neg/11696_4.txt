I started to watch this film with little expectation, in fact I noticed it, because it was the adaptation of S.K. a novel (a novel I never read). I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was not good, but you're interested. What really catches this story is the work of the director and actors. The movie is too long, it has no "nice" shots and no fears, dialogues are stupid and special effects are crap. The only good things are, as I said, that it keeps you interested (I think the book must be good) without using a lot of horror balls. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10.
