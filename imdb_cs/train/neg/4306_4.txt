There's one good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini ass! I'm sorry I'm so dull, but it's true. Pity she did not do nude. It would at least be caused by this mess. We see another chick, but it's not from Lola. And the man, is Armand Assante old or what? That man looks like crap! "Consequences" are the usual B-movies you'd expect. The story had the potential. It's like having good ideas, but they did not know how to do it. Cinematography is just terrible. Unsightly! Direction is uninitiated and the end result is a turbulent thriller with lame twists and emptied actors. Lola Gaudini is great as a vixen in a cheap, smart way, but she does not even save the "consequences" of being garbage and not laughing, just plain smelly garbage.
