SICK. it really means so incredibly crappy I killed myself. There was nothing at all about what she was talking about. The best part of the entire production was art work on the envelope of the box. The budget of this film was sufficient. The film was under the street. Production looks similar to underground shooting for crowd hits. The subsidies used in this film were stolen from the clothing store. The end was so predictable that you should quickly move forward in the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there's a book for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I would have avoided it at all costs. I liked the intimate scenes that made the film for it. just makes fun.
