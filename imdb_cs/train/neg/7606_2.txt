Beverly garland was born in bad time. She was an actress some time ago, bringing strength and kindness, even so frantic flicks like the Corman movies she played. In Gunslinger, she's a female sheriff. She gets up and takes her job to pursue her murderers. He is better than the material he works with, far away. The film is gray, steady, and mostly boring. There is some (unintentional) humor with tire tracks everywhere, people running in one building to suddenly appear before another (I've heard of fake queues, but that's ridiculous!) And the really stupid line of the newlyweds the sheriff fell in love with the guy who hired her to kill her. Even if she did not like her husband, it was just like a week or two when he died! Eventually, eventually he finally shoots the man to death. No happiness with men, this. <br /> <br /> The villain is the other woman, the owner of the salon. She is going to buy a lot of land only if the railroad passes and makes her rich. Her action plan, if it is not, is nice - it just steals so much out of town as she can and jump. Shit, it's her and her hired gun at the end of the whole city. Are you telling me these people are not armed? See what happened in the real cities of the Old West when bank robbers came to rob the bank and then they were thrown in the hail of armed and dangerous urban people. <br /> <br /> This is a lot of unnecessary talking and riding around, scattered by a few lame snapshots. The end is as creepy as usual in Corman's view, though thanks to God it lacks the moral plumage at the end that was in The Conquered the World. The sheriff will take his badge to Sam Bass and set off into the sunset even though the movie was so gray you never saw the sun.
