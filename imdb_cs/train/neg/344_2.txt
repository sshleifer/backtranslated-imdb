Let me make this film really clear. I did not want to watch this movie because of the conspiracy, I'm looking at it for sex scenes. That being said, this movie is so terribly crazy that I flip between pure pleasure to see the pious body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and the pulling of the eyeball out of the conspiracy disaster. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie has already attracted me .. you see a woman who pains something around the lake, in pure bliss and quiet, then the beautiful girl approaches and asks if she could paint next to her. When they both finished, they show each other what they have done ... and the woman painted VINOHRAD, WHILE THE LAKE STORY IS THE PRESENT. What kind of chef would make such a mistake? And in another scene, Traci kills his teacher's mistress by smashing him with a sail, and then floating, and none of the city police officers once gave her a suspect. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DO NOT HAVE THE GLOVES TO DO? PRINTER PRINTERS ARE ALL INTO THE WORLD OF LAMPS! Then it's the worst whenever Mandy is around, it's a "cool" sound effect that looks like a cat in his fit. It's also a real shame that Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I really feel sorry for having to play in this super-low budget soft-porn no brainer. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to play in this film. Total in all, 2/10.
