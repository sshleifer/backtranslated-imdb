I had quite a lot of hope for this movie, even though the article had a bad look. I was extremely tolerant and I was sitting all over the film. I felt a little wrong. Although I'm not the smallest or especially sensitive to the cinema, I was looking forward to Woody Allen, "All you wanted to know about sex ..." and "Hannah's Funny Games" - I found ten-year obsession with directors who want drink milk milk completely wrong. And when the film culminated in an orgy, where the boy drinks both her breast milk and the woman she's attracting all over the movie, I almost resisted with resistance to a total perverse and sentimental parrot, that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not mind, I like the vast majority of European cinematography, as well as independently produced films, so this movie would be a great pleasure. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should be included in history history as a lesson in the wrong cinema.
