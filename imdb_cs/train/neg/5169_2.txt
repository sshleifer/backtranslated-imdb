WARNING: I encourage anyone who has not seen the movie yet to read this note. <br /> <br /> Though I did not see it all, Hamiltons was sure to deliver one of the fun I did not think it was in common with the half-dead actress, the stupid fence scheme and the twist at the end of the movie, which was very slow, ! are people who eat other people. Well ...... I noticed that people not humans, not because they are not human, or wait, I think they are, oh, do not know, did not know !!!! So good, are they cannibals, or are they imbreds or what are they? I mean, maybe it's just the "things" that came here to see what people want or they are cannibals who have been eating people for a long time or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHERE IT WAS! So if you think the Hamiltons is good, I ask you why, why, WHY, WHY, WHY, why it was so amazing, because it was just terrible for me !!! One big BOOOOOOO for Hamiltons! See The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail or Borderland for fun !!!!!
