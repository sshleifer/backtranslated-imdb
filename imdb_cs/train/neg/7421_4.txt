Watching beautiful women creeping around, playing cops and raiders is one of the most beautiful wine pleasures that allows me a medium. So the house on Carroll Street was not a complete waste of time, though the story was invented, and the screenplay is inconspicuous and a bit irritating. There are many hints on different Hitchcock pictures, not least the selection of Kelly McGillis in the lead role. She is dressed as Grace Kelly and not far from the brand. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way the audience is introduced should be someone with political conviction and intent in life. Throughout the film, it deals with a clearly defined time period, true events, and a specific issue. But in the first few minutes the story goes into a frantic crime story with incredible randomness, high predictability, and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable, as actors' performances are good, as well as photography and scenography. The finals at the station in New York are breathtaking. It starts in the underground and then moves up to the roof. The film can be appreciated for good use of architecture.
