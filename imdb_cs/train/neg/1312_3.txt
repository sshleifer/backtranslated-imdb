Tom listens to one of those old radio broadcasts, something from the 1950s to today could be watched on television. However, when this cartoon was done, there was no television, so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally shakes his boots and listens to a story about a "phantom." In fact, she literally does everything the narrator says, such as "hair at the end, cold chills go through her spine, her heart takes her throat," etc. Jerry is looking at Tom and laughing at his scary cat . We get the taste of what we will see for many years after this cartoon 194, in which Jerry tortures Tom for no other than sadistic joy. If a cat asks for trouble, it's one thing, but when he's talking about his own business, and Jerry's physically (and in this case mentally) misuse, I have a hard rooting for a "little guy." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These initial T & M efforts were also one minute longer than everything that followed. Sometimes it has one minute difference. She did it here because it was training for a while. It could have been truncated for five minutes without losing anything because the sketches lasted too long. This is common for Tom and Jerry. They are usually much faster.
