This film is a pure failure. I'm a Steve Martin fan, but he can not save a tired idea and a Swiss cheese script. Think about "Police Academy 7" and use it for a military parody. Yuck. I do not feel that other user comments reflect the bad rating that this movie has earned (and rightly deserved!). It is very misleading. I've often seen that this movie is tagged at $ 3.00 in the grocery store and now it's definitely why. <br /> <br /> If I could get my 90 minutes back ...
