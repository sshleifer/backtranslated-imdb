I do not know what he's talking about. This is definitely not a movie, in fact I do not think there was a decent girl in it. No, it's just a jovial, badly done science fiction Ed Wood. And it's bad. I can not even begin to say how bad it is. I saw it late at night on the cable and I was in shock. The fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all. Actors were either producer friends or mentally retarded, special effects are joke and the pace is madly slow. For me, however, the music will culminate. A monkey could write a better theme with a xylophone toy. Do not divorce this thing, but if you ever see it on the cable, watch it. You will be wondering how bad a movie can be.
