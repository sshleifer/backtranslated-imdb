1st place 2/2/2003 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): A nice and non-spectacular sequel to the original classical animated "Dalmatian 101". Yes, the film continues where it ended first, but the problem is that it is played as the original. One of the great things about the original was a story that does not have this story. Animation is very much unseen for Disney and everything we get is the same characteristics that go through the same kind of story. When Disney stops bore us with sequel and repetition, etc. Atd. Probably when we stop renting or buying this average fare they have issued.
