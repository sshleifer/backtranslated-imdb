An exceptionally horrible story I can barely put into words. The best part of the film was when one of the victims of the murders appeared, alive and good, just to be massacred again. There is a chance that I missed some key elements of the plot because I could be in a moderate coma at the time this child was. The box from which the film originates shows scenes that are never in the movie. I was distracted by the rough paintings of torture slavery and the promises of "Euro-Basket, Sexy Horror Movie." I feel it was a budget version and about a quarter of the film was omitted. All good things more than likely. I got the PG-13 add-on, which had about as much meaning as the end of the new movie "Planet of the Map". Watch this with a friend and bottles of hard stuff. You'll need it.
