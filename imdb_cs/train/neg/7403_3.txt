It was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's about as much as we can say. It starts with a good atmosphere; The hospital is suitably sterile and alien, the mood is set to "spooky." And then ... nothing. Well, something. Just something that does not fit ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and still intolerable supporters and the hospital they have taken over. I mean, come on, bikers? Some groups watched the Gwar a little too. My personal favorite was a demon whose head looks more like a middle-aged friend who desperately tries to threaten while at the same time it seems like he really liked to fall on an Afghan-style sofa, pull off his belt, dump a can of cheap beer (probably Schlitz ) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen far more terrifying trucks. At the railway stations. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are still cartoon and even less scary. At least on the DVD video they explain their presence in the hospital ... seemingly just randomly appear on the spot, playing some bippy "metal" and causing people to be a little dead. By neglecting a few good special effects and gaming, which is not entirely horrible due to the lack of decent writing, there is nothing. It's just a movie with background noise.
