Question: How does a bourgeois director handle a subject like immigration? Answer: by turning ourselves into a parable of existential alienation. Yes, we returned in the early 1990s, right after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and subsequent flooding of immigrants in the European Union. what better way to deal with this subject than making a film about an estranged, middle-class journalist, an existentially alienated high-ranking politician, his wealthy abusive rich wife, and so on. , immigrants are asking for political asylum in an untouched Greek village near the border. I think Angelopoulos can show some social consciousness when he deals with supernaturally disturbed upper classes. I think honestly, the scene in which some top military officer curses his destiny because he sent his daughter to study in London, enough to make you despicable. Anyway, it can not be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of film art after all, is not it? Poorly. It is at this point when his manners are becoming too artificial, like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks appear: blurred windows, blurred lights, strange wedding, walk along the river, and people with yellow water cloaks. Also Mastroianni breaks new place for most of the striking performances at all. Avoid really. Go to his early films.
