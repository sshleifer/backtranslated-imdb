It's not a "film of women," but a movie for a gang. One of the worst movies ever made by a male director about women. Director Andy McKay just does not know a woman. Toes of bad taste, humorous style of American cake, raw story, no sense, obsolete story, reversed characters. There were vulgar fantasies on the screen. Insult and certainly not fun. I wonder how the three good actresses have accepted to take part in it.
