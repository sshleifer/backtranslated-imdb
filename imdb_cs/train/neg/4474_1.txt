wasting my life ... the director should be embarrassed. why people feel they need to make worthless movies, they never make sense to me. when she died at the end, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the movie because I was embarrassed watching such bad acting. let's hope that whoever plays Heath will never work. I also hope the director never gets another movie and his pay for this bullshit. {.02 of 10}
