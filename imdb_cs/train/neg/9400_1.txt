It is very unfortunate when such a film is shot. A lot of work and money has been put into a movie that is best amateur. The cut is stretched, there are obvious errors that could easily be removed at the second sampling, and the soundtrack is non-imaginative. With this video, much more could be done. I do not think they got time or video cassettes. Handheld shots have a distinct amateur feel.
