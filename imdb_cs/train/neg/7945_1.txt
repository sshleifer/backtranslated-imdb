The film so much confuses religious ethics and ideals that it can not create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. By submitting the lawful execution of the convicted murder as a catalyst to the apocalyptic end of mankind, the film highlights the parent's murderer as a martyr for Christ. Somehow, according to the conspiracy, God is angry that the company has decided to get rid of the fanatics who killed their own parents by lighting them while they were sleeping in bed. Still, the same god will not affect the killer's actions. The leading figure, a non-religious pregnant suicide woman, eventually gives her own life in a daring but unlikely attempt to unsuccessfully rescue this convicted murderer. In other themes of a developed plot, Jesus returns as a powerless and frustrated wanderer to symbolically unleash God's wrath. The modern, unspeakable incarnation of Christ not only does not allow man, but laughs at the messianic ideal of all religions. It can not influence mankind for good, and indecisely skate the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy his own. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, a mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself able to reincarnate herself in her newly born, soulless child, which in some way rescues all mankind from the wrath of the Almighty. I also interpreted this as a statement to support abortions at some levels. This movie, which attempts to link many religious themes into the thriller, can not make any religious point that I can interpret clearly, except for the mockery of the people's faith. He raises many questions that he never even calls. He disregards the religious values ​​of his listeners as he attempts to portray the Asinine version of their fulfillment. Stupid
