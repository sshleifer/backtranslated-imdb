I can not vote because I would not look at these people. They got my money by another film (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen. I feel that it is my civic commitment to help people keep from this waste. Go to the forums on this movie and see where the cast members are trying to behave like when they see the movie for the first time. One man even reacts to himself ... with the same name! There are shixy in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not near (in any case). If it is the second film of the company, it should be better than the first. That means the third movie should be much better. I did not see it. All I want to know is how you distribute this basket using the same names all the time. Have fun with friends and make a movie over the weekend is fine ... but do not try to market that garbage!
