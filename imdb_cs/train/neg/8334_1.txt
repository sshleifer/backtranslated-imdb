It has absolutely the worst performance of Robert Duval, which sounds like William Buckley throughout the movie. His musical melodramatic acting takes away from every dramatic interest. I'm not sure if it was intentional theft of the scene or unintentional, but it's the only thing I can remember from a really forgotten movie. This image should be displayed in every amateur class of example of what is not. Thank God, Duvall went to bigger and better things and stopped trying to get a cultural accent. He's a good actor, but that's about it. Klaus is much better. His performance is dim and remarkable.
