Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good at Mumik's hands, have returned to this very small offer of Universal Horror. This time, instead of having Wallace Ford as a comedic "Babe", we get Fuzzy Knight as a stupid friend named "Stuff." But the results are just as charming and the level of fear is virtually zero. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of ​​playing treasure on a remote island inside a haunted old castle. Peggy is one of the gangs going on the road. But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in black cloak and a big hat known as "The Phantom" that crashes the party in the quest for the buried property itself. <br /> <br /> This "phantom" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to even try to keep its average fellow face in the shadows to create tension or spookiness. It's always nice to see Moran, but otherwise you could count it as one of Universal's forgotten stuff.
