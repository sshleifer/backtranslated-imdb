Words can not simply describe how horrible this movie is. I was watching the video last night and I just could not believe what I see. Basically, "Snakeeater" is about the ex-military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sisters who were held captive by the Deliverance-style editorial staff. Film acting, writing, directing, photography and editing are populated together with the song "Soldier", which must be one of the worst songs of all time! <br /> <br /> However, there is one treat. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in a laughing movie. If this is not the case, please avoid this mess in ALL COSTS.
