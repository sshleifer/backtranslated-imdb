A very futile movie with characters that make me so indecent that I really did not care who would appreciate it (or was it the film to tell some cool-talking cold hearts of New York people?) No romance here, no comedy. The efficiency is very flat and very predictable. What worried me most was continual joking with quotes from classical films. Man, can not you see that the more you quote, the less your own film becomes? Try to be the original yourself! A small budget is not even justifiable at all. Dirty, miserable, miserable. No wonder it cost me only one buck ...
