Like an enthusiastic fan of Flashman's books, George McDonald Fraser, I was looking forward to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this movie was released for the first time. Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment - so I left her 20 years before I came back to look at it again, but it was not the second time better. Mr. Fraser is an extremely skilled writer, but I'm not a fan of his film scripting work with Richard Lester. The thirst for killing has made me annoyance "Three Musketeers" and the same is true here. The whole tone and feel of the movie is bad for me. Flashman's books are somewhat fun, but they are adventurous novels. The way Flashman has adventures has a lot of seriousness - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is translated into novels, but due to the comedic style, the film has never been uttered. It's a tremendous shame because it could have a great movie if it was a more faithful adaptation to the style of the book. When I first read that the book should be filmed, the article said Oliver Reed was supposed to play the film. I rejoiced because Reed was a flashman to me. How I would like to see him in this role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but he does not fit into the Flashman's visual image of books (too smart a viewfinder! Flashman should be a big band). However, Reed was excellent as Bismarck. The movie kills that it's a comedy. The only scene in which he creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). Great shame, like production values, costumes, sets, etc. They are excellent and casting is generally excellent - almost everyone in the film is well separated from Malcolm McDowell. Perhaps Richard Leester's directorate is responsible for the way the film is, because the recent radio adaptation "Flash For Freedom", edited by Mr. Fraser, has worked quite well. Maybe someday we can see that Flashman made justice on the screen.
