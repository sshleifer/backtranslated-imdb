(spoilers) The only truly unforgettable part of this otherwise rather boring and lukewarm British meal is Steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst jobs in dyeing. That and the beautiful caterpillar eyebrows on an old evil dude trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job that makes the pious boring and gray movie fun. I like it very much when Crow kills Mike with his "Touch of Death," and when he revives him in the theater, Mike shouts "Boys, I've died, I've seen eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this is this movie ..." It would be disappointing, he had to go back from the afterlife and watch the rest of the Designed Man. The film could make the fortune sold as a sleep aid. Some hits in the movie were bad: police inspector - "Electric current!" Crow - "Shocking, is not it?" police inspector - "That's ok, okay" Tom Servo "Very low, right down the floor!" police inspector - "Can I continue?" Tom Servo - "He's dead but knocking on it" MST3K is definitely the only way to look at it snoozer.
