Inside Man tells the story of detective (Denzel Washington), who is being investigated for his possible participation in the case of missing money. When the bank is robbed and the hostages are held by the master thief (Clive Owen) and his team against his will, is the detective determined to force the thief to surrender? his only shot when he showed he was innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intentions, sent to get an item from the bank's safe deposit box that is stored in the bank, and you have a completely dilemma. Unfortunately, everything you choose in the movie and nothing worth at the end. Denzel Washington is the most uninteresting in an ineffective and uncomfortable egocentric performance. The only economical merits of the film are its competent stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster brings the most surprising and high-quality performance against the type as a ruthless, cutthroat villain species. Clive Owen is not given much in addition to outrage and pose, but the depth of his presence and his accomplished acting skills more than offset his underdeveloped role. It is strange that such a talent spent on this film has little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking about when creating this movie. However, the most unfavorable aspect of Inside Man is how many unwarranted praises have been received. For a movie that seemed to have all the premonitions of a premiere blockbuster, it's terribly flat.
