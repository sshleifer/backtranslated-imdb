CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> While visiting Rome, the love nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young liberty (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed by the sharp Castelnu's father (Massimo Serato), and Fate deals with a tragic blow ... sexed-up love (Alexandre Dumas "La Dame aux Camelias") scriptwriter Michael DeForrest director Radley Metzger, who, along with Russ Meyer and Joe Sarnov, contributed to the adventure with a new definition of adult cinema parameters in the sixties and seventies. Metzger's "la dolce vita" survey, which has been using his recent career in shaping, is rich in visual surplus (for example, emphasis on reflective surfaces), although the sexual sincerity of the film looks alarming in accordance with modern standards. Production values ​​are nice all over the world and the performances are very humorous (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite the weak dubbing after synchronization. Although in the unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini is the frantic set of designs to place the film firmly in his period and Piero Piccioni's "wah-wah" musical score has become something of a cult object among the exploitation of devotees. Finally, CAMILLE 2000 is a taste, but fans of the elegant softcore erotica of this director will not be disappointed. Another one was Metzger THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many see as their best film.
