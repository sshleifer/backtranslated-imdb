We bought this series on DVD for all the brilliant reviews we've seen here. I gave him three stars because it is undeniable that sometimes acting, direction and writing are brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we have not seen the propaganda that was so smoothly transmitted in the series. When one looks at distinctiveness, he sees the entire litany of radical right-wing beliefs of the renowned Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid distributing spoilers, I would point out to highlight all dozens of specific cases. A brief look at the land on IMDb reveals that everything from torture to the control of weapons to the right of the network provided by "Infomercials" and called them "news" is justified by the cute conspiracies and disturbed speeches given by some of the best actors in world. We have watched many exhibitions and eventually gave up disgust when justifying torture through Prosecutor General Gonzales as a glittering example of why all kinds of torture should be used to protect us all. The series also manages to humiliate male and female gays by using subtle ways to use them as fence devices depicting evil people. All in the litany of a radical religious right wing. Undoubtedly, the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as evidence that America lost its way at the beginning of this century. As a student of history, I myself would characterize this program as a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and part of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use this tool as a learning aid to help students understand how tiny propaganda can be so active in any case. Just buy a cheap copy to avoid enriching the ultra-right players in the Faux network that created this travesty.
