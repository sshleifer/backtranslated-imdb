Recognizing an action movie with an interesting premise: a young mafia who is about to kill (Chandler) must show his boss that he is a good person for service, so he goes to California to do some lessons with a well-known professional killer (Beluschi) . The first and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee), which is totally strange for all of them. But is it an easy target? The film goes on and comes out of this basic idea, but the result is just a bad routine; even a strange act at the end does not save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give it 4 (four).
