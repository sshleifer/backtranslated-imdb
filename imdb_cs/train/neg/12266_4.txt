Republican images come late in the game to the "Werewolf" genre Werecat. A writer appeared in the plot, returning to Paris after a long trip abroad, during which he developed fear of jungle during which he had outages. It comes to great success because his novel, which parallels the infamous test, is the best-selling one. The French government wants to know if it has access to secret documents, which seems more likely when an official is killed by a "katman". Suspicion really falls to the writer when his fiance ends dead. Complicated issues are the return of outages, so the writer does not know whether he's a killer or not. Okay thriller is too indifferent to enjoy it. Too many musical numbers are in the beginning and too much dead time when everything in the middle and later part is spoken. The acting is fine and the sets are pretty good, but it's the reason why most people I know remember only a top killer is the most interesting thing in the movie. despite the short duration (just over an hour), I think the reason why this movie was seldom seen on television was that after 20 minutes you started to suffer with patience. As well as she speaks, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, it was too late in the final minutes. <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
