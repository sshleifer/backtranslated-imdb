Worst De Niro Scorsese collaborates in this terribly agonizing violent excessive mess. Scorsese is completely out of his element in this movie with the horror of clich√© suddenly loudly ringing the phone and the door of tricking tricks that seem ridiculous and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman. Cast is completely unnecessary, and southern accents are very uncomfortable and forced. Nick Noltie plays the most precious lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend someone! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than a typical 90th film psychic killer. The scene with De Niro and Lewis is very unpleasant and the climax continues on and on, and we all should be more than tired of a psycho stalker that never dies. One of my worst film experiences. Lease of the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
