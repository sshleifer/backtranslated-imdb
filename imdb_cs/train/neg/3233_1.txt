C'mon people, you can not be serious, another case of advertising tobacco when it is not! It's not even terrifying or scary or humiliating - it's a terrible amateur video rental that is meant for the next party to put the girls down. Gore is incredibly bad, even the eye-scarf is far from being able to shatter, but she just wanted to take me a camera and hit the people over my head. The girl just puts a rubber face, does not move at all. It would be much more fun to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> One season, "I'm a celebrity, take me here!" is more scary than this one. Do not waste your time or money.
