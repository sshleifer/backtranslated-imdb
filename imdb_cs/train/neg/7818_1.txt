I usually do not go out of the movie, but I did it in half. This movie promised something else, but did I think I did not see it before? Warning: spoiler! In the year 1, the spacecraft collapsed and landed on the ground, well, all those years later, with the super adult on board, no less, this thing will continue to burn and crash! What, this advanced civilization can not seem to be developing landing gear? For an industry that is so liberal, we see another movie by Woody Allen, not blacks please! Superman runs around to save people, make sure he holds in Europe and the US, does not go to dark areas, please. Maybe I could stomach 30 years ago, but now.
