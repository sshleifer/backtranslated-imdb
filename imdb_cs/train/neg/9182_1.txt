Just like everyone else said, acting is horrible, no story, no poor director. About SFX, 360 degrees, shooting in matrix style, 1 shot is stupid enough, but for each character. I mean, come on, have a break. And what happens to all of these game scenes just to remind us that it's "video game adaptation"? Jesus, he should shoot the one who thinks about it. <br /> <br /> <br />
