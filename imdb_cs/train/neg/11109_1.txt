I'm really surprised that this movie gets such a rating! I have not seen such a bad movie for years. That was really a bad movie. The stripper is not enough to describe unnecessary (almost fun) blood scenes). If you do not like Hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ... it's ten times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps. I can not say about acting because the script was so awful. Clich√© all the time. (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < We are talking about thousands of murders and no one will notice. In fact, these people are simply missing. And there's a good guy trying to solve the mystery (and there's no secret for us because we know the bad guy from the beginning) and as usual nobody believes! What a surprise! Eventually, the butcher kills the massacre and kills with death!
