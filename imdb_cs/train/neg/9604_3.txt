The first thing I noticed in this film was, of course, an unnecessary amount of nudity. There is no need for nudity or anything but much that was not needed. Annik Borel plays an upset woman who believes in her stories about her family's stories that her predecessor, who resembles her, was a werewolf and believes their destiny is destined to be the same. Which I actually found quite interesting. The original werewolf was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw a real Wolf man you should never have seen, extra, or two. I found this concept of someone who was not really a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately this is not the movie I was looking for. Instead, we know he's not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no excitement or twist, and they're also trying to make the movie look like it really happened to be the script. They do not succeed there by adding one or two parts of the film that relate to reality. At first, I was thrilled to read the film's description. But I slowly realized that it was a cover, just to be able to reveal the breasts of the main characters as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since Danniele has no brains and is just a nut that runs madly and grows and waves like a wolf, little skill is played. She has moments when her performances interrupted in a terrifying moment, but she is quickly destroyed by a poor camera and light. The idea is great, but she's terribly executed throughout the movie. 3/10
