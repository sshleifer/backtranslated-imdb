Yes. I admit it. I believed all the hype around this work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in Mexico City about their sexual life. And so I really waited for me to finally see a Mexican movie (aged) that was popular and interesting. Unfortunately, the film was a complete disappointment. The story presents two couples, both of them with very obvious marital problems. When a third party enters each pair's life, their problems reach a key point. Or absolute absurd. The story then turns into a battle for sex. The attitude of each group (yes, literally grouping, girls with girls and boys with boys) is spectacularly stupid and childish (I think humor should be there). And it all goes from bad to worse. The performance ranges from good (Miss Zavaleta) to the average (Mr. Bichir), while Serrano makes acceptable work on his opera prima. Equal circumstances that make up a story, one-dimensional characters, a very bad (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship, etc. Cause the movie to fail. Miserably. SPYL had (impressive) a good reception at the box office. Believe the hype at your own risk.
