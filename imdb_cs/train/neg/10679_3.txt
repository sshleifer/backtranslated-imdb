I did not expect a movie as good as "In The Fire Line" or episode "24", but it looked like this movie was made for television and at best it was average work. (Good) cast did not mask the fact that the plot was too predictable and the actors had to fight (really trying their best, I think) through their bad scripts. When I watched the movie, I felt like I saw it in other (better) movies. In that you had car walks, big shootouts, romance, conspiracy plot, etc .; This movie has none. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** When you see another woman talking on the phone about the character of Cuba, you know who's behind it all and all the advice given to you ("you're too close to the president, you see from my point of view .. ") sounds stupid. <br /> <br /> If it was on me (and maybe it's a good thing it's not), I will overwrite this plot as follows: <br /> <br /> The first lady orders her husband to murder because she is sick and tired of writing checks in Cuba all the time.
