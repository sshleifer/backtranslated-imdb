First, what's good in the movie? Any pretty actress? exotic background? the fact that the actors laugh at playing (I would, if I were in their situation)? I do not know. The story is simple: the Catholic priest who makes abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his brother, male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I am afraid there is nothing that could be learned or left to think a bit about serial murders, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "profiler" (a series) with replacement actors and unbelievable casualties (uncle is a policeman, which girl who lives in the house of another victim, can have a child with a priest etc.).
