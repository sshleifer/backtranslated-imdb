I have to admit that the drawing of this film is directed by Eduard Sanchez, who helped the crazy popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Besides, it's a foreign film that resembled Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, which is one of the films that critics hated, but I liked it. But nope, unfortunately I felt that most of them, Change is a waste of time, so this review will be short. Spaces are always promising and Altered is no different. He tells the story of a group of people who met strange encounters when they were younger and as usual others will take you as an urge to introduce things. Stories about alien abduction have always to deal with the probes in the holes, so I'm not going to go into details, but you get that drift that's damn uncomfortable and something you'd forget. What if you get revenge? This means that you can successfully persecute and capture one living. What will you do? For this group it's a joyful payback period or they thought. And that's where the film starts to develop into snoozefest, with a bad, tireless dialogue and even worse gaming. Even when there is a low budget, there are not many redeemed factors, whether it's the power of the story, or any help from the cast in creating their character just a little interesting. It's a standard cardboard van from a plain script, coupled with some cheap blackmail tactics. <br /> <br /> What's good with make-up. A lot of effort has been spent on producing some things I do not mention because it spoils only a few elements of what makes this film acceptable. Besides, there are usually cheap special effects, blood and bloody moments, which is nothing you've never seen. <br /> <br /> Watch it as a last resort. Compared to another monster movie in the city - holidays, it's less fun and taking too seriously. Damn down, you're warned.
