This film about the secret experiments of the government mind and the corrupt use of citizens by secret and strange shadow characters had the potential to be a really interesting film. But it failed for me. I do not develop much on a rather confusing line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the user's comment "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description. But it was not working for me. I found it slowly, which would be fine, but it did not seem to go anywhere. The viewer is in the dark about too many things to really handle this film - in some films it can be argued that the filmmakers intended to provoke the idea and for this reason left things ambiguous. I do not think this is the case. As for the frequent long shots of the two buildings that were often featured by other users ... I see they keep in mind - they give the viewer the time to get another drink without the missing "action". And I suspect that many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have a few drinks on board to get through this.
