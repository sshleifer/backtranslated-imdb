This is Peter Falk's film. Period. <br /> <br /> When the film came out I was 10 years old; At that time I was a movie. Of course, my parents did not even see this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the writing of his ads and the aura that it was an important film. Well, 34 years later, I finally saw the movie - never before saw a Cassavetes movie. It's a hack, overall. Zero feeling of timing, adjustments. Performance Gens remind me too much of Dustin Hoffman's stint in "Rain Man": technically on par, but no one. When Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man," Falk takes the cake for this film. I was angry at the performance of Genius, really - it seemed to be more suitable for "Awakenings" (jerk!). It's not all her fault: it's a briefcase from the first scene to the last one. We never know why? Falk's character seems to be real, and Falk is WONDERFULLY exercised as a seriously flawed man. <br /> <br /> It's been arresting a portrait of not a woman under the influence, but simple, Cro-Magnon, a man who cope with a wife who does not work, and still can not to deal with her three children and husband for long hours of work. I would like to remember Cassavetes for "Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". He would have been a better director if he had made his own surplus tendency - how he came to this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
