I usually do not write reviews, but I do not understand why it's so much rated and wanted to remind lovers of horror because I can assume that all the high ratings were given by average TV observers. <br /> <br /> <i> I just watched the first two episodes, but the two were so cliché, it was not even funny. the same old stories you've seen / read several times - living toys, bad things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative but they are also bad versions of these clichés. I prefer, for example, "chucky" and "silent hill" over these two episodes at any time. and do not even ask for visual effects ... those in the first episode are fine, but in the second ... terrible. it looks like the film student's project has gone wrong. blood ... or gore ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. It could be interesting for a ten-year-old child who probably has not seen / read so many scary stories (although I recommend "to believe" - ​​now that's what I call a decent mysterious TV show). but for an adult horror fan it's worthless. I got only 3 points because in reality there is some beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting.
