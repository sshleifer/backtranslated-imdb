I had two reasons why I watched this swashbuckler when he was broadcast on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigid - and here I was not disappointed. She looked beautiful. Secondly, when I read about the film, it seemed to me that it contained an absurd humor, which is not unlike what can be found in the films of Philippine de Broca. For this reason, I am unfortunately disappointed. I found predictable jokes (except for some funny notes on the subject of war) and the figures are completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninitiated manner, without a sense of drama at all. I was still watching until the end, but I was bored very quickly and just sat there waiting for Lollobrigida scenes.
