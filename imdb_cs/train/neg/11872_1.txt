The only way it is family drama is when parents explain everything wrong with their message. SPOILER: feeds a deer for one year and then kills it because of eating his meal after killing his mother and first pontificating taking responsibility for his actions. They accuse bears and deers of eating bad behavior while taking no responsibility for using the appropriate locks and fences or even learning to shoot instead of killing animals twice and letting them stop.
