I can not believe I spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film. If there's only one movie you'd have to miss, it's the one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father died recently and has begun to deal with some local anti-social teens and drugs. All this is subconsciously more violent and eventually such a subconscious explodes ... The first thing is that I do not think that in this movie I will find meaning or trace of great ecstasy every single sign. If the director considers what I saw as a great ecstasy in the last few minutes, I must say that it is not even close. The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time I have not seen any expressions on my face from the actors, and I did not feel that body language is enough to make any impact. Perhaps the crew were so tired to have corrected the camera to include everything in the setup. Everyone is happy, except for the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and talk that might be related, but they are really so random that you can never pull them together, maybe only if you are the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> You can find less than 5 minutes of real acting in an hour and a half, and everyone else is just people who walk, talk and move. So I really can not comment on acting. <br /> <br /> A nice selection of music in the last few minutes. Maybe it's the only good thing. I never gave movie 1, but this movie definitely deserves it (at least you laugh when you look at haunted movies). This is a film about when an unsuccessful attempt to portray problem teenagers has met an extremely troubled audience. I hope you will not get into any group.
