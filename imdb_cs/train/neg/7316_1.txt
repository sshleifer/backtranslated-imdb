When I saw the previews of this film, I did not expect much to start - about the other dark horror. But wow, this movie was totally terrible. And that's great. <br /> <br /> First, casting for the movie was terrible. You do not feel compassion (or any morbid feeling) for characters. The game was so terrible that I just waited and hoped that God was going to end the terrible thing. Secondly, there are points in the movie that have absolutely no connection to the story. Can someone explain why a girl boy starts screaming "PANCAKES !!!" on the top of his lungs while going to Jackie Chan's movements I've never seen before, and another bite of that guy who has the virus? Why does the child's father continue to upset himself with a virus infected guy and go on a chase to find him? I was left feeling of such confusion and utter distrust that I literally said aloud, "Where the hell came from?" He just could not believe what I saw. I really thought I saw some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever is all on top. This movie made me shatter and shudder again. Then blow my mind. <br /> <br /> Please save an hour and a half to do something more productive. Tracking grass is probably a good alternative.
