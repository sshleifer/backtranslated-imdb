When I first saw Versus, I had great hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD was promising. He did not provide the living. Very slow development. Loading potential with occupancy and cold image. The assumption was interesting, but the payout did not rise. It could do much more in the end. Most of the movie is just "sitting around". Simply put, three of us were seated to sit down and watch this film and a 50-minute mark that we were trying to resolve to the end. They really needed more shock elements. If you are looking for Ichi Killer or Versus type fighting then save yourself a few and a lot of disappointment.
