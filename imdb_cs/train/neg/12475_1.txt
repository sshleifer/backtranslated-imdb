I do not remember going out of the cinema until this one. Not only that, but I was with seven friends and we all wanted to go. Unbiased plot, characters from clay, violence for no reason. It did not matter to me when the good guys died; It did not matter when the boys got it. Fantasies and spells were laid on thick as a liver pudding, and there was no coherence. In short, great fun if it happens that you spend eternity in hell.
