I can stop the question once and for all: "What's the worst movie ever ... sometimes?" It's Flight of Fury, played and written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are a lot of great bad movies, but this cake makes it so serious. It is a Romanian film that talks about the extent to which Romania should go to capture Bollywood. He also talks about how he was completely lacking in the intellect and talent that Steven Seagal became. This movie is so bad that after watching it you literally feel broken and you need to welcome yourself in the corner of the shower and cry because you know nothing will feel clean. <br /> <br /> It was released only on the video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect that the laborers who had to make the DVDs had to wear protective aids and received regular advice.
