It's like a bad 80th TV show that has relaxed and tried to become soft-core porn movies. Oh, my god was wrong. Each character has little meaning. The conspiracy itself was nothing to talk about. Something about the stalker, I think. Eventually shooting? It's not quite clear, but somehow it's a volleyball game. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason why my friends rented this film was that Casper Van Dien was in it and eventually ended up and wanted to move him forward into scenes that barely watched. Thank God I did not make any money, but I want the hour of my life back.
