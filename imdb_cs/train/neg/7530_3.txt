I found this film boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hasty, shallow "optimistic" end that did not sound the whole story. Following these characters over the weekend about terrible events, hostile attitudes and bad news, it's just not my idea of ​​a traceable and interesting movie, and I was very tired of the "one note" topic and could not wait for it to end - actually, I almost stopped in about half way. The whole film seemed insignificant and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressed and uncomfortable, even though the acting was good. A small film with small ambitions and a little temptation - sorry, but it just did not happen to me and I love good, small movies! He just did not dare, though I watched as he hoped and believed it would be. I was disappointed, especially after the two local evaluators listed their "Year 10 best" list. I would strongly recommend watching the "house of sand" instead - now it's a good, small movie!
