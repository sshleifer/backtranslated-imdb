When I saw the title, I thought we were going to get another jet slasher, but in fact I found that seventy-five was a slight pass through and almost 80 years back after a rather slow mid-section that raised momentum for the last half hour leading to her uncomfortably sticky climax and utter exhaustion. It will not win the prize for its originality because it's as systematic as you can get and steal your thunder on the way of excitement (usual cheap jumps), location (detached mansion) and motivation from other films. The blinking direction is next to the book and the material is quite surprised by the ill-informed red screams as part of its elaborate drawing and modest script. Sometimes I am ridiculous, but I have mainly talked about her brutal and threatening acts of gross violence against some of the occasional harassing college students with a psychotic killer with a combat ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a brave young cast, but the characters they displayed were not too tempting. Always Present Rutger Hauer appears in a short supporting role as a detective who dresses. Slick but shallow and forgotten add-on to the folds.
