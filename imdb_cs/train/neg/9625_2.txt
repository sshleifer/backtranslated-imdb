This film offers absolutely no fantasy in either its prejudice or execution, but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so-called comedy that has no energy to talk about. The story is about Reuben Feffer, a director of analytical insurance risk, Ben Stiller, who finds his new wife, Lisa (Debra Messing), who cheats him with a diving instructor (Hank Azaria). When he returns home, Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to the party and go to Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) with whom they went to school years before. SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly is forgotten and sad and lives carelessly, which is the opposite of who is Reuben as a man, but begins to date and Reuben begins to change as a person when he starts to try new things like salsa dance and eat spicy foods. But one day Lisa returns and wants to stay married to Reuben, but she really does not want to, but Polly decides to leave because she does not believe in the wedding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's very easy to say that something is not funny, but I think it's even easier to find out why. This movie is completely and completely predictable from start to finish, when each scene looks like it's just because of the ridiculousness of the script. Hamburg, who also wrote the script, apparently wrote it without thinking of trying anything else, and seems to be trying to generate the same energy as "There's something about Mary," but instead the events seem incredibly forced . Did anyone really think the blind ferret was fun? If you do, your easy! Several times during film characters, these emotional expressions would have unexplainably explored, but everything that they do is overestimated. Stiller works a lot, but maybe he should work less and just wait for better scenarios to come his way because this movie does not work as comedy or romance.
