Great effects of CGI and really an Oscar-like performance by Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is the only poem in this film to win Best Oscar for the year when Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /> <br /> This movie is a loving love letter of baby boom generation, with barely concealed right-wing prejudice, from Forrest's Vietnam service to "resolution" with Jenny for the end. <br /> <br /> But it is said to be an extremely entertaining and American film throughout. Some parts of this film I considered to be extremely insulting, Zemeckis is so close to the level of Gump himself. . . Maybe that was the reason he was trying to do it. Watch this movie and ask yourself, "What does Robert Zemeckis say about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> It seems that Forrest has chosen the "right" decision and has been in the "right place at the right time" over the last 45 years. Those who mistake the director's vision will probably pay a big price. Zemeckis also says that idiot camouflaged as innocence and naivety is patriotic, even American quality?
