The first ten minutes of this film about filming an international film in Belgium is fine: you see real chaos on the scene, a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown, a cool director (Mickey Rourke), a badly tempered star, etc. You've seen everything before, but it's done well . BUT THEN! For the rest of the time, the film repeats itself: ten minutes over and over again. No top, no dramatic development, no good talks, no bad deal, it just goes on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good moments when his character talks about his career in a scene where reality and fiction come together. Overall, it's 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
