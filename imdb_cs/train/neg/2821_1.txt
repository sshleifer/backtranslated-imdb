I only saw this movie once and it was enough for me. The film has very little if it's a conspiracy, and it seems to be nothing but a coherent scenario of psycho-sadistic violence and little else. I wanted to see this movie because Zoe Trilling played from the second "Dawn Night"; and I wanted to see someone playing normally. Unfortunately, Tobe Hooper's script barely begins and does not lead now, because Robert Englund dominates the film and chews the landscape and conspires. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
