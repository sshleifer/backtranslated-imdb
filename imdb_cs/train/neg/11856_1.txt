I just saw this movie yesterday in the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006 and I really wonder if the people at the festival actually screen the films before they choose them. The film was just terrible - I say that without hyperbole or side motives - it was terrible. Matthew Modin's days as a leader are on their way. Gina Gershon had an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her involvement in this film. Gloria Reuben had a weird little stone inside her - she should be ashamed. The script was terrible, and there was absolutely no reason why the characters should be involved. I really doubt it will be highlighted, but again, people in Hollywood are sometimes familiar with mistakes. I really think that "The Fish Pipe" is a serious candidate for the worst film I've ever seen.
