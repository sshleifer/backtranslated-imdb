what kind of sh * t is this? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was observable and as good as the first movie at the beginning, but from the part where the protagonists gain the super force in their dreams, it became childish. This sh * t should be rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see some very mature stuff, but it was only for a third of the film. The rest is for young children. In addition, it is too focused on Christianity. I know that Freddy is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways of fighting demons. Why should Christianity always be? It is a complete orientalism and full of white men / Western supremacy. Do not watch it, show it to little kids who love power guards.
