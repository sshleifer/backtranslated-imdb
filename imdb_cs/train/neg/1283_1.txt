I have to say that I first watched this movie about 6 years ago, and I really enjoyed it. I bought the DVD recently and after the second view I wondered why I liked it. The game was terrible and as usual we have stereotypical quilts in our fake costumes. The game was at best horrible. Tim Roth did work OK, like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange thinks. The conspiracy line was good, but executions were bad. I'm tired of seeing in Scotland so portrayed in movies. Fun hearts were even worse, which is that movies just save grace. But seriously people did not talk like that at the time, why do all the actors have accented characters from Glasgow? Just another movie that tries to capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I noticed that the only people who say this movie is good are the Americans, and to be honest, I can see why they like it, I know they are interested in men in KÃ¡ltas. But if you're thinking about buying a DVD, I'd say you'll spend money on something else like a better movie.
