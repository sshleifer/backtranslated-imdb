I saw this movie at SXSW with the director present. Relatively few people left and the audience barely gathered even polite applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is among the worst. In 106 minutes it is at least 95 minutes too long. You will be able to look at the unsuccessful and exhausted attempts of the principal to communicate in real-time. Same grimaces, mouth movements, kinetic and frantic repetitive words and syllables over and over again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. One site actually compares this work with early Mike Leigh. What drugs would you have to do to make this statement? Since Frownland is the song Captain Beefheart, you might have to use Trout Mask Replica on a heavy rotation to appreciate this movie. It was incredibly awarded the jury's award at the festival. You can bet that it has not won the audience.
