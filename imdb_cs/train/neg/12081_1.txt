Note to George Litman and others: The Secret of Science 3000 Riff's Theater is "I do not think, the * breeder." my most favorite riff is "why did you look at his" like "?", just for a total absurdity. and "Good not good!" above all, I would like to say that we must strengthen the MST3K crew for trying to laugh at this TV film. you really can not talk about dialogue; Bill S was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that it would even reject it. the dramatic club of a junior school could do better. <br /> <br /> I suggest that you buy a book and read "Hamlet".
