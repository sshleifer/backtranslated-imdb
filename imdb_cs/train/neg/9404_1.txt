This absolute waste is based so close to Friday's 13th series, which is a virtually carbon copy, it accepts it because it is an Australian film with people who can not act. Once in a while the young boy was accidentally burned while shooting a music video on Lake Eildon. Now a few years later, the boy grew up and avenged anyone to come to the lake to make a music video. It's a clich√© and a waste of time and money, seeing it just out of curiosity, or if you are an aspirational actor who tries to find out how NE (unable to) act. The leading role of Alan Dale starring in the television series Neighbors, but ended in a set of X - how did that happen?
