Whew. What can be said about the Gymkata that was not yet? This is nothing but pure dressing from start to finish. If you want a movie that keeps you on the floor with a laugh, it's the perfect movie that you get. From Cabot's wild slim combo / wig to Parmistan (and that's four billion ninjas), everything about this movie is useless. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Clouse, an unheard-of mind that brought you a mirror scene in Bruce Lee's Game of Death, once again reveals his complete lack of directing talent. Several other faces you most likely do not recognize will also appear for your entertainment, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you will not remember or care for them after the movie. <br /> <br /> They come from a book called "The Terrible Game," which if I could find a trace of her existence anywhere, I was interested in reading it to find out where that thing went wrong. Instead, this book is obviously a fancy imagination of Gymkata. Probably something Clouse has devised to sell his fragile idea. They chose this and Yakmallah for it. It's simply one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's a little bit true.
