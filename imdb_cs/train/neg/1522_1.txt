You should know that I'm a type of person who watches even the worst movies to the finish, often from a totally morbid curiosity. I even watched Leprechaun until I was tempted to tear my eyes and print on them. You should also know that this movie was in my video recorder less than half an hour before I made a furious jump for the stop button and broke the rental shop just to keep me as close as possible.
