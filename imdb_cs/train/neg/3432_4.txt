A murderer, a cannibal rapist, is killed by a crazy cop at the site of his last murder. In his tomb he gathered a cult with plans to resurrect him by jumping on his grave. This, of course, works and he wakes up when he breaks his penis and he's back to his old ways of killing a brand new zombie. Two cops, one of those who are a little crazy about the city and have problems with drugs, are back to the case. Two of the original members of the cult also try to stop the murderer by resurrecting some other dead thing. They thought they were leaving, but the plastic doll that was used in the original resurrection came from the grave. Sounds a little mad indeed, but it's not just his garbage. The game is awful and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent Gore in the face of the gore series and is just as awful as the uncomfortable cop in this movie. The other policeman just tries to get his horrible lines. Now I'm for low budget cinemas, but this movie is terrible. If it was not for the ladies' very easy eyes and their nakedness, I would have slept. There's a little gore, but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the victim's stomach. Zombie make-up on the other hand looks great and his long-legged penis used to rape his victims is fun at times. There is also a decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. A doll with the voice of chipmunks is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in the movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. The end is very bad. You expect the murderer to fight much more than he does. God knows how they made enough money to continue. <br /> <br /> 4/10
