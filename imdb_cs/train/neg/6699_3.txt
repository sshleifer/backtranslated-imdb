"Algie, Miner" is one bad and dysfunctional silent comedy. Tag timing is completely off. This is a kind of humor with certain sequences that drives you to wonder if they are funny or not. However, the true quality of the film is irrelevant. This is a mandatory watch for movie lovers, especially because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is a feminine fellow, acting like a stereotypical "pansy" that is common in many early films. The film has a common homophobic attitude of time. "Algie, Miner" is quite awesome but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
