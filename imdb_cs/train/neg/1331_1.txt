The Collusion Course is even worse than the typical films of "white male corporative capitalism evil" of the week. This movie is less pleasant than a tooth. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his underestimated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he performs in line with the requirements of his character. This movie is so bad that Leno's character, a sacred jester, is less poisoned than Morita's character, a sacred fool.
