I hired Hybrid for the weekend. What a disappointment! A stupid humble attempt at tele-film. The guy who got the lead was totally weak and when he ran, he looked like he was eating the sweet candy ... with his back! The contact with the wolf he was wearing was great, though I thought he was relying on the actor because there was nothing wrong with him. The wise Native American Indian must be one of the most stony hard faces ever seen. Talk about an acid cow! She once smiled at the movie and I think it was because she had sex. The sex scene was also lamela. You could also show that the curtains, if you can dig it. <br /> <br /> First, and that's a big domestic hate, on the cover and DVD menus, losers have digitally pulled cold, sharp teeth on the boy. They have never been seen in the movie. :(
