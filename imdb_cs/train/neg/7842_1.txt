He caught it by accident. he pointed out-and could hardly believe how terrible the experience was. For comparison, the original "Man Called Horse" was a spell-binding because it held one interest all over. But this piece of nonsense - my words fail. It was bad enough to have a "story" introduced by all the impacts of a wet loaf of bread, but this mistake was complicated by the apparent lack of subtitles all the time it was interpreted by the so-called "Sioux". For good, could not the filmmakers find enough North American Indians who were also actors and close actors to play as "Indians" in this farce instead of the scammers they actually used? I also realized that it is embarrassing to watch Richard Harris, who finds himself across the landscape at the very beginning of the director standing just behind the camera. He told him that he was running and jumping from an insignificant point A to an insignificant point B just to shoot the movie records and minutes. Absolutely terrible in all respects!
