I watched it with my mom and we were like ... What the hell? We did not get it at all. Maybe I got it wrong, but the chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father. That movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good movie with tension. Bad film with tension! * shakes the cane in the movie * I can never see her again. And I'm also a big fan of lifelong movies! They need to stop trying to keep movies out of the books. It's crazy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> My Rating: 1/10
