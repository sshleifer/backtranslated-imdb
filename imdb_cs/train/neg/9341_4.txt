This comedy by Hal Roach, Tough Winter, is ninety-ninth in the series "Our Gangs / Little Raceclips" and the 11th Talkie. Bascally show of black comedian Stepin Fetchita, who gets a special invoice here, we see that he goes to his hut where the gang hangs. Farina receives a loving letter for him, and Stepin tells him to read it because he can not read it every day when he goes to NOC. This is done by his darling in Tennesse, so now Farina has got cotton-eared ears because he's too hot to hear! In another room, Weezer hand over Mary Ann's instructions that she makes taffy from radio, but because she's still running back and forth in the kitchen, she misses a segue announcer on rice pudding and Spanish Tamale confusing Mary Ann with Tabasco and Lux! After finishing the production, Jackie and the rest of the gang are helping with a terrible tasting but a very sticky cloth, as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. When everyone tries to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that combine the functions of variable appliances such as a vacuum cleaner, a vacuum that rings, and a refrigerator that plays music! End. What I have just described shows the meandering nature of this "gang" that served as a pilot for a potential short series Stepin Fetchit. It's just as good that it never happened because Fetchit's lazy black man was just fun in small doses and would be considered very insulting today. Many of the scenes I've just described are good for some laughter, although the last sequence was so confused that the results were too foolish for me. So in summary, Tough Winter is a curiosity that's worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
