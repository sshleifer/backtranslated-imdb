And put it "2" instead of "1" (terrible), because there is no denying that many of the visual images were amazing, a lot of talents went into special effects and artworks. But it was not enough to save it. <br /> <br /> "Sepia" tones, squeezed some colors, was done many years ago in other movies. Nothing new there. I see there are some hat-tips on other old, classic movies. OK. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But the movie has to be fun and interesting, it's not something that would make you sleep. <br /> <br /> Story and script of this movie It was terrible, characters are two-dimensional. Slow motion. Some scenes were quite nice, but in the end, as a whole, it was pretty boring, I could not recommend it.
