This is only getting worse as the stars of David Hasselhoff. Well, then leave me. Compared to the waste, which today is called horror, this film is not too bad. He has a beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot but she can not speak well. She has a great scene with her when she is supposedly raped. He shows his nice body. Linda Blair does nothing, just like Hasselhoff. 3/10
