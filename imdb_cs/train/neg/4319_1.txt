I'm sorry, but I will damage both the plot of plot and the end for you, in the hope of avoiding a recreational fiasco like the one I'm facing now. Father dies and his mother asks Santa for a letter to bring him back to his family for Christmas ... and Santa is doing it. Dad is juicy, happy and healthy, and he does not know he's dead. Everything ends up sweetly sweet. But as a parent who recently watched as my five-year-old lost my best friend, it was horrible. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his friend back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the will of the young heart - no persuasion will convince him that it is just a movie and that his dog is NOT back to Christmas. It is the heart of breaking to watch his joy, just knowing that Christmas Eve will have to face his loss again. <br /> <br /> Damage to you on behalf of all believers who have lost loved ones recently. It is quite difficult to deal with the loss of one child, but there are some desires that we should not even plot as an option.
