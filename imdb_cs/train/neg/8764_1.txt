This film was absolute torture. First, it's unbelievable 4 or more hours! It is true that the Kargil War could have several points that were captured and fought, but each of these battles may not be proven. So maybe it's a documentary, not an ad. Sure it did not seem to be, because there was not enough background information and there were some mistakes. The combat sequences were so poorly executed. I'm terribly disappointed by a man who did well-executed sequences on the border. Each battle was exactly the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (It could be a spoiler). The whole army marchs to the hill, five or so soldiers curse five thousand times (every time they also use the same key), one of the main actors is shot, someone yelling at the litter, the actor says, "No, you will not get the stretcher, it will take 6 men from battalion, "and then the actor dies. That's exactly the same thing happening over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. Casting a movie is too great for his own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters were well developed. Actresses had the smallest roles. Everyone is dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them wept in sync. It was so comical. They moved their hands and their head at exactly the same time, then bit together each other. <br /> <br /> The list goes on and on. I know I forget something. By the way, I think I shot the film so much that you got the picture.
