Where to start ... Oh yeah, the message for the bad guys: When you first find the person you watched (for the sake of killing) who witnessed the crime you committed, you do not spend time with him for another opportunity to leave. Victim report: When the chatters talk to each other and guess, take this opportunity to "RUN AWAY", do not sit and watch them until you hear the noise they hear. Message to the director: If someone has a 5 or 10 minute lead in the vehicle or on foot, you do not have bad guys at the top or bumper! time and motion does not work like this. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) a man so she can be abused at home.
