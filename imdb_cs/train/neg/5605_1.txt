I was very disappointed with this film. I expected more of Thelma and Louise from friends. Instead, the women in prison have leaked in this film, they have no sense of loyalty to each other. It was an extremely vulgar pack of hyen who overcame each other, crossed one another and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the movie. Instead of being thieves thieves, planning to escape and finding hidden money, female getaways were too selfish and cruel, trusting for a long time. These women were not liberated in the positive sense. They just ended like a lot of free cannons, unable to respect each other or themselves. If you like 70th film feminine crime movies, skip this bomb and look at The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, where Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones play.
