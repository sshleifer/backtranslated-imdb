No, <br /> <br /> You are basically looking at something that makes no sense. If you do not measure a movie for people who really want it, check out this movie, I'll explain this story. Everyday everyday women walk down the street and find their own car. It follows her and many events take place during this time, which includes her and her family. I especially made an account to comment on this movie about how horribly it was written. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story just did not bring it anywhere - it could be extremely widespread and come into a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer is trying to achieve by answering most of your questions at the end of the films, but this movie is asking: What happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just went for nothing. /> <br/> Spoiler Starts __ <br /> <br /> They had this area between two dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come to our world and kill us. It was not worked out during the movie, and you never know how it happened or why it was or when it happened. Nothing can be explained during the film. The main character should not be the main character either. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally comes out and runs away (sister girlfriend) should be the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, threw it right after .. do not waste time. I really hope that nothing like that happens again.
