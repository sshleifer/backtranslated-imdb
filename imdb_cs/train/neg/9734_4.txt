The man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the strength to ... blow the flames! <br /> <br /> I was really focused on this movie, which was directed by the great Toby Hooper and staring at the wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above the average film with individuals with violence. Spontaneous combustion behind is an interesting assumption, unfortunately it never seems to meet its potential and prolongs its plot too much. But the special effects are not bad and will help bring the film to the final. Cast is not bad, Dourif steal the show. Everywhere, no classic, but it's not the worst of its kind. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
