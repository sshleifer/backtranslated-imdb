"Flight Of Fury" is the shocking but the worst of all the boring action movies - I do not expect Seagal Film to expect a lot of fun for about 90 minutes with some soulless action - unfortunately it is not even attaining that low expectation. Action scenes are little and far, conspiracy (which is totally insignificant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with huge plot of holes in the whole context. It's really terrible - it's bordering on Seagal's torture and his whispering One expression performance is best amongst a lot of third-party players - it's hard for me to believe that this scarecrow has spent about $ 12 million, except 11 million of which 12 were Seagal's salary - I doubt it! One moment of any interest in a Straight Boy or a Gay Girl is that apparently nowhere two hot girls end up in a lesbian sex scene of some kind supplemented by huge gossip on the screen other than that - It's average things that do not like many Michael Dudikoff B -Films I resisted 1/10
