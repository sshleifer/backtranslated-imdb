It seems that this movie has a lot of people who say it's one of the most brutal of all time. After I just examined it, I can say it does not suit these claims. The idea of ​​the film is really demented. Overall, executions were not worthy at all. Even the last scene (eye thing) is not really so ugly. I was expecting something crazy, instead it was inferior to gore released on movies like the ultra low budget Violent Sh! Everyone who wants to see the real movie will be disappointed because there is no story (though most people know it). Fans of Gore will be disappointed because, unlike beliefs, blood and guts are a little and far away. Not to mention that an actress playing a victim may be one of the worst in history. No matter what people say, this movie is not so shocking that everything is upset. Avoid it.
