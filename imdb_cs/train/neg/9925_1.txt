It was on the 30th anniversary of the DVD for the Blazing saddle, brilliant itself, but not this. Nowhere have I seen the name of Mel Brook and I can guess why it makes much more sense not to meet this pilot. My gawd, who would find this funny. Sure, it could be a racing problem, but it just was not funny for me because it's just not funny. It's like writers did not even try to be humorous, just to make sure they are connected with the Blazing saddles. Did they expect this show to be a pilot for several seasons? Flat out, it does not matter. It was a quick cow that did not pay for God. I think it's useful only for historical purposes, or just to show how stupid and unimaginable Hollywood writers can be.
