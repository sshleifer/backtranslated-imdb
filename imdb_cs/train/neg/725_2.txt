It was a terrible movie! Not for the item but for delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time the movie came out and expected to see the film about the triumph of the human spirit through oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression without ending. Samples and ads did not mention it! Moreover, because of everything that played golden mud, my memory is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again the previews do not say anything about it! (not that you would expect it, but it's a problem). If I knew how this film would be depressing, I'd never see it. At least I would be ready for it. It was an ad campaign with a bait and a switch and I will never see this movie again!
