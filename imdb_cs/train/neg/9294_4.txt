As someone who was postponed to the incredible visual "Hero," I was watching this movie, which was charged as the same but better. It also featured an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed with both counting. I bought the DVD of this movie invisible and it was a mistake. It was not better. I realize that these flying martial arts films are purely fantastic, but this story is shot so far beyond what is remotely believable that it just shook my head in unsatisfactory disbelief. A blind woman defeats hundreds of opponents? Sorry, that's a bit far. Also the main male character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying due to dialogue, a stupid look on his face and a stupid laugh that he also destroyed the film. Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - for me - simply had no appeal to become a movie worthwhile to own. This movie is not my hero!
