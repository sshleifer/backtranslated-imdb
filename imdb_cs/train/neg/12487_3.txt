This film was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> I have the opposite opinion on critics. This is not a case where the material is not at the actors' level; here actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are just not up to the level of material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were all as big as Davis and Cagney and they looked how it had happened One night - a classic classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves she has no comedic talent (for her it's a good thing, it's just the only comedy she ever tried!) Davis's acting is hiding hopelessly, but none of Colbert's acting nuances in One happened. Cagney, a great comedy actor, does not seem to be with his associate, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and gags, but delivery seems to be better suited to drama than comedy. Part of the problem is also a soundtrack that, like Davis and Cagney, seems to be a better light drama than comedy. Jack Carson, who has played similar roles throughout his career, has dealt better with a very similar material. In a relatively supportive role, Eugene Palette delivers remarkable performance. In a slightly different role like the old Western relic, Harry Davenport, it is very good. But in one of the worst performances, William Frawley is irritating. His characters constantly refer to fictional policemen are a bad attempt at irony. <br /> <br /> I really love each of these artists and it's a shame that they do not get any chemistry and no better results than The Bride Came C.O.D.
