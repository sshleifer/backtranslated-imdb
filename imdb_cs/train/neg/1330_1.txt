That's why Jay Leno himself does not admit this movie. It is still one of the worst movies of all time. The game is terrible, the script lacks direction, and the director himself does not seem to be convinced of how to take this film. "Kamos film", "action / comedy", "secret". He looks half way, surrenders and is just for riding. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and specialized artists. It's a pity he spends the time and gifts that make up this mess of the movie unnecessarily. Jay Leno and Pat Morita had spent years engaging in their craft at the Hollywood circuit before engaging in it. Mr. Morita was a star himself, and since the mid-1960s he has starred in such cult TV and film classics as "Happy Days" and a deep but welcoming "Mr. T and Tina". And she won the hearts of America with her roles in the powerful movie "Midway", "The Karate Kid", and many others. Mr. Leno was seen on television shows dating back to the mid-70s. And he was the best artist in comic clubs of America. He sees him on countless TV spots and big movies. It is a pity that they have conspired with this nonsense.
