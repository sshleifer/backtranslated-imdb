I saw this film in my international cinematographic class and was out of the way. This film is nothing but a scene of obvious shock for another. <br /> <br /> The fourth man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve who has the idea of ​​his unexpected dangers. She meets a woman named Christine during a lecture at a local book club and decides to stay with her until she finds out how attractive her boyfriend is. To make it clearer, Reve likes Dutch sausage. So Reve plans to make Christine a boyfriend so he can finally have sex with him. Later, however, she found that Christine had three elderly wives who had all murdered. Now Reve and Christine's friend could be "4 MAN." The plot has meaningless holes. Editing and everything else about this technical movie is absolutely fine. The film is just rough and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, it's not my cup of tea. The movie opens when Reve gets out of bed in JUST T-shirt. So at the very beginning you can see Reve's beautiful bloom floating as he walks past his cramped flat in a hangover. Later, he has a dream where his bakery is cut off with a scissors and they show it along with the blood fountain that follows. Reve loves Jesus' sculpture and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Moreover, there is a lot of blood. More blood than any Freddy Krueger movies. <br /> <br /> Not that I have something against the "shocking" scenes, but this movie is so stunning when it's shocking. The whole movie rotates around the value of the shock. <br /> <br /> So if any one of your cups of tea is, check out this movie. Otherwise it will be far away from this. My mind is still clear.
