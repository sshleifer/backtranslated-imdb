I wanted to like this movie, I really did. He has some good actors, but in the end he looks. They try to be humorous in some places (daughters over trying to eat meals), in other areas (a scene where they clean up a court, agree with joining the team), and some scenes that are slightly interesting are really just fillers (all working scenes). And I did not find "villians" intimidating or hateful, just as I thought them childish unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I met people like those in the movie when playing a church ball. And I'll say the judges are in place. Still, I really did not care about so much about the characters or their search for the famous balls. Maybe because they were all so one-dimensional, which might not make much sense if the movie was more fun or it seemed to be a bit smoother overall. Kurt Hale and Halestorm Entertainment have created some good movies, but this is not one of them.
