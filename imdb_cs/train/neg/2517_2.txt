This film is a perfect example of how NOT to make a science fiction movie. The worst trend in science fiction is to make your theme horrible, sophomoric, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxleyan / any understanding of the "human future." Sci-fi filmmakers (and authors) as geeks, taking themselves seriously because of the relatively high ratios between their genres. I think other genres with high CTGSR (yes, just did it, released), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a slightly better idea of ​​not changing the world with some deep "message." Sci fi can certainly be successful at a serious level, as many great filmmakers have done. But there is a huge unfavorable impact on the whole concept of "Robot Jox," with a low-income construction of "the future" (a lone good design element: bizarre, smooth sightseeing billboards all over the place to encourage women to have more children); his painfully heavy parallels "Iliad" (NAMED ACHILLES FOR GOD WILL BE!) Actually, I did not pick up until I saw the movie as the tenth, but I went to school so the creators are not liberated.) Of course, if you're a crazy movie such as I, this disadvantage has a great rise. I absolutely love such films because bad movies are often more fun and sometimes more interesting than good. It's a little Lester Bangs access to watching movies, I think. <br /> <br /> Note: Leadership in this movie (Gary Graham? It's his name? I refuse to go check.) He's really not that bad. He does it. He's very cold, especially when he's drunk.
