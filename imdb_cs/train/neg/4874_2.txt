It is a shame that neither animals nor Eddie Murphy have anything to say good to say. this film is just plain. <br /> <br /> Children's film? Well, if you're trying to get them to sleep, then maybe. It's just 90 minutes of some animation on the eyes that are bad for pets, and quits that are not fun. And the synchronization of the lips causes old Godzilla movies to look great in comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy faces a suppressed undervalued van that is painful. He seems to be trying to change his old manic person, but what? In short, all the magic and miracles of the original version of 1967 are lost in this reconfiguration, whatever it is. The city wants to scare some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad things. No really. And Pluto Nash can bang with them. Things are divided along with some obsolete jokes for a blunt, inspirational conclusion without surprise. <br /> <br /> Rent the movie '67. Or some old cartoon yogi bear.
