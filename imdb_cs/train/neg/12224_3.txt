Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story. In order to have a chance to gain education, Babs is enthralled to masquerade as a boy, which is not the hardest thing, because the Boy looks like anyway. At her new school she meets a bunch of male classmates who have no problem at all to believe he's a guy. Do not miss out on the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs's male friend thinks he's a man, but he's "rolling" on the floor, sitting on "him" and looking shrewdly in his "eyes" .... Snicker. Mediocre film; an angry story of nothing interesting.
