This movie is a farce! Names are grossly ill-ordained, and the plot is twisted and disgusting to something that any literary enthusiast does not recognize. And they have a thief to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / cone weapon. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem he pulls Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can not believe that the screenwriters did such a thing. The way Grendel is rendered is impressive. This and the cast are the only positive points of this feature. My English teacher would be crazy if she saw this abomination. If you are not a desperate fan of the epic poem "Beowulf", avoid this movie at all costs. And even I would not recommend it.
