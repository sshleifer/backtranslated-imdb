I first bought it at a video rental shop. Second: I watched it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: Most of them were lamela. And last but not least: It's not just a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler despite this unfortunate and forgotten movie. I'm sorry, because it was his first film. Even if you are a huge fan of Adam Sandler, do not bother to watch this movie. Instead, just take the video, board the yacht and throw it overboard.
