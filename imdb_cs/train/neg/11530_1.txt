Over the past ten years, I have worked in 3 different independent professional wrestling organizations, managed many professional wrestlers (including 2 star Backyard Wrestling), worked on 2 different TV programs and played voices and comments for many DVD matches. I have never seen a level of total amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skills and poor quality production found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Even show it as a match video of any kind is a complete misuse of the term. A low-dollar video camera is basically a home-made video of children playing behind the scenes. Sound quality is poor, video quality is poor, and playing is terrible. The "wrestlers" wear improvised costumes with hand-drawn shirts and ski masks, picking up various objects and half-mimicking match matches. Sometimes there are "matches" on the grass. Sometimes on a trampoline in the back. ALL are badly solved and performed without shame without any matches. In short, you do not have to bother with this rot. Whether your interest in this DVD is fun or academic (both in my case), you will be very disappointed.
