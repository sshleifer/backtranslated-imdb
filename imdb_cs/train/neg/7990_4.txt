"Anita and Me" is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic Britain, rather like "Bend it Like Beckham," or more, "East is East", with which it shares the 1970s. The tone is totally chirpy (despite the ubiquitous accents of Black Country), but the film lacks "East is the power of the east and the result looks rather thin and sad." Moreover, portrayal of the film between the Asian girl and her white friend is not deep enough to justify the way the movie I'm also tired of movies where the hero is for years a writer, it's naturally often something that real writers have experienced, but it's hardly a new element in a fictional story. "The East is East" was fun and sharp; "Anita and I "are obvious and boring in comparison.
