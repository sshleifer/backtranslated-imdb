Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> The gang of cheaters. A perfect plan. Everything will go wrong. They are in trouble. The police are out. They are bent. What are they doing now? Sounds good? The film seems to be trying to be a combination of actor, Indian film and theater. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of thing that loves actors - it's like a workshop or a game, because it mostly consists of a narrow focus on actors acting ... angry, strained, scared, planning - gives artists plenty of free choice to really invite them. A trio of scammers, one leader, one guy, one brother, came up with a big heist system. .. and a monkey key fits into work. To bad things, there's a little "fender-bender" and one of the cheaters in the deck over the back of the windscreen. Policles are on their tail and they come across a bar named poetically (and lead) "Dino is the last chance." Spacey, as a director, tries to focus on actors' performances and delivering dialouge. He tried to press on a bright and passive red cigarette with smoky and glowing Bogart. And indeed, it keeps all off-screen violence. I think it was a mistake. Focusing on intensity and horrible violent scenes would give the film some edge. The problem with the film is that it moves too slowly and suffers by virtually disappearing in every role. Matt Dillon seems too young and too idealistic to become the leader of this gang. Gary Sinese seems to boast and deeply thinks to be a paperless tag along with these guys, and Joe Mantagem is as effective as the traditional routine foul of the supernatural lieutenant police who is all in. But he is not given anything that would she could really do. William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a helpless grunt who wants spilled blood. <br /> <br /> And scammers are in a tense situation when they either go to jail or try to think of a way out of this. <br /> <br /> Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it. The characters are mostly in conversations, trying to think about the plan ... and they have to calm down and too articulate. There is even a scene where the scammers hurl themselves to the whole hall of armed policemen directly from outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the scammers will even call the police in front of the bar. Oh brother. Enriched. <br /> <br /> These policemen either throw or unlock. Should not scare scammers a little scared, a little bit of trouble? Meanwhile, all real actions happen inside. Someone is carrying a gun, a baseball bat that leads to an ugly confrontation outside the screen, and there's another accident that happens ... well, a little sad. But ... Faye Dunaway should also spend more time with a dialect coach who has improved on his accent in New Orleans. Skeet Ullrich is all right in a minor part. A policeman who listens to a pack of matches in the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so it's the scene when someone goes by the right rear glass. <br /> <br /> Of course, Dialouge is trying to get to David Mamet's approach and it's just as bad, but never realistic or indeed real. The film feels like too much what it really is ... a really low-budget film with a camera actor for the first time directing other actors from a scenario that is not "bad but needs a couple of re-writing." Spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a feeling he's "making a movie," and feels he's been filming actor. <br /> <br /> These actors are talented and can work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said, the film really suffers from irritation. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that bad actors were included. I think they found just the right cast, but they put them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some roles would be great. When veteran of the crowd star Joe Mantagna play the pack leader, Gary Sinese as the angry cop's lieutenant outside on his bullhorn gives orders and barks to his troops, keeping Fischter in his "bloodthirsty task" and Matt Dillion as a scapegoat. That would be a great improvement. When some actors direct, it works. They can even win the Oscars for it. But a lot of time when actors move, tend to focus on performance. Just shoot the actors. Sometimes it works ... but they need a good demonstration program. Excuse me for it. <br /> <br /> The situation in the hostages is similar to the story of the next ages in real life, so it is only natural that the films will also go from point A to point B. <br /> <br /> There are some really great posts for this genre. "The universe itself appeared in a similar film about hostage situations:" Negotiator. "It certainly will not become cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, it has a few nice moments and personal touch, but in the end it's immediately forgotten and the kind of movie, which is best played on a regular TV, Do not be avoided by the ways you see, I'm giving out 3 out of 10. The universe's "Beyond the Sea" director's credit was supposedly a better effort, hmmm ... maybe it's true. <br /> <br /> Dane Youssef
