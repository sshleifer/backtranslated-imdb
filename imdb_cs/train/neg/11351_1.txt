With MASSIVE commercial it goes to Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that's what my son was hoping to see. Among the DVDs and theaters I've seen almost everything from the incredible (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad (Wall-E, Bear Bear). But it was perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or no children. It was "when will this stupid thing end?" kind of experience? Okay, it's about toddlers (or better - it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3 years old), but I've never seen something so predictable, repetitive and slow moving. After you're finally concealed, but you're relieved that the movie is over, there's the bizarre thing at the end that you think is a joke setting, but it does not matter - it's serious even though it's hard to tell what they are trying to achieve. 3-D effects ... yeah, if you've never seen the Viewmaster, it's great stuff, otherwise not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son was bored to the end. My wife and I looked at each other and finally said "wow". Badly in every respect.
