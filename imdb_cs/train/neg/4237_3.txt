JUDAAI was a courageous film by Raj Kanwara at his time In 1997, when such a topic was damned expelled from the box <br /> <br /> To give him credit, he would succeed in showing how greed changes man and how <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < when he earns so much Just show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are several cringeworthy scenes <br /> <br /> Direction of Raj Kanwar is adequate although sometimes too melodramatic Music is fine but most songs look forced <br /> <br /> Anil does her role well Sride is in her part of excellent Urmila is decent Among the rest of Kader Khan is as usual Johnny Lever is funny, Paresh irritates Farida is decent
