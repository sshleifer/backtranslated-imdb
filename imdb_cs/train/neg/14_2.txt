There are moments when you finish the movie, you want to return money for the time you spend. It was one of those times. I almost moved away with just 15 minutes before I endured ... and I wish I had ... The tempo that a person goes from direct, controlled, controlled life to total rigidity and irresponsibility could never be so fast . From promotional celebrations to the predictable conclusion of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence and by the change of the mind of the fabric. The female part of course is understandable when watching the talent of a beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But the fact that the penny-pound aspect of drug, violence and devotion to the person he has just met is impossible to understand. Honestly, besides looking at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keen, this movie has no redemption. Save money, save time ... do anything else ...
