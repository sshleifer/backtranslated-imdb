Omega code was a model of cinematic inconsistency. It was a bit of (but precious) good acting, especially two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise, acting was definitely wrong. The conspiracy line was relatively weak and only partly based on an already debatable biblical interpretation. Of course not one of the best.
