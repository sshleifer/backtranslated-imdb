He watched the film really enjoyed Gregory's Girl many years ago. It was a disgrace. This conspiracy was vaguely disturbing when the teacher and his friend were breathing more than 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. It seems that the previous commentators think it does not matter, but it seemed somewhat hideous to me. If you have children at school, then the last thing you want is that every young teacher entices your pupils. We were surprised to let the censor pass. In addition, the film was just a waste of time. The script was poor, and John Gordon Sinclair tried too much to recreate the image of his schoolboy, slightly horrible and wall. Why anyone would want to see him in this performance is incredible. I did not get this movie. Dreadful. Please do not waste your watch time. Life is too short
