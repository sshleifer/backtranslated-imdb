Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (burial ground) and produced by legendary Italian Horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this combination of great talent, you would think this movie would be a real gore fest. It can no longer be. The massacre falls directly on his face as one of the most difficult slasher films I've ever seen come from Italian cinematography. In fact, I tried to stay up in the movie and I never had a problem with Italian horror films. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with a prostitute who is killed by the side of the axle road. This scene was used in the Fully Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene, and it increases your movie's expectations as an ax that controls defeat. Unfortunately, the next hour of the movie is so boring. The film continues to a horror movie that is filmed and there is a lot of character development in all of these scenes, but the characters in the movie are so boring and misdiagnosed that your interest begins with a leak. The last 30 minutes of the movie is not that bad, but it could still be much better. Gore in the movie was pathetic, and because Fulci used most gore scenes at the Nightmare Concert, there was nothing new. The end of the movie left a nice turn, but it's still very unanswered and the continuity falls directly across the floor. It was not a very good film, but for a real Italian scarecrow (like me) this film is a must because it is very rare. 4/10 stars
