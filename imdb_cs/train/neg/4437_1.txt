The "triumph of love" is nothing more than nothing. It is fertile, humiliated, 4 hours of torture. In fact, it's been more than 2 hours, but it seemed much longer. I am delighted to even think of amateur performances by such subtle actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Supportive players are not that awful. Maybe they tried to be so high that they were clowns, but if they did, I did not see it. Mira Sorvino does not impress any one. He is right there. My estimate is the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, much better. It could not have been worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this film, was inspired by the recent production of the game. I do not know what she thought when she created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe it all lost in translation.
