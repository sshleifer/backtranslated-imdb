It seems that everyone was pampered about this subject and did not even notice how the film was shot. The deaf, deaf guy is fine, the victory wins - that's good, the aspect of cricket is great, but the film is overall average. I think it could be a lot better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on real life events. I'm sure the movie could be more interesting. The songs are just stuffed and I had to literally pass the scenes where it would be seen from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good acting. Traceable.
