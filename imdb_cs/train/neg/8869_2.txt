With the release of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry actually hit the rock bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived with his wife Marie (Regina Lund) for a long time in a quiet life. One day, an old friend of Stephen comes with a favor to ask him. Stefan has to do little kurier work. He should bring a suit full of heroines through Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately things in Germany do not work as planned and Stefan is now in great trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks a traditional family drama. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea what the film is to be written, shot or cut, it can only be disastrous. Content can be closed: bad behavior, disjointed conspiracy and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex scene with the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. It takes only a few seconds, so it's about 90 minutes clean, let's say what it really is, bullshit.
