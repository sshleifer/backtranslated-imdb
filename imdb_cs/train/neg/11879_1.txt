My wife and I rented this movie, because some people set out parallels between him and the "office space." Blockbuster and IMDB even had a "recommended" offer if you liked "Office Space". Now I've seen Office Space about 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Funny, humorous and representing characters that remind me of the people I worked with over the years. The "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" by being both movies. This is where the similarity ends. We were probably sitting in the first 50 minutes of HT, giving us the pleasures of doubt and hoping they would not pray * that it would be better. No. We could not take it anymore and stopped the tape. Thank God it was a free rental. I would be sure we'd pay for it. We should be reimbursed for having to sit. Now, because we did not see the end, it might be miraculously assembled and redeemed. I doubt it. The Haiku Tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe it was ever made. The movie is so unfortunate that it's painful. Just send dead letters already !!! The assumption is asinine. Jokes are terrible. We got to the "printer does not work" scene and had to stop. We could not take it anymore. This film is EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of office space ... ... you do not waste your time with this turf. 0/10
