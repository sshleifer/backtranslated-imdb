(There are Spoilers) The homosexual nymphomaniac hooker Miya, Kari Wuhrer, takes over the life and car 18 virgins, though he is too embarrassed to admit the collage of fresh Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the film, Myia not only pull away, but give the poor, innocent and naive Trent a lesson of telling the dangerous work of nuts and keeping it so far for him or her to avoid becoming one. <br /> <br /> Hanging around Miyy Miyy rider will raise Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy hit, in the back seat of his pram. Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is none other than his estranged daughter! Enraged that Miya is reluctant to make Roy almost strangle her to death just to be interrupted by the first year of college student Trent Colbert, who opens to the side of rest as he drives one of the trucks. <br /> <br /> When she sees her chance, Miya jumps into Trent's car and both are in what turns out to be the wildest car chase they've ever shot in the movie. On their way through the northeastern US, they are finally involved in a truck that breaks murder and shootings with state soldiers, which then lead to the parents of Trent's homes while being held hostage. There is another wild shootout between crazy Miyou and the entire SWAT team, empowered by local police officers and state soldiers. <br /> <br /> You can expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be deliberately or unintentionally entertaining, but it is not. In fact, the film is very worrying about Miya's handling of everyone in the movie that he comes in contact with even his poisoned father Roy and poisoned children. Getting Trent to move her across the northeastern Miyassa gets the mad sloth that has him in the motel room, along with whipping ligatures and a lighted candle. Miya also gets it with the motel owner horny Mr. Foster when he cheated him to give him a gun as part of some weird sex game. After holding Foster, he leaves with Trent, who in a cold motel room, wraps with about $ 40,000 in it but does not bother to leave with his car. <br /> <br /> They need money to pay for the gas to get home to their parents on Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on her Miyy mobile phone to pick her up in the local dining room to get the money back. Just like the dwarf is Trent, he's raising Miyu, who is now a legitimate fugitive, and later joining Father Roy on the open highway when he tries to bypass Trent & Miya out of the way. <br /> <br /> Chase ends up in this abandoned wear that Roy haunts Miya, raiding him on a muddy high heel path to get to know him where he exploded from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take his trousers to forget to leave the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> With victims and murder, as well as strike and run, charges against them two desperadoes stop at the S & M / Tattoo boutique, where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed in leather and chains, from Myri, along with the corresponding writing collar. To meet his equal and conservative parents for a Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> During a firefight with state soldiers, one of them ending badly wounded, both refugees by law will end up with Trent's parents Mr. & Mrs Colbet, David Keith & Elaine Martyn at home with the entire local police force, with the SWAT team , they are waiting for them. <br /> <br /> An unpleasant film with a really disturbing end result that has made you wonder what exactly the movie has attempted, if at all, to tell its audience. You first felt a lot of sympathy with Miya, but when the film stretched, when it got worse, it evaporated as quickly as the ice cubes in the valley of death. Although Roy was the most uninterested person in the movie, at the time the movie ended, Miya completely eclipsed him.
