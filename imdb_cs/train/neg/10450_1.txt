This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie". I laughed the whole movie, instead of being afraid. It was funny how snakes would look for a certain part of the passenger body to attack, for example, the eye, tongue, butt, breasts. If we have seen the national geographic channel, we know that the snakes will not hold on to the body after pregnancy. For each single scene, the snakes strangle the passenger and leave a bite on the body. I believe the producer did not investigate the information about the snake and its behavior. I can not believe I lost my money to this movie. So I do not recommend that this confidence in the movie just waited when it was in the dollar theater or borrowed it.
