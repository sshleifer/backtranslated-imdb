Gayniggers from space are a short foreign film about black, homosexual aliens who are exploring the galaxy until they get on Earth. Being a homosexual, their aim is to have the universe only for men in which all people are gay. When they see women or "female creatures" on Earth, they are first frightened; eventually they decide to remove all the women on the planet and free the male population. The offensive title, with a racist, homophobic and sexist plot, though likely intended as satire, gives this film some value for shock. However, there are few substances under it. As another reviewer has pointed out, besides character names (eg ArmInAss) there are a few jokes; I think I laughed once for a little gay joke. I think I quickly got into the movie, it was a satir of bad science fiction, but after that I had enough; I still wanted the movie to end (and it's a short movie!). Not brilliant or very well written.
