A horrible movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just filler. The film was bad. Why I have to extend what I do not know. This is my time. I just wanted to warn the others. Avoid this movie. The act is angry and writing is just sad. Badly in every direction. The only nice thing about the movie is Deniz Akkay's breasts. Even it was destroyed by a terrible and unnecessary scene of rape. The film is a poorly imagined and totally unbelievable piece of waste. OK, now I'm just selling IMDb for this stupid rule with at least 10 lines of text. At first I wasted the time to watch these bugs. Then I feel compelled to warn others to create a bill with IMDb just to find out that I have to write a film about the film just to say how wrong I mean it. Totally unnecessary.
