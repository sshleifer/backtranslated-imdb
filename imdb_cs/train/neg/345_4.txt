This can not be the last movie of Mandy Schaffer. Someone, do something! : D: D: D: D: D: D: D: D: D: D: D <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The brother was pretty well done, and until then she did not get to the movie until half. And please, put Mandy in several other movies! She's too beautiful to cover her career at such a young age, hea .. .. <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms, if anyone cares (apparently no one liked this movie much.) First, as Traci still appeared at the right melodramatic moment to see what and it was never seen in return, it was very annoying Hollywood: Stop gifts gifts perfect time happiness that depletes just the moment they culminate, it's stupid to write better scripts so you will not have to if your script is not good enough to <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen would not fall for that fake trick Traci pulled out. He had Traci fingers. More bad writing / directing. <br /> <br /> I could erase this film also, but it prohibits grace. Actually, I hated it the same way that the others seemed. It just did not have much reason to make it if it was not a clean vehicle that would show the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and whoever thought she was not sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say it's not sexy? One or the other of us needs glasses and I do not think it's me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Do not confuse "Moore, Mandy" - although I would like to see her again) ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. I mentioned, I hope that Mandy will make me more movies? <- D
