I did not expect much from the movie - a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be transformed into a modern, credible and soothing, melodramatic and interesting story. But this movie has decided to get rid of the talents of people who have been involved in the simplistic version, so linked from the source material, it's amazing that they have the courage to call it Wuthering Heights at all. He does not forget the fact that it is the story of people who are essentially insurmountable, mostly misunderstood and often cruel among themselves. Changing the very nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example in the novel, did not have a bony bone in her body - she got rid of her blind idealism and transformed her into a deliberate bitch. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically tortures most people on their way, but in this version Catherine eventually leaves his daughter in his care. Dialogue is unique and one realizes how the actors managed to deliver in some way with straight faces. Instead of depth or real emotions, we know they mean something when they scream in one's face. I read criticism at the beginning of the nineties, "Wuthering Heights Emily Bronte," which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, who said it embodied a dark-gothic story in a dirty corset. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes one step further, with a basic narrative structure that brings happiness to the beaches that boast really bad music.
