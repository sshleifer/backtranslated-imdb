... or the audience. Rapid recapitulation .... So you have a doctor who, for some unclear reasons, has been experimenting with stolen body parts. He wants perfect transplantation, but he feels he has to do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately and comfortably, his fiance gets his head cut off in a traffic accident for which he is responsible. Agonized with grief, she keeps her head in the lasagna pan (or is it a chunk?) And pumping it full of "adreno-sera" (sic) to keep it alive. And then she wakes up and talks about the fact that even if her neck is clearly separated from the vocal cords she has no lungs so she can not speak even if she has it. It seems that the blessed God does not see everything her fianc√© did for her. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his sadness turns to whine when he sees the possibility of transforming his beloved head into the body of the first dirty bimbo that can rise from the street. Meanwhile, the assistant physician, some kind of secondary business Igor, gets into philosophical arguments with a head that has struck telekinetic friendship with a "monster in the closet" (every mad scientist has one). Finally, the writer realizes that he can not continue his misogyny and fear of intimate affairs at the ad infinitum, so he kills everyone, then probably goes to the bank to read the check before the financial rescuers of the film have the opportunity to stop paying for it. <br /> <br /> I talked about it, I think it's a bad movie? Someone should tell Turner classic movies to stop showing this edited version without what's going on. The assistant's eyes were ripped apart, the pigeoning around the house, without much blood left, is simply too expensive.
