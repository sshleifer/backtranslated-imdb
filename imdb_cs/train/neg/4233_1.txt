I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 for it. The only redeemed quality is the horrible gore. Dabing was worse than any other I've ever experienced. Looks like it was shot by a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects because there was plenty of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen but I have to admit the abundant gore that was not as disgusting as it could be because the whole movie is so stupid and incredible
