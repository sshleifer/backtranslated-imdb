A brain that would not die is one horrible piece of film that broke from the initial credits. It has all the classic hints of being bad: incredible plot, scary acting, low sets and lighting. The plot is as follows: When the doctor and his fiance find themselves in an accident, he gets into his head and he raises her head and takes her to the lab where she puts her head in the pan with the special fluid that keeps her alive. I bet Virgnina Leath, who played her head in the pan, had to spend a lot of uncomfortable times as she put on a stick around her neck and knelt under the table. However, the doctor tries to find her new body and hires two strippers so she can choose one to have her new body. It was so bad that it was torn to pieces at the Mystery Science Theater 3000.
