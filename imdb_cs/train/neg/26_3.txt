Assuming it does not lead to live video transmission, I must say that this title is not at all cost. If you're not bored with good, well made movies, that's it. I saw it last night at AFI Dallas and I left for the remaining 20 minutes, simply because I did not care (conspiracy, not insulting the director ... that's unpleasant). When you see the movie for only 5 minutes (shot, broken window before burning all the shots ... and then the window breaks with the first shot) things will be bad. Let's just say it's just an indicator of what's going to happen ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I'm going to save you all the details, but it's a sub-par in every way, even half-retreating acting Michael Madsen is disappointed when you expect him to be acting. And rape ... Christ! "Silence and Take Her" should never be used in the scene of rape. EVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
