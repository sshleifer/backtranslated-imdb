Next Monday 13th, even with some of his music! A group of young adults gather for a small meeting in high school and start killing and la Jason Voorhees. Could it be the silly man who is troubled at school? <br /> <br /> The Raster Slash is fun for fans of the genre and includes the usual T & A quota for movies when it comes to his movies. The end is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher. MPAA: Rated for violence / gore, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug content.
