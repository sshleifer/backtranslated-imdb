This film was filmed in a really bad taste. The script was really bad. I feel really sad that the later Gregory Peck, who took over the leading role of this B-film adaptation of one of the greatest generals of history. The film was politically incorrect and totally insensitive to those who fought against the Japanese in the Second World War. There was a scene where I almost vomited, showed Macarthur in a bunker on Corregidor, and talked to soldiers as an experienced politician, a wounded, legged Philippine soldier. A bloody and dying soldier manages to sit down for a general visit and says: "no papa, no mother, no uncle alone" and MacArthur gives his little song that the Americans "will never leave" the Philippines. The scene ends when the soldier is raised by Macarthur's words and gives him sensual greetings. I mean, if it was a more reminiscent scene depicting the USA as a great white savior of the world, tell me, because this is a cake. It has turned out that the Filipinos are girls in difficulty of honor and must rely on the great Americans exclusively for redemption. Obviously and deliberately overshadowed the contributions of members of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces in the Far East), these are volunteers from the Philippines who were integrated into the US Army during the Second World War, who died side by side with Americans fighting against the Japanese who walked side by side with Americans in the Battle of Death in Bataan and defending Corregidor Island by launching a Guerrilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with the famous "I'll Return" speech. My later grandfather, a military veteran in the Philippine War 2 and a USFFE soldier, was one of many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for their home country. I think this film does not give them the honor and thousands of others that Macarthur relied on intelligence preparations for his famous return to Leyte in the Gulf.
