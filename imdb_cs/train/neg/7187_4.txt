Here we go with another movie slasher, good looking people and acting from everyone was really good! <br /> <br /> Few kids play funny phone calls and there parents kill the killer before the kids! 20 years after they are still friends, they go to a huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (no nudity) for at least half an hour of film! Again, they start making pranks by phone again! and then the killer returns and kills them one by one and the killer is in the BIG BLACK COAT with an ax as well as the film Urban Legend, <br /> <br /> Death scene really strange, really strange times too. <br /> <br /> A nice movie slasher in this section would put 7/10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the film a little useless <br /> <br /> Twist killed a movie for me so I will give 4 / 10
