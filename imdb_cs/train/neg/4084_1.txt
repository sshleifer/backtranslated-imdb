You hear again the radio djs who ask the audience to nominate films that a listener can not stand or never meet all the time. This is the movie I think ... a few days later. It's something to do with Shakespeare's play. I'm not sure, but I think I was approaching this movie for about 20 different minutes ... I thought I realized that my nails would not stick and they were watching me> This movie seemed boring and fussy. Even though it's the first movie I got so low a score (which I was actually trying to track), I would not want to postpone further movies by English director Peter Greenaway. I remember his "Chef, thief, his wife and her lover" was a really great British film, though his content was sometimes stomach - a brilliant film, but I understand why people would look at it. Another good film from Greenaway was "A zed and two noughts". Again, it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but it was interesting. Another movie I usually think is too late for such a radio show is "Brazil". He had never been able to see that all the way - he did not stop falling asleep! <br /> <br /> If you do not have the taste of self-important films that are extremely high-styled, demanding and difficult to watch, then ride from Proser's books.
