I only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was young, so this movie is blurry when it comes to remembering it. But I can say it was not as fun as a movie called killer tomatoes, and the most memorable stuff in this movie is a song and a scene with the older couple talking about the poor Timmy. In addition, the film is really just scenes of small tomatoes and large tomatoes that roll and people are behaving and scaring how people should do in a movie of this type. However, just having a very silly assumption and catchy song theme do not have a good comedy to do. You have granted this film to be B movie, nothing you should not take seriously, but you should still make humorous jokes and do not try to extend the slightly fun premise into a full-featured movie. Perhaps short would be fine because a trailer showing the above-mentioned older couple and a man who was desperately trying to fight a bigger tomato was actually quite good. The trailer itself looked like a mocking trailer but did not really make a full movie and rather a weak one.
