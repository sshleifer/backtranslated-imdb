Do you remember the good ol 'animated show of the 90s? The one that people praised? One that could appreciate people of all ages? The one who painted the batman as a real detective instead of Hulk in a bathing suit? The one with whom the villains might apply? The one who had the villains with real motives? Sure, Warner Bros. not that. That's why it's happening. <br /> <br /> Frankly, are these people aware of anything about Batman? Did they even watch the batman comics? Do they know that Batman should be a detective? Compiling two tracks does not make a detective! This makes you a slightly intelligent monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout of the episode: <br /> <br /> The penguin stole something. "Loans Opening". Batman finds dead where he is. Batman goes there and gets into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds an obvious / silly way out of it. Penguin escapes. The Penguin is again obvious. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (by the way everyone, and I think each one is kung-fu for some reason). Batman punch is a penguin. he got them out. goes to arkham. (Note: this is usually another villain in each episode) So, as you may have noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of candy on the ground, maybe it's at an old amusement park!" Yeah, maybe it was the last six times. And I've already mentioned it, but they all know Kung Fu! ALWAYS PENGUIN! what he thinks? (probably because it's from people who did Jackie Chan's animated series) What is really disturbing is that the show is just action. No senses. None. If a batman needs to think, he uses technology, then he does some kung-fu. But hey, do not forget the villains. Still what would be without backpacks? <br /> <br /> But first I have to say, for the sake of originality. I do not think other batman media could imagine being a joker and a scary monkey, such as emotion and poison ivy as a minor (which is a little confusing when you think about it, is not her sexuality going to be her main strength?) What is still The bigger crap, however, is that each character is now a 2-dimensional, stereotypical cheater. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Man-Bat is a powerful hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some inexplicable reason. <br /> <br /> The penguin wants to steal everything. For no reason. <br /> <br /> Watch the sample here? <br /> <br /> But the most offensive must be Mr Freeze. Remember Emmy Award Winning episode "Heart of Ice" by Batman: Animated Series? Who gave Mr Freeze the motives for his crimes? An episode that was so good that it was used in a comic book over the original story (mad scientist)? The one who made him the victim with the goal? Even Batman & Robin acknowledged that with Mr. Mr√°zy coming from P.O.S. film. <br /> <br /> But this series says "F # ck it" and will make Mr. Freeze the jewel in front of his misfortune, only in his mind, then he will freeze and give him the power. He then goes on to steal the jewels without a reason, while saying sh! T lines like "have an ice day". Maybe they watch Batman & Robin after all. But <br /> <br /> Hey, look at the clear side. This series causes you to feel nothing for villains, so it means you're good. Good for you.
