As for HEIST, it's pretty weak. Continuity is quite miserable, there is not enough character continuity to really feel like you understand a character. Peter Falk is great and is one of the reasons why he is worth watching. Falk has some great lines like "he'll be right back, he'll buy some smudge" or something like that ... there's a couple of pretty scenes, though they're all due to the actors' efforts. Direction, script and editing are quite miserable.
