I just saw a movie in the theater. The film has only a few good things to talk about. Kareen's beauty and a few songs can be. And it is done. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Everyone involved in the film will be disappointed, even the Mumbai Indians (right now Chennai has reached the semifinals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scene. Now Bollywood tries to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors have a big influence to look real. But unfortunately, the Bollywood directors do not have the time. He spends his time on the songs and the publicity of the film. Now these stupid action scenes can work in the south because the audience just pays to watch their favorite actor kill a bunch of people. But it would not work in Bollywood. I can hand over all the action scenes that I wish. At the end even some Chinese people seem to be out to beat Akshay Kumara. That's the height of stupidity. Audiences do not pay to watch such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget action movies. They can not do it. The last good action I saw came from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for fans of action films like me. Do these people see your movie after finishing their movie? Can not they realize that the slowdown of the action (done with the rope) is too unrealistic and childish? It is better not to have action scenes if you can not handle them. I just want to go back to Amitabh, where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect these days is not very effective, but visually it is much better than the current scenes. <br /> <br /> This film should now open eyes to Bollywood film directors. Do not use any other action movies until you get the art to be realistic.
