This is the worst movie I have seen for years! It begins with ridiculus and continues in the same way. I'm the one when something happens in this movie, and acting is worse. The end will pick up a bit and save the film from the overall flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in bad film. I'm sorry for Tim Burton Batman was good, but this is angry.
