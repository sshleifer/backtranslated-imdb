Almost every detail of the plot in this movie is illogical and unlikely. It has no form of a real human story, dead and boring. This is a Hollywood parody with trumpet musical bits that remind you of Denzel Washington's film, camera shots and focus, racist stereotypes, absolutely useless and comic shots and gestures of famous people in the clothing catalog. It's made to provide a lot of zombies whose meaning in life comes from watching names of celebrities. The only good thing in the movie is the end of the credits and the funky song that accompanies them. I feel like an idiot to watch, save myself.
