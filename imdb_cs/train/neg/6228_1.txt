This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It starts with a few random blasts and then cuts into a puppet lace T-Rex, which interviews (!) With the audience. He moves back and forth between puppet puppeteer and animation, probably because filmmakers could not afford live actors. I'll save you a long, tedious and inexorable plot that takes this pitiful movie to a brutal 85 minutes. One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby shop somewhere where it sells to print b-movies and bought it for fun only, but as it turned out, our intervention was not unnecessary. This movie makes fun better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood was "Plan 9 of the Universe" was the easiest film in existence, but let Japanamation / Lego cars / puppet puppets overcome it. If you see this movie anywhere, you buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth many, many good laughs.
