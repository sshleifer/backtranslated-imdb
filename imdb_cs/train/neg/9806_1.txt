I can not explain what is the popularity of children's television shows, powerful rangers. I have never understood why the unbelievable kids like this show because the characters seem to be such idiots and do not care that you have to worry about them. <br /> <br /> Costumes look totally cruel as a multicolored spandex that people wear in the gym. What exactly is the purpose of this to show anyway, but for the kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems? What's going on with the terrible hair and the clothes on this show? Not to mention that this show is still playing on cable television only to earn children to teach children how they fight each other when they do not agree on a particular problem. <br /> <br /> There is a lot better fun for today's kids, hopefully they are not as trusting as the children of the 1990s who were watching this show. And what about the homo erotic tension between red and green guards?
