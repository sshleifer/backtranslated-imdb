What's wrong with RGV? It seems to be repeated in every movie. Have you exhausted your creative ideas? If it is, it's time to take the back seat. I came to see the film with great expectations - of course, I could not imagine it anywhere near the original. I knew he would not do it, promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treatment, after all, is not the same person who directed director Sathya and society? Or is it him? I have doubts when I watched Aaga. I will not talk about a plot or story because most of them are taken from the original, if you really die going and you see this, you can play fun with your friends: identify the scenes from the original one and make your own assessment! So Veer becomes Heer (how nasty?) I guess Heer will not sound so great. Ajay Devgan is quite a catastrophe like Heero, the comedy is a tense and crappy speech that was really effective in society, sounds fake. The chemistry between Heer and Gunghuro (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the charming Nisha is trying to become more and more irritating. This reaches the peak at the end. Raj is really bad in comparison to the others, he is a guy who will look in the future. I was really disappointed Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, it looks like a cartoon by Gabbara Singha. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl all covered with a scarf, instead of inspiring fear looks like a beggar with a bowl. The only performance that really excelled was Mohan LÃ¡l as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I have no patience to write more.
