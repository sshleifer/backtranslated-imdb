After an eager wait for the end I must say that I wish I did not get involved in the whole series. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. Everything was destroyed. The trip was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce ... let's say, seven years. Why seven? Why not just? Or nothing? Why avoid the whole adventure? The crew were dying all the way. Why does he want to save the seventh nine? Others do not even count what? The most meaningful part of the crew claiming to get home is not really the most important thing for them. As he says, "the path is more important than the goal". Incredible. And on the final scene they are surrounded by other ships of the Federation and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, return to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst end at all.
