Firstly, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the tiresome emotional movies of the 1970s and 1980s, the movies from this place really began to contain some humor. Imagine making real comedies! In fact, movies are fun and entertaining, unlike long, dark, depressing and boring. During the 90s and 00s, some really great movies were created by the "new generation" of filmmakers. The movie was awarded critics and played a lot of money. This has become the norm! <br /> <br /> Then come United ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It just is not funny. Not even once. Never. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we're used to Norwegian movies to be fun. Especially with such a cast with some really funny comedians. But .. They do not even say anything funny! Where's the humor? Show me humor! Is this an awkward clerk Harald Eia? Is this a surprisingly totally absurdly unrealistic football coach? Is this a comment by Arne Scheie? The film is not just fun! <br /> <br /> But this is not my main rant about United. This is predictable. (And here I'm afraid Norwegian comedy has stopped because I've seen it in many other movies too.) All the time you know it's going to end well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve. There is absolutely no room for surprise at all! Overall, I can say that I was feeling bad when I saw this movie. It was the movie that realized that we probably needed some new blood in the Norwegian film ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
