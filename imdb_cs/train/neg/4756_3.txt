Remake of the great 1972 movie phase, casting Caine as a nemesis of his character from the first movie. But do not do anything nicely. Impressions from the actors, Law and Caine, which are further deteriorating in a weak, self-centered direction. <br /> <br /> The heat setting in the original is abandoned for super-modern living. The close interplay between Oliver and Caine, who made the first such film, is replaced by the horror and horror of arrogance that immediately discovers contempt in the viewer. But this is not handy, to-ing and froing like one then the other character's original grown so well, it's obvious OTT character murdering both characters from the word go. This version of Sleuth is not really worth watching, watching the original movie and being enchanted by the introductory law.
