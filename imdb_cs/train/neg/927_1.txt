I mean really how Charles Band's Full Moon head would let a total ball like DEMONICUS out. I think she should never start with the green light. The story is repetitive, characters are best weak, there's no real story about the Tyrant, other than he's a bad guy. Then the writer or director makes a bad end. That's right wrong, Demonicus is rising. The last survivor escapes the deadly cave, then the image of Chimera appears, which I could add cheaply and chase after. Then, when he goes home, FUNHOUSE. The statue, which was destroyed centuries ago, does not appear for one reason only to collapse. It does not make sense. What the hell did Charles think he would allow a stack of piles of piles, with four different film companies that are so desperate for movies. They could have asked me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. TURKEY.
