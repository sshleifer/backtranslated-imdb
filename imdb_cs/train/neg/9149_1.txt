There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the slightest chance of talent. No one has ever tried acting, even accessories in the caf√© look like they're stuck. Nothing seems to be attempted. The quality of the film is terrible. Most of the action takes place in narrow corridors or in a cameraman-filled apartment that is filled with an idea and swings a leopard camera forward and forward between "actors" when they deliver their lines. No tripod or any suitable microphone, there is poor sound quality. Even "Manos" better than this, at least they had the right equipment. What conspiracy is simply lost in manufacturing disorder. Attach yourself to home videos, preferably from a five-year-old, who will try out video clips on Dad's new camera. You will search for a long search for a movie that is incomprehensible.
