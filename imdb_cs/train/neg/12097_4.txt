In fact, I really did not have a chance to see it. After Mst3king hell out of JasonX with some friends though I was hoping for similar experiences here. Unfortunately, the film itself is too serious. Does it matter to Jason's problems? I'm sorry not to. There is a Legion Ft13. Movies that cover it the same way. At the end of the day, he's a deadly serial killer, I just will not be sympathetic. Freddy was by far the most intriguing aspect of the film with hallucinations and what not. , but unfortunately it was little and far and the end of the movie has plunged into the wrong episode of the deathmatch celebrity ... just not funny. <br /> <br />
