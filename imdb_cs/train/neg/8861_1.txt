Horror horror sequel "The Howling". It is picked up with the funeral of Karen White (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee unfortunately) comes and tells Karen to Brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen is a werewolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill Sybil Danning's main werewolf. Ben and Associate Karens (Annie McEnroe) joined him. The terrible scenario, the bad direction, the awkward adjustments, and the really spooky acting by Brown and McEnro are one-handed. The effects of werewolves are mostly kept in the dark - for good reason! They're terrible when you see them. Special effects also at the floor - although I resembled the flash of the cartoon that comes from Danning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy that is especially stupid and Danning takes off at least eight hours during the final credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - a fun village in Transylvania - it looks like it comes from a universal horror film from the 1930s! Transition scenes include interesting camera tricks; Brown and McEnroe have a good body, and Lee and Danning are good at this - but they can not save him. Really - Why did they do that? Where's the hard money? This is one of the cheapest IMDb movies. It should say something. Danning is supposed to be horrified when she saw the movie - I'll understand why! It must be missing.
