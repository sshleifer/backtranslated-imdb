I was really excited to be looking at it, it's that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then it quickly jumps to the main plot, which is attacked by a group of foreigners and Dyer is defeated very badly while Anderson gets raped. Then they decide to go for revenge. Sounds good, is not it? Well, it's not. The story is boring and sideways, and some things are really weird. I will not make any details, but it has happened that I have no desire to see. I like to give all films a benefit from the doubts and I really wanted to like this. It just did not work. I give him 3 out of 10, mainly for acting.
