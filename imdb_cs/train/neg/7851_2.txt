As has already been mentioned countlessly, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is not an overturning of the original work by Wes Craven of 1977 (generally ignored). But despite the fact that Craven (a double threat with his son, Jonathan) wanted to give the postmodern sequel-remake an official stamp on shrinking designs, he decided to shoot a film of the same quality - GREAT. Former music and video director Martin Weisz takes reins from Alexander Aji and is obviously overhead - yet somebody wonders how someone could create a Cravens Screen Writing 101 movie. Not only are the characters (in this case the gang of national guards who sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely unpleasant and prone to genuinely annoying genre pitfalls (playing without irony, thinks you) but constantly crack jokes that are not fun. Looking at their absolute inability during training, their fate against repulsive, roaming cannibals is painfully obvious. It was only this time - as in the original 1980s - that the script was so simplifying (in fact, it is hardly possible) that any potential subtext is discarded in favor of amplifying the ante in repulsive shocks (we are treated combo-delivery -murder during introductory credits plus volunteer rape for those who did not get the DVD in the middle!). Even the mutants in this trip are powerless memories of an unforgettable nature - the seeming, rubbery looking make-up FX looks like the rest of the film, trying to hide its face from embarrassment. I really mumbled at the lame 'surprise' at the end of Aja's otherwise great film and the producers literally broke at the end of Hills 2, kicking off the scene - a very light scene - for the third installment ... yet Cravens and Weisz created a movie that is so cynical bastardisation of what the 1977/2006 version did, that they would try to find an audience after this offensive slapping.
