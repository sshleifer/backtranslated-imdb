It will completely defeat why Godard is so serious - and One Plus One is a great example of his unwillingness as a filmmaker and "intellectual" polemic. It is hard to believe that Godard really believed all Marxist and Maoist kantas. Anyone with half the brain could solve the decline of those "isms," and how many people destroyed and continued destruction, even though Godard was preparing his films. As a creator you ask yourself: you should have boring voices reading the demanding political diatribes of your listeners, and then, when you could not think of anything else you have to do, put another voice in the first voice you lost your listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard, who insists on making a film with Rolling Stones: of course he did; No? It was the only guarantee that such mindless garbage would appear in the first place: the genius of the stones eclipse a defenseless and foolish political idiot that releases the camera. The book scene was not worthy of the worst marginal theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence even of the little children who were used to playing it - as could be seen. By letting friendly critics say that all these carefree bulls are satirists in the mainstream of the film, it is only a safe departure that offers those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. It's ironic that Godard's one-time big friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, did the best film about movies at all, and Godard and Le Mepris did the worst! By the way, Godard did not choose Stones' trace of Sympathy with the Devil. It has just happened that they were the track they worked on when "the film" started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
