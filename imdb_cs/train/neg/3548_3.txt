For those who like depressive movies with fearless characters and a sordid story, it's for you! From the gruesome atmosphere of New York, which appears to be an extremely cruel and almost hopeless place, to two diverse leaders who do not have much sense of morality, this film is a true downer. <br /> <br /> Why earned the Academy Award was because at that time it was so shocking that Hollywood, a brand new freedom to show all that he wanted, with all the abandoned moral codes, wanted to celebrate this fact. The filmmakers were like a non-mature six-year-old with an unlimited spending account at a local patisserie. So Hollywood gave theatrical viewers (probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homelessness, and other such gorgeous views and sounds that would have thought it a twisted brain ... work. <br /> <br /> I also wished to shock the traditional audience. This was done at this level. The audience was amazed at what they were saying and heard, and the academy, proud of being able to show the dirt and make money at the same time, could not help, but to award this piece of gilded waste. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, I was fascinated by this film as a very young man. But when I saw it again in the 1990s, I left my mouth so badly that I had never seen her again to look at it. <br /> <br /> Actor was good, but what? The game is good in many movies. Nobody has ever said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight can not act. On younger days, Hoffman was particularly good at playing people who were destroyed. It was a bit like Johnny Depp of his time, playing guys like "Ratso Rizzo" in this movie and then "Rain Man" later. Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is the one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid that it overcomes subtle acting. <br /> <br /> This film is not "art" and is not worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope for a long time in 1969 and that is why it is so kindly remembered in the hearts of filmmakers and critics. These are two hours of fury and extremely gruesome, religious cheap footage, celebrating witches (Andy Warhol even gets to grips - no surprise) and generally despised people. I liked the catchy song, "Everyone Speaks," which helped Harry Nilsson celebrate, but it was also fake because Fred Neil wrote a song and sang better than Nilsson did ... and few people heard about Neil which is their loss). And as has been said, the name "Ratso Rizzo" will stay with you! The film is a landmark, but in the negative sense I'm afraid: this marked it as "official" that Hollywood had left the toilet and has since remained in the sewer.
