This woman, who works as a photographer trainee, goes home and takes a bath to find the hole in the ceiling. So she finds out that her neighbor over her is a photographer. This movie could have a great conspiracy, but the plot leaves any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is handling heroin. If they avoided scenes where someone would haul heroin, then it would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought a scene appeared somebody inhaled a white powder. It was really pointless to have so many drugs in one movie. He frightened attention from the main plot and a great story about the photographer. Lesbian did not bother me. I was looking for a film about art. I found the film about drug use.
