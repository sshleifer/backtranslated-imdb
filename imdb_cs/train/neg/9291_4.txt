I can not believe that none of the official reviews of this movie warns people that it contains two pretty disturbing sexual scenes. It is as if our culture has accepted this kind of behavior as just sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to deny these attacks - just as the woman who has been repeatedly attacked and pressured never retains the men responsible for their actions and no one else. One man is stopped from completing the attack when someone throws a dagger on him but he is repelled only "you can not force a woman to love you" rather than "you would never have a woman sexually, you jerk" ... from a woman's point of view film is abducted. They are "throwing bones" to women, allowing them to be both experienced fighters and leaders, but the film is much more defined by romance characterized by the idea that human sexuality must involve the imbalance of power, the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use any fighting skills to try to deter the attackers. She never forgets - she seems to apologize. Overall, it's a depressing and disturbing movie, with great cinematography and great scenes of fighting, but it's not as good as a hero.
