I can not say that I was everything I experienced in the misty moves of Mundae who saw only a handful but it was obvious that it was done at sixteen, and although it might be worthy that the creators could do Tomb Raider rip - outside the garage, it's not because it is quite obvious that they are doing this. The film only works for forty-five minutes, and it is definitely a good thing, because there is not enough conspiracy to prolong it. It has to do with an evil Nazi scientist (which looks like an evil star as a porn star played by a Nazi scientist could sometimes), a mummy that is clearly wrapped in a toilet roll and Misty - this movie version of Tomb Raider, which keeps a lot less time , than Angelina Jolie did in a large budget version. I have to say that, despite its shortcomings, this film could be better. Misty Mundae has a start and even better when you ask me is the fact that the stars even worse Darian Caine. A couple can engage in any lesbian sex that you would expect from Seduction Cinema, and that's at the expense of a non-existent conspiracy, though it's not really a bad thing. Obviously this is a waste film - but the fact that it is short is for its merit, and if you are after some lesbian sex, you can do it worse.
