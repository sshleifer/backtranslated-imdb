Hot saddles! It is a struggle between two stolen brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can fire fires mentally; they divided over children's differences, with dippy love-interest Debra Winger captured on Wednesday. Director Glenn Gordon Caron shakes a dark comedy in Vince Gilligan's script with a presentation so elegant that the film reminds the enthusiastic filmmaker of a $ 15 million grant. It has the pristine energy of a great business feature, but a formless style that does not make any of the characters except their nodding eccentricities. They are not even characters, they are the function of fences. Hardly released into theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over the essence it looks good. Aileron is the only performance in cast that looks really confused. * 1/2 from ****
