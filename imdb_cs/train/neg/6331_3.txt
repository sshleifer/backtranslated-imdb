Mr. Mike was probably the most talented comedian of all time, so I was interested in what he did with the complete creative control of the film. It's sad, but not because jokes are not funny - some (I will not say most of them) are, and in fact Mr. Mike has done a good job of translating his mentally unbalanced screens into visual gag. The problem is that technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, name) is so terribly horrible, the movie is unbearable. Some equipment called "PKO Productions" gets credit production, but it does not look at it at all; it looks like Mike stole one SNL camera and done the whole thing in the afternoon. I realize that Mike's goal is to torture the audience, but it also deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or understand what it is that should be shocking. The DVD, however, is not a complete waste: it contains an excuse for Bill Murray's O'Donoghue and SNL's "Mr. Mike's Loved Bedtime Stories". In addition, the "swimming cats" section of the movie is a great scene you can capture if you want to scare someone. 3/10
