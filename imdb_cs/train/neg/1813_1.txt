If someone wants to make a really bad film, the "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets the scale to measure the depth of badness. Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a sack-white "furry" costume that looks as though they were sewing together from the discarded carpets. Progress slowly, painfully, with more unusual effects that the viewer deny strongly from the suspension of distrust. Add garden gnome (just damn that). <br /> <br /> At second thought, skip this movie completely and find something else to do in an hour and a half.
