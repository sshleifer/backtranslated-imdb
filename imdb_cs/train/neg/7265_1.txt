You will only see it at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs if you have no sleep problems. It's a movie full of demands - it opens with a small quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it's all downhill. Camera - Imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. The storyline - Smokey Robinson and the miracles "Love I've seen in you was just peace," spread from 3 minutes to more than 2 hours, but filled with repetition. For painful pain, this film is one of the benches in the Methodist Church my parent drew me when I was a child. I want 2 hours of my life to be returned. The promoter Julian Hernandez preceded viewing with commentary that the film was "controversial" - it only applies to film narcotic effect.
