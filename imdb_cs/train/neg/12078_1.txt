I literally fell asleep three times when I watched this movie. Sure, it's Shakespeare, and it has a certain way of thinking that is interested or not. But this film goes beyond any barrier of long soliloquies and what not, which can prevent many of them not just interested in the Shakespeare-based story. The greatest obstacle to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often during character interaction it is almost difficult to distinguish who is who he is. I am convinced that this film is nicknamed in English. Certainly they could get voice actors who could add a bit more drama to these classic literary lines. It would be hard to judge this film more than 1, although it may be based on prejudices apparently of age and what would look like a very low budget. It's totally painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do a favor and read the book again. 1/10
