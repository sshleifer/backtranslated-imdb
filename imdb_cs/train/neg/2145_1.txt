I have a question for those who thought about this idea. Why? What made them make a second film about this. If the memory serves, Cinderella did not end with "everyone lived happily after all"? I'm sure yes or it was indicated. Wait for a while if everyone lived happily, how could this be continued? If they do not try to make the most boring story in history, they can not go on. I mean, Cinderella could sing about nonsense for two hours, but why? The movie that ends "happily ever after" can not have a sequel; if he does, then he does not live happily! Something must go wrong, causing problems with the first end! Why? That's wrong, it's bad. This is my last word on this matter.
