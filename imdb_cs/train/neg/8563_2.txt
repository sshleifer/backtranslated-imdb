It's what the name of this thread says. Only the impression I got from the film is that the character Marlee Matlin was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. Her first figure, with William Hurt, where she danced, was stupid. Overall, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and four times I fell asleep. I want to watch the movie with one intent ... to beat my insomnia problem, because all I do is sleep me. Sweet dream.
