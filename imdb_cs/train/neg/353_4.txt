As other reviewers have noted that the movie will die for the past 1/2 hours. Nevertheless, it is before it is predictable and Kate Capshaw's tremendously poor performance, which has clearly never found her character and the ruins of every scene she's in. Connery is all right, just like Fishbourne, but most scenes are being manipulated for an effect rather than a truth that overlaps with feelings of unreality. And the end is just bizarre. The movie makers apparently knew that when they messed up this mess all they needed was sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie for supper dinner to make up for adding a huge "dramatic" score. Each small jump is accompanied by a crescendo orchestration, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of a bad movie in a major league, it's one you want to see, otherwise you skip it.
