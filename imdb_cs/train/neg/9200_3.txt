One wonders how the script was written. Wayne and other artists do the work OK, but because it's not even a comedy, a romantic thriller or something else, it's rather disappointing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ It is, however, interesting to see the real Moravian story that was created just before the US was directly involved in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics has something to do with trying to make a movie for all the tastes, but it ends up with something that does not cost anyone. However, it has historical value.
