Without galloping to any kind of shooting and healthy documentary film honors, I can honestly say I'm angry about myself, that I have been bothered to sit on the full length of "20 data." I will not waste time on plot, you can read more reviews. But I'm going to say that Berkowitz's hyper, Woody Allen's style, was extremely annoying. You would like to let go of coffee or take some comforting remedies. And of course, it is obvious to Berkowitz that this film is a bad idea, because its parts describe in detail his attempts to fund the documentary. Forgive me for reassuring insults as compliments, but I take Berkowitz for having the skills to persuade an idiot to fund this terrible piece ****. I appreciate the boundaries and intentions of the film, but even when it comes to the standards that Berkowitz sets for itself, it fired and loses at all levels. Finally, I am sure that many of these female companions were not in the morning with a wandering filmmaker, and therefore I question the authenticity of the film. Hey Myles, I loved your movie for the first time I saw it ... when it turned out to be an episode of Seinfeld, or it was a film by director Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
