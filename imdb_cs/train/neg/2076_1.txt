Well, I must say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! Jokes were extremely rough (they did not expect it from the PG movie) and they did not laugh! With this great engagement, I expected at least some good acting, but I did not even do it. I'm a huge fan of Rainn Wilson, and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed with his performance. Neither the characters of Luke Wilosn, nor Uma Thurman are the least agreeable and I really could take care of what happened to any of them. I did not expect it at all, like in the past. I really liked other movies of this director (Six days, seven nights for example) This film is NOT worth the $ 10 that cost me, and I strongly urge you not to see this movie. I guarantee you will like me to finish this movie.
