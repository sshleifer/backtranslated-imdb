I can not say it's the worst movie of all time, but just because there are still some movies I have not seen yet! This must be the most powerful attempt to shoot a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same problems he had with "There Will Be Blood" (even though he was not that bad in the film.) The whole movie feels that you are looking at what a man is trying hard to impress beyond his ability. It's like sitting in the chair of his little director and thinking, "how would a great filmmaker master this scene?" It just does not have it, I do not know if this movie could save a great filmmaker. surely some nuggets of size that could be polished but nothing matured. "The scene in which all the characters sing are the worst moments in the history of cinema." One by one when we see singing figures, and I was filming in my seat, I said, "Please do not just keep that guy on the verge of singing death, too!" Sure, MASSIVE FAILURE!
