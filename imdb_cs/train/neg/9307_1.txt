I rented this movie about a month ago when I did not have anything else Friday night. The only thing I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'TRASH' The act is so bad I've seen that kids in high school do a better job The whole cast seems to just read their rows, no feeling, no emotions, and no room for capturing the viewer. On the second note, the special effects were madly cheesy and the whole thing looked like it was shot by a camera whenever someone can buy a radio chat. The clan itself does not look like the one on the video cover. Damn even in the movie will not appear until the end and it all makes it out of humorous songs and walks around chasing several characters. There is no real murder, nor is it a real movie slasher. Because I saw it, I questioned a few things. 1. If it's "Serial Insane Clown Killer," it would not be a Serial Killer that kills clowns? 2. If your friend loses, why would you go out into the forest to have sex rather than look for? Sad really. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is this the only real acting that suddenly was crying at the end? Did the event finally decide to show effort at work? This movie is so sad they come. My advice is to avoid hiring so that you do not lose an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
