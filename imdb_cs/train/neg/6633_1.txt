Where to start? How best to describe how horrible this movie is? <br /> <br /> We start with the humor of the camp. That's not much fun. Add a lot of musicians who are acting as actors - Meat Loaf is terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity that Carney, who should know better than this movie. <br /> <br /> And then there's a conspiracy. Roadie, whose life goal is to work at the Alice Cooper show, will meet a girl whose life goal is to be Alice Cooper's band. At least they get what they want ... And then, when the movie ends, they can not come up with more likely last scene than - well, I will not destroy it for you if you really want to see the movie. Some actors who tell you it's going to be "B" or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. This is a sure sign that the film is probably not very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to low expectations - even overcomes them by being worse than the poor. <br /> <br /> Let's just say. This is the film against which all the bad films are compared. And no one is worse than Roadie.
