First thing first. In this genre film, the first thing you need is good music and where the shankar and his party fail. The music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, AJAY DEVGAN, who drew the mark "A" from his spelling, did a good job, but it was not useful for bad films like this one. ASIN is like a doll who is used to public entertainment even though she looks good, but her role in the movie is dancing, in fact dancing a member of a rock band and I do not think any rock band there is a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> In the nut shell this movie is a piece of crap piece *** t. See if you want to deceive.
