It seems to be a general underpinning of these comments, the movie has some amazing animation (I watched it on blu-ray), but it really does not get any real depths. <br /> <br /> First, all the characters are pretty boring. I got a hint of a situation between Laputa between Agito, Toola, and the main adversary Shunack. However, maybe my mind was going through and it was a godly wish (Laputa is my favorite anim√©, the original Engilsh oak). The characters are not really nice and, as mentioned in another post, they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leave the poor old Minka jealous and reject (she loves Agita, who does not seem to know it). However, it seems to immediately forgive the Tool at the end without explaining the change of heart otherwise than the end is a bit "happier." <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. Like who druids really are? Are they people? and who are strange women / girls who look with them and run in the woods? There is nothing to explain why they are there and how they can give normal human power. Plants coming from the moon still do not have empty spaces. It's almost like a strange version of the Trifid Day. And who's calling Toola? why bother with it if it was not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, but I found a conspiracy not as deep as a movie like the Spirit in Shell or have a real character like Miyazaki. I do not feel hated when I was watching it, but I think I did not buy it. My advice? Let it go if you have a few spare hours but borrow it or buy it cheaply! Perhaps if you have new animated movies and you have not much to go, you will enjoy it. It is certainly visually pleasant.
