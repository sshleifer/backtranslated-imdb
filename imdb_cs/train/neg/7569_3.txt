This definitely corresponds to the time when Axis & Allies play spy games across most of North Africa and the rest of the world. It is not the best of the films, but certainly not the worst of the budget films, as described earlier in the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was really good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Park (as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never played a bigger role, he's behind me. He played the perfect role of a friend / partner and saved the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, this movie was part of the Superbox-Mart budget package called War Classics. Eight dollars for eight dollars, which included other, never heard films that have some decent stars trying to pay bills. This script is ... well, not so hot. Cutting and cinematography is ... worse. If you can get around and you want to see the future Cisco Kid & a great helper who unfortunately has never met his real potential, you will definitely pick it up! Otherwise, they can watch other WW2 movies. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
