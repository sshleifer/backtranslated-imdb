Look, read and read these comments, and there's a lot I want to say, but I'll try to cut it down, but just ... First, forget all the bad ones ... How did nothing from Notorious show up and I agree that most people here say it's "Hollywood," what can I tell you, what did you expect from a real story? When people wake up and see that u will never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... Everything is covered and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm not against 2pac nor Biggie I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim DID are surely interested in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Next, for all those who they say the movie is amazing and cant see the truth, either u are too blind to see too much because u think you know something about BIG, or you do not know anything about it at all and to love Hollywood teens movies. Use your mind and look at the clouds ... There is plenty of what you could say when it comes to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say, because it's a very wide topic, but for the film I can only say it could be a bit, I think it's much better. But I'm always just a guy who gives her my opinion ... No hard feelings ... Look, I like hip hop and I live for it but after seeing this movie, everybody a little intelligence could see that it was so it is not how anyone would have expected to live. They all respect 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who live like this should turn the second page because it will destroy the youth ... It brings a bad message to the kids and it is: you will not go to school, but you live out of the streets, dense and just you are going for paper .... Real hip hop is supposed to be love and intelligence, to be smart and everyone. <br /> <br /> OK I know that many of you will think I'm crazy, but it's just my opinion. Look, I'm maybe something wrong and I'm not saying it's a really bad movie because even though I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years, i still do not know anything about 2pac or biggie no matter how many articles i read or how much I support them and listen to their music ... Like most of you all out there. Only people who were really close to them and the murderers know the truth about everything. And all I want to say to all those biggie and Tupac and family fans, these two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE LIKE TO BE BETTER, TEACH YOU AND LOVE AS ANOTHER , YOU WANT GOOD, BUT YOU CAN NOT HELP YOU, HOW TO HELP. HOW IS ANY QUANTITY OF MONEY OR EVERYTHING IS RECOGNIZED AND HOW TO WORK AT A DISTANCE TO THE MOUNTAIN, YOU ARE FULFILLING YOURSELF UPPER AND PROVIDING YOUR SOUL, THAT TEAM AND THINK ... WHAT ARE, YOU WILL LIVE ALWAYS AFTER DEATH !!!! RATE AND LOVE TO YOUR !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND OTHER THAT HAVE CHANGED IN THIS WORLD !!!!
