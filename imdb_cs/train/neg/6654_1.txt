I do not usually think that Hollywood productions are appropriate to be called movies, and therefore I call them films. But this piece of elephant fertilizer is not even suitable to be called a movie, and therefore quotes in the title. Where to start? 1. If it is not the beginning of geriatric casting, it is certainly an embodiment. Stefanie Powers should play someone even less than half of her age, she's supposed to play eighteen, and she's FORTY effing TWO !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. The dreadful and stupid thoughtless portraits of Paris and France, where we see cliche figures such as: a sympathetic clumsy business owner, a queen of models, a fairy tale mother, a queen of models, etc. This film is overcome only in this respect for the Da Vinci Code (which the reviewers correctly identified as a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It's very, very ridiculous, that in the movie about time and place, where nudity would be such a normal place, there was no nudity, especially if it was the whole focal point. <br /> <br /> 4. Terrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Lift music by Nana Mouskouri !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think that's enough. And I've been able to watch these observations when I watched these crap just half an hour, WE PREVENT surfing the Internet and talking to my friends about mathematical equations ... I think ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to join my list. :): P: D
