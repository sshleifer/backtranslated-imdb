1993 was a year. That was before Philip Seymour Thomas won the Oscar. Who knew I'd have another movie with him? I was actually paid extra in "My Friend's Back," which was shot in the suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original name was "Johnny Zombie" (thanks to God that the producers had a heart change!) I was on the stage scene. I jumped out and watched the film the day he was released in the theaters. It's more a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for good laughter, you might want to look. Nothing that is not even close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead," but the cheese factor is good enough. Hey
