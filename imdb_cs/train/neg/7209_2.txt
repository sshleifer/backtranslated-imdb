I was fascinated with cartoons at college when it was done. She had a lot of charm "Get Smart". While it obviously had its own mistakes, it was rather pleasant. Naturally, I was interested in seeing the movie version. That was before I saw it. Then I wished it never happened. Besides that all around (who on Earth, although Broderick was even close to the role?) It just did not make a mark. <br /> <br /> <br /> The effects were reasonable and perhaps just what I liked in the movie; See live action gadgets in action! It lacked a story and a treatment that made it funny or charming or interesting. The original was a cute cartoon with a very kind attitude. It was fun. The film became dark and took FAR too seriously. If he had a serious plot or went crazy enough to make it look like a "cartoon on the film," it could have been nice. Since it exists, it does not deserve to be considered part of the "Legacy Gadget".
