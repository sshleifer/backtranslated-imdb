Medellin is a wonderful place to live, work and study. I've been there twice, and I've never heard of guerrilla activities, paramilitaries who have been hostage tourists, or something like that. There are "invisible police", but it's not the Big Brother system. There are just enough police, so they are visible in everyday life, but no one has it without good reasons. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting document in that the youth he describes in the film will basically become his characters. The film directors carefully plot the plot between the daily actions of La Sierra and when the figure dies, it is a true path. It is hard to imagine, however, that the three young men are all members of Bloque Metro, a gang that terrorized La Sierra before the Colombian government began restructuring the country. La Sierra is not an accurate display of life in Colombia; there are, of course, things to be cautious, such as petty criminality, but when we think that "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo are pickpockets, Colombia does not seem at all. The Colombians are eager to await their chance to show the world that once the torn country war thrives more than ever.
