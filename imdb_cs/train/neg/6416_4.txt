Some Commonly Unused Spoils Why do people, when they are disoriented, sick or scared in the club, cut in the middle of a crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who would be hiding in the right mind under the bed when someone walks into their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a foreign door and when they do not respond immediately, open the door, come in, cut a few hells, and then start going through their stuff? <br /> <br /> If you were persecuted by someone you just discovered, he was a murderer, what would you do? Does the silence intertwine and hide under the wooden platform or between metal instruments? Sure, of course, running on an old barn or some other weak structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost every thriller that came out in the last few years, but because it's the "Return" page, of course I'm talking about "returning". I saw it for free as I work on cinemas and try to project all the "spooky" movies. I thought this was acceptable ... except for well-worn clichÃ©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really stupid and looks a bit "Huh?" over most of the movie. The details of the plot are slowly divulged as the film progresses and it's almost enough to make it interesting except that there was not enough explanation for how it was moving so I was almost lost until the last 2/3. > <br /> If you are a fan of a spooky thriller, it's worth seeing at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater, and you really want to watch a movie, I think it's worth entering the matinee. If you thought the trailer looks like an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
