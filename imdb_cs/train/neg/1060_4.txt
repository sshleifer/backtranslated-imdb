Okay, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give him a little credit for fearing terrorists and the thoughts that the CIA Director is plotting to blow this plane off the sky before the world is prestigious. And it is done. That's a good thing. Act ... just. Story ... stupid. "Twist" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like nobody thought about what to do when the plane gets into the contamination. Do not you think bureaucrats have a "plagiarism" guide and how do they include them? Proper implementation of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. He does not have to send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus occurs in the air, why was the door open and the "shooters" standing there without protection? In fact, has anyone ever happened to shoot his legs? That would stop her. I always watch the movie to see the end as soon as I started it, but it was a waste of time and for the most part foreseeable. I saw it with a recorder, so I did not have to watch all the commercials, it was a plus. It's a good example of why I'm looking at such a small network television.
