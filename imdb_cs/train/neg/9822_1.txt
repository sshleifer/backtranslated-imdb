There were times when I wanted to be beaten to death. The only reason I kept the whole movie was because I could not believe how bad it was and thought it had to improve. It was a horror movie. I was terrified that I was exhausted by what seemed like 4 hours of my life that I would never come back. The other two hours I spent with the loss of the loss. Recommend this movie to anyone you want to torture and tell them the tensions will kill them.
