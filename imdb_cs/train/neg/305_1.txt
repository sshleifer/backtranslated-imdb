I'm glad to see this movie after Mr. Sandler became famous. It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a painfully boring home movie. I really enjoy his other movies ...... but if you are a fan like me ... keep away from this. This can change your thoughts on Adam. You may never recover from the horror of that movie ... I had better time to watch how old people play scrabble in the house .......
