The king is dead and the king lives! Triad Caddy Shack Two, Family Under Stairs, and Beverly Hills Soldiers have been associated with the worst film so long as they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king ..... yeah ..... all cry to the new king .... "Down on Earth". But some things, such as Tiny Tim, are so bad they are good. Sometimes it could eliminate the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a ball. So you can see ... well ... well, just remember your word. Go for it. Everyone yells to the new king!
