The Rule of Georgia must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very unreal feeling that caught me, "what?" out loud at least 7 to 10 times during your exhaustive two-hour course. Advertising in her story as a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as a matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter and Lindsay Lohan as a rebellious, exaggerated, rather clad daughter, the viewer thinks it will be a clich√©, a light, a cat that will develop and will meet as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about fake ads for the worst. After many shots of animals he makes "fun" things in the background of "key" scenes, not to mention the whole five minutes, focusing on the old woman who comes to the doctor's office to change her diaper or the fact that this film is actually a figure of Lindsay Lohan , who sexually exploits her stepfather, the Georgian rule creates her own genre of cinema: An unjustified, horrible, inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious problems, the most difficult, unreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, he should watch The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. Thus. The only way I feel that I can get a reader to understand the horrible genre covered by the Georgian rule is to create a hypothetical situation. Let's say the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was the main character of celibacy because it was sexually harassed as a child. But instead of making the film more dramatic, they will be afraid of laughter and comedy with all the reactions of characters from the fake, lifeless, human beings that pretend to be caring. <br /> <br /> Throw in the yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the lightest, most extensive figure that could be completely cut off from this badly written scenario, along with a male character who throws away all his religious beliefs and morals to be harsh , too tired a girl who does not have the same interest as he does, as well as a futile scenario with car chases, unreal moments of characters trying to connect each other, and you have the Georgia Rule. I thought the film was an insult to all those people who are struggling with movie makers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc. Who have a lot more talents and do not get noticed. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you need to get enough drunk in front of your hand.
