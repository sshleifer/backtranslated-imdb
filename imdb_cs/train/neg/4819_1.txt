This is a typical low budget of the 1970s. It should be a documenter of the Bigfoot fishing crew across the Pacific Northwest. Each character is stereotypical, from native American to cynical cowboy. Play and narration are a complete joke. If you are hoping to see a lot of great tracks - you still hope. It will not be much and what you can do in a backyard with a cheap costume and video camera; it would look better than this movie. It's not like I do not like low tariffs for 1970; I'm doing. It's such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, a miserable story and no excitement you just can not enjoy. It does not fall into the category "so bad it's good", nor can you laugh at how bad it is without using illegal substances. It's mostly a lot of boring footage of people camping, hiking, riding horses and watching wildlife. There's a big attack that's stupid; supposedly our friend Sasquatch throws stones down on the campers from above as they fire the rifles back to him. At this point, with a strong rooting on the bigfoot, some stones fall on the filmmaker's head and stop the whole thing.
