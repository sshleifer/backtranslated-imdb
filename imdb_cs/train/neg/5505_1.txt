Shazbot, it's embarrassing. In fact, there is a list of 100 that makes you embarrassed: 1.) unsuccessful return for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels basically played the same role he played in a live remake of 101 Dalmatians who was not too juicy. It certainly has a fun way to promote the Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointment that Wallace Shawn is for Disney what Jet Li had to Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original Martian of the TV series, played a bit of a piece (he read "cameo") in this film and died two years later lupus. Chance? 6.) terrible special effects. Seriously - terrible. 7.-100.) That the damn talking, farting suit has been annoying to Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Come on! ... Good. You are - you are a joker. Okay, we'll send this review with a moment of silence about this stormy death, and if you'd like, you can say a quick prayer that Disney will not forget this travesty and do something stupid as a film adaptation of "Morka and Mindy" headed by Tim Allen .... ......................................... ......... ...
