I do not really have anything new, I just felt like having to comment on this bag. So here it goes: <br /> <br /> Horror. Running my DVD collection MST3K again and watching Hobgoblins 10 times. It really is really, really painful, but it was another one on the list ... You can see it's the tiny core of a real movie buried beneath all the bulls that are "Hobgoblins," but it just could not get out. All about this movie is 4th. Story, acting, effects, women, "action scenes", ... ahhhh forget it. I can watch bullshit like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (aka "Zaat") again and again with almost no bad effects (in fact I like it - btw, this will be on TCM later this month - October 2009) but "Hobgoblins "is the whole knife balls. The worst part of it may be that it's about 12 hours after the movie, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medication, and yet ersatz the "New Wave" dance music that Amy, red shorts and Laraine Newman were shaking in the living room, still running through my head. This torture takes several days. <br /> <br /> Good luck or not?
