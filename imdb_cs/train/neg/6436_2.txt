I am a kind person, so I made this film 2 in 1. It was undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. There were very few conspiracies and deeper areas of interest that were affected, that is, what Jesus really wanted us to know was hidden and instead we received heavy visual doses of a sadistic punishment caused by our heroine (Arquette). Total crucifixion during the first 15 minutes would be more humane for both her character and the audience. The hearing was barely there, and the direction was uninitiated. And when I saw one more drop of water or a dove flying to the camera, maybe I started shouting louder than Patricia.
