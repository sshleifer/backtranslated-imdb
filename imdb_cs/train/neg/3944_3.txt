The movie My Name is Modesty is based on an episode that occupies about one page in the 10th modesty of Blaise's novel Morningstar Night. Describes an incident in which young Skromnost (17 in the book, in the mid-1920s in the film) advocates her lead in the war over the casino. As it is before the real Blaise adventure her trusted sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems, since the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has always been one of the fascinating aspects of novels and long-lasting comics. The second problem is that the movie is just incredibly boring, because in fact there is only one small episode blown into the script. Casting is fine, but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as a heroine and really too old to play a modest young man. I have the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution in order not to lose the Blaise franchising rights.
