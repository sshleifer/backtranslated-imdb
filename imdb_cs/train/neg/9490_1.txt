This is complete and absolute garbage, which is a great example of what the BAD movie is, it can not be anybody, not fans of b-film. DO NOT use, I repeat, DO NOT ALLOW the precious time of your life to this waste. Bad behavior, bad direction, terrible (but I mean a really terrible) script, and a complete lack of imagination about what kind of entertainment (whatever form) it is. I bought a DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning would not be enough for what this film did to me. I like b-movies, killer toys, strange lagoon monsters, but that's not anywhere near. Do you know those movies that are so bad they are fun? Neither. Just old pathetic.
