I know that some films (I think: European films), which are very bad films, are considered by some "critics" to be a great cinema just because they are non-American. I've seen 8.1 IMDB scores for this movie and noticed it was selected for some great festivals. Do not make it crazy! If you are not one of those people who like similar movies that resemble the mind and then call it great art, skip it! The film contains one funny scene after another (a similar, Italian film I got into my mind, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not just boring, like some other strangely praised movies, but they almost play as a camp. I mean, say that acting is terrible (I mean at the soap opera level), the story has no surprise (it happened in the endless times, combining several stories: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, HRADING HEART, only much better), not realistic character (some real furious on the way, notice the merry zombie-like daughter), and so on and so forth. It's as if it's not enough, the film is 135 min. (count it!) long and eventually the director opens his sentimentality. After the movie with such a frankly wrong dialogue and scenes that made the audience in the preview of the laugh laugh so much incompetence, well ... This is an insult to the cinema and only accepts high ratings because it happens to be in a "different" language, in this case Spanish. The strange world in which we live ... 3/10
