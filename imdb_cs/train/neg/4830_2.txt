REALLY? REALLY???? I know that if you make a political war movie you will notice, but this movie was just garbage. Worse in every sense. It's terribly inaccurate in many ways. I have the easier time to believe that the President of the United States will settle, fly fighter and shoot foreigners. It's easier to notice a few things that were right. My jaw dropped off when I saw someone saying that this film was the best 25 years ago. It was an exaggerated, seemingly useless plot, and sometimes he had a controversial cinematography. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT tools? did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like having to carry out extensive research, it was only five years before this movie came out. I am a veteran of the Iraq war, and if you have spent one day with an infantry or EOD group, you will realize how B.S. this movie is. Compared to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why not use Commando and Red Dawn? I think it could be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see the past of an incredible conspiracy, historical and factual inconsistencies, then this movie might be fine. Nothing more. If you still hear "Oscar Buzz" and you have to add your own pompous review, go straight ahead. As for me, I'm writing to the director to find out if I can get 131 minutes back.
