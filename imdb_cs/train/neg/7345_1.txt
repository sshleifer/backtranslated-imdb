I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people are sitting and watching this garbage? OK, my dad and mom love it, but I'll make sure I'm out of the room before it's over. It's so depressing and sad, but the worst thing is that it's all detective programs because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programs with real secrets ??? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictional figures about whom we know nothing about having died more than 20 years ago ??? I wish the BBC gave more comedy to BBC, because now with the vicar of the dibbles, there is more room for this bullshit.
