I do not know why I'm commenting on this stupid fact - I've shown that I watched a few episodes (a cable marathon broadcast when I was sending 5 episodes in a row or something, but I did not watch the whole thing like three episodes) because I was nine months pregnant and is getting ready work every day. Maybe I'm bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, I really do it. money and fame, it seems to have a very little sense of dignity. Or he is scarcely inclined to the extreme. He married the Federline nitinity (well, someone can make a mistake) and before that she "played" this terrible show about her everyday life where she puts the video camera wherever she feels, whether it's in someone's face or in the shower, as Federline stands . She bothers about her sex life without leaving something for your imagination, I do not care about my role, but I can not think of how she feels now when she is divorced. And yes, I'm embarrassed for her. But I should not be. It seems that he lives a rather empty, shallow life though. I do not want to change her life, even if it is possible. If you want, kill the TV.
