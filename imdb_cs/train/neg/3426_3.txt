As a fan of the manga and anime Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, LAW JACK, etc.) I'm looking forward to this. I have not seen either manga or anime, so I have no prejudices. What we have here is a series of stupid softcore films of the type that is used to alarming regularity at night on cable channels. While it's twisted when compared to the ropes of ordinary cable watchers (the heinous bits of our hero are either stuck nicely behind a strategically bonded scarf or naked with a ridiculous sunny effect), there are long scenes of slavery and torture that give the management enough charm to it was unsuitable for children. While I have nothing against naked female heroes, I do not like amateur movies (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, in each of the four episodes I've seen, at least one amazingly beautiful actress. No wonder Nagai TESTICLE BOY has never done ...
