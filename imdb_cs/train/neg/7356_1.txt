I got into this movie just as it started in the afternoon where I was at home with a touch of flu - otherwise I would not want it. That would be best. I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good artists - and I thought it might be worth a look. It turned out to be somewhat, but just because it's one of those stories so horrible that it fascinates. Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents, except for her Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson's breasts. Unfortunately, her acting performance - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson a Garbo or Davis comparing. White suitcase rat, owner's cat, young suitcase with the owner evicted and restrained in his home, and lots of doofs (including young nut cases) that pass around facilities with a risk of biological hazards and an absurd conclusion. I have always waited for at least some scenic or terrestrial element to contain at least minimal realism, credibility or the ability to induce some empathy / sympathy - but it turned out to be futile.
