Probably the only thing that got the film up to four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's great portraits of merciless incompetence. . . yet it is one of the only roots that prevents it from being a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, he provides a remarkable mix of gangster charm and direct man to manic foolishness Chris Kattan. Also featured by Richard Roundtree as a boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented FBI agent who jumps his head from the glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falck's adviser and Benedict Arnold. has some amazing possibilities and in the hands of young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase it could prove to be a great comedy car. The Katt√°n, which seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, only provides a confused mess. It is sad that Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray their brothers, are both under-proven. <br /> <br /> There are some very fun scenes, but they are too few and separated too much boring. What I really miss is what always attracted me to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no "second level" that could happen over this tile. No cultural reference that only adults receive. . no double entender. . it's just stupid. And by the way, that does not mean I recommend it for my 9-year-olds because they probably have better tastes and less fascination with some of them. their body parts and their functions.
