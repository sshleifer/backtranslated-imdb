he had to see it because it looked like a big scary idea - the prisoners who found a magic book, oo err! claustrophobic terror, etc. <br /> <br /> But it does not seem like a story that would go with a great idea. rather than cooling / physical horror, it relied on the effects of an open fire and horror OTT on the body - which did not scare you when you are 12 years old. Logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters killed only for bodycount. wasting good characters - which was the best of this movie. Apparently a low budget that does not spoil it, the film really does not go anywhere and I believe I'll say it - it needs a Hollywood remake. you simply lose interest in this version. certainly not in the same league as other French films that have been published in the last few years as crimson rivers that were at least observable / entertaining, malefique is not honest until the end. and I bet you can guess the end before watching the movie. really really disappointing - impossible to recommend.
