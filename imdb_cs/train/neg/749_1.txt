Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel, which comes with budgets of about $ 2 million. Some contain wide-ranging effects, others contain recognizable cast, and others - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Hines originally claimed that this movie was a budget of $ 20 million dollars, but it is painfully obvious that it was probably produced for $ 750,000 if it is not much less than that. Few files are used, a number of scenes are shot against the green screen, and most effects appear to be incomplete and amateur. Painful to watch. Not so much because it is badly managed, misplaced and misleading, but because many of us have been watching the development of this production for some time and have hoped for this film despite a relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed this movie when it was originally announced joined the legions of those mentioned by Barnum.
