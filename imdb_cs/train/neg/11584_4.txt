About twenty minutes into this movie I was bored already. Simply, these characters were rather boring. Occasionally something pleasant happens, but then things slow again. Fortunately, my patience was eventually rewarded and the end of the movie was not bad at all. However, it was by no means good enough to justify sitting in the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the film was overall average and, considering all the talents in the cast, I considered it a disappointment.
