Was this movie stupid? Yeah. Was this depth of film? No way. Character Development? No way. Drawing Drawings? No way. It was just a film about a highly fictionalized Springer show. It shows the lengths that some people come to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job like Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is ... well ... FUN! This shooting was not enough to be a "breakthrough" movie, rather it was intended to live in an outbuilding park (I live in a park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everybody sleeps with each other, all the girls get pregnant with different boys and everyone guys drive rusted '66 Ford sensors (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention the "trailer park"). Some people over-analyze films (case-in-point: Star Trek Shaqi). I watch movies purely for fun; that the girl is wearing another shirt in another scene (read "Goofs" about a horse shirt.) Could it be better?
