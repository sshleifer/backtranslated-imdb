This film has the potential, but what is really bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I've never seen her before in any other case, and maybe there are some Croes fans who like something similar, but her performance in this movie is bad. Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines, she seemed to be trying to make sure she had the lines in order and she was just reading the list in her head. So her voice has a very small inclination. I can not believe that someone bad about acting has taken a leading role in the film. He must know someone in the biz. Now it's not like I'm going to have that much sign, but the comment must be "this" long and its performance is what's flying more than anything else. br /> <br /> But I liked where the story is, so I kept looking. The first part of the script has the shapes of a good movie. But the end was also a disappointment. Maybe if her acting was better, I'd like to.
