Usually I'm not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so unbearably painful. I stumbled over a horribly predictable conspiracy, the lame played and laughed in moments to be tense. Indeed, most viewers looked quite bored and conversational even at the "most tense" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald has performed as the only performance of any merit in torture. Even the "twist" at the end was not. I heard the film said he did not take the film seriously; but I did little in the film. <br /> <br /> The cut should be left on the floor. Make yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
