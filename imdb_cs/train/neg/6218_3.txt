My thoughts on film 9 were not good, it was not good at all. Visually it was great. I was satisfied with pace, cameras, etc. However, characters? eh, a little gentle. Conspiracy? It was bloody. The film looked like a new tweezer than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and terrible. Science is not rendered better. Creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "soul" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? <br /> <br /> This is something that bites my ass bit. Here we have a CGI movie ... created with science ... and using it to tell us that science destroys the world while supporting the idea of ​​saving us spirituality? At least they had the decency to stand up one of the characters. "Okay, what about now?" (or something similar). I could not hear it too well, because the crowd immediately got up and made a break for the trip. It was "okay ... it was just fun to sit here, but get out of here as fast as possible!" type of output. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can not think if you want to enjoy it. Look at the visuals and gently nod your head. Any idea, "what does it mean?" will suck you out of distrust and your eye a warning sign with desire. <br /> <br /> OK ... SPOILERS follow. So essentially a scientist creates a "machine" that is capable of creating another, intelligent, robotic life. Evil people use it as a weapon. The scientist, however, realizes that it is also the fault. He gave his machine his intellect, but he did not give his heart. <br /> <br /> Skynet moves to the collective ass of humanity and destroys all of its life on earth and finally turns off slowly. However, the scientist can survive and create pedestrian puppet puppets. Everyone that contains a piece of scientific soul. The last one, No. 9, wakes up when the world knows nothing. He sees the strange device nearby and picks it up. Meet the other as yourself, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 is captured by the last surviving robot of the machine. # 9 finds more like himself and goes to rescue # 2. <br /> <br /> Successfully. <br /> <br /> # 9 records that there is a matching hole that perfectly matches the device. He inserts them and the machine returns to life ... pulls soul # 2 into the process. The film then continues in action scenes with No. 9, which are trying to save their souls pulled by compatriots. <br /> <br /> Eventually they will succeed and destroy the computer. They let the souls of their fallen friends go up into the clouds. Then it rains and we see the life that comes back to the planet. Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. Not at all. Why the heck of the scientist wanted to divide their soul into 9 homunculi? What did he do? Have they been created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother? Why did he expect nine small animals to succeed if nothing else was done? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight against the first one ... at least it would seem to have a reasonable chance of success. Why did they have their souls soaked in the device by the device and then destroy the machine and then release the soul to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to turn off and return life without all the other crazy steps?
