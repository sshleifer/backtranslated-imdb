In fact, I wanted to see this movie in the theater. He was actually sold out. In fact, I went to visit Solaris instead, which was in fact the worst film to be released in 2002. Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a hard streetwise 'Street Pharmacist', scared to see a boy being shot, so he decides go clean and invest all your money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). It looks pretty good until Jack leaves town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It happened very late in the movie, so if they did not find out in the preview, it could be an interesting procedure. But they did it, so it is not. In fact, there is no interesting thing about this movie; everything is given in the preview. If you've seen even one preview, you've seen the whole movie so you might want to think it hard to fill the gaps. Go to web pages, download preview, save 3.99 dollars. There is no surprise or distortion in the whole movie, except how terrible the soundtrack is. I hope the one who was in charge of writing a soundtrack was released. Twice. Most of this is what music would be if the only songs that could be released were the duets of Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (I can break the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept that is so worrisome), both he had less talents and musical abilities. Actor's art is best bad, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% polystyrene and 33% ziploc sack. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) Increases the rest of his cast with his acting skills.
