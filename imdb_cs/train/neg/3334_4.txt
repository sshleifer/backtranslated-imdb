It scared me when I was a teenager. Now it seems more fun to me than frightening, but with some pretty disturbing moments and some poor quality that I like. And think about it, the conspiracy is rather disgusting ... but with some taste. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are huge gaps where there is nothing interesting or interesting. The end goes on forever, which means that after a few moments it seems that the seemingly tense climax seems stupid and Barbara Bach screams and screams. "Monster", after being exposed, is unfortunately not too scary. The slightly rough look of the film also works against it, so it looks like a television movie more than something for theaters. But this is an example of films that are rarely done today, so I urge horror fans to look at them and feel a little nostalgic ...
