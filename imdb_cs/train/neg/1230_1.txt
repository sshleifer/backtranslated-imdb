Words can not describe how utterly stupid this story (and so the bad movie) is! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think? So there is a shopping center and its parking space is totally full. Basinger's character is buying a cup of tea and some wrapping paper. When it comes out, the whole site is so empty that no one can hear the two shots fired near? Although he lives there when he leaves from baddies, he goes to the furthest and richest place than the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? RECEIVE !!! I do not even want to go to the unheard of red box because other people did it earlier. Do not let him know how he kills crazy killers one by one. <br /> <br /> This is so stupid, without the slightest logical reason, I can only warn you that you are looking at it, it's a total waste of time, honestly !!
