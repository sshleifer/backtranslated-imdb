Martin Weisz, who directed the solid "Rohtenburg," will have Wes Craven another hot "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, boasting an incredible story and a flashback dog, will forever be erased by this technically polished remake (just in name). A lot of national guards (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills full of mutants. One after another weekend soldiers are eliminated. And it is done. There is some hardcore violence and reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is precious little to get excited. Movie heroes are a common clich√© and mutant group, remote from Craven's original family, mostly reminiscent of Brian Thompson of "Cobra" associated with some creatures that Stan Winston left behind in filming "Wrong Turn". Much of the action takes place in the caves, ala "The Descent," and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. The ridiculous aspect of Wes and Jonathan Craven is the addition of a sympathetic mutant who is crouching around his cave like Leatherface in Hooper's original "Chain Saw". Weisz will be blamed for this tedious debacle, but it's not really a mistake, because he does everything in his power to keep up the tension and push some freshness out of imagined situations. Not unfortunately a fan.
