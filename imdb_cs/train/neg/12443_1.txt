- Let me start by understanding that the Starfish Invasion was supposed to be the parody of science fiction films of the 1950s. I understand it should not be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of them works. The parody should be fun and this is simply not. Not once during the run I did not. Generally, I enjoy myself, but I have not found the entertainment lock anywhere in the Star Invasion. I knew I had problems from the beginning. The two "stars" appear on the screen with one of the cutest gags - a water hose that they can not control, so they're both wet. These two perform as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why would anyone want to mention the act and the Bowery Boys personality is behind me. After less than a glorious beginning, the movies continue with comic sequences, dancing Indians, green men, decoder rings, and many other non-functional bits. It's all just a complete waste of time. I bought it on a double DVD with the invasion of the girl's bees. This film is an Oscar win in comparison to Stargaz Invasion.
