According to some comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - maybe a dramatic or stupid or simple or comic film, but essentially an action movie. Whatever it was that I was watching, it certainly was not like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (though the prologue is trying to make it look complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the insurgents 3) the group of murderers. <br /> <br /> Now subtract the first (never appear in the movie). Then just let one of the murderers, princess, become dishonest for vengeance. Add interest in guilty conscience in the love of rebels. And you got the ingredients. But they still did not turn it into a story or a movie. There is a feeling of emptiness between some random action sequences and some special visual experiences that are trying to be low-budget sci-fi. The film just does not feel like a movie, but it's a weird, incoherent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
