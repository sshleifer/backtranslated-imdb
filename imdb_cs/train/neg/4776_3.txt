I had to write a review of this movie after reading another comment that says it's the best movie Sidney Poitier. Poitier has just returned from more than a decade of break in film acting and is clearly shaken. 11 of his films are listed on Wikipedia and do not include it. 5 of his films is on the list of AFI's top 100 inspiring films, again not included. Berenger and Poitier, ruby ​​and urban whipping went on hunting a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border with Canada. Some attempts at comedy in this film are clearly failing, and the bond between Berenger and Poitier has been incontrovertible and clumsy (not helped by a totally insignificant scenario). Kirstie Alley (as a hostage) was unnecessarily used and almost completely ignored when she was on the screen. Some attempts at tension are being done, for example, if you intend to guess which of the five men on a fishing trip is a murderer (all of them are typical villains). I understand that this is the whole challenge for most fans. I thought who he was, and I really did not care. If you are a fan of Berenger, look at the Sniper (1993), you can even see Billy Zane push his stuff. It's much better. Overall, I'd kill Shoot 3/10. It's not bold, and it's too easy for me.
