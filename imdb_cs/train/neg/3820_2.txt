Voice tracking "Speak Easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comedian, director and stuntman exposed to this humiliating portion is to see Picasso use as a pocket or perhaps more to see the finest Camembert abused by whey fats and processed into Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is badly occupied as a professor of post, whose exaggerated vocabulary is the only thing that prevents him from saying, "Tell me about rabbits, George." (The post would say something like: "Kindly let me know about the status of small mammals in the Lagorod family of Leporidae, kindly sir I think is primarily intended by the epithet" George. ") When Keaton created his own characters, but they were not stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their world. Not so with Poste, who never stops in flight and motorized, and who does not have more control over his destiny than the Titanic diving rat. While Keaton's original characters had enchanting naivety and innocence, the post encountered such a deep sexual slowdown that if he had ever become physically excited, he put an ice swab bag and sought medical help. <br /> <br /> There are a few small, redeemed moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of the Theme Todd's vampire, or his suggestion as a suitable dress for Greek dance, but it just does not cost for the whole movie you see. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch 'Talk Easy' with friends and Mystery Science Theater 3000. But besides, keep quiet. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembers.
