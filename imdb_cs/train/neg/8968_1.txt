Writing on the screen is so stupid that it hurt me to lose 2 hours of my life, I never return (where I heard it earlier). The act is so-so. Things change enough to observe you and wait for something terrible of what has happened. However, there is not one original thing in this movie. While the first cube was a horror movie that did not make much sense, the bones of zero got up and try to tell the exact same story, except that this time it makes an unpleasant point to try to explain information about every detail that did not answer the first film. The comic thing is that the director is recycling the exact scenes of the first film, which were somewhat strange and trying to explain them. But the scenes are simply copied, there is no coherence at all. This script is insignificant. I can imagine that it's written by a half-year-old 15-year-old with a baseball cap and a beer package for a class project. The best part is eventually, they cripple a "good" guy and he becomes a retarded member of the first movie and you see him when they find him ("this room is green ..") in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap applause what turns . First, what if you did not see the first, it makes no sense that you are the director of the nitwit. Another great idea: Instead of numbers that specify the x, y, z area (1997 cube), this time it is 3 letters, each of which gives one of 26 possible coordinate values. Spirit. Until now, permutations do not make much sense ... let the letters disappear before anyone can use them. I want to return the money. I think I had to write it because there are just so many bad, inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / writers should be obliged to have some talent.
