The descent schedule, if it can actually be called a conspiracy, has two remarkable events. One at the beginning - one at the end. Together these events account for about 5% of the total time of the film. Everything (and I mean everything) is basically a director's desperate attempt to fill in the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I'm not bored with bitch scenes - but if you expect to sit in 60 minutes of deep / dark (literally) scenes without a story, you have another thing. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, is totally futile here. And no, she will not get naked, even in the NC-17 version I've seen. If you have a few hours to throw away and want to see the "descent", sleep the place - you will probably have more interesting dreams.
