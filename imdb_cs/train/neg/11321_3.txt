You can not really go far when the first story is not so great. The premise of cyborg blood needs blood. "The screenplay is bloody." Actors do not have much to do with it. Sets were arranged in the desert to reduce costs. It's a trademark that if the background is a desert, the film has no budget. Lack of budget is fine if there's a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from $ $. but this movie looks as if he had to scramble his change together just to get a sandwich to the cameraman. Again, forgive if the story just did not find it. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film committed the biggest crime of all: It does not end! It just ends up as if it were a commercial break from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Just strange. <br /> <br /> It's bad.
