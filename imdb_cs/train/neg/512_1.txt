It seems to me that some of the films that were banned during the history of the cinema were in fact very important and very good films. I would like to say that instead of banning demanding, controversial films, censors should consider banning movies that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your reason. If they did, one of the first films to be hidden would be undoubtedly "Stroker Ace". This movie is awful with the "A" capital. It's the worst movie that Burt Reynolds has ever played in ... a pretty good performance for men with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" on his biography! <br /> <br /> A thin story introduces us to successful automaker Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He stuck in a humiliating treaty with the creepy promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The treaty requires it to do degrading promotional work for a new string of fast food restaurants, like dressing up like a giant chicken. Jim Nabors, a thief of Ace, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), with a brain that is somewhat smaller than the Countess who is impressed by Esola, will get into the mix. <br /> <br /> Hal Needham, director of this low-grade waste, was formerly a stuntman and made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging stunning stuntmen and car chases / races. Some of these movies were fine, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited," but with "Stroker Ace" they have reached a career of nadir. The characters are so silly that you really feel sorry for the actors who play them. Anderson is especially settled with such a deep role that he tears you grind despair. Humor is weak and infantile in its entirety, and stunning and racial sequences are immense. Even borrowing during the final credits (which can be found in all Reynolds-Needham companies) is generally unfortunate, which gives the impression that perhaps the movie was not very funny. "Stroker Ace" is a massive killing.
