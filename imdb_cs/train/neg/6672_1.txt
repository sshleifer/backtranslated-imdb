I am 47 years old and I have spent so much of my life, as I remember, a fan of horror and science fiction films. Whether they are quiet, black and white, no budget or big budgets, there are only a few of them that I can not find anything they might like. That means I give this film credit for good gore and creature effects, but that's all. This is a case of story effects. The truth is that we live in a time when there is very little left, which was not seen in horror film. That's why the film of some kind really enjoys, it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad behavior, but a bad story with a good actor and good effects is still a bad movie. This film does not even have a good deal, just good effects. So if you can not just gore, do this.
