Although Misty Ayers (a burlesque stripper) is definitely attractive as a blonde, it's just an excuse to let her go through her underwear several times (1954 was not filming nudity, not in 1965). > <br /> The boy who hires her to work in a canteen, reminds Bud Abbott of Abbott & Costello. Most of the other women are uninteresting and the drunk woman is hauntingly semi-fun. <br /> <br /> And 2 of 10. Mrs Ayers has a damn figure, but you can not judge the acting talent because the whole movie is post-dubbed. Some of these "exploitative films" that are usually made later than this are somehow interesting, but it is really a fest fest. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) directed by. There are some samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments, but there is really NEVER here.
