What did producer / director Stanley Kramer record in Adam Kennedy's novel and a very nice screenplay by Kennedy? Are there any pieces omitted? What about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very confused story? And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a terrible performance, take such an ungrateful role? The Domino principle wants to be on the same basis as Parallax View or Manchurian Candidate and lacks the brand with a very wide margin. Stanley Kramera's major outburst.
