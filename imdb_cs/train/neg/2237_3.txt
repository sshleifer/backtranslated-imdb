I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else (and that's probably still going on.) Even DVD packaging looks cheap, just like the whole movie. Weapons and fist fighting with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple plot, made me laugh when my stomach ached! With very little financial means, I must admit that it looked quite professional. Seen as a movie, it was one of those thirteen in ten hopeless gangsta nobody expected. So if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, check out this movie. If it is not, throw it out of the window.
