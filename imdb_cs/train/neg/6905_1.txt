Polynesian militia men drink, fight, and make a stream of sexist, silly and dysfunctional comments. Real life Polynesians are much more entertaining than these stereotyped cardboard characters. The anticipated Samoan girl did not look or act alone at Samoan, she seemed more like a white woman who has sex with anyone. With stories about the story of water you can not say anything about acting - even the most brilliant actors could not do anything about this script. It is sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a movie that does not have one good scene and only two or three "jokes". What is the waste of kiwi taxpayer money that has lost the opportunity to make a great movie about a lively community. It's better not to shoot movies if they're as bad and helpless as this.
