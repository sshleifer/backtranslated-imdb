I was an avid spectator until I personally spent long cold hours and helped build a home for a white family, just to be unhappy when I saw the house a year later. All the beautiful rock landscapes were removed, the beautiful rock path and front fountain were removed, all the pine trees and pecan trees in front were cut out, the sprayer was torn. Now it looks like a disaster. They do not live at all ... they live "in the city" and only leave for the weekend. He does not want to think about all the hours he gave the people of Oklahoma to these people and saw the result. The story we all saw on TV was not entirely true ... we do not believe everyone you see and hear.
