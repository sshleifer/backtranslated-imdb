After reading a lot of reviews, I do not know what movie some people are watching, but apparently it was not what I saw. This movie is terrible. Actor acting, especially Moore, is terrible. A woman can not act. Nice breast, but she can not act. She did not recognize her as a real character at all. Instead it was spoiled. Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play with boys. <br /> <br /> And that's finally the movie - Hollywood make-believe. The training sequences are over the top. Politics - across the summit. Political accuracy - over the top. Combat scenes - you guessed it over the top. Your task is to get in and stand out without being revealed. So, what are you doing? Why shoot as many bikes and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my wing anytime. The premise is good, but once Hollywood grabs it, we'll end up with the Top Gun with your breasts. <br /> <br /> What else can you expect from commercial American films? I think power.
