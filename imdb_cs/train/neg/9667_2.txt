This film is fairly known as one of the worst examples of propaganda ever produced. The urgent equation of the Jews with the disease is simply pathological and even worse becomes almost true for a few seconds due to its repetition. The fact that this raw material works, even briefly, is itself a lesson. You have to have a strong stomach and a tight grip on yourself to get it, and I would not recommend trying it unless you have a good reason.
