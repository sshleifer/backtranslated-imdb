When I decided to watch the BARBARIANS playing the twins of bodybuilders Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be that bad because the movie was directed by Rugger Deodat, who has a reputation for making dirty movies but well-filmed dirty movies. Well, THE BARBARIANS is a remarkably creepy action / adventure film that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and fails at all levels. The view of the film is bad. Some scenes were well shot, but the tone and shiny, tiny "disco" look of dresses and hair are adorned simply makes no sense, even for low budgets like this one. </ Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairstyle and costume. It's supposed to be terrible, but it's like a bow. And it's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL THE CHILDREN'S CHILDREN, appears in her first film, walking through a modest fur bikini. I'm sure he wants the strike to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbarian twins are all right because the heroes of the muscles are bound, but it is almost impossible to make the right criticism of their acting because their roles are just as ill-conceived as all others in this disorder. The only way a movie attempts to distinguish one twin from another is by having one twin wearing a support that covers his buttock while the second double armor is difficult to cover his muscular butt. I am not joking! Do not ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato had to be really desperate to agree with the filming of this film. And his desperation is perfectly reflected in this haunting film. It is bad.
