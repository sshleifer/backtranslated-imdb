*** SPOILERS *** With the assembling of late members and servants of late Christopher Dean, John Carradin, hearing his last will and testimony, they will be somewhat surprised that the Dean of Fortune, about $ 140 million. Money has to be divided between them, but only after they have successfully spent a week at Dean's Chateau. In the story, it seemed that the story appeared when we later found out that it was actually a night, not a week's holiday, at a guest house where the guests could qualify for Dean's money, because almost everyone ends up dead at sunrise. <br /> <br /> The first Dean Curse victim has nothing to do with getting and money from heir Christopher Dean from local sheriff Dan Garcia Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta's head is cut off in a refrigerator and then served on a plate of shocked group of guests. Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and Laura, Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders, a small pet is found dead outside floating in the pond. The film has all the people staying at Dean Mansion to be removed one by one until they find out who is really a killer. Then we have something that seems to be a double step in the story where the killer is originally killed together with two of the last remaining guests. The real killer will end up not only by getting all the prey $ 140 million, but eventually ending up when he does not have to split up with his accomplice by making him the only poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> There's all you can think of in this step that includes selective guests, including incest of S & M sadism and, of course, double and back-stabbing without counting murder. You could not care a bit to see who would survive to choose Dean's happiness at the end of the film and hoped that none of them would be against any hope. Not a big surprise at the end, it's really so much a surprise because the killer's identity is made accessible to a movie that forgot to keep your face in the shade, so you really see who's before it's revealed! Then we have a plot that eliminates the murderer along with a host of remaining guests, just to make the film a little more confusing than it is. The last plot you see comes from a distance of up to ten kilometers is just to show how clever the most obvious killer was almost nobody watching for the film.
