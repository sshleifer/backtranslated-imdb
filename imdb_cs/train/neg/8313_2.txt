I saw it on the whim because it was available and I heard Thumb movies were funny. This was not. Most of the jokes came from the character "Geranium" and again according to Kate Winslet. I think it's really a pathetic "Thumbtanic" creator to feel so deviated to the respected actress just because she (heaven forbid) did not fit into the model of ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was a line that resembles: "Hey, I have a great idea! We're on this temporary raft that nobody else sees!" Thirty seconds of entertainment in 26 minutes of film does not get its value.
