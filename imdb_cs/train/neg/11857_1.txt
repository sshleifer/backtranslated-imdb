The worst movie he ever did !!! Read real movie reviews from professionals on this movie. Check out Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews of this movie. The comments on this site are probably from people who have some financial interest in this movie. I consider positive comments to be very misleading. It seems amazing how negative the comments about this movie are so bad and that positive comments sound like an academic prize. Do not waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie is slowed !! I can not believe that such a movie would ever happen. Why should Hollywood waste time on such a junk? This movie is an attempt at nothing. I ask myself how the money that produces such garbage will be released. I went into a quarrel and the attendant even told us not to waste time or money. I have not heard and I have lost time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really the "worst film he ever had!"
