... but it simply does not work and I am surprised to see how many people think it is good. On what grounds? There are some loose hints here and there, but the whole material is self-sufficient and unconvincing. Lynch's movies are generally interesting because they create confusion and yet they are very playful when they do it. There is some visual sense, there are some subplots, characters, thoughts, etc. But it is boring and yes, useless. Because anything that needs to be explored is either "small," either too attracted or simply said previously in a superior way. Only Lynch examines DV, nothing more should be treated. 1/10
