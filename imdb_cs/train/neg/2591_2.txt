To begin with, I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Although "naked miles" and these two are the worst, it seems to be the fall of the whole series. First of all, it was the best part of the film that it was American Pie, a film that is always appreciated. However, there are tons of bad things to say about this movie. Above all, the story has a very obsolete "arched" structure. First there is a character, then a promise of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of them has a length of exactly 25 minutes. In addition to general consistency, there is little or no personal development, which makes double conspiracy. <br /> <br /> In addition, I deeply hated the stereotype in this movie. This means riders show that they are extremely cool, just-think-of-sex sex and explicitly display geeks as inferior. It also shows that women are only sex objects and men want to treat women as sex objects. In addition, acting was also bad. Perhaps, except for Steve Talley. So, in the end, a generally horrible movie if viewed from a critical point of view. From the point of view of teenagers, it seems to me better, but in most countries, this film is rated in 18+ by most countries, so they should not be seen by minors.
