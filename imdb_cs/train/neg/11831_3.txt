I do not understand how these animated movies still exist and no matter how well (or badly) they love. I saw this movie with my two children (5.7). They like something animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full and I look forward to seeing the film with a great actor. To be honest, I was boringly stupid. It was unbelievably predictable and simply unhappy. There were a few laughs in the whole movie, and that was it. Of course they were trying to get cheap laughs again and again, but it just did not work. My son almost always says he wants a DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter slept halfway. Children also thought the character's animation looked odd. I did not hear from them because I saw The Polar Express, which gave my daughters nightmares. Trust me, I'm not the kind who's looking negative in everything. Quality is the quality, and just as many animated films that fits there, it has very little.
