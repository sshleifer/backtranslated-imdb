The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and obsolete, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what is or will be a "caregiver". It seemed to me like watching a 70s movie. The subject was simply unreliable for 2007, not even in DC. I think this was true for everyone else who was watching it because the applause was very low and fast at the end. Most did not even stay for Q & A. I do not think Schrader really meant that the movie was in advance. Many scenes seemed to be shortened as if they had not been completed or simply did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try to find out or guess what's going on. I really do not even have Woody (Carter) a private life or a friend. What were all "artistic" male slave and torturing images (from Iraqi prisons)? What does he mean? I think it was his very poor attempt to try to create this dark private subcultural life for Woody's character (Car). It did not work. It did not seem to make sense. The only good thing about this movie is Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. You really got the great sense of what a "walker" might be (say, twenty years ago). He was great and would most likely never be recognized. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Boring. <br /> <br /> You do not see it! It's painful! If you are not a real fan of Harrelson.
