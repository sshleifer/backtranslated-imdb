Nothing to say but Wow! Does anyone really have someone slip through the open field? This happens about 25 times in this movie (it's clearly a favorite scary director's direction). In one of the introductory scenes, a smooth spokesman / hot shot should come up in the back seat so the camera camera can sit in front of the movie. Shortly after arriving in the field, 5 contestants will appear, and although it is clear at 2 pm at the latest, everyone is convinced that the sun will stop every minute. After about 30 minutes of dirty garbage, we have a privilege with a retrospection of clown history, in which we see some of his previous victims. If you look at this movie, look at the ladies' chest .. its ribs are up to her neck, it was totally disgusting. Most horror films take place at night, but without the night camera, chaos is forced to do it during the day. Several night shots that caused the film to look like it was stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the backyard directors. The movie eventually redeemed when there was a matrix like shooting with a clown that we were rewinding and watching again and again with a laugh hysterical. <br /> <br /> Surely ONLY THIS FILM HAS BEEN ALL OF SNUCK IN THE OPEN AREA. <br /> <br /> SIGNATURE, ANSWER
