In the recent movement that brought Asian films to America, it's the latest film to be released here. As a big fan of Asian films of all genres, I went through the net and came across to be re-released to the US market, so I decided to preview it and borrow it at a local video rental company. <br /> <br /> Trust me ... action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have completely thrown this movie out of the water. Jet Li fell asleep while watching combat sequences. If you're looking for martial arts fun, your time would be better if Jackie Chan were moving !!! <br /> <br /> Additionally ... do you think you are going to watch martial arts with about a girl paid in jail for her parents death but exaggeration !!! The good hour of this film in the middle is full of dialogue, absence of action, inadequate revelation of the tangent conspiracy, quite unrelated to the assumption we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy and the boy with a conspiratorial group in which the producer / director did not have the time to devote himself to elbaorating, while devoting part of the film to the problem. It would be much better if they just had a whole hour and developed the story in itself with another film and focused on aspects of martial arts. When I talk about it, I really do not believe the choreographer Iron Monkey, she has done a stock sequence in Princess Blade. I was utterly offended in the frequent use of slow movements and quick camera changes to describe the killer's physical speed. I just did not buy it. Please, I warn you not to waste time and money on this movie. The premise is intriguing and the trailer could even try you, but I feel that this film is NOT suitable for the public (perhaps in Japan, but not in the States) and will be the worst film transferred to the Asian film industry states.
