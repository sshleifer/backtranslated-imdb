Just Cause is one of those movies that initially thinks about why it was so hard when it came out - nothing special, but competent enough and with excellent accompanying performance from Ed Harris. Then you get to the last third and everything is getting stupid until you have a torch killer attached to his forehead and threaten to include Sean Connery's wife (typically a conceited and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and a baby (very young Scarlet Johannsen) in the alligator hut skinner's. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie best seen on the plane and even once.
