Hi, it may be because I'm not the theater master or sophisticated movie observer ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". I rented this film for Charles Bronson and it's a title ... but a boy who wasting time ... just watching the two boys sitting in the vault and talking ... The movie on this DVD was so "TMAK" ... I had heavy watching the darn movie ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but they put it on DVD then they should do some digital remastering. I was also very surprised to see these high marks on IMDb for this movie ... as I said I'm not as sophisticated as other people who commented on this movie earlier.
