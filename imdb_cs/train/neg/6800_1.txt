I just asked myself to comment on how terribly stupid this movie is. In addition to breaking the Executive Executive or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story, it's the film that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can have the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to accuse actors of doing a stupid script that is a clich√©. It's bad enough if you ever get into the movie when you run into the insult of your intelligence, but when you find it's running down again, you have to think that the director is also not the brightest bulb in the movie or the producers who have decided to transfer this story on the screen. Mostly, low-cost actors can apologize for choosing to do this because they most likely appeared to get money and exposure and not to become a part of this humorous movie, gaining awards or recognition. It could end up being so badly believed to be involved in such a loser. I see no reason to summarize the plot or even to provide some examples that would prove my case, for that would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one would be able to endure in this debacle. Just as studying good movies can inspire you to create a good, skillfully crafted work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from watching this monster is what you HAVE NOT and what does not work! Be warned.
