It must be one of the worst waste of a 35mm film film ever released in public, the sequel to the least funny original pseudoprofil film "The Legend of Boggy Creek." A bad screenplay, worse acting, etc., Dawn Wells had to hope that Gilligan would come to rescue her and take her back to the island to escape from this flap.
