After watching about half of this movie, I noticed something strange ... I found out that I was constantly switching through TV channels to find out what was still - it's not really a movie feature. The film is referred to as being in many genres, and I must say that it mostly failed in each of them. I went over 80% to watch the old rerun instead. The bottom line-the whole movie felt as if those who did it did not know exactly what to do, and eventually ended up in the mix without any recognizable taste.
