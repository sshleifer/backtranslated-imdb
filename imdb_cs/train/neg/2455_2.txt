I remember seeing a movie with my parents in the summer of '78, and I was pretty much in that time. Of course I was seven at the time. Just before Jackson's movies, my wife and I rented the movie because she never saw her and felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Ralph Bakshi has spent money halfway through animation for this film and has been forced to drastically reduce the demands on this production. Since this film was mainly done with rotoscopic, animation technology for people with budget, it says something. Much of this movie is animation only in the weakest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are obviously just people standing in front of the screen, maybe with some animation effects that are over them. <br /> <br /> Due to the budget constraints, the film is already compressed by the "Fellowship of the Rings" and the "Two Towers" section - it has risen even more. What you like is a movie strip version of Cliff's book notes. It's not all bad though the animation brings the heat I found in Missing movies in Jackson. It's nice to imagine what it could be like decent financing. This film is also remarkable for the sequels that never came. A few years later a half-time television special was being broadcast to pack things. All I can say is that it's a musical instrument.
