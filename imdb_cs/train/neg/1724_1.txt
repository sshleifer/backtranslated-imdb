... and it's the movie. I imagine that if there is a truly negative posthumous life, damn souls are tied up with somewhat uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this film on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, Hands of Fate" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a crazy movie B, a bad movie is the best one (or is it the worst?) A thing I really did not like about this movie is a soul duo that's been throwing a comedy for a comedy. Now the little comic relief is a good thing, but most of the film is focused on the adventures of these two fools, rather than the "heroes" of this film, who are actually less time than they! To be fair, Crown International has really destroyed the film by adding bad music and misconfiguration. But frankly, it was probably a bad movie, so the crown could not really do so to hurt it. <br /> <br /> It really has to be in the bottom 100 list. I would not want this to be on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's my kind of camp B movie. It was bad, but despite getting one star, I still liked it.
