When you have two artists' tower, the least you can expect is a great camaraderie, which is the case in this movie where we have 64-year-old romance Amitabh Bachchan, a 34-year-old taboo. Wait! In fact, it's all in the name of the conspiracy, so instead of "cheeni" it is the content that is "Kum" in this Adman turned Writer-director R. Balki's vain effort .. Trust the two older actors who brought the house with the wise cracks and hot sweet moments when this unconventional pair became love, and that's all you find in the slow but refreshing first half. The locals of London captured during the rainy season are charming. At the end of the first half, romance was completed and missions achieved. There is not much to say. Therefore in the second half of the strange opposition comes in the form of a girl's father to the extent that it is Satyagrah is really a test of patience. It is equally strange the culmination of what is being done. The result is the second half dry, flat without energy. There is a subplot with a girlish child dying of cancer that has little effect. Nevertheless, the film is recommended for its fresh access and performance.
