I saw this film on March 21 this year. They have to say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". The block is jammed. He writes about Prabhat, who lives with his father, wife and his little brother. The movie opens when she rescues the bride. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a conspiracy to kill their young brother. He made a plan by sending a couple of men. They come to school pretending to be Prabhat's girlfriends. Kill the kid. His father throws him out of the house. . And Aakash are going to Kenya to find him. Sunny gives good performance, Chunky was most unpleasant, Naseerdun was useless. Diva did good, Sonam was useless, Jyotsn was useless, but she looked cute. The guy who played Brother Sunnys's movie was cute. Very sad that he had to kill his character. The girl was cute, but it was annoying. Another kid did good. Alok did it well. Kiran was adequate. Amrish and Gulshan did good. Cinematography is excellent both in India and India. Kenya.Script is weak, but has some good dialogs. It also stretches. Film. The music was just fine I just liked one song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics were good. Other songs were forgotten. Do not look at it. Rating-3/10
