This movie got a lot of bad print from people who do not understand what it was supposed to be. One must understand that he never wanted to take this film seriously. It is a camp, just like the "Army of Darkness". AoD was stupid, but fun and bad. The "house of the dead" is not a good evil. <br /> <br /> There are properties that are owned by good camping movies, of which the most important are credible fantasies. One needs to believe what is happening in the movie when he sees humor when the situation is incredibly wrong. Without borders, the film becomes absurd. HotD lacks any credibility. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that HotD does not bring anything new to the genre and repeats the same plot and reaction to the nature that many horror films will inevitably begin to expose. For example, too often, horror films fall into a trap where the main characters find love between gore and destruction. I do not know about you, but when the zombies haunt me, I want to do it with a hot cat. Believe it? No? Then you probably will not believe it when the characters begin sucking the face of the other in this movie. In addition to obvious issues that worry this movie, like so many other horror films, Uwe Boll has decided to add scenes from zombie video games that are shot, randomly, whenever the character shoots the zombies in the movie. Not only is there no clear justification for this artistic choice but it turns it away from an already incredible conspiracy. There are numerous and numerous examples of bad behavior and apparently no attempts by the director to lead actors' reactions to events ... leaving the movie without redemption. Avoid...
