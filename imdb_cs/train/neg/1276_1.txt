This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Let me say this again: This is the only favorite movie I've ever seen. She had all the sounds of a bad movie: mistakes of continuity, bad writing, bad behavior, bad value of production, bad music. I thought horror movies were a few points. The first is to be tense enough to scare you. This movie gets and F in this category. The second point is that when a person dies, or something happens to them, we must take care of them. This movie also gets F. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman, when she fears to happen to her, wolfs her. The next story, an OCD man dies of distrust and talks to his dead friend. And then there's a terrible story of a bad roommate. Come on, could you choose topics more interesting and a little less common than being alone in the house, being anal-retentive, and having a roommate? He writes all these stories, where hallucinations, the virtual reality brought about by a doctor who himself uses it. Wow, stupid. Let me explain something, I like to look at bad horror films and laugh at how bad they are. I could not do this. It was utter pain to sit and watch. Do not ever look at this movie. You will regret it.
