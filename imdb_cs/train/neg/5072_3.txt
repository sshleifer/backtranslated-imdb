And, of course, received, who will lead. At one point, the medical assistant refers to himself as Iorra. Working with an increasingly credible idea that computers could be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this film does not spend enough time exploring this premise. Most of the time on the screen is divided between the native girlfriend quarrels in the coma and the pursuit of the murder of the brain donor. He tries to be a science fiction / drama / thriller but can not deliver on any of the three. <br /> <br /> As a Frankenstein remake this is missing everything that did the original good. Nobody calls a doctor, or even threatens to throw him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a comet victim who opens one eye and the amazing computer that does it is not even displayed. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when a mistake is made, there is little response. Every tension over whoever might be a killer is broken by gradually showing him in the same room with all possible suspects. Finding a killer is as easy as opening one file and talking to one person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is in the house as it happens in the SF, the cableway plays a significant role, the conductors live on a Victorian hill, Pier 39 comes out and the last showdown takes place in the Golden Gate Park. More specifically, after ten feet of a cliff in the park - it's enough to keep the bridge in the picture still. As soon as the apparent scenery of the base is rounded, no other attempt to visit the city will be. <br /> <br /> Actor acting is the only saving mercy. Keir Dullea shows a good range and takes a few really emotional scenes. Suzanna Love shows recovery from a comic well. Tony Curtis receives only a handful of lines and twice as many bad guys who explain most of his French assistant to most French. A little blond boy also encounters his bits. <br /> <br /> I gave her one extra star for the scene where her husband heads south of the bridge on a non-rotating parking lot and then immediately backs them back to the bridge leading north. It takes a lot of things - bravery, ignorance, deadlines - to try to get the viewer slip into a single car chase.
