It is sad that there is a lot less than swings. The plot was decent. I think this is not common, but it has a story, unlike other modern horror movements. The second good thing was cast. I'm not saying that acting was good because it was not, but every actress / actress was hot and attractive. One of them is that the movie became exciting for the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another down (or you could consider it if you want) is excessive nudity. All four girls were without toasters for a few minutes, and they all showed up for a long time. It's not like I'm against naked, but it was a horror film, not "The Dreamers." <br /> <br /> If you are not desperate to watch a guy, take off his swimsuit and go naked for a few minutes, or look at the girl getting naked for no reason or you are a comforting fan of Debbie Rochon than it is movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
