Despite my flaws I liked "Cigarette Burns", John Carpenter is Season One's episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story looked like an inexpensive cross between MADNESS RETURN and 8MM, but it was still good for the budget and time constraints that were granted to him. With "Pro-Life", however, the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is a solid direction as always from Carpenter, but there is quality writing and all production in itself, which makes it feel that it has been done in complete and complete hurry. The script is not always clear, the message is blurry, and the story is full of plot holes once you look back at them. Perhaps Carpenter wrote a script again, it could be a major episode. Instead, it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans find the smallest experience in. Certainly the worst Carpenter ever did. 2/10
