I watched Hulu (too many ads!) So I did it, but it was like watching a really bad friend from the early 1960s. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both plays Jerry Lewis. If I were an Indian, I would protest if all men were murderous and all women like sharks. They cheated on music videos for Western sales and used many Western models to touch the men. He usually likes Indian movies, but it was a great disappointment, especially for the modern Indian film. The story does not happen in India (Uncle still says when Mac returns to India), but I do not know where to do.
