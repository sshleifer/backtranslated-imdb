I have to say that I am really surprised by the high ratings of this film. I find it quite idiotic. Does a mother receive a "vision" when it touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice has caused her vision to continue ... It seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was terrible, I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and most of the supporting actors for what they had to do. I usually like LMN and I'm very open to films, but this movie seemed to me to have a ridiculous conspiracy and over gaming, and it just was not for me.
