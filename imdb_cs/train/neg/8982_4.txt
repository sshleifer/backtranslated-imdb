My nose is slightly bent when I write it. A few weeks ago, I posted a previous comment on this movie that has not yet appeared. I suppose it was rejected, even if it complied with all the usual instructions. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who appeared in such significant productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, it all eventually submerges under a really horrible, melodramatic scenario. There are also a number of free nudes who do nothing to encourage narration, nor give impressively the nuances of what is otherwise a beautifully rendered work of art. Today's trip to the beach in Valencia would be far less demanding than if you had to meet these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.
