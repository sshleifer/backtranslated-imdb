a movie that tries to be much smarter than its creators are able to produce. the movie alternates and passes through the mirage of the "surprise" fence in a desperate attempt to keep the audience's quarrel, offcourse piercing a "plot" with waterfall scenes that they thought helped. James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual experiment, and only sleep is going through the film. the same applies to other "actors". The conspiracy is quite stupid and sticky. which is not such a crime, but at the end the enormous plots of the plot are very tedious and boring. The film managed to bring some interest in the middle. in all, it's a lazy watch for a really boring day, but do not be afraid if you miss it. <br /> <br /> It's a chrome 4!
