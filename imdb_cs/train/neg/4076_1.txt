This subject deserves a much better script and the end result than the movie comes out. The screenplay is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a string of nightmare scenarios freely knit together. The gaps and free ends of the story are numerous. The scene where the kidnapping kid learns that her parents are not dead and she was looking for her is just bizarre. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the shelter head for the refugees to give her the "missing poster" when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of the refugee shelter finds he has kidnapped under his roof, it should be an immediate challenge for the police. This is a law enforcement issue that is not for the Oprah segment for 12 minutes. Everything that follows to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for purely gratuitous exploitation. Funny, that's what this movie has to condemn. Finally, he seems to have joined.
