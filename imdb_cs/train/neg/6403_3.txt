.... as far as the level of joke on which this comedy works. It can hardly even reach full length, "I can do it ..." until I need glasses "is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes, many of which are so short that you can not believe it when you realize it was a dividing line example: Santa Claus gag), others are so long you can not believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to create THAT punchline (example: student awards) .And almost all are directed without any art. I do not know, I do not know, I do not know, I do not know, I do not know what I'm saying. there is also some comic male nudity.) And I agree with the others that the deliberately stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! none of these reasons is enough to make this film more than * out of 4.
