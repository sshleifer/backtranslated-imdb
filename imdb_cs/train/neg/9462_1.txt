Inappropriate. The PG rating that this film gets is another big mistake of the MPAA. Whale Rider gets PG-13 but this movie gets PG? Please. Parents do not be fooled when you get a child from a primary school into this movie, it's a huge mistake. Many times I felt uncomfortable not only because humor was inappropriate for the children but also because it was totally useless and useless. But all in all, Cat in the hat is still a terrible movie. Casting and the overall appearance of the film are the only economical merits. Beautiful Kelly Preston and Alec Baldwin are always enjoyable (or hateful) both are good in their roles, although Preston is so beautiful for such a role. Children are conditional actors, and they show it especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that kept me safe and did not throw things off the screen. Did I mention that there is too much talking in this movie in this movie? Mike Myers is totally foolish. I did not like him as Shrek's voice, and I really believe that Myers would never allow her to get back to the field of children's films again. His performance on the cat is a slightly faded version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. Eventually, the cat should not come, he should stay away, but he came, even though he just destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and controversy. Cat in a hat can be the worst movie for kids.
