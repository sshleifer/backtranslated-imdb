The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale in the afternoon. I suppose this is a horror / comedy. I've foretold every scene in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I believe I can come up with good effects from what I lay in the house. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I'm afraid I do not. Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey. After a little thought, I have one thing to say on this movie - it's over.
