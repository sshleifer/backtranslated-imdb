This story about three women is a very sensitive study: Muriel (oldest Charlotte Van Den Eynde), Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 years old, and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the oldest mother of Muriel. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. Live Laura wants a baby. Muriel comes from the village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams of youth when she is a young girl. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so you expect something - in case of an accident - which could dramatize this story. As time goes by, you will find that Dorothee Van Den Berghe just wants to develop a psychological portrait of three women and nothing more. This movie is a disappointment because you expect women to learn from their experiences, which is not so, so one remains with feelings of emptiness.
