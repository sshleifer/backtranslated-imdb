I was dying to see it once when I saw what a ridiculous poster of MEATBALLS was, and he thought it had to be the best satire ever. What a great idea for satire - the genre is full. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think all participants probably realize) is a catalog of unused opportunities, not quite a performance and (fortunately!) A pair of extremely cheerful, inspired pieces. Janeane Garafolo, which is very prominent, looks really bad, probably because she is inconveniently trying to make her play full of fun. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to watch, trying hard to be funny and looks like Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny when she sees you laughing but her segment is somehow not going to hysterics. Paul Rudd had great teenage manners and was sexy like hell, the others are really entertaining (not born). I think the problem is that the director just does not move things right. It starts to be very dead, and it sets itself monotonously. But when he leaves things really outrageous (the drug sequence is the second most amusing time I've ever had in movies, the first one also appeared in a misleading film: Andrea Martin in ALL PRIORITIES who complained about IN & OUT), it's just funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just was not. Dress and styling for 1981 are 99.9% perfect and very few songs are also perfect. This will end up as a medium-bad episode of TV MAD, supplemented by frustrating over-sketches.
