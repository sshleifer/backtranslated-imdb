I was exposed to this film in the classroom of relationships in my school. As it turned out, it was nothing amazing and nothing new. While trying to be original by concentrating on a younger father instead of a mother who shows the problems that a father would have gone through. She had an interesting page, but it just does not suit its originality, because nothing else in this movie was original. We have a main character who has an older sister who likes in any other movie, like what has something against him, we have at home a mother who expects too much, and when he gives more, he feels hurt and leaves him in the dust, then we have a father who is always gone. Then the girls have parents who want everything and expect to be perfect at all. I told the story that it was interesting, but the lack of good acting from the cast and the lack of good writing or narration. Everything about this was a clich√© when the little kid in school began to study with a girl, meet, have sex and then boom that we have a small child. Perhaps it could be better if the writing was much better and if the actress improved, I seriously got more emotions from Leatherface and its chain saw than I did from some actor in this movie, and it's pretty bad to see that Leatherface movies are bullshit and horror. So far, the only interesting teen movie I've ever seen is Juno. Meanwhile, the comic site of this serious situation proved more fun and at the same time gave the same message. Just as I said that this idea was original, most of these films focus on a teenage mother, but she decided instead to focus on her father's career, but originality again would not save this film from being mediocre. I really hope that somebody decides to re-create this film with a better cast and a better writer or to make another similar movie because this was unnecessary potential.
