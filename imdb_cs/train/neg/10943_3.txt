This is really a bad movie, bad acting and very boring tempo Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All the characters are just unpleasant (with the exception of Lamas) and there is absolutely no one who does not care about the prey!, Plus the event is very boring. The film gives us 3 villains who should find menacing and disturbing when in fact they are boring, laughing and just the bunch of morons I wanted to close! And it looks very cheap and amateur! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but can not save this piece of bullshit and believe it or not the opening was really great as well as the end, however the middle is incredibly dull and got me to insist on printing a fast forward button! Plus Dialog is especially ridiculous ! There is a cool bar scene that I really liked, but once Lamas heads to the dock, it collapses, plus the scene where the villains torture Jennifer's family and kill them should be considered disturbing when it's actually ridiculous! This is really a bad movie, a bad acting and very boring pace, but Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! But it's not enough, it's not recommended. Direction is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, with an average camera, a dull position, and keeping the film boring. The game is very bad (except Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is amazing and when he is not obliged to act, he is quite fun to watch, he's really cool in character and has a lot of charisma, but he can not save this one and he has no chemistry with an actor! (The Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is terrible, and while she's decent, she's not very convincing, and Lamas has no chemistry. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but she has not got much to do before screaming and scaring, she did it all right. Robert Scott is DANGERALLY unpleasant as the main villain and did not threaten at all, it was ridiculous, like the other two. The rest of the cast is bad. Overall, avoid! Avoid! Even if you like Lamas (like me). * of 5
