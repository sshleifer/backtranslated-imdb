It's a movie that has had a lot of lives. in the year of his release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I heard nothing but bad things about this particular plot that was criticized as too complicated <br /> <br /> sincerely speaking is something like red herring and the film suffers even more when the word "plot" is used, because if I see there is no site as such. There's something about Russian gangsters, a person called Pete Thompson, who is trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant and an Irish guy called Sean. As everyone fits into something called "conspiracy," I'm not sure. It's hard to explain the drawings of Guy Ritchie, but if you look at one of his films, I'm sure we can all agree that everyone has one no matter how complicated they may seem at first glance. As well as James Bond's film, though the drawings are shot in action scenes. You will have a serious problem believing that RANCID ALUMINUM has any type of central fence that can be thoroughly explained <br /> <br /> When you look at the cast list, there are enough warning bells about what kind of movie you are watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films over the last 15 years and does nothing to make it inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives the acting bad name (and he plays a character called Kant who sums up the joke of this movie) while one of the supportive characters is playing a television presenter probably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this one. <br /> <br /> The only good thing , which I can say about this movie, is that she is totally forgotten. I saw it a few days ago and right after I watched I was going to write a very critical review, warning people what they were watching, but now I've forgotten why. But that does not change the fact that I remember that this piece of crap is immensely immense
