This musician, adapted to the novel by Gore Vidal (actually one of the great American writers), makes THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF DOLLS look like Fellini's works of art. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and in fact not too high) in the lead role (with the exception of KANSAS CITY BOMBER when it was pretty good) starring John Huston, Rex Reed (bad movie reviewer, not critic) alter-ego, Mae West, young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (before Lee Lee Majors, what a shame) and other different creep-azoids to pretend, except for the tangled old movie clips (ie Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... JUST they could continue bleeding from all people. <br /> <br /> And 2 out of 10. Best Performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth seeing!
