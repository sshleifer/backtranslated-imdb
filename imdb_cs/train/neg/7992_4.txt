I remember seeing this movie long ago on TV. I recall the assumption that the film is about a group of people in the hotel who are attacked by ant ants. What I did not remember was how much it was! <br /> <br /> I recently shot this movie on TV late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake, because such films usually disappear from existence and they'll never be found! Suzanne Somers plays Lakewood Manor at the top of her career, played by Chrissy at Three's Company. Constructive workers install the pool outdoors and accidentally disrupt the ant nest. Or I should say * NEST * MAN-EATING ANTS '!! One of the workers actually attacks the ants. One minute they choose them from their dresses, they are covered in the next minute. The following scene shows the skeleton in the dirt. If you thought it was quite far, you should see that Myrna Loy is playing on a wheelchair bound to a wheelchair that is brought out of the helicopter from Manor! I had almost an idea of ​​how she thought she thought she was out of the movie. The final scenes depict Suzanne, Robert Foxworth, and the third person sitting on the floor of the hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing over the straw and covering the ants. This is basically a movie. There is really no "disaster" appeal or "big-star" draw to the movie. At that time it was supposed to be a "spectacular" TV event. Now it's lucky to see 4:00 hours at the local station. If you want to capture Suzanne Somers at best, then let's take a look at Tri's episode. To see how Myrna Loy does anything to put the bread on the table and pay bills, then look at this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
