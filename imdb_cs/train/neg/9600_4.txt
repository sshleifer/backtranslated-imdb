A very special, but occasionally elegant, exploitative film without a real story, but the benefit of its stunning lead actress and a bunch of nice, spooky make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful girl with the twentieth birthday that suffers from a rape trauma at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her to another conviction that it is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was considered a werewolf. He kills his brother-in-law during a night's meeting and gets to the hospital. Again, he escapes and accidentally devours more men while escaping for police detectives, doctors and relatives. Everything is nice when you look and listen (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity is irritating fairly quickly. Fortunately, the lead lady Annik Borel seldom wears his clothes and fills the tedious moments by dancing naked around the fire. The movie is too long, too weird and too forgotten. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of blue director Rino Di Silvestro tries to believe that his film is based on real facts. Yeah, right ...
