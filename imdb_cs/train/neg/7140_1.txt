You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies ever should have one of the most beautiful cars. Why should cars not only be victims of violations, but also the only true actors and artists in it. Just as on Earth you are Porsche, Lamborghini, or anything that will allow these people to get in touch with your cars and destroy you a reputation for millions. The top advantage is that you have gained the advantage of cars and making money on their chests. It's painful for those who love cars. It's painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want money back!
