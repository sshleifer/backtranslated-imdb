This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. The game was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: The comet, which appears once in a second, appears at night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then the following morning everyone, apart from a few chosen people, turned to the dust from the radiation comet. Human clothes are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have turned to dust. No bones, nothing. It is ridiculous. How can radiation burn people, but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? Even better, the comet has transformed some people into zombie meat eating monsters. Their make-up would not even look frightening for a newborn baby. Insane Clown Posse scares me more ... and they should look stupid. Then they were survivors. People who were surrounded by steel when the comet was passed were spared the zombie-house and death. How can steel block the radiation of a comet that allegedly burns people in their tracks? Equally offensive is the horror of the 1960s that plays in the background through parts of the film or 80th hair rocks that have no purpose for the film and want you to shoot your TV program. The silly part of the film is a character that focuses on it: two girls Valley and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go to eat the day after the apocalypse with those who go all over the world? Throughout the movie, there were four five-minute horror scenes and most of them were dreams. Among these scenes is a simple dialogue that makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence between the elementary interview was painful. I could have done a better movie with four monkeys and a Cheetos bag. This movie is not seen at all.
