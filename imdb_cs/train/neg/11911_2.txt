I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, but watching closely. I was waiting for another terrible strange effect or another absurd cliché of conspiracy to show the full strength, so I could learn how to make a movie. It seems that when they went on the film, the crew watched every other action / sci-fi / shoot-em-up / good vs. the evil film he ever did, saw cool things and said, "Hey, we can do it." For example, the only car parked in a mile on what looks like a one-way street with a non-parking arm is the only car that the protagonist is, an attractive brunette born of bile. The car shatters before it lands. The special effects were probably my biggest beef with this movie. But what I really did in my bad books was unpredictability and lack of reasons for so many elements! For example, an antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to cause damage in bizarre ways, becomes a solitary military vehicle carrying an important VIP. The truck gets homeless with weapons, you know they're dead. Then the guy who protects the VIP says, "Under no circumstances will you leave this car, do you understand me?" He's going to find a beast that killed his three buddies, and he gets into a nearly comical cliché. Then, for no obvious reason, resisting logic, convention, and common sense, a silly VIP ass gets out of the car !!! Much of what happened during the movie did not make sense. Transparent action has separated me from the movie, as well as bad camera work and things that just made you go: "Wow, that's incredibly rich." Shiri Appleby saved a movie of 1 because it gave the film the only element that always allows viewers to enjoy the sex appeal experience.
