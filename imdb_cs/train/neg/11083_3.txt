This movie was late at night when I saw it. At first it was interesting, but it did not convince me as a whole. I'm not a fan of Tyson. In fact, I do not like the box at all. It is a barbarous, obscene and double face (society) that some get the money for being beaten. <br /> <br /> However, I felt the beginning of the movie was fine. Actors are all right, especially George C. Scott (like Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable movement is. I have not read books or books about boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about the man, but it was quite fun. As the film went on, I felt that it had lost a little spell, and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was not good enough.
