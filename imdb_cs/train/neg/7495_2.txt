Fox's "True Story of Jesse James" (1957) is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James". I'm not sure where the bug lies, but casting in this version of two central characters, the unequal direction of Nicholas Ray, and the scenario with ham must have something to do with it. <br /> <br /> In the late 1930s and 1940s, Tyrone Power was the chief executive of Fox, but in the 1950s his star began to fall, and studio studio Darryl Zanuck began to prepare newcomer Robert Wagner to take his place. This was the main mistake in Zanuck's part because Wagner proved to be less than a suitable substitute. With the possible exceptions from "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven and Hell" (1956), it is hard to think that Wagner is anything different! Also, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing but a Fox player before he was assigned to play Frank James to Wagner's Jesse in The True Story Jesse James. Borrowed from the studio last year, this unique actor was his outstanding and revealing performance in the classic John Ford "Searchers". But his acting here with Wagner as the second half of the James brothers is not boring. Neither player brought any personality or color to their roles. They are totally lacking in the brand, lacking in charisma and appeal, which are so strongly depicted by Power and Fonda in the original. The film is also confused with too many obstacles, and around the Wagner screenplay like Robin Hood in the American West, it strikes you as a carefree introverted fuss that can not feel any empathy for you. The support cast is worth mentioning, but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely looks like Ma James. The best aspects of this unattractive so-so-western film are the wonderful Cinemascope movie from great Joe McDonald and the outstanding musical score of underrated and little-known composer Leigh Harline!
