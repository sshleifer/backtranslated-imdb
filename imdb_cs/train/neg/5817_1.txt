The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive. The characters were stereotypical "white baskets", the film "conspiracy" was shadowed from the outset, and the worst feature of this film was that nudity was so obvious from the body that it was funny. Unfortunately, it was the only fun thing in the movie. Mrs. Jenkins would be better served if she were to use her life story in the future to "entertain" people. It was simply wrong. One positive aspect of this film (it has nothing to do with the poor quality of the film) lies in the fact that my brother has expelled the money for this arsonist.
