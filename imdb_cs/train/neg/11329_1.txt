Elizabeth Taylor could not act at all, and she was just her usual unpleasant, ruthless self in this movie. It was before she got so fat, but she still looked very short and thin. Rock Hudson was okay like Bick Benedict, but he would be a bigger actor, like William Holden, better. James Dean has certainly proved he can mumble for the movie. The entire movie is incredibly slow and takes too long. The actors were all too young and lighter, and neither of them was aging aggressively because of bad makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous when he was stuffed out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously of the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
