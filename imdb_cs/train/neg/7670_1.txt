Where do I start my story? Tonight I went to this film with a few friends who did not know more than the actors who were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. Well, I came to the first 20 minutes of what poor decision I made when I saw this movie. The story was crap, and it was also a script. The lines were horrible that people in the audience were hysterical. Cast could not look more plastic. Even some scenes looked like they should do much faster ... as if they were dragging without a special reason. Very bad editing. This whole movie was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
