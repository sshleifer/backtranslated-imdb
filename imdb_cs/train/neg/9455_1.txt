Well, I think I know the answer to this question. For money! We were so bombed with the ad and Cat In The Hat, which we almost believe there must be something good in this movie. I admit that I thought the trailers looked bad, but I had to give him a chance. Well, I had to go with my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood waste. Again to prove that an average person can be programmed to believe that everything he says is good, it must be good. In addition to the insulting fact that the movie is about 80 minutes long, it obviously began with a script-read myth. It's full of unsuccessful attempts at nonsensical humor and terrible pastel scenery. Jump across the universe without aim and direction. It is then associated with, ............................ yes, I will say, BAD ACTING! I could not help, but I felt I was looking at the "Coffee Interviews" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the cat intended to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning also had no prize, but Mr. Myers would have to disappear under the rock until another Austin Powers movie was prepared. F-, no stars, 0 on scale 1-10. Save Money!
