After reading another review, I thought this movie would be really good. I like movies "B", but it could not even be considered such. Photography is probably half a decent thing in the movie. However, the cut left much desirable. It was very jaded and staccato. Whoever chooses music and sound does a terrible job. The music was terrible, especially whatever atmospheric or scenic setting. If the acting was better, they could get the film out. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in porn. To see the film of "B" vampires, check out "Bloody Ties". You will have more fun.
