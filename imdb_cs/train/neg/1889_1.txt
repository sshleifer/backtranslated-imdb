This film is by no means fun, but rather a look into the depths of the darkest side of human behavior. It freely connects half a dozen stories of the worst kind of abuse, perverse sex, greed, violence and intolerance. The whole event takes place during a few very hot and sticky days during a hot wave wave in Vienna and warmth can be responsible for some of the anger and hate in the movie. For me, the treatment of a slowed girl by a security dealer was the worst episode, followed closely by a scene of drunkenness and perversion in a "wreck" apartment. You will be gripped and I hope this movie has been scared. I hated it, but I felt compelled to see it. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 for displaying 'man' as it is sometimes.
