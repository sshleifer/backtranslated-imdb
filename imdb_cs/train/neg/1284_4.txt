This movie was a long increase without a peak. People who are bound by the sword at the end of the game must be either of their minds or they do not. Too often this film is soft. I'm not saying soft movies are bad. But no matter how you have a favor from sugar, you should have no room for T-bone steak. This film was about revenge for crimes committed against culture, but it eventually became a tiny battle. And only one of them knew what the sword was; Tim Roth character (and yes, he plays him well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" without knowledge of how to use the sword, and the way he "won" was a shame. As a drama, this film had its period, but the best performance in it has to go to the nature of Scotland. It's just one rain before it's called "soap" in my book.
