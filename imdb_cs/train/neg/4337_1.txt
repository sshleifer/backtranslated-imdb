It's just breaking a wonderful story from Edwin Torres. This film does not follow story in the book. And there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter even saw the first movie. Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) went from prison to the beginning of the original. Here Carlito leaves with his wife in paradise. What happened to Gail of Lorain, Ohio? In this installment, this is not a mention, and Carlito retired and is likely to get married to another girl. Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. I also like Mr. Guzman playing a completely different character in this movie. Pachanga was back in the days of Pacino. Now Nacho Reyes, a murderer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much larger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's a while I've read a book, but where does the character of Sean Comb come from? I think this film really hides the racist tension in Harlem, which Torres writes. And the crowd does not receive the treatment they did in the book. They are also destroyed in this movie. But the charming Pleasant Avenue is magical for the second film. <br /> <br /> The book tells a great story. This movie could tell a great story. That's just a huge disappointment. Read the book. It's better to use your time.
