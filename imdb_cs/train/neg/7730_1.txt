In spite of the great style, gleam and glitter, this French musical can not speak. The tones are repetitive, predictable and boring. The story is uninteresting, like many characters. <br /> <br /> People chase song and dance without motivation or reason. Most casts wear fake-looking wigs and hairpieces, and sets seem hopeless to the studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video restored version was stopped before the end, so it had a negative effect on me. It is certainly a pity he has such a talented acting career in such a weak ending effort. <br /> <br /> It is going to show, I think that where they follow (in this case the great classic, "Umbrellas"), they often go wrong. You can not capture again, only again.
