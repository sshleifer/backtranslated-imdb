As many people agree, Origin is a beautiful artistic anime. The music, the graphics and the created world are beautiful and really stand over most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more than this than I suggest looking elsewhere. Beauty stops to look, and when it really comes to plot and characters, there is nothing special. The activity is slow and minimal and people are sometimes flat, horrifying and do not act realistically. Not to mention holes of holes and holes of conspiracy there ... So, summaries, oh goodness, I have never seen anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness, it's like ... -how- people do not get involved like that. He made GIANT a step forward in graphics and music in the anime, but it also took several steps back to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there are not so many measures to do it ...
