... Bad that you are deliberately wrong ... This small jewel fired directly on the large screen MST3k. While it is obvious that the film does not try to take seriously (Hopefully their goal, as well ...), the film is still wrong. Hell, it makes the Leprechaun in the universe look great budgeted ... Briefly: Paint my muscle car colorful prune!
