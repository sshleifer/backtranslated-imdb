Is there a movement that is more intolerant and more resilient than the ecologists movement? The future young socialist, who joins the circus, must look as intimidating as he joins the real circus. Though these people usually put their Hollywood brains on these important issues, Hollywood habits often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism. Here you will learn the art of knocking your fingers in the face of anyone without losing your brand of smirk. Learn how to get rid of logic and science with strong arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by marking it as a gateway to planetary Armageddon. In addition, you learn how to lie with a straight face, you also learn to shrug the accusations that have deviated from the path, no matter how much you are hypocrites. You will be able to use as much energy as Al Gore, although people will behave as if you were Amish. In the second season it was even more useful because we could visit other Hollywood gods, your names are holy and your audit - ie the judge - their lifestyle. NOTE: It is the only time for the envirofascist to consider others because it allows the victim to get the opportunity to buy a variety of expensive and trendy organic toys so that they can move their finger across the faces of other people. <br /> What does Ed have in the third season? Maybe he'll teach us how to judge when he's sleeping!
