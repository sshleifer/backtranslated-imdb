Check out the movie web site, more time was given than when writing a screenplay for this movie. It could not be more about boasting. Original story? Original? They had to find a script tucked between the old law or face the legal consequences for this corner of the corner. Best Special Effects? Come on, I could do better with the Atari 7600 and the jar of earwax. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, America's most entertaining home video is still classic. I'm sure they do not have enough money for this title, so of course they're not really that good, or it's a little bad or just funny, but it's a story that's losing time and money from this movie. Four stories intertwined into one and all of them were fruitless pieces of sight - befores and finished - it is already.
