One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to define "worst?" I prefer that both eyeballs slip away, and then they are forced to dance on them, than ever seen in this pitiful label. One of the hits Wonder Zwick manages a movie that simultaneously offends fans of Elvis, Mary Kay, Las Vegas, gay, FBI agents, and the rest of humanity with any intelligence that should be abandoned. As Elvis Presley Enterprises has allowed the rights of real Elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be "The Only Good Elvis Presley Imitator Is Dead" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and it does some work - is a crushed scenario: In 1958, Elvisa's words and songs are quoted and played in the 1970s. Worst Special Effect? That Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis's tomb, probably the most photographed / recognizable grave in the world, reminds of a pyramid with a golden record stuck to the top and is somewhere in the middle of the park. Potentially, the biggest audience of this film was Elvis fans. However, the unbearable stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, not an FBI commission ... and I could go on and on) actually undermines conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid film. This is really a terrible, terrible movie.
