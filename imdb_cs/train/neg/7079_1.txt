No reason to bother renting this movie. I knew from my opening credits that I had trouble. It was shot as if it were a small pornographic movie, but it really is not something erotic. Looking at the world of sex addiction is interesting, but to a certain extent. Bitter sex scenes, bad plot and portraits by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this movie.
