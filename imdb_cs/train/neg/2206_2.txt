The scientist on the island is deeply saddened by the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why did not he forget my dead man in the hammer shark. Well, who is not? It's a bit difficult to deal with that shark hammer that kills everyone is constantly called "Paul." Also William Forsythe cast as MacGyver-kick-ass-savetheday-a lot of hero lacks credibility. On the other hand, there are a couple of hot chickens that really make you look at the screen while Shark Paul bites another to death. In fact, I find bad b-movies quite fun. But because of my taste it would be a much better film if it was made for $ 100,000 less. Then it could be fun.
