These reviews claim that this movie is so bad that its good is over that. This movie does not blame that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli. These movies were fun in their horror, but this pile of dinosaur manure is so bad that it is painful. In this pain I did not see a bad movie because I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a bounty of $ 35 million. Cinema New Line Cinema refused to put on theaters. They lose the losses by sending it directly to the video making it the most expensive direct-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi set out to be in this disaster after a huge payoff. Plot: A millionaire clones the dinosaurs to launch shots in the sun that would kill humans and start another ice age. The police woman named Katie Coltrane and the idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly cooperate to stop him after the death of a dinosaur friend. The story gets you at the beginning of the film, the film of all its secrets. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is pretty awful. Whoopi looks disturbed and tries to cross her performance, but without success. Theodore Rex is totally unpleasant, and after five minutes he will have a weak behavior on the canvas. Most jokes revolve around him and threatens to bite people and beat people by tail (in case of accident and intention). I thought the Burglar was bad, but in the back seat it's Theodore Rex: the worst movie Whoopi's career. Do not let anyone tell you that this senselessness is bad enough to be nice. I did not see it when I was watching this movie. Everything I saw was the wreck of a train written by people who had to have a sick admire of Howard The Duck. Humor is at this level and Theodore Rex looks like an inbred cousin of Barney. Painfully from beginning to end.
