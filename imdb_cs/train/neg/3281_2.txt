I suspected the film would be bad. I'm the Duke's fan back. He has three years of TV series on DVD. I was right. He took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the main jump and some scene with a jump was good. But to sum it up, it was a movie that looked like a tiny version of a TV show. Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that Daisy's original clothes were just as revealing, the interpretation of Jessica Simpson of Daisy was just terrible. Sorrel Booker and Denver Pyle must also move in graves. <br /> <br /> Do not waste money. If you are an old tried and true fan of Dukes like me and my three children, you will be very disappointed.
