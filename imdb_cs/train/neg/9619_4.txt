If you believe this, * another * group of adolescents will return to the next * cabin on the lake three years after * another * one of those fatal accidents has declared one of their number. Low and, behold, a psycho who is wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap paper cloth in it), rises to lose one by one. This mechanical "Friday 13th" reflection gained weak renown as one of the first digital engagement functions, but that's where ending-breaking facts and everything that remains is predictable, amateur production with sub-performance and repetitive boom-mic intrusion. The last second step is a bit of ghost lifting and "Memorial Day" is something that best flies in the lake and forgets. One only for collectors of mad slasher.
