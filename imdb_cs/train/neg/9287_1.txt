WOW! Why would anyone go on going to an already ugly film? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no trace of what it wants to be. It simply appears on the screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is like: Twitch (played by Kurupt from Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where a box filled with golden bricks could be buried. In prison, riots are ripped between rival prisoners, one of whom is shot dead by a man named Cortez, and Cortez plans to escape. During the marriage visit, Twitch's fiancee and Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and are held in the execution room. Burke reluctantly spins with Twitch and eventually gets into trouble with idiotic prisoners and discovers that Cortez has a close relationship. Opinion: This is an unnecessary sequel to Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is awful, acting is horrible, dialogue is a joke, and everyone in this movie is a cartoon. Look, I know it's a low-budget movie, but that's not the excuse for these boys to do their best to do what they do. Nobody in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. No one in this film can be seriously defended as an actor, Kurupt should be ashamed of himself, his character "Twitch" is an almost indifferent minstrel puppet who spends most of his time, while he is being lifted by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time concentrating all over the film as if he had to take the PHD (quite a huge dump). The battle scenes are badly choreographic and pathetic and for the action film HPD2 is pretty boring even though the action is happening Don 'Let someone say this the movie is somewhat decent, it is stinking and is the main reason why people despise folklorism.
