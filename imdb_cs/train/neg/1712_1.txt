If Todd Sheets were to go and admit that this movie was intended to fake the zombie genre, I would change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line and even every actor's nuance should be a parody. I could probably crush the soup from the alphabet, organize what the letters remained, and even better the script. Especially two scenes remind me of me when I think about this movie. WARNING: SPOILER! One is when Mike's dad and dad go, I repeat that I walk through the stairs with tiny zombies. It is a small staircase, and despite the fact that it moves against the enemy undead, nothing will happen to them. When they get to the end, the ex-sailor turns around, he says, "God, you're an angry bastard" and shoot only one. The other is in a military complex. The girl is a zombie machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera is about forty seconds around it, while it is surrounded by zombies in the length of the arm. Then he almost exhausts the crowd and joins the other people. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be considered credible. I still like this movie just like almost every comedy just because it's so damn fun. Kudos to Todd Sheets for having gotten so many people in his movie, and it was his job, but not really.
