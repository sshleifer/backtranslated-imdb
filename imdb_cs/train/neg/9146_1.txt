Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch the camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for minor thefts. Anyone who pays a dime to rent one of his garbage should file a lawsuit and be compensated. That was innocently my first glance at his "job" ... and it will be my last. Ed Wood looks great now. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of crap to a video rental room, I personally ask him to be pulled out of the shelf. As an active supporter of homosexual cinema, I'm excited and angry that this twisted, extremely misunderstood child can give up and wrap up something like that, with a blond nice boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who fortunately has no more worker credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back side that is used as a bait, and then put it on the market as a rental movie. Believe me, it does not have a place where it would not be anywhere. it's just not a movie in any sense. Offensive, irresponsible unsolicited things like this can only be detrimental to efforts to support and support homosexuals (hell, generally gay rights!) For those who love to rent this for cover, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not so flattering that he's watching the movie because he's on the shelf and he's seen one or two shirts without a shirt - that's all. Instead, the home-made Mroavich causes us our own nasty, apologetic-looking gym of nakedness. This "thing" he "gathered" is for Mraovic's reverse project. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, gives similar dirty garbage) are terribly terrible. Mraoviƒç deliberately poses as a complete without talent (in all areas), desperately catching any "lost" attention he can for himself. He must be honest.
