Karl Jr and his father are now leading an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of boys who dive into the island. Who will fight after a while. (even those who survived) This has uninterrupted blood, blood and bloodshed, which would be good if one of them appeared to be remotely real, or if production did not look as if it were with a weekly value, money (I can be overstated there, it was about a few days worth). The terrible dubbing did not bother me so much, and I suspect that if I were really drunk, some of that might be a bit humorous ... maybe. But how it is, in just 78 minutes, the movie still felt too long ... Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Bonus movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and stories for other released Shock-o-Rama films
