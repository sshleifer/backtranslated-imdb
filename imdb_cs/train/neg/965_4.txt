At first I liked the film. I thought it was a nice comedy with some stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky made the best !!! Just like the gorgeous decorator Robert R. Benton - this man was really good at taste! But the script writers disappointed me very much. The best end would be the ladder scene, but instead they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Do not like the end. The father becomes a friend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds out that she is all right. It would be all right if the screenwriters, for example, said that they were different in the body, but they did not do it, they just got rid of memories. The actors were good, they were really fun. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. he was very entertaining on the dance scene :)) ... But some of the moments spoil the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, waited for 23 years (it's been a long time!), She was true, she loved anyone except him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, with his friend Philippe Train (Ryan O'Neal), very easily betrayed the man she wanted for so many years !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end, and some missing human psychology.
