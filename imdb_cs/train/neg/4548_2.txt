Boring. Minimal conspiracy. No character development. I went to this movie with high expectations from the book. It could have been a great movie. It could probably become a cult classic. No, it was a huge flight. It was badly busy and had terrible special effects. It was difficult to identify who the evil people were: insurgents or the army or church, or all of them? I'm still busy with some mini-lands in the movie. I remain astonished as to some aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is never fully explained. It seemed like I was looking at the episode of a small science fiction channel series. It seemed very similar to a movie made for television. She will not see this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
