Where do you start with such a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Did you mention the cast of unsurpassed heroes? Timeless acting? A horrible script? <br /> <br /> You just say that everyone paying the money to see the film as poor as it needs to look at it. I know so. I respect those poor people who have seen it with little or no advance from the magicians like the Empire (usually a bad sign if a random copy is not available for quality mags movies). The cinema should really start thinking about going back if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after he opened up with two other buddies. The only person in the cinema was one kid alone. <br /> <br /> And it was on a cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the advertising campaign failed or the word spread the most out of the country just what it is a smell. <br /> <br /> Since I've been away since the Avengers (1998), I have not felt such a short change since I was watching the movie. If you get a video with a friend within a few months, make sure he pays for the electricity bill for it. Tara Fitzgerald deserves the prize for not training - Keith Allen retains some dignity in the midst of film bloodshed; Barry Foster was to be arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans makes his career not a follower of Notting Hill's success, and only Dani Behr is half good as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> She was in the Word, the audience's expectations of her acting abilities had to be fairly low at first. Production values ​​are not bad due to a clearly limited budget, but this scenario is shameful. If you want to hear a lot of unrepeatable characters, say "Fak!" for a few hours it should be right on your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bargepoles are needed. <br /> <br />
