Very elegant modern (keeps it sensually hip) transforms the story of Dracula (although it remains with traditional customs) with a rather interesting, if not fully captured, back story of the Prince of Darkness. When I tried to watch it for the first time, I could only do it half way before I lost interest. Again, it gets to a good start (especially scenes with thieves and then their encounter with Dracula) but less involved for me when they come across to New Orleans to concentrate on Van Helsing's daughter. Great place to set it, but never used its setting (despite the etching of Paradise in Damnation, where Dracula could blossom). He produced Wes Carven (and they threw it there) but wrote / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically, it had a bit of a dream, but some kinetic adjustments and cheap discharges do not help. The wrong script becomes very stupid. Lussier does a polished job that remains somewhat glassy, ​​puts plenty of blood (make-up is suitably achieved) and lots of "Virgin" ads. No, I do not mean a virgin, it's a music company because it's happening in many shots, and Helsing's daughter is also working there. This was not an obvious planting. Soundtrack is a fun choice of rock melodies. The performances are all over the shop, but there are little known faces (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler, like Dracula, simply did not get out because there was no big presence. He was simply crowned by happy ladies at night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula brides. Just like Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are all right. Christopher Plummer gives up a reversal, while Van Helsing and Omar Epps enjoy their role.
