This film, though not entirely bad, should be filmed where the real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was destroyed by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. The Grand Island is located in the almost treeless, flat Platte River Valley in Hall County. Producers of this film filmed in a tree covering the Ontario hills and moved the whole event to a nonexistent town called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this terrible night just to be forgotten because of a badly filmed movie.
