The first half of this version was the best I've ever seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre he's ever done). The development of Jane's childhood and character was exceptional. Then it was as if someone said, "Uh oh, it's been running too long," and shredding the rest of the story to pieces. The main scenes, if they are included at all, are hidden, combined and eliminated to completely change the story. There was such a small transition or even a scene development that would be difficult for someone who is not familiar with the story even to follow. The great disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and eventually it was exhausted.
