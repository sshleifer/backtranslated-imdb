As an impressive ten-year-old I enjoyed the philosophy of the 1970s "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understand the controversial situation concerning the romantic complications between David Birney and the teacher of the Irish Catholic School (Meredith Baxter) and the two sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents ) who have problems with the marriage conflict of a young couple. <br /> <br /> I look at an exhibition with many years of personal life and I am amazed that this show was for one successful, though, highly rated period. It was created by veteran television writer Bernard Slade, who, several years after the show was canceled, wrote a successful play "The Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own air mass. br /> <br /> There was no denial of real life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in the short-time role of "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here they were trying to breathe life into an exhibition that needed a lot of comics to make the complications more in depth on a very controversial topic. The show was broadcast on Saturday night between two CBS races: "Everybody in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were smart, entertaining, and had plenty of edge (rather the other), which kept my interest in the situation and characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and had only an occasional taste. This was another example of an exhibition that was not really as good as I remembered.
