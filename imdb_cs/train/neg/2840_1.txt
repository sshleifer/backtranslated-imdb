Two old buddies are being sent to Japan to obtain the results of genetic research containing a videotape that they stole black clothing at the beginning of the film. First, you just have to learn some ninja skill, because "only the ninja can defeat the ninja." <br /> <br /> Sakura killers try hard to be a nice ninja-flick, but it fails so badly. The whole movie is so hollow and predictable that it's hard to say something good about it: The same plot was seen in various variations a dozen times before, the characters are too short, the direction is boring and the script offers nothing surprising, even in the final scene, has lowered the value of the film (the basket). Even the 80th fan of ninja-flick-fan, who understands the aesthetics of trash-movies, finds it hard to find this film, and it's hardly pleasant. It just does not offer the audience anything new, not even on a visual level or on a conspiracy. The Shurikens are thrown out and the kata are swinging, but they are not enough to keep the direction of the film they would be, and will repeat similar combat scenes even to the most exciting audiences after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's hard to recommend a movie for everyone. Even the impassive performance of Frank Nero in "Enter the Ninja" lags behind the American ninja Sakura killer. Even on a visual level, the movie has no spheres, and it's a waste of time to try to find some great fighting scenes in this movie: There's none. All one of the most useless ninja-flicks I've ever seen. He does not even care about curiosity. Trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Â½ of 10.
