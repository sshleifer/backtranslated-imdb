What can be said about this disaster? I was looking at it because it was on the cable. I'm sorry I hurled time, but at least I did not lose money. <br /> <br /> Creation is the driest of what you can get! Please, you must be very generous to avoid the CHEAP Halloween costume. Well, there are also signs of terrible effects, f / x and dialogues. Confrontation with creation is incredible, you can not get any pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst you can get from direct video clips. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PHOTOGRAPHY movies look like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid this at any price, please. The only "positive" thing about this garbage is sexy women.
