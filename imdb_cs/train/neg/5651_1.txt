In my life I have seen many great and terrible movies. I'm not expert on expert reviews, but I definitely have something to do with it. First of all, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Their acting is so unrealistic that you even want to release the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors did not care about quality. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing is about these dialog boxes - they're so chilly. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. Your 14-year-old son seems to be able to act better. I feel like this movie has a budget similar to the cost of my 14-year European car ... <br /> <br /> Please if my message gets to you - you will save time and money.
