It's one of those movies that you and a lot of friends sit around drinking beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately, for me, I found myself. My friends and I rented a big block of movies and we never saw him. He was back back, and I thought it was wasted when I did not look at it. That's how I did, and I was amazed at how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> Now I like bad movies quite a bit, and I would probably like it if the "hero" was not so disgusting. I was hoping the whole movie to build that stupid sword and let someone kill! In the film he does very little heroic things. It's a kind, nasty, stupid thing. It is more of a quality redemption than villains. And what about all the naked chickens? I think I like naked chickens just like another guy, but this movie went a bit overboard in this department. Well, anyway, if you like bad movies and can become a disgusting "hero" then I'm sure you will like this movie lock.
