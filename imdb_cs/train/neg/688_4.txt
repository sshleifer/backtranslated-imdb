I've always liked Fred MacMurray, and although her career has been tragically short? I think Carole Lombard is funny. A few of these two major and attractive stars together add top-notch supporting players such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, join them with the noted director Mitchell Leisen and get a bad movie experience. Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet cute" when they visit the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpeter, so he embarked on a musical career that is predicting meteoric both in his rise and fall. As he ascends to a musical star, Maggie neglects to inspire him to start again after he touches the rock bottom. Oh, yes, it's a real Hollywood happy end that is not too soon. Stars and director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this movie is so predictable and slow that it's difficult to watch. The initial scenes in Panama are so expensive that they seem to go on forever, and later the alcoholic Skid simply travels endlessly to New York City. Fred and Carole are trying their best, but the tired scenario and S-L-O-W do not give them a chance. Even the last scene in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment simply does not feel right. This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from the stars MacMurray and Lombard. However, I guarantee that the tracking will take about 48 hours.
