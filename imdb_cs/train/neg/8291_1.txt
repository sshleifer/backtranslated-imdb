An idiot dentist discovers that his wife is unfaithful. So there are no new stories here. The authors, however, managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. If you like watching children when they are vomiting or seeing a dentist who thinks that they pull the teeth of all their women in bloody horror, look for (or rent) a movie. If not, go to something else (My Fair Lady, someone?)
