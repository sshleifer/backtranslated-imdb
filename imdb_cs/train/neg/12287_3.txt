At the end of the eighties, he saw an inexplicable explosion of supernatural horror films that were placed in gloomy prison spaces. Renny Harlin's gorgeous and moody "prison" got the whole scary swinging ball; immediately followed by a significantly inferior "chair", John Saxon's hospitable "Death House," the "Destroyer" passive psychopath, and this furiously impassive exercise in a hopelessly comatose body. <br /> <br /> Your usual bulletproof collection of horribly unsympathetic chowderheads students has led an intolerable, patiently tedious Alex (especially uncomfortable Nicholas Celozzi) to go to Alcatraz Island to explore the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden terrible death of up-and-watching rock star Sammy Mitchell Toni Basil played in clumsy of "Hey Micky" fame). Alex's brother becomes obsessed with the evil demonic spirit of the frantic cannibalistic warlord commander of the American civil war and continues the expected killing, forcing Wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and stand up against this horrible ghost. <br /> <br /> Although slickly photographed by Nicholas von Sternberg, with some decent gore sets and a lot of scary atmosphere (the film was shot in place in the silly, rusty, ruined Alcatraz ruins), "Slaughterhouse Rock" is simply not cut it as a fixed, effective fear. This is to a large extent the result of uniformly unpleasant and insurmountable collegial emerald characters, a heavily scruffy bun, whose unpleasant comic tendencies prove to be more fun than fun. The apartment plays from a distinct cast, the more it is the only "Playboy" friend and an undeniable blonde kitty who has the highest hope, Marie Carlton, who makes Linne Quigley a particularly irritating personification as a token of excessive nympho bimba. In the direction of Dimitri Logothetis, there is a modicum of spectacular visual style, but the tone is unevenly distributed between dizzying gravity and dirty, terribly sophomorous stupidity, and the worst is that Ted Landon's conspicuous, inconsistent, too complicated and ultimately rather confusing scenario furiously fails to develop the necessary internal logic the far-reaching story became even remotely credible. In other words, this glowing fool unfortunately succeeds in making unnecessary 90 minutes, it seems like an extremely exhausting cinematographic prison.
