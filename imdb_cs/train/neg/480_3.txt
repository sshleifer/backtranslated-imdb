2 Stars for Kay Francis - It's Great! And she did not deserve the terrible jerk that Warner Bros. throw the way! <br /> <br /> The two-story assumption that this film is based is extremely absurd and incredible. Kay is a small urban wife and a mother who wants something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor arrives in the city and invites Kay to the hotel to talk about the possibilities, Kay tells his husband to go to the cinema. Hobb≈Øv kid mother gives an error in the noble ear that Kay is not true and he encourages her to look for her. He finds w / actor at the hotel (there are only talk!) And this guy slugs, which falls over the railing, landing face-first into the pond (pond?) A dying. It was here two incredible space on which the rest of the movie based on: <br /> <br /> 1) The judge tells the jury that if it is established that the man died * before * head went into the water, which must find a vintage murder in the first degree. (Whaaaaa ?????? I beat a guy in a fit of rage would count as manslaughter or murder 2 most not first-degree murder. Give me a break! But the fence is required, he was found guilty of the murder of 1 so that it could be sent to prison for life. this is one). <br /> <br /> 2) his lawyer, after conviction and sentence, Kay says that it is all her fault. His reasoning is that if he did not go to the actor room, then her husband should not go after her and give up a guy and kill him. She tells her she's guilty, not her husband, and nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is that Kay is trying to achieve fame and money to get her husband released from prison and really badly made that caused the actor's first kill. <br /> <br /> I can not even continue with this review. The film was too painful. Four years earlier, in pre-code days, you have never captured Kaya playing such a pear! In true fashion, Kay Francis tried to believe that this woman was a credible figure. I give her a lot of appreciation for trying to breathe some life and the credibility of this ungrateful role. This character was far from pre-code Kay role and real life spitfire Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Steer the way clear to this! There are much better cars of Kay Francis out there! (I can greatly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery, Dr. Monica and One Way Passage are also good. I'm sure there are other great Kay movies too, but I just mentioned those you've seen and can recommend.)
