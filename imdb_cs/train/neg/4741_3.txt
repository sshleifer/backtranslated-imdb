Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, powerful plot, but is ruined by cheese details throughout the movie. I'm a younger teenager and I did not like this movie. I thought these effects are terrible, but they may look more fun for younger children. The matrix moves the destroyed action, you know it was totally fake. Then there was Yen Lo, the evil spirit who temporarily had random people and the return home, in which Wendy sought to win. Everything ends up as a typical good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk Shen cousin defeat Yen Lo (and destroy it forever) eventually. So Wendy will learn a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for another DCOM.
