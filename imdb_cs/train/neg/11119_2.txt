Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes work as violinists on a basketball court. Well, that sounds good. It leaves plenty of space for good comedy and a good story. But no such event happened in the many boring minutes of this pathetic film attempt. This film became superfluous, retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. Woody of Cheers, and I look forward to seeing him in this movie. But after I saw his "acting", I came to the conclusion that there should be noisy country hicks who defended themselves. His acting was as boring and poor as the movie. Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez. I like movies with Perez before, but I decided that the reason I was using other jobs in my career was that she was not the main character and she did not have so much talk (To the right age). But now, at White Men Can not Jump, she has become a central figure with many lines, meaning the audience has to cope with her incredibly annoying and whimpering voice. So after seeing this movie (freely used term) and hearing Rosie Perez much more than I appreciate, I can now say I'm a white man and I'm going to jump. . . from a two-story residential building.
