I really do not understand all of these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. Eva Mendez is hot but horrible in this movie. But I do not think it's her own fault, but the directors. He managed to make everything look artificially; their acting, thought, make-up, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is just for the idea behind a movie that was very badly executed. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this bullshit, go to Fellini, Woody Allen, or David Lynch.
