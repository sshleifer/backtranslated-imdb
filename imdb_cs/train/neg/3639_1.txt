This film sucks from the beginning to the end. Probably you will not have worse, acting, acting, shooting, working with the camera etc. It's all bad, very, very bad. But that's what makes him a great watch to give you more than good laughs. Worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really do not have a clue as to what these people were thinking about making this movie. Serious Viking Movie? The story is damn ridiculous, it's more of a hidden comedy, like a mafia, also absurd, but damn fun. And look at the end of the movie ... uhm.
