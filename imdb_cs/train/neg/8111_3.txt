Another great film Costa-Gavras. It is a great presentation of the situation in Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics. Facts may or may not be accurate, but the fact that the United States has deeply engaged in the upheavals and support of Latin American dictatorships. Despite the fact that the spirit of the film follows the typical left / communist propaganda of the Cold War. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always interested. For example, it states that US action is brutal and inhumane and represents the extremist activities of Tupamaros as something positive. As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America to join the US. Europe is full of poor East European prostitutes. I have never heard that poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls bulk prostitutes in most of the Eastern European countries. The US fought for a dirty war, and God blessed us all the monster of Soviet Communism that was defeated. It is unfortunate that the US had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not the idealistic world Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. This whole film follows the corrupt and bankruptcy left-wing ideology of the past and tries to promote it as idealistic and morally correct.
