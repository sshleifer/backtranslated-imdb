Has anyone stopped to realize what movie they produced here? Now let the former naval officer drop into a group of kids in a cadet school so it should be a family comedy? Poorly. It's just a rough comedy directed at teenagers with many bad moments. It could have been extremely silly at this point, but I found a voice of Damon Wayans that irritates conviction. Does he speak like this in real life? If he does, he will have my condolences, but he will not have the money to watch his movies
