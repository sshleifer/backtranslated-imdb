If you call out an absolutely easy, regressive, self-serving, unlawful, anti-civilized juvenilia, then it's an ideal movie. Very poorly scripted, with an often inaudible interview and an enrageing tedious handheld camera, it is a film that presents the world with a simplistic Manichean concept: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are at best insensitive, and predatory monsters in the worst case . The only escape from the horror of civilization as a whole is a lot of primary screams (yawning) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave space in the forest, with a utopia in the form of a rave party - again, in the woods (naturally ...). It shows all the weaknesses of the first movie and lots of others.
