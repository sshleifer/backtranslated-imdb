The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film could not accept the futuristic technological vision of the book. Damn, the total memory was released a few years later, and it did a good job, even the orange watches released in the 1970s made a good effort to create a futuristic world. Infinite German Expressionist Colors, black and white shots from visionary screens, is not the reason for this approach when the film was shot in 1984. The main character is working with a white collar but dressing as if working with oil and grease in the garage. This film decides to accept a false communist approach to setting the design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel does not necessarily dictate the subject of a communist, worship-humble worker. This book has to be seriously adapted in a modern context, as this book is more important today than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of that crap. The soundtrack is uncomfortable, the lack of foresight is annoying, it seems that this film has made it impossible to feel realistic or credible when it's exactly what is necessary to get the novels to the audience.
