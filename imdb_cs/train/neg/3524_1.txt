This is one of the worst cases of a movie I've seen a long time ago. It's terrible that I'm not sure where to start or even when it's worth it. The story is a real problem and I'm sorry that "Sly" has a decent performance. But the conspiracy ... Oh dear, dear. I really like the path near the end, which will manage to climb from the top of the mountain while the helicopter is on its way. Climbing a day or two lasts five minutes! I could continue: but it is not worth it. In addition to a swift opening (which even five years would be able to predict the result), the rest is ugly. I apologize for the people, but it's as bad as the movie happens.
