Störtebeker is really one of the worst television mini-series ever made on this planet. The performance is unbearable and the historical background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it was a big city at the moment, that's the best day he's been through. Secondly, Hamburg would never be a city that would take care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, the largest city at that time was Lübeck. But worse than all this: Direction! How can a dilettante like this guy manage such a movie? Impossible! It was not a credible scene, the fighting was ridiculous and I could not suppress the laughter in most of the rigorous scenarios. I can not understand how a large TV station could be so incompetent.
