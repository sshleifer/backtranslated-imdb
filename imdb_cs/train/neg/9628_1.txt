It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. DVD got me a free order I placed online for non-DVD items. <br /> <br /> No wonder they were taken away, no one could be divided into money for this disgust. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As some reviewers may say they consider it a cheerful beggar of belief, the person who incorporates it in the worst five movies sometimes has a place on. How on earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could join in this waste is incredible. Mostly toilet humor and badly done. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to have fun should avoid it at any cost.
