But after three times I still had no idea what the film was about because there was no real interest or interest in it. But here it goes: Lots too old to be teenage teenage actors dressed in the terrifying second eighties (can we look like that too?) They decided it would be a really good idea to get into a motorboat and go visit an abandoned Alcatraz after one of them the nightmares of people who have been defeated by various frightening ways that have been able to repel POLTERGEIST, POLLUTION and Freddy Kreuger appeared. Dimwit even imagines that he fries through an open fire with some deformed freak that cuts on the doll strips. The good thing was that it was just a dream or it could be injured and good that his dreams had a decent budget for special effects. My guys are pretty pretty: girls, model spaceships, blowing things with bazooka, etc. Once on Alcatraz, they find themselves in Slasher and meet Tony Basil, who can not help but get into some dances, occasionally and with his own lighting crew complete with the smoke machine for the smoke veil in 1980 was inspired by a light look, which I miss). And so it reminded me that Mrs. Basil helped choreograph David Byrne from Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances. This, of course, has nothing to do with this film, but it still appears in the mind because the films represent very little what it really is intended to do. It happens and you can either watch or work on the page tag with it on the TV on the side. But since the movie is not really interesting, you will decide to finish one last thing instead of wasting time, the movie will end and you will find out that you have been thinking about what you missed each time you realize that the credits end up coming back, Dammit ... Some 1980 Teen Horror films can survive such a specialized review: Umberto Lenzi's GHOSTHOUSE, CHOPPING MALL & KILLBOTS, it's hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and over-the-top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind. These are movies that, like you or not, require your attention and usually pay off with some good guy or T & A, and the typos in your work as evidence that you watched the TV instead of the keyboard.

The film is happy with the feeling of 80 minutes - no matter how many minutes and never do anything more than just a distraction sometimes even though I tried to give him a chance but no dice. <br /> <br /> There is some offbeat production design, the use of lighting is noticeable at times, and the occasional blast of chaos probably keeps fans of Teen Horror 1980s interested. The rest warns you: You will be scared if you dressed like in 1987, and the answer is probably more abominable than anything that happens on the screen. Try to watch it as free leases, if possible, so if you are disappointed that you are not stuck with this damn thing: Movies like this will take on a valuable rack space that is today a commodity commodity, what the world is about to conclude & Everything ...
