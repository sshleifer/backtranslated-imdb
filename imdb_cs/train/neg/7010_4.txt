I know nobody cares, but I do it. The film is historical for one reason. This is the unity of two heroes of two great seventy science fiction films. Well, one is great and one is pretty bad. Big is really great, in fact it's the best. Bad is really bad, in fact it's the worst. Of course, it's Star Wars, and it's star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker," who is the hero of this movie about a guy who got his Vette, then went to Vegas (lead) and after many adventures he eventually recovering. (As he tries to repair cars, I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). On the way, she meets golden hearts and ends up facing Kim Milford, the hero of sci-fi cult movie "Laserblast" of the 1970s, which is, as I said before, the worst science fiction film ever he has ever made. Milford plays the dirty leader Hamill has to steal. I realize that nobody cares about meeting two great sci-fi heroes, but I'm doing it. And I also have to say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. Mark Hamill is an actor needs strength, a plot needs extensive training of the Jedi and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts could only be the most annoying character of all time, at all, in every movie I have ever seen. But it's a fun movie that you can watch every weekend or night at night, late at night, very late. It's one of the films that are marching, looking for something without finding them, and at the same time it's a complete purpose, like plain jazz, just to exist as it is. And yes. And what it is is not so great, but you can not say it's not fun, because in an hour and a half you will feel messy but you will not feel cheated. So shut off your mind, relax and enjoy the confused gem without any expectation, and it can always be with you.
