Because of the erotic scene, just to realize it was one of the most amateur and incredible movies I've ever seen. Something like a movie project in high school. What does Rosanna Arquette mean? And what about all the warehouses in the bizarre, supposed Midwest? It's quite hard to get involved. No lessons you learn from it, no brilliant insights, just crazy and rather ridiculous (but lots of skin if it intrigues you) recorded by nonsense ... What was with the bisexual relationship, all the way from all heterosexual encounters. And what was the absurd dance, when everyone played their stereotypical roles? Give this passage, it's like a million extra miles of bad, unnecessary movie, money that could be spent on starving children or AIDS in Africa .....
