Oh, the so-called comic story of low-key Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), the attractive blonde he met just before. After lying to him with his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to say more and more lies to cover his footsteps. I'm sure most of us have witnessed a story like this one at least before ... in the movie or on television. The film is formal and EXTREMELY predictable, with the ending that you can see arriving miles away. <br /> <br /> At least cast gives some interest and keeps it observable. Lee is in the lead and Stiles is a lot of fun in a light comedy role that differs from the very serious roles he usually plays. Becky is a free spirit that seems to change the job as often as other people change their clothes. But you know, this is not exactly well written. At least one question remains unanswered: what exactly is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), a brutal former friend of Becky who is investigating IA? And I did not like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; it's a very unpleasant moron who got nervous so quickly that I begged someone to hit him. Add another debit: a free, uncritical portrait of comedian / actor Larry Miller, once again playing (in this case, he is a little justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister). <br /> <br /> It is not good at all, but as usual, I give three out of ten on the basis of the effort of the cast itself.
