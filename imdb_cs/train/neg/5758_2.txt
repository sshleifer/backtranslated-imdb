One could say that the actors do the film, but it clearly proves that this statement is wrong. Most characters in this movie lack anything that could happen. They play the part of cardboard cuttings that are moving in predictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. It could be summed up in a few words, but if someone were to read, I wanted to see this movie, I have to stick to it. <br /> <br /> I had to move forward where Jack showed us how to become a dirty eater. I have to say that 70% of this film revolves around cooking, eating or preparing for food. Frankly, I'd rather not have to spend time looking at Jack chewing with noisy mouths. Personally, I could do it without references to shoes and jokes that have improved the first half of the movie. Apart from his own personal dementia, the film really lacked something that would cost in time. There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like they were dragging. When something happens, character reactions are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It is best not to look for this.
