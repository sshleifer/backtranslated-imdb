I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, a more objective picture and greater consistency. It's just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any spell or romanticism, it's the same boredom itself. I think actors act relatively weak. O'Donnell may look glamorous like Robin (with Batman), but there's no charm here. Probably, as he ages, he loses his childish spell, but he does not get any spell growing up. Not surprisingly, it has not been proven in many countries and sold in the UK at 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
