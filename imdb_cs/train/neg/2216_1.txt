I'm a lover of B movies, give me a genetically muttered bat and I'm in heaven. These films are good for you to stop thinking about everything that's going on in your world. Even the stupid film B usually laughs and I still consider it a good thing. Then it was Hammerhead, which was so terrible that I had to register with IMDb to warn others. At first, science emerged about how to create a shark that the film hardly touched. To make the audience interested, they made sure that blood was every few minutes. During one assault scene, the camera moved out of the attack, but you saw what a bloodbath is probably throwing the scene to inform you that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what wonderful special effects). When I returned to science, I thought it was very interesting that the test subjects were kept naked and the test devices required them to be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway, this film had a bad conspiracy development, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say I'm totally wrong. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo, or Jeffrey Combs could not save this arsonist.
