We should all congratulate Uwe Bolle. He made it unthinkable. He can be the only director who has two films at the bottom 100 on IMDb! It's like a movie cockroach. No matter how he has few talents, and no matter how bad these films are, he can still produce them. I know he finances himself through some bizarre German fund, yet his ability to continue filming despite absolute and complete failure is one of the great secrets of the universe. it would not be so bad, except that video game developers still give their boys the best qualities. I really liked the Alone in the Dark game series. Even the newest, New Nightmare, was good for a few hours. The adventure of Edward Carnby was a good movie, but that's not the case. Now Uwe Boll got his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Fate? I can only imagine that this guy will have to go through adaptation from the game to the movie unless he stops. Someone has to take off their credit line, or these video game publishers need to understand and realize that when they make a bad film from a game that kills a pass, no one is interested in the title at all. <Br /> <br /> Think about it, it's the House of the Dead or itself in the dark viable game name already? In any case. The new House of the Dead game will be released on the X-Box and nobody cares. The title is dead and all because of Uwe Boll. So if one of you works for a game publisher, or you know a game publisher or you have access to a game publisher ... please warn them. <br /> <br /> This movie has no value in itself. I can not separate what I did not like from the pile of dung. Virtually everything is upset about it. Writing, playing, music, CG effects, editing. I thought if I waited until it came out on DVD and then borrow it with little expectation, I would not be disappointed. Boy, I was wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to launch a large pile of BOLL sh * t.
