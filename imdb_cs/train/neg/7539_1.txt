Where are we going to describe the complex misconduct of Neil LaBute's latest filmmaking attempt? <br /> <br /> There are many kinds of movie fans out there, but by far the most annoying and shallow is Mr. Intriguing. You know Mr. Intriguing, right? <br /> <br /> It is the person who no matter how stupid, lame and incomprehensible the film says: "Sir, I do not know why everyone hates it, it was interesting." It's the man who finds an interest in a dog's veil. Especially when he pulls Hitler's mustache on the top of a pen and march around a house that has argued about the brilliance of science fiction, which has thinly covered references to Greek mythology. He is also the guy for whom the version of Proutka was made. No one else could stand it.
