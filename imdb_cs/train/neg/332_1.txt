I will start by saying that I could not get all the way. I picked him up on a rainy day from WalMart, like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I thought there was no way for my shopping to go shopping. Was I wrong or what? Seriously, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this film over and over again until the end of eternity. That's the only appropriate punishment I can think of releasing something so bad. Shooting reminds me of the films I've used for class projects on a large old VHS cam. The effect is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are several cool portraits. Yeah, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is unhappy and the ship comedian is even more defeated. That's about as much a conspiracy as I understand. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and I give it to many co-workers to watch. Everyone comes back and laughs and says, "Wow, I did not think I'd ever say I turned off Adam Sandler for 15 minutes ..." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well, now you can "<br /> <br />
