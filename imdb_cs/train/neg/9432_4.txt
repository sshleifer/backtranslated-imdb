"Unheded" is a strange little movie, the forgotten slasher of the Golden Age of the genre. It's hard to really write a satisfying review of this movie simply because the movie is so unique. This conspiracy is rather exaggerated - three young women on their way to the rock concert will get in a car crash and eventually get stuck at the mansion of the eccentric old woman and her daughters. The ladies very quickly realize that something is wrong when they hear strange breaths and sounds from the attic. In addition, the mother and daughter seem to have a very special relationship because they are arguing intensely at their dinner for their guests. The old mother even goes so far as to call the daughter of her bitch and the bitch and accuses her of cracking the boys at night to sleep with them. In the middle of the movie, when one girl finally decides she is better off to find help, killing begins. <br /> <br /> When it comes to playing, this movie is at the bottom of the barrel. None of the three intricate girls can act, especially the "girl" leader. It's almost unbelievable that they hear them delivering their lines in the same wood tone throughout the movie. Mother and daughter are better, but not too much. The film is also partly boring and really really pulls. Murders are terrible, but nothing we've seen yet. However, as I mentioned here, the film really gets points with that great disturbing and cruel end. It comes entirely from the left field and has the same value as the shock that ends with the classic camp "Sleepaway Camp". Unfortunately, the rest of the film is boring and suffers from a terrible and boring and boring journey. Isolated, spooky-looking lock and dark pre-illumination give the film a grainy realism, but it is quickly broken when one of the characters tries to act. Maybe it's worth it if you can keep it to the end, but I say you like just a quick handover in the last 10 minutes. 4 of 10
