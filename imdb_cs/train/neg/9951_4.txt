Johnny and Jeremy are vampires. Without teeth, of course. They are dark, bitter beings who have nothing better than to spread their own misery. Through their spell (namely, the sharp tongue and the fat wallet, respectively), they bring desperate souls, which go on to suffer and sacrifice. This is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. It's not a mixture of black humor that I can easily sign up for, partly because it botheres me to imagine an audience, a dirty, main character. But I liked the sound and melody of the fast fire (and supposedly very humorous). I was very impressed by the strong acting cast, especially by David Thelis; only the figure of Jeremy seemed too two-dimensional. Photos and music, both dramatic and dark, work very well. <br /> <br /> What really tells me about "Naked" (and the main reason why I would never recommend to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to represent misogyny as a valid way to bleed someone out. In other words, in a world that is so bad, what is the difference when someone causes pain to girls, is not it? Designing (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not such an awkward person because he is not as harsh in girls as Jeremy, it seems totally absurd to me. Both are terrible, ugly people. And they have a special interest in women always hurting. One might claim that Johnny will eventually get what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly turned straight and kicked him in his ass. But his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior is still treated to some extent as laughter. And I can be mistaken, but I think most people who absolutely love this movie will also find that the aspect of the film is dark comic.
