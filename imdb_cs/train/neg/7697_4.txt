This mini-series is really more fun than some others with much larger budgets and bigger aspirations. The SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. If it was not so long (almost 3 hours), I think kids will be happy. It's adventure, action, "cliff scene", and not too romance or other "icky" things. When you are young, you are not too critical about flexible rubber swords, camping, and repeating scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated in the movie the same way as in the old magazines to get the audience up to speed.) Finally, kids are usually more accepted by the American English Dialogue based on the Asian actor's mouth. (Not to mention that some non-Asian actors play some of the major roles.) I'm going to give this movie three stars, but I felt like a director, the producers and the cast earned some extra credit for at least passing the project. This film is not art, but just like painting your house it actually took some time, effort and discipline to make it happen. Overall, this is not a recommended use for your time, but it could keep babies entertained while traveling in a mini-van. Oh, yeah ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. It seems that the spelling checker thinks that "dialogue" is the right spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, Webster and OED consider it to be an alternative.
