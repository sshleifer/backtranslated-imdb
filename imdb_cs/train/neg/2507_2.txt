It's not a good movie. It's incoherent, all the action acts are bad and have a poor story that you've seen a thousand times better. Not to mention that you see every piece of land that is miles away. Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lonette McKee that he could not sing. But who cares about it is so terribly good looking. But I turn, nothing new. The bottom line, the hot girl group uses the advantage, someone gets into drug addiction, somebody gets involved in somebody, someone gets to hell, and then a terrible thing is going on. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to the music industry. I can not believe so many people that it's a good movie. It seems that many of you want to use a sliding scale when it comes to classifying Black Movies. I do not play it! If you want to support these movies by seeing them - great! If you liked it - super! Everyone owns it. But do not try to tell me it's good. She had pleeee! I ask that colorful people do not engage in such types of films just because they have black actors. Do you want to see a good African-American movie? Look at Love Jones. Beam. Or Color Purple. They were great movies, no matter the actors' color. Why? Because they talked with compelling stories with great acting, it made you feel a little longer after you left the theater. Just because it's our experience, it does not automatically mean it's a good movie. It's good - if it's good. Time.
