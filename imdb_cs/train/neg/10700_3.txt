The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - played by Colin Clive) and his affair with character Amelia Earhart played by Katherine Hepburn. When they met, he was a very devoted husband, but when he encountered a strange but fascinating Hepburn, "he could not help" and they fell in love. You can say this because they look into the universe a lot and speak ENDLESSLY about how painful their uncompromising love is. Frankly, it is a horribly dated and practically impossible movie. Part of the problem lies in the fact that in the days before the code the charming movies of adultery were very common. Moreover, even if you accept this morally suspect subject, the utter confusion of the dialogue sounded like a romantic 19th century novel ... and really bad. Better and with difficult characteristics (after all, wife Clive is a nice lady and not hurt anyone), it causes a great waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this film is the costume that Hepburn wore in the early stage where she is dressed in costume from the mol! You have to see it to believe it - and it looks like one of the Bugaloos (an unclear but appropriate link).
