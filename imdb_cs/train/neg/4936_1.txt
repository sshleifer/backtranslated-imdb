I spent time giving this show a chance. This must be one of the worst new performances. If they award awards for exhibitions that plague THIS, they should sweep the category. The game is bad and the story line is created. Dinosaurs were a little weird, but at least it was fun. This show lasted for three years and eventually it was scratched. This new show, based on the advertising of insurance companies, is not fun and does not really play anything for it. Perhaps the original advertisements and the number of times they have been and are still repeated are what is bad in this show. We just came to TV and we're tired of seeing the caveman.
