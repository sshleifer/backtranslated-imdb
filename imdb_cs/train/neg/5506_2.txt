We went to this film because my husband enjoyed the original version of "My Favorite Martian". We had our 6-year-old daughter with us. She wanted to go halfway to the movie that was cool for both parents! The parts we saw were humorous at times, mostly either too stupid or rough. I would expect that this film will have children from 9 to 12 years of age, if so. It is certainly not suitable for younger children. From what I heard, the original series was much better, and if you're going to "relive the past," you're likely to be disappointed.
