After the success of Part 4, the next sequel was a natural movement. However, they should have stopped her before she started. Alice, who survived part 4, found herself pregnant, and Freddy seems to be using her unborn child to get to his victims, which are, of course, Alice's friends. Strange Nightmare movie, very heavy on religious beliefs and bad acting. Special effects are good, but the film itself is not.
