From birth I grew up in "very Christian" households. I was saved before I saw this film and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a young group in my church. This film was very worrying. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares for years. I used to lie in bed and listen to the sounds of my steps on the floor. If I did not hear her steps, I would like to get up to make sure it was not torn. I prayed so hard every night that I should be saved because I was frightened of forgetting Jesus. This is definitely not something I will show my children until they are much older, if at all. It took me years before I shook the fear that this film gave me.
