Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia, who has been in the mental shelter for more than ten years after he was found, and he wondered how the back paths were on his hands. Doctors want to test an experimental new drug that will return its lost memories if it works. But when daughters give him hallucinations, he decides to escape instead. While outside, he meets a young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) treats poorly with his mother, he does not leave her near a dark chamber in her basement and generally suspects. <br /> <br /> While the general 'secret' movie is easy to identify before it is revealed, I find that Mr. Diamond's acting is fascinating enough to keep my whole attention. (For the sake of total revelation, I was a huge fan of his murder and his short, but crucial role in The Shield, to Journeyman & Dollhouse). It's not a great movie, not a good one, but pretty good to use. Although I liked it better than the previous movies I saw from director / writer Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquita) Eye Candy: One Flea Breast in Hallucination <br /> My Grade: C -
