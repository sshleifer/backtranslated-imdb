Despite being regrettably considered intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately, this film is mercifully fast. The scenario makes no sense, the whole idea of ​​a sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely fragile, and John Lydon shows us that in the space of one film one must never leave the music. Its performance is unambiguous and irritating. The only positive thing that has to be said is that Harvey Keitel can make a good turn. His later bad lieutenant would show how good actors can play, but his performance is merciful.
