Kirstie Alley, looks a bit slimmer, but just a little, he's in this mess with the man MacGuyver looks like, bleached blond hair and everything. The premise of the film is an elderly woman (50!) Who can not get her screenplay made for age discrimination, so she sends her younger nephew to act as a writer. This is not an original idea, not a very good film with dirty talk, an uncomfortable interview, and a ridiculous plot. There is another conspiracy about the writer with the mood or admiration of Kirstie's character and why this is part of the mystery. The actor who portrays Kirstie's brother is so wooden and dirty, it was tortuous to watch their scenes. What I'm saying about this movie. Avoid it.
