urgh! 3 things the movie needs: good script, good plot and good casting. I watched a movie that he was expecting to be jolly horrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just terrible. I lost the will to live halfway. The only thing that stopped me from touching my fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason I watched her first). She has done a good job like Rastus, and her look has not changed much since then. It was a fantastic first effort in the movie. the dog was also very good. they both had a great job with such a terrible material. Sandra Bernhard, I think, is the biggest mistake of the movie. she was totally miscast, and I do not think she ever got enough of a character. I give the film 2 out of 10 - and that's just because of Rose.
