The movie starts fine. A widow with a new girlfriend and children. The film is filled with the dire decisions of the director. Like "allows to separate." "I'm going down ..." what to do? Silly stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time by hoping it will be better .............. Hardly.
