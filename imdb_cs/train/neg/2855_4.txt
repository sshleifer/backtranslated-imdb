"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy", no matter what you want to call it ... simply does not hit the mark. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just do not like gangster comedy (as I thought Oscar, Johney Dangerous and Mafia also sucking) It's probably more "funny sharp verb" than everyone out of Comedy, but its not as funny and sharp as it or other reviewers) Do it. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start making it running gag was sometimes painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change in location or perception for the time they were supposed to be. Most of the film was either in the "Dreyfus Club" or in a number of offices and rooms. .. (what was the fact that the Sit down Gun break out of the Goldblum still winning?) The support of the cast was ... on excellent paper (great to see Silva and Drago) but the characters were killed before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a joke! Romance and the love of film have also flooded her. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll be back soon.
