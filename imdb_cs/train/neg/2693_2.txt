<br /> <br /> Although the actress is STRIKE beautiful, the plot has little chance of admission, because too many disturbing details face viewers in developing the story. <br /> <br /> One can believe that middle-aged girls in the middle and three-year-old school class in the 1950s simply gave up their virginity without thinking about marriage to 30-year-olds who barely know but I doubt it. Someone may believe that the young high school teens are very confident and self-confident because they communicate with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience only then felt very uncomfortable at the time, and was awkward when experimenting in the adult world. One may believe that an experienced physician would not know the sharp stroptomycin - the stinking fermentation of the byproduct of the busy land microbes - and did not find that some unmanageable boring powder is false, but I think not. <br /> <br /> One can believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter and hang around in a public school schoolroom during a schoolmate and make trouble, but I think school companies are traditionally protected environments and parents, chaparones and school staff would be about to prevent it. <br /> <br /> One final thread, after Hey Babu Riba, five teenage friends referred to themselves as four. There is probably an explanation of why Five of them were FOURsome, but because it has never been described in detail, each link goes to each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie did not mean the truth.
