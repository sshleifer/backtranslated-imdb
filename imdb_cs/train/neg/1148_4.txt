Pedantic, oversized production attempting to record the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is quite promising, with an ongoing explosion test, but the melodrama with James Stewart and his wife, Vera Miles, is just getting into the way (Miles had the habit of playing lukewarm women under pressure, and her broken nerves came directly to the plan). Dear director Mervyn LeRoy has helped this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite being a talent, this picture does not impress. Murray Hamilton's best performance will be Stewart's partner, but most of the dialogue is ridiculous and violent stimulation causes the movie to look twice as long as it is. * 1/2 from ****
