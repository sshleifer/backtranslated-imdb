In my time, I have seen many horrors, everything absurdly wrong, but no one has reached the depth into which this piece of waste is being reduced. This movie made me uneasy and disturbed when I watched him as I tried to wrap my head around what the film was about. Now, as I saw it, I understand - somehow - what's going on and why, but the movie itself is too muddled to be nice when you watch it. Yes, there are usual scenarios of terrible violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters ("Highways belong to me ... ME!") And enough nudity enough to distract us from the "fence" who feels alone and uses as a puppy he no longer wants, and stays in the box on the side of the road. Blech.
