the movie was somewhat true. I recall the story reported 15 to 20 years ago that 4 fishermen found the body in the water and decided not to report it until their journey was over. I also recall that they are accused of interfering with the dead (or some such charge). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside of Australia must think that we live in a country full of violent and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film encourage this perception. The movie itself reminded me of the Simple Plan. But as for one of the best Australian films at all, as someone has said, I can not be so generous. Put it this way, I would not bother to watch it again.
