This movie is a complete shit! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it's tiny and incoherent. I'm proud to install 70-year-old depths of everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like shock, but I need a coherent story. However, if you look at a horse, a friend gets you, the movie is for you. The saddest part was this chubby werewolf with a functional wang. I think it's just hard to sit down, not to mention that acting is terrible and the soundtrack is wrong. Please know that the packaging is interesting (what looks like the gorilla hands that reach a bare bare butt) but do not waste time or money because you will not get back.
