I thought it was a great idea, but, boy, it was badly executed. We get a broad sense of how complicated and challenging are the behind-the-scenes operations of the show, but practically no specifics of what works. Producers seem to have found no way to tell the story or give the audience a "passage." (They do not say they did not try but have scenarios related to the ring description of Ring because the narrative of the program does not say that it physically mounts the opera.) We see that there are a lot of things but about that what people do, and why, they say little. There is little sense of who is who, or how different production departments work together and work together. For example, we hear a number of times about a problem - so we expect the problem to come to a close and its consequences and / or how it will be solved. Instead, filmmakers generally just cut on something else (generally quite generic shots of people pushing things or talking in headphones.) Overall, the movie eventually felt more like a picture trap that you would see running under the show's final credits, rather than something , worth watching for your own merits.
