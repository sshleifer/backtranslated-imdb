I see lots of movies. The original war saw years ago and they loved it. Computers, for which most of us are still "a great secret," and the film was convincing in its own way. This time, however, the budget looks like a low budget on Wednesday evening special. Total crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Give it so weak, you will not believe it until you see the movie (which I would prefer to recommend). I can not point to an actor who really did a good job in this movie. But hey, with this script I would be surprised if someone could do a good job. Lots of scenes clich√©s. The CGI appears to be removed from the '86. <br /> <br /> "No, I'm in a bad mood, I'm just writing about this. Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is shorter than losing it to watching dirty movies.
