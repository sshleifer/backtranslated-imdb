From my first album I was a fan. This film is a bad service for him. The performance, except for one of Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, is just horrible. <br /> <br /> Those Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were especially annoying. Even sister McGarrigle was destroyed by the so-called harmony of Martha Wainwright. I have never seen my husband stand up and went out of the room on the movie before and I found myself quickly passing on the performances got into several segments of interviews that were also difficult to monitor due to poor camera work. <br /> <br /> There are many people who have been able to interpret songs by Cohen, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson. terribly. Hopefully, there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen on a film that will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
