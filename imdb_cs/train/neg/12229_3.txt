This movie started well, I felt I was watching the adult version of Seinfeld. I quickly began to question the situation and the behavior of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing. All the actress was great, but only a few scenes had short moments where they were really fun. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this film to casting agents. Watch the first scenes and then find something better, otherwise you will find yourself in this mess completely lost. I found it in a bucket in a video store. It cost me two dollars and because of the exhaustion of this movie I feel it was a good price.
