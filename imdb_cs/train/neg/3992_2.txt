Director Spike Lee is known for showing films as racism. In many movies, like "Do the Right Thing", most white people are brutal racists. In this film, the topic of interracial marriage is an issue, and racism is the whole thing again. What Lee does, however, is again demonstrated by his bigot against Christianity. These are the wonderful double standards that exist in the world of film. If Lee or someone else created such a kind of bias against another group, would he be dishonored, but Christians? Hey, it's an "open season" on them. Ossie Davis, reverend in this film, shoots his son and then gives the smoldering weapon to the top of his Bible. They increase it to a more detailed situation if you have missed it. Hey, people, here's another Bible reader and look how it is! Lee does such things in almost every movie he does. It shows the same hatred for dealing with racial relations. Who could argue by displaying racism as evil? However, Lee keeps it in this movie, as well as in her other films. His apparent bitterness toward white people does not help the situation. It brings only fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: Start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, it's "overcome it." This is too bad, because the subject could cause movies that would trigger thoughts if done with objectivity and intelligence.
