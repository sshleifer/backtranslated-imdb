Because of all his visual pleasure, the renaissance would be much better in live action. Animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, just like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, perhaps the world of the film would not be so lifeless. There is a lot of admiration here, but in the end I found out that all I could do was admire. I did not like the film and explained something I had not seen before: visual elements can be a positive aspect of a movie, but without a good story and strong characters, it can not be anything. I will not go so far as to say that this film is useless but sometimes it is dangerously close. I love Dark Sci-Fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies I thought were great. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain, and Dark City had his thought provocative story. The Renaissance has shadow and light, but nothing else. I wish I liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters made it worthwhile. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic explosion of colors and life. How ironic is that one of the deepest and most important films I've seen this year is becoming of the Renaissance.
