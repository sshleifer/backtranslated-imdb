If I checked IMDb BEFORE borrowing this DVD from Netflix, I should have a few hours of my life back. I'm sincerely suspicious when I see the director of the film. In this case, according to credits, the same guy was the "writer and director" - unfortunately, the label of the overall quality of this production. Several interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenu's scene resembled her early comedy routines claiming Judyism), which led me to evaluate these two stars rather than one. But these moments were little and far ... and I could hardly see them because the initial sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention the forced punishment. I admit that I came back to watch this part again to find out if I miss something that would help me find out when I saw the whole thing. No, although I at least realized who the characters were, who would prove to be important later. The "spinning camera" technique has been exaggerated and essentially unnecessary. I found out I was talking to the TV screen, "What ?!" or "For God's sake, get it!" Not recommended.
