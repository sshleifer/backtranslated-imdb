I do not understand why so many people praised this show. Double peaks are one of the most difficult titles I've ever seen in my life. Now I've seen all the episodes of season 1 and saw season 2 episode 1. I just can not miss this show. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the right involvement in a criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In Season 1, there was a scene that Agent Cooper threw on the bottle stones. Can you guess why he did it? He just wants to identify the killer by doing this "joke", mentioning the supernormal abilities of the Tibetan dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, season 2 began with a "funny" scene that a silly old man is giving Agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper puts himself on the floor. (He's got a gun in his stomach already.) This old man will not do anything except when he says some silly notes. That is all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 seconds .... It's like hell.) I would read some comic books rather than see this show.
