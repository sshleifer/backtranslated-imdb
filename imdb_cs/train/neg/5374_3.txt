CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most exaggerated, overlapping, everything I've ever seen I came out of France. There is nothing worse than French production trying to break out of Hollywood and Czech films is a perfect example of such horror / action / friend. I almost halted halfway because I knew it would mean nothing more than the French boys trying to find out. The movie starts promising, like an expansive horror movie, but it quickly moves genres, from horror to action to x-files of the type to pick friends, that ultimately CR is everything and also nothing. It's so clich√© that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and those quiet pauses, fading and disappearing at the right moment of interpretation, made me groan. I thought only movies made in Hollywood use this exhausted technique. Chase's scene with Vincent Caselle running the murderer is so exaggerated and exaggerated that it's almost a thing of beauty. The climax at the top of the mountain, with a stupid revelation about the murderers with Caselle and Reno, played by "comrades" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, derailed completely how little the credibility of the movie has so far. It's hard to believe that director CRIMSON RIVERS has also run GOTHIKA, who, although having his share of the problems, has not even even attracted the horror of this overwhelmed, confused film.
