that's the worst movie I've ever seen. I am not joking. next time I come, I'll keep running my head in the wall. I would be better off if I was on alert and trying to explain to my doctors why my brain is swollen before they try to go through this movie again. I hope the black and stylist will never work together this project again badly. they are both good comedians, so I was shocked that it was so unpleasant. If they had to do it again and again, I'm sure they will not do it. the people who faced the money had to lose their tone. not really - because the special effects (all 2) were terrible.
