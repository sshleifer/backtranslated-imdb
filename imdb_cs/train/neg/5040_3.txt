I have read the comment that it is the best Chinese film ever. Perhaps if the only Chinese movies you saw did not contain any dialogue, lengthy looks and silence and hacking, then you are in place. A complicated story? Hardly. Try juveniles and amateurs. Great moods and exciting memories? Hardly. Try flat boring and trite. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I could not wait for it to end. Especially when the best lines in the film are "How are you? I'm fine, are you sure?" Wow! What depth of character. I think continuous cigarette smoking should talk to them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed. Even Zhang's sentimentally poor "Journey Home" was better than this.
