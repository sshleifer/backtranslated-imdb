This is a depressively shallow, naive, and mostly unhappy, look at the unlikely relationship between Brook's psychotic film editor and Harold, his failing girlfriend. They both have ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold is unable to do anything but look nice at this stage of his career; but also because Brooks' character is neither interesting nor pleasant. There are 15 static, unbearable minutes at the start, where Brooks, when he has just split up with Harold, finds his apartment in a depressing, exhausted state - unbearable. Sappily and unimaginatively booked Joe Cocker's "You're so beautiful," just there's not enough material for a feature film. At the periphery of their relationship, almost nothing happens to show that these people exist in the real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention is to experience the white hot light on the affair and somehow deconstruct it; but if you do that writing and playing must be much better than what's here.
