I was delighted to see this movie soon and I must say that I thought it would be boring and I wonder how they could ever improve on the 1984 Bachelor Party version of Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good ... I was right ... In all honesty I thought it might have been better ... Surely there were some funny moments but it just did not seem like I was a marker ... The acting was fine and the story is pretty good at watching the original, but I think it could be much better ... This movie would say it's for the teens and the young heart; full of flesh, alcohol, and sex ... It's just another typical filmmaking that's done over and over again. 4/10 is my voice for this.
