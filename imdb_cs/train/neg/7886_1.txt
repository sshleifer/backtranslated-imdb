I have nothing against religious films. Religious people need something to watch on Saturday night, I think. But what really removes me is when writing to a DVD box does not tell this to a potential audience. Propagation of religious propaganda as entertainment NONE, bro. <br /> <br /> And even if I was a religious person, I would have to agree with most other posters, this movie was a mess. Badly controlled, poorly spoken, poorly tuned, and the soundtrack attempt was cheerful. The fake accents were horrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and the continuity was out. The only reason we lost our time through this chill was that it was too late to look at another film instead. You should go to sleep. Absolutely no redemption of the quality of this film unless you are a religious type who immediately approves anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers, even though it is a pile of garbage. If that's not the case, avoid it at all costs. Do not be fooled when writing into the box.
