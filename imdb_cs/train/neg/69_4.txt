I thought it was a very clumsy, inconsistent version of the famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles and gave their character a character; but the whole thing was forced and mechanical. Beginning could have been much more involved; probably starting with a shootout and then blinking back to find out how they got there or something. And I felt that every scene is normally predictable and labeled as a very bad TV soap. I was looking forward to this film and I was hoping for something better. The only thing I can say is to beat Mick Jagger, but not much.
