One scene demonstrates the mentality of "Terminator women" quite well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villains camp. Karen walks through the armed guards at her gun, but after a few seconds she throws her away and calls her to fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, lifts his gun and escapes! And then again, when the film is directed by a warrior and written / made by another member of his family, you know you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble will get some fun in the beginning, and the movie could be better off if they were more focused on their relationship of love and hatred. But after about 20 minutes, the film will slow down, and even with an occasional battle scene to revive things, it lacks excitement. The finals have Trimble fighting Qissi inside the cave and Sheperd goes womano-a-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on the speedboat, but the matches are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and reduces their value. On the positive side, kudos to the clothes department, Karen has the opportunity to show a spectacular fission throughout the movie! (* 1/2)
