This movie is so terrible that it will cause the angels to lose their wings. Shaq tried to do another crossover effort, like his work in Shaq-Fu for NES and his countless unbearable rap albums, and later, the epic work of scary filmmaking that is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about the movie. I've seen it a lot of time when I was very young, but I had to be an idiot because this movie has everything that's good about movies and tears apart. This is funny. I saw it on the Disney Channel a moment back and spent a few minutes doing it. Although, as soon as it becomes excited, you will still be overwhelmed by its horror. If you see it on TV, try to: Consider looking at the movie, removing all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magic powers. If you do, it will be like a film about a pedophile who is chasing a child and a rapist to pick him up. This is quite fun and disturbing. A terrible example of the film. Do not use if you do not want to mock, check out this movie.
