My teacher recorded it and showed it to us in the care of children to show how teen pregnancy affects people. It has just shown how teen pregnancy affects a child's jocker who is not properly educated about how sex and a girl works, an unfamiliar girl who throws fruit when she is angry and can not say she is wrong with a man even though she was wearing a sign, that he is such. I would not have been surprised if the father of the child had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the screenplay. Mother Stacy (baby wearer) is a turmoil. She does not forget the fact that her daughter is four years old and is seemingly unshaven when people hide her through her window in the dining room. Bobby's (the father) best friend's name is Dewey, and it's obvious to bend the character of Sean Penn in the Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is terrible, simply because none of the characters is credible. Thank God, it's just for television, which limits the chances of the public viewing.
