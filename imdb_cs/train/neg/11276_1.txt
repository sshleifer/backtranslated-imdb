I do not waste time when I wrote a lot more about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. This has already been done in great detail, many times. "The plot" started out as a very steady cock-wide boy / gangster all over the hole and very quickly descended into utter shambles. Anyone who pretends to see some hidden masterpiece within this terrible mess is just joking. It's been seven or eight years since I watched him in the cinema before he was dragged out, but it still feels like the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm just making these comments and really the only reason I should watch the movie is because of the funny fact that my brother Eddie appeared as the second "heavy" in the pub. It was his hand that made Zippo fasten against Rhys Ifan's face in a bar in 'Russia' (actually it was filmed in the former Butlins holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he recently joined the agency and it was his first part. When I saw the movie, it seemed that no one in it required any acting experience. I remember there were about 8 people in the cinema - and it was just days after they were released. I have never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and disappeared so quickly - and right. If you were thinking about borrowing this movie on DVD, I would advise you to put your two pound coins in the fire until they are hot and then put them in the eye towers. This will probably be far less painful than watching the movie.
