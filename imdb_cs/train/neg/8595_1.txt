Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both great actors who will certainly be able to face any challenge they have been given. Unfortunately, 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers only one audience and audience: (2007) is trying very hard to be funny, but comedy is forced, extremely poorly managed and very poorly managed and pointless story. for a third of the film, nothing that even the most humiliating audiences, such as friends and relatives of the directors, could even capture, not to mention how it really is. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone who liked it pretended or had to falsify it, as Neila's former girlfriend did when she showed her an old black and white movie they would not have to worry about. "Detective Tracking (2007)" is far from category B, falls somewhere between Q & R, such as "Questions?" and - Repeat questions! The director knows what he's doing! If his goal was to defeat the audience, he did a very good job! "Watching Detectives (2007)" was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur Please do not let it be a waste of time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
