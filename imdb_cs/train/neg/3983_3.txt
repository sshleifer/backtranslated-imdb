Irene Dunne completed her famous career in this so-so movie. She should come out with bang because she was an actress, and that's not in this unforgettable, almost unknown film. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half is much better, because in the second half it is quite stupid. Perhaps Irene saw the manuscript on the wall and left. Even her tall voice was a bit poisoned. She is said she was not happy with this movie. I see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of the TV sitcom in the 1950s. I talked about the fact that David Nelson from the TV show Ozzie & Harriet was in this movie, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded just like Nelson. Overall - so at best and under-par for a great actress.
