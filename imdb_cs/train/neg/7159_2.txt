I thought I'd never find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Texas Massacre on Chains," but this movie competes with him. I'm not a man who falls asleep watching the movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance started. I woke up and started watching him. Why did I deserve it? The whole movie was agonizing, I had to use it quickly to watch it. I can not stand why one of my favorite actors of all time (Mr WALKEN) could do this thing. I have to think that he has done a favor to the director, or he was really in need of money, because the film after the movie he is doing is ruining; and so fast ... What about the movie? it's not ghostly, stupid plot, the characters are horrible (but I really liked the guy who played Jared Harris), the effects are very weak, lack of death and blood, etc; He has something in three words. And I think so. It is impossible to endure how the director can make such a film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I was more disappointed, it was when I saw on the cover that the movie was introduced to "Stephen King", I think he could never imagine the bullshits, right? (I rented it in Argentina). I do not answer for a million years. <br /> <br /> I'm evaluating this movie with two of 10. (As I say in my article "Returning back to the Texas massacre", it will always be worse movies, that's why it does not deserve 1 in 10)
