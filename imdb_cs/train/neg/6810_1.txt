To be honest, I did not like the "Executive Decision" - which is an obvious template - very, but compared to this bite it seems like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> People who move in the movie (the term actors would be an insult to all the other actors) should participate in more actor classes, the guy who built the building did not even see the plane from afar. It's so ridiculous that the 747 is only 3, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicity (for example, use the sleeping gas, then do not use it, then use it), which eventually dropped the rating. <br /> <br /> You can enjoy more moving the drawer or drilling holes in the knees and filling with milk.
