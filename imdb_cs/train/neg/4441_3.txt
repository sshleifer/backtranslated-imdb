The "triumph of love" is proof that not every Comédie-Française who uses crossed masked tendencies like Shakespeare is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, the Commedia Dell Arte-inspired playwright, about which Brittannica says: "His gentle feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino has fun hanging out with three mixed romances, her trousers were not even Cherubino in the "Marriage of Figaro." <br /> <br /> Herky-edgy editing is unpleasant and seems to indicate that many shots are needed for each long speech. <br /> <br /> Best was Fiona Shaw as a spinster as well as costumes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Originally Written May 29, 2002)
