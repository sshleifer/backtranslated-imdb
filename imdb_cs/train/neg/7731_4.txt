Comparison is perhaps unjust but inevitable. Those who attract the intimacy and depth of the umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover in American style a musical cutout - a fearless and foolish dialogue with an inexplicable number of songs and dances. Genetic accent Gene Kelly was apparently so poor that it was replaced by horrible dabing work (as you recall, the dabing was almost completely pulled up in Umbrellas). The French translation (also for the title version) leaves something that would be desirable, although it can not be attributed to Demy. The film also includes several self-confident moments that come out of excitement, such as Links in Songs for LeGrand itself. And costumes - well, a combination of tight pants / white caps and unusually unnatural colors resemble the Austin Powers movie. . . <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer with umbrellas; note, for example, a suitcase carried by Maxence when he left Rochefort - the same suitcase carried by Guy when he left Cherbourg. Also note "Comfortable Brunette Differentiation" - Madeleine in Umbrellas and Josette in Young Girls. Generally speaking, those who expect a natural sense of umbrellas (except for a floating scene on a bicycle) or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous ends, as in Umbrella's script, would probably have to hand over. Those looking for the French version of the thin American musical will be quite happy.
