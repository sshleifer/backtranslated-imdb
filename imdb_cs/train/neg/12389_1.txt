Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) brutally raped the teacher (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is forced to court, but he is completely free. He then raped Kathy! <br /> <br /> Inappropriate and sick rape film. This film was promoted as an important drama dealing with rape. What it is is a badly written and (for the most part) badly run drama. It expresses the attraction to the victim of rape, but it strikes the scene in our face. To be absolutely honest, it's about the fact that Hemingway's acting is so bad that he will lose any real impact he might have. The test scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie was too far when 15-year-old Mariel was raped (fortunately it was not shown). I admit that it led to the big end when Margaux grabs the gun and shoots Sarandon dead. But seriously - having a young girl raped is just rebellious. Effects do not help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was definitely a beautiful woman (and the real model I believe about), but her acting was much left desirable. Reduce the movie. Mariel was fine, but that was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. It was not a bad thing, but a terrible scenario was working against him. I remember hearing that in 1976, some women stood up and raged when Sarandon was killed, so maybe it works for some people. I found it boring, simplifying, and really sick. And 1 all the way.
