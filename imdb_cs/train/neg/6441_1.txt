When I looked at this Wrestlemania Match Card, I was so overwhelming and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. It starts ... and it ends. <br /> <br /> I sit there, angrily at hell, because I wanted my money back. I mean by looking at Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that goes down as a classic and then you expect the same thing and you get the average amount of garbage they have ever. The only moment in the show that destroyed me was when the HBK pulled out !!!! The moment when HBK loses to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Price is such a loser / poser. He almost destroyed Wrestlemania 22 when he beat TRIPLE H! I could not look at WWE when I saw Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch it again (fortunately). Again I had faith in the WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I've ever seen), which was pure classical Wrestlemania. Surely it did for Mania 23 and gave us a lot of unforgettable moments. <br /> <br /> If you've been watching any of Wrestlemanias like those that get you up to the fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), please do not do it and make the same mistake I made and left WWE . And if you look at it and get angry, start watching and watching Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
