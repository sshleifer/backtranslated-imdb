As a historical matrix who is particularly interested in this historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. Costumes and productions were completely authentic, but the Hollywood portrayal of this "British Little Big Horn" was really boring. A number of film footage dedicated to marching or fine soldiers should be unprecedented in the film of history. Eveytime I heard triumphant background music, I knew I had to prepare myself for the next strenuous scene of an absurd filler. Of course, the producers invested heavily in the "production" and were determined to raise money. Despite their excellent cast, their dialogue was once again boring and their characters never developed. Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished the scene, I would be disappointed. Their lines were so weak and insignificant that I barely believed they were two great actors who portrayed Lawrence of Arabia and Bird Man from Alcatraz. There are worse epics, but this is not much better.
