Seriously, what band is singing about a crazy car? So what if it's their ten It's too immature to sing a little child to "be my women" seriously! Is that a nice name too, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants ??? HOW CREATIVE. I do not know why they need a TV show. I mean, most artists do not really need a television show about themselves, especially a group of naked brothers. Shit, how many of them are in a horrible group. And seriously what about movies? Is Jeez Nick used to become the bridge of those years that grew up, but really Crazy Band? So many parents would not allow their children to watch the band naked brother, her silly, non-staging show, which should not be televised.
