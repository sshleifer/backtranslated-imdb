To overcome his wife's death, he does an old man naturally made by someone in his position (at least in Peter Greenaway's film): he and his son settle their home eight and a half (no one's legs) of women and embark on a sexual odysey. It's a Greenaway movie, there are plenty of tricky and uninteresting muddles, and of course, there's no need for male nudity. In fact, the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude. Coarse. Besides, who wants to see the old man completely up front? For those who are not on the homoerotic scene, one of the women likes to make an unpleasant horses. There is no story - just a random collection of boring scenes.
