Although nothing can be compared with vampires Vs. Zombie ... in any sphere of the movie I will try to judge this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breathtaking. When the explosion was on the TV screen, I thought my whole house exploded, and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the shells landed on the floor next to me. I just amazed my friends. But the scene where the sound of Jack Black sounds the worst monologue I've ever heard I almost killed but do not worry because it got a fire movie can go through its terrible action off to "I have to be tall." Seriously, he had to watch closely how he was babbling about disagreeable thoughts that had absolutely no sense, and added that he had to be "tall" to justify his terrible behavior. Well, if you can say that in order to justify horrible behavior, then if you talk to writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you will probably have the same answer ... seriously. With the production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked that I did not mark a broken shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after the terrible justification that the film was shot. If you want to see this movie then you should be assassinated <br /> <br /> Your true <br /> <br /> General
