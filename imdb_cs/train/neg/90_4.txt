: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in Love still happy. I waited for a really long time to see it, and finally I got a chance to reappear on Hallmark on Thursday night. I love the first three movies "Love", but this was nothing like I thought it would be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, it was a way to get into a lot of goofs and the editing was very bad - to many scenes out of context. I also think Kathy's baby's death soon happened, and Clarks does not seem to be in the movie. It seemed that none of the actors really wanted to be there - they did not have any emotions. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie. I think writers should have a book more. It seems that every film that he has done so far is just slipping further and further from Janetko Oke's writings. I mean in the movie that they never mentioned the debt, and that two guys or Clark get hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies' reaction to Kathy's death could have turned out and heard rather than just heard. Of the four films I've been doing so far, I have to say that Love remains joy is my favorite. I hope that with four other films that will follow another book, and if Clark's character is in them, I hope he has a bigger part and I hope his part will not be so kind. I also hope that there is more Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty, but who knows what writers will plan on next.
