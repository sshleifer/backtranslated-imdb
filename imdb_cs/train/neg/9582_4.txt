This massive piece of fecal matter combines so many absurd scenarios that ultimately it is a sad revolt of absolute joy. This is very bad because the premise is promising (as is often the case in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this screenwriter it is reflected in la la la country. <br /> <br/> Lowe is in jail and serves the DUI time that killed his mistress. We see that he has nightmares just to know that he feels really bad. Then he is in the neighborhood of a cell colleague. Or he? Lowe has some suspicion, but he's fast falling. His suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to do. So why did they set him up to be killed? Oh, this could be interesting. This is where he falls from the rails, and one of the tracks decides he can get away with the insult of the spectators' attention for the next fall hour. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* ****************************** <br /> <br /> I will not be bored with the endless rewriting of the irrationality of what follows, but think about this end. Lowe was imprisoned by burglary on the train. They want to have the tape he has, because the tape crushes the boss and you. So three cops, weapons drawn, ready to rescue Lowe, will arrive on the train. Criminals kill policemen in front of half the passengers and then ... continue to persecute Lowe to get a tape. HI!!!! killing three police officers in public will take you to a deep doodo, to hell with tape. Still, they go through a shopping mall that flies into place, as if the public does not exist as a witness and is finally caught by Lowe and the guy still wants a tape !!!
