Twenty years ago, five-year-old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed that his father had killed a mother with an ax on an empty road and committed suicide later. Currently, Michael (Gordon Currie) is inviting his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and her best friends, Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser) Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country with his grandparents in his farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would be their most intimidating fear. Together with his Indian boyfriend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an old Indian celebration using a carved wooden manikin Morty (Jon Fedele) to eliminate their fears forever. The biggest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns to his father and kills his friends. "Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and unnecessary slash movie that uses an interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear before every friend before it grows, but in a cluttered, cluttered scenario. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs Betsy Palmer; others are very weak, but in general, acting is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation of why the dummy is brought to life; furthermore, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sadness when each of them dies. The low speed for more than fifty minutes could be used to build a better dramatic situation. At the very end, Michael shows the charm that his father was interested in not noticing. I do not know if the previous reference was edited in a DVD released in Brazil with a run time of 87 minutes. Special effects are very good for film B. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
