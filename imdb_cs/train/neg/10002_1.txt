I'm sorry to all, I know it's supposed to be an "artistic" movie, but wow, they should give out the projectile weapons so people can blow their brains out and not watch. Although the scenic design and the photographic direction were excellent, this story is too painful. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. The shot was too long. How long can you watch two people sitting and talking there? Especially when it comes to two people who complain. I really had difficulty just going through this movie. The performances were great, but how much of that dark, dark, non-injecting material can you take? All I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise it was Bergman's riff. And I'm not his fan. I think anyone who says they like them for 1 1/2 hours is "good, lying.
