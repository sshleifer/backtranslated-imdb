I loved "Anchorman, the Legend of Rhone of Burgundy" and hoped it would be just as funny, but unfortunately, it was not. However, some bits are excellent. I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, declared his love for Ron Burgundy in a car filled with other members of the intelligence team, was cheerful. They all ignore it and only grow louder and louder and eventually kisses Burgundy, which is not even recognized. Overall, however, this story is not gel. It's a noble attempt to save unused bits from the first film, including the whole conspiracy about some good benign domestic terrorists called "Alarm". Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has some funny lines, but basically this unused line of plot has a good reason why it's not used in the first movie. The extras on this disc are quite good, the best two are filmed exams featuring a lot of improvised comedy and a faux commentary with Will Ferrell and "producer" that Ferrell finds out soon, was not part of the film in any way, shape or form. It turned out to be "just a guy" who walked in the door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. It's some pretty funny stuff and it's about 10 or 15 minutes
