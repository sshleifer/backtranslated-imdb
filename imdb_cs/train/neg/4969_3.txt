First, it's not as close as it is bad as some of the other garbage Sci-Fi Channel produced; it does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact it's very bad, but it definitely had the potential to be much better. Movie mistakes come from character characters, characters, absurd stories, visual effects, music, and most of them: acting. When I talk about the character, of course, the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem to be ridiculous Vikings, rather than warriors of gross power - the helmet wearing our main protagonist is simply too stupid. Grendel looks like a Hulk, but with strange tentacles attached to elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from the beginning to the end, but Finn - a useless helper - has achieved two-dimensionality thanks to a romantic subplot, and Unferth also gets some idea because he becomes less horrified. <br /> <br /> Just like Finn, there are unnecessary additions to this story to be his own while still holding the source material. Crossbow, who is gifted to Beowulf, is so ridiculous, I am surprised that the cast does not come from a set. Apart from the additions, there are omissions, such as the basic themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. Special effects are severely horrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are ill-conceived and as such they are on the screen less than credible. Music is exhausted, especially when a person dies. <br /> <br / Overall, it's not the worst Sci-Fi movie yet. No. It's actually one of the better movies, though it's still waste, it's good waste, so it's the best guilt. The only thing that works is a dialogue that is still wooden here and there. I strongly recommend that you skip this movie and watch Robert Zemeckis adopt the ancient story of Beowulf, simply because this film Grendel is only half the story and not the whole thing that gets this movie a three-star review.
