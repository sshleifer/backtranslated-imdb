It's hard to criticize this movie because I do not like the story myself and no good acting would not save it. Think of "Raising Arizona" with average stripe. She performs successfully but Jennifer Tilly is as usual at the top (yet it is not enough to make it a pleasant camper film), coming somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast has a face constantly in amazement knit, either by the stress of their parts or by the stress of the whole unnecessary exercise. Great humiliating few movies. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too hard to make it comprehensible. I wish I could tell you how it was over but I went out, sorry.
