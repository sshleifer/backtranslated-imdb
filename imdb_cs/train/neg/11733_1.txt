I'm shocked that people who like this movie ... I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed at scenes that were not funny. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience, but frankly, the story in this movie needed a MAJOR revision ... it did not make sense, one second of the figure asks what exactly it is that they sneeze ... another scene, that they are hopelessly dependent and find out how to do it? Also the end just took the cake .. I do not want to spoil the wonderful conclusion .. but it largely mixed up with the rest of the terrible plot / script ... see this movie for comedy if you have to ..
