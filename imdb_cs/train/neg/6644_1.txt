Yes it is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to undress his actor and publicly show his friends. Pintilie IS NATIONAL "Emperor" - talk like this ... It's a great time when someone claims the truth. This cheater is a voyeur, a brother tangled in the body of an old man. His many naked scenes have no artistic legitimacy. This is a 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by playing stripes in a buff and looking at their willies. And if he did it in front of the audience, he could get tough! Did you know that the "Niki Ardelean" set off the poor Coca-Bloss when he told her: "Oh, Coca, how would I want you to be!"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she has become incomprehensibly embarrassed - to her little satisfaction! And as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in the Romanian audience, so many people are still so stupid to claim these visual obscenities as "works of art"! Will anyone ever have the decency to reveal the truth to everything?
