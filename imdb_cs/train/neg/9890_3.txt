Another Rape History <br /> <br /> This film is a disaster; uses only a historical story and makes a sweet love story with a bad actress and low budget production. The film should be 1/3 of the time, they just dragged the time to make a mini series. <br /> <br /> Combat scenes are so stupid and illogical, soldiers are stupid, costumes are a disaster. The Romans fought in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans as they tried to fight in the woods, in this film the Romans decided to fight in the city, I think I'm real. > <br /> <br /> And by the way, Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, meaning a light-skinned man.
