Ariauna Albright is a really good actress, but why she has a written transference is a mystery. What could be fun winds like a classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can act just as she looks really sexy, unlike her partner, Lilith Stabs, who looks good, but it's obvious she spent money on having a school in a spa or a beautician. It was a production that screamed for some T & A and the imaginative writer of the script could have reached the flow of things. However, Ariauna does what she can do in the circumstances and, to a certain extent, rescue her reputation. Tempe should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in dirty fetish police uniforms, the audience is expecting a fetish game and T & A. Nough said.
