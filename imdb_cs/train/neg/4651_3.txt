Of course, "Flatley" is no longer exactly the ideal name for the dancer, but I think Michael really pushes the ironic envelope with this new name: "Flame Feet" <br /> <br /> One really can not recommend recommending Desenex Foot Spray for a ride (and clearly ill) Flatley. <br /> <br /> I could add that, like the eager London crowd (according to the review below), I'm also thrilled that it's his last live performance. <br /> <br /> "He claims that this may be his last live performance, Flatley is thrilled by the enthusiastic crowd of London." ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide
