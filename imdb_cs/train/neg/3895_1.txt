Once upon a time, some bad people shot a movie about a guy who came into space, probably going to Saturn, but really just about some photographic shots of sun eruptions, and then he gets a bleeding from his nose and before you know he lies in a hospital-bound head to his feet then the hospital gets overweight with a bad uniform that wants to eat it, which should melt all over the place but it does not seem to lose any mass, and then NASA or at least one NASA guy gets worried about it he calls another guy to haunt him, but the boy who sent to hunt the molten guy must go home and have the soup first and his strangely-shaped woman forgot the crackers so he can not have crackers, and then he has to go out and look for the fading guy with the geiger counter , and it really does not work, so it's really just running a trail of half-dead bodies, and then there's something about the sheriff and the two ugly old people in the sensation and because I can not say how the movies end, I can only say that Jonathan Demme is somewhere with some guy with the stupid name Burr DeBenning, and if there is any justice in the world, everyone who is associated with this film died of a heinous, violent death and was unable to make more movies and the world lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER THE END!
