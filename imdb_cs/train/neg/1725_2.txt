- The film opens with a meteor that strikes the lake. Unknown inhabitants are the dinosaur eggs at the bottom of the lake. The Meteor warms the lake and transforms it into a huge incubator. You won it, the eggs bring the dinosaur, which culminates in the community. <br /> <br /> - What a complete garbage. It's not like I mean a dinosaur stop-motion, it's all about the movie that bothers me. The effect is unfortunate. The dialogue is totally absurd. Comic relief is nothing but comic. Logic does not exist. Any similarity between the "scientists" in this film and the real scientist is purely random. I could go on for all eternity in the wrong aspects of this movie, but you have the idea. I feel it is quite safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
