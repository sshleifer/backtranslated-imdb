Extremely boring drama is played by the very young Roddy McDowall, who trains the wild horse, Flick of the title, and is the only reason why he looks at it at first glance. Silently in crazy, exaggerated music and the bold schmaltz dialogue, it's one of those endless movies that will culminate to your head. The endless sequel to "Thunderhead, the son of Flick," in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag, is a bit better than the original, but the pace stays sluggish, and the scoring continues to dive, even though there are at least one or two non-comic scenes.
