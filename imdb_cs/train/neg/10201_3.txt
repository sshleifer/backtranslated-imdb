This is a typical thriller of "Perfect Crime". The perfect crime is executed, and the investigating officer, ignoring all the traces, immediately knows who is guilty. Viewers have to wait all over the movie to be captured. The result is every episode "Columbo" or "The Murder She Say". The director himself refers to the story of hackney by showing that the policeman was watching the episode of Matlock! This story is barely full for 90 minutes, but the director insists he will use all 120 minutes of filling with every clich√© in the book. Skip it, you will not miss it.
