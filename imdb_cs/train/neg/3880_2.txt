From that moment I can watch a good horror film. I've seen some sick things. But this is one of the few films I considered to be a grotesque way that was simply repulsive and rebellious. I like gore movies when they're fun. I like that there is a lot of creativity behind them. Gore in this movie is not creative. It is bad. It's nasty. It is totally unpleasant. Because this movie is certainly not fun. The film is a horror movie, but it lacks fear. So maybe the only reason the movie could watch is for the gore, but that's the most uninteresting and ugly aspect of the whole movie, and that says a lot. The game is terrible, the story does not make sense and music is really annoying and WAY is too electronic. Everything took me out of the movie. The whole film is one great long-suffering. There's this guy who has an unlikely accident in the transport and wakes up in the hospital to find out that his skin is melting and melting. I think he went out and ate the human body to slow the melting process. There is a strange scam that involves an old couple being chased by a dog, a broken head down the stream, and an end that includes a man who has been shot by the electric current. There were times when I really tried to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie that I thought was even fun was the early scene in which the nurse slows the hospital corridor. If you like ugly, unpleasant and uninteresting horror movies, it's for you.
