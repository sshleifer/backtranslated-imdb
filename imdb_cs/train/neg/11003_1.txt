How to begin? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has no interchangeable qualities. I just sat in this movie and it was a fight. He did not even get a single smile on his face. that someone would divide this terrible movie. I felt this movie was an unsuccessful attempt at unpleasant humor. The only thing I liked about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm sure that's why I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I'll wrap it up as I try and forget about the time I'm unnecessarily with this bitch. I will leave this warning to you. DO NOT USE THIS FILM IS SUCKS.
