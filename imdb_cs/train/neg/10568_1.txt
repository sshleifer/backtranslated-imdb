Wow. In my time I saw some really bad movies, but he really takes a cake. It's the worst movie I've seen over the last decade - without exaggeration. As a military veteran of the American War in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to even watch this ridiculous film, not because it brought a lot of memories - far from it - but there was absolutely no attempt at "authenticity" to be found anywhere in the movie. Not as much as the smallest piece. It seemed to have been written by an eight-year-old child who noticed military (and military) behavior directly from a comic book. The film was made in Honduras, which should be a trace, but it even fails to fully explain the shameful production value of this cliché. endless technical errors, but it would take practically forever. From the old units of shoulder spots that have not been seen or worn since World War II, and brand labels like "ColCollins" (worn by the "Colonel Collins"), which was actually written using the inverted mirror image "N" from the Russian alphabet (not American alphabet) the list just goes on and on. Unity, equipment, conspiracy, and, in particular, the behavior of the characters themselves - each scene was simply filled with ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies, and completely soulless clichés. Neither the story nor the characters were the least trustworthy or believable. It was all ridiculous for children, extreme. It was obviously a movie that wanted to appeal to the pre-boys, and I have no doubt that they would find this movie absolutely absurd. In short, this film has absolutely no redemption of features at all. It's a complete waste of time. I would like to advise anyone who reads to go through this trash; it really does not cost you to lose a single moment of your time.
