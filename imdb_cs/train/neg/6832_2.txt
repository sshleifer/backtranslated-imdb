I want to enjoy this movie, but Van Damme does the same old old waste after time. Poo knickers fight scenes as usual. The only thing this loser had lost was that the Russians would eventually eventually kill them. This film is a complete dog that does the highest in nature, please please, please, Van Damme. Anyone who likes Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets any acting work is when he makes a movie that produces a movie and plays a movie on screen. SHOULD VAN DAMME AND HIS SLIC BACK TIG SET. I give this film two out of ten, because the one with the sand was better. To add an insult to injury, I've lost scrap on this manure
