Underground Comedy is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known it would be bad if the phrase "guaranteed insult" was written in the box, which means the creators will concentrate more on making you money than laughing. <br /> </ p> <p> This movie is amateurish lots of children's sketches, bad characters, and worse jokes ... from the striking feature of Batman to the painful, unfortunate Arnold Shvollenpecker sketch, it's just not fun. Several couples who are a bit funny are a little and far away - watching Michelle Duncan, for example, when playing a gay vampire - but even they have gone too long and lost the innocence of Vince Offer on comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep an underground movie underground ... bury it!
