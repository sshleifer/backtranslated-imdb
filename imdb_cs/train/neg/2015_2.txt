I enjoyed this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am a plane and has a serious love affair with helicopters. I do not like this program because it requires fantasy to an incredible level. The world record for helicopters was set at 249 mph Westland Lynx a few years ago. The only helicopter that was ever faster was Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. He reached over 300 and was a helicopter, which meant that a thrust propeller arose at the end of the fuselage. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopter can fly more than 275 due to the principle of rotating wing years. And Bell 222, the "actor" that depicted Airwolf, was not too fast or standards for helicopters. And it did not stay in production for too long. <br /> <br /> It was a movie that came out during this period called "Blue Thunder," which was much more realistic.
