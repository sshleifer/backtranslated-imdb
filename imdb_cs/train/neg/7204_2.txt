This is one of those movies that you think creators would refuse to release because it's so terrible. Apparently they thought the kids were stupid and they were excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they were fun because it's funny fun. What is a talking car with buttons that call Wendy, McDonalds, M & M and Skittles? There was no talking car in the caricature. (Dr.) Claw is to be evil, not handsome and charming. Why is Rupert Everet 'Claw' the same? Were drug writers writing these scenes? Looks like they were (badly) a Robo Cop lamp, with the fact that you became a criminal fighter. I was trying to get money, but there was a policy, if I looked at more than 30 minutes of film, you would not get the money. I'm sorry I've watched more than 30 minutes of bullshit. After being told I did not come back, I decided to watch the rest of the dirty waste called Inspector Gadget.
