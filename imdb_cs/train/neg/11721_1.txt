This movie was terrible. The script is completely unreal, but is written to play in the real world, the editing and lighting effects are worse than most of the first projects in the film school. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who: A) knows some details about the world of police or secret operations. B) knows some detail about film or awards. I recommend this film to an average or below average mind, I think it would be nice if I was noisy. If you have to watch this movie in full, I highly recommend some drunkenness <br /> <br /> It's a complete loss of what has little production value.
