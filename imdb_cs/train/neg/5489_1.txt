The story is similar to ET: alien ground running and trying to get home. While staying on our planet, it creates friendly ties with people. But unlike the ET that radiates drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. It's really a clean production of Dysney: its main viewers are kids and the film is more visually than in news. <br /> <br /> You will find some fun scenes (the first sighting of the city, the "cosmic" shaky board), and the casting is experimented with special mention of "Doc" who rejoices in the "Mac Fly" character and Hurley seems to be an open car-derision. /> Led on Cake: The title is recorded by Danny Elfman, and like every other great composer you know his "voice" before it is even credited.
