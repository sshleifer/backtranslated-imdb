The two kinds of films that we like are (1) western and (2) films of 30 or 40 years. We liked the Snake called Man; But ..... <br /> <br /> But ... this picture is unpleasant, unpleasant and stupid from beginning to end. Since no one in the story (good or bad) is in jeopardy, there is no motivation to motivate the audience to attract the audience. None among the friends trying to steal the gold, and no friendship amongst those who try to protect him, no friendship. Sledge has a nice friend, but there's no reason why he's acting around the guy or why he wants to be in the same room with this ruthless pig. The film also suffers from intrusive and dirty music scores and from the very poor writing and direction of Vic Morrow. Of the last 30 older films leased out of Netflix or Video Vault, this was the rock bottom, the only real mud in the group.
