What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and credible premise and a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the film is losing. In fact, it never happened. It was a little excited when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then she finds out that it is after all, but it was. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and mostly brings a movie, was horrible and his whole character was not so close to being important to this film, except to be longer. I'd really like to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try a clean comedy that unfortunately was not, but perhaps a drama with comic elements. I think if he did this, it could be very funny, because the two actresses are quite entertaining in their own way, and when I'm sitting, I can think of many scenarios that would be rebellion.
