This movie was terrible. OK, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I always had to be a little bit interested. <br /> <br /> The plot stretches along and throws out enough key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' very dubious. (It's not a virgin, but she's allergic to bees, WOW!) So there are many things that make no sense and are unexplained, I'm afraid Mr. LaBute is not making a horror film. (How did two people apparently see blowing in the car at the beginning of the live and well at the end of the movie?) Cage looks embarrassed and confused, and his character is prone to calling "Rowan!" at the smallest noise. The "nod" to the original is irritating, as they are rather unobtrusive rather than intelligent. For example, some events mirror the original (The girl looks out of the box that pretends to be dead when Woodward / Cage is looking for an island) and several lines of dialogue are drawn directly from the original scenario of Anthony Schaffers and shoehorned. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really can not bother writing about this movie anymore. There is no substance. Dismount it on a pile of rubbish with all the other edits that have defamed the good names of the films on which they were based (in this case, very loosely).
