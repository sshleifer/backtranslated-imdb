This film is a perfect example of an excellent book that has been destroyed by the film. Jacob I loved them perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no plot, land disappears, and editing is terrible. The most important thing is that the music is directly from the synthesizer and sounds incredibly terrible. Bridget Fonda is acting well, but every other actor is totally amateur. I would suggest this film to somebody studying as a producer as a study of how not to produce the film because it is full of bad scenes, bad transitions and acting that should be shot again! Read the book and do not waste time with this movie.
