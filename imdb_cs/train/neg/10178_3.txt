How did I ever realize that this is a sequel? All he's doing is throwing spheres! The worst of all is not a comparison with the first installment of the series! The comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintentional laughter go? Pretty rough action in the field takes too long. Bob Uecker has literally rescued this from a full nine-hole run. What's Up, MAIN LIGA 4: RETURN TO SMALL LEAGUE? Ehh, it can be! Leave it on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star game. He had too many three times.
