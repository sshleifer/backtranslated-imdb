I saw this DVD in my friends' house, and I thought it was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood - not big names. I'm interested in deciding to do it later .. It was hard to get experience, believe me. After finally seeing the credit, I realized that "My Turks really suck in Hollywood-style movies, this is an insult to a nasty journalistic film ..." but then wait! I checked the names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish film; on the contrary, it was literally shot in America with an American director and crew! I've been thinking about it again - how can you convince names such as Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? with money probably .. It still keeps thinking .. How can you get so much money to offer them and supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer. He hired the cheapest equipment and the crew you find. And if you have trouble adjusting your budget, then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce - or I have no information about it. So from the bottom it is not a bad film that everyone so anxious to present as ... It makes you think - in my case even meditate - and there are plenty of films beyond that which do not even influence that. at least, think you; It makes you wonder .. It leaves you unbelievers .. and then you again wonder ..
