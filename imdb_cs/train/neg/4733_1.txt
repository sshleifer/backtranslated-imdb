I can not believe I was sitting in the whole thing. This movie has the worst acting from Killjoy. Here's a brief sketch of the plot: The movie begins with Jojo and another cat sits on the beach, slumping through the slender blonde-beach "hunk" that looks as if he did not go to the gym on his day of life. Somehow everyone knows him and every girl in the movie wants him. UH OH! Here comes the competition! Stereotypous "hot cat" and her best friends who run a nasty pink car. We'll soon find out that Joy's mother got a job in Australia, which means Jojo will have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'll cry). A huge storm will come and fill their pool with ugly water. Somehow, for no obvious reason, the cat drops into the pool and comes face to face, yeah, you think, MERMAID! This is where the "story" really goes out. They basically want to get a mermaid to fall in love with "hunk". This is preteen flick with such a bad deal, it makes the 80s look like the top Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the possible clich√©s ... the best friends, the "hunku" everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her terrible friends, the terrible old man ... you name it, it's there. I took it for many people by watching it. Consider my hour and 40 minute sacrifice. This movie is not displayed. Do not do that I suffered in vain.
