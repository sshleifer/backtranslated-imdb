It's a simple story, but it feels very manipulative. It lacks pathos because it leaves no room for imagination or personal thought or time for reflection. The animation is well done, but I feel it's too presentation. I would prefer more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe it would not be so much a kite for me. But for the Hollywood style it works well, but it's very derived from Aardman movies, and I'm afraid of that. Maybe a longer movie will test if this producer can do without a voice report. I think the voice is too depressed.
