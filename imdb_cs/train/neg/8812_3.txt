Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would be better if all the characters were forced in the first five minutes. Where's Blade when you need him? While as deep as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR SEN and as a nightmare like BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is not as entertaining as any of the above-mentioned ruthless movies. While hopeless cannibalism can make a smaller accelerated race of Jeffery Dalmers, it was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. I really thought it interesting as late night's infomercials and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic properties, you can endure it, otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that these people were not doing Brain Damage because it was the quality of dead creatures.
