STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US Army has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane to escape detection difference from others. The Renegade Pilot (Steve Touissant) steals him and portrays the US government to redeem it. So they are forced to send their best man John Sands (Seagala, who else?) To stop him, in exchange for his freedom from the detention center, where his mind should be erased from all the incriminating information he has learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I jumped the Attack Force because I was able to find out of the envelope and all the postproduction manipulation that happened to be bullshit and when all the negative reviews and low ratings came into it, I thought. But I decided that the FOF would go because Shadow Man (the same director) was not bad and what the hell, Seagal was my favorite action star once and maybe just maybe he could make a great movie again. Oh, I'm crazy. Dabing, terrible serial footage of air fighter jets, awesome camera work, cheap production values, fish, unconvincing battle scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and boring, a storyline that will not come anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film Once Upon and Time in the Hood (which I skipped) seems to mean the termination of his contract with Sony, which means he is no longer those horrible European film films and his next Prince movie of Pistols could mean returning to theaters. Hell, he did it before, and Stallone does it in front of me (Rocky Balboa.) This is not Flight of Fury. It's not fun. It's a flight that does not even make it to the ground. * *
