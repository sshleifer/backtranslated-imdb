The envelope of the box of this film has the name Kylea Minogue but has the same fate as Drew Barrymore in "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this film lame; trying to market a movie with someone who is in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to have this film feature of young hip college kids who are not aware that there is a killer there. To top it all away, Molly Ringwald's 80th Anniversary Teen Movie of Fame is the star of this beautifully written movie. It's a good career to get Molly some money to scare a dirty movie in Australia so she will not be ridiculed in those states. <br /> <br /> Either way, this stupid film is about some stupid horror, which has never been completed because this stupid animal kills everyone in it. Throughout the movie, we should guess who the killer is. Long story short, remember our little girlfriend Molly, she saves the day ... or she? This step is simply wrong, borrow it if you feel like torture alone or just break it on the floor in the local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not throw horror.
