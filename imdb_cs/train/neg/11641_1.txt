Although I generally support a well-written film, I am not limited to films that escape these borders, and more often than I do, I look forward to admiring films that "break the rules". And it is quite true that director Pasolini violates the rules of the established cinema. But it's also my opinion that it does not break them down successfully or at any current point. Pasolini's work is visually disturbing, but that's less a matter of what's actually on the screen than what the filming and jumping of his films seem to be less the subject of artistic choice than amateur cinematography. This is true for DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred the use of non-actors and, while many directors did it with a remarkable result, under Pasolini's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini contains quite often images that are meant to shock, offend or otherwise disturb the audience. Such elements can often be used with a surprising effect, but in Pasolini's hands it seems that such elements rarely really play a part in the film. This is also true for DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I was given to understand that there are many people who like and even admire Pasolini's films. I have never met with them and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works, which gave me a reason for such popularity or admiration. When I judged him for his own deeds, I think he is essentially an amateur director who "did not break the rules" by choosing a lack of skill - and who was initially applauding the "existential courage" of his day of intelligence, and therefore simply confirms it in bad habits as a filmmaker. I find his work tedious, insurmountable and demanding. And this also applies to DECAMERON. It is also sad that almost every film of Pasolini was my misfortune to endure.
