Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First, how do you know which movie you buy? Henry Cele the stars in each of them. I bought this movie when I thought it was a miniseries ... WHAT IS LETDOWN! It was a comedy, but a young girl was raped. David Hasselhoff (Spelling?) Is OK for popcorn TV but he was not faithful in this movie (where was his English accent?) And WHAT IS LOVE STORY ??? The film should be about how a young man comes to military strength - not a captain of a slave ship who shakes with an English girl looking for his father ... If I paid for more than $ 7 worth of film, I would have to call the police - because it would be a crime!
