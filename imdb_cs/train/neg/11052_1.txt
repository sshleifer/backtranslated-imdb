Deadly Wake is a PERFECT MOVIE for movie students ... to learn how the NEVER PRODUCING movie! Let's see ... what did the crew do in this movie? Worst Music Mix Worst Editing Worst Script BEST ALL TIME DIRECTIONS Worst Actor Worst Choreography Worst Cinematography Worst Props Worst Files Worst Illumination etc. Make sure this movie was in a high contrast black and white, ... it would still be terrible. All scenes are dark (lighting people call "black"), often a musical score drowned meandering dialogues, which was okay because no one ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. The "evil" robot was jolly ... what was it? Jazz Dances? Oh ... I think it should be tactics or something. I'm sure it was a fear in the hearts of poor editors. And how do you edit so many garbage records? Impossible. Garbage is rubbish, no matter how you've combined it. How did anyone get over dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is - I could not stand watching more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with lots of breaks) just to find out if it has all the good parts. NO WAY! NONE! A perfect example of how not to go ... you have to see EVERY serious film student !!!
