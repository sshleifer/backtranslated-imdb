there are three kinds of bad movies - cheap, boring and tasteless. the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> The boring movies are simply boring - if you do not leave fast enough, you will fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Disgusting movies actually have their defenders; but the fact remains that they are masturbation aids for very sick people. <br /> <br /> Only cheap cheap movies are really fun because the creators wanted to make their films so desperate, capabilities and resources available. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is simply naturally boring and tasteless; Fortunately, fate and lack of funds and skills redeems her by seemingly equally inexpensive. this movie is cheerful and it can also be the last really fun - the bad movie ever made. The first time I saw it in the theater, God can forgive me; that I was so laughing that I was rolling out of my seat and also with most other viewers. It is clear that Derek and her husband-promoter took this film as a partial satire; unfortunately, apparently did not have the resources needed to remove it; As a result, it looks like a "satirical" element because the school girl's impression of a gay young man's perception of the honest gorshin of the drums in a batman trying to pretend to be a robin - does not fly over our heads - has no idea where any human head can be . On the other hand, there are some supposedly serious moments in this movie - it's supposed to be an action movie, remember - they're so tremendously cheesy, man asks if anyone as to Derek's unhealthy tendency to reveal her breasts - I can not imagine less erotic nudity the photographic display is so weird looking at these wide shoulders, Imagine what somebody has ever seen in it. <br /> <br /> As for the conspiracy - such as is - well, it is not; Derek haunts around Africa, and God knows why. then her father, Harris, pretends to be acting in a maniacal puppet show, and of course there is a hunk'o'Tarzan who seems to have been amazed by the ad without knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he did not see scenario - apparently no one. <br /> <br /> negligible work with camera, bad editing - if it was not a 3-way chimpanzee, the movie would be unbearable <br /> <br /> as it is, it's a real horn.
