When I saw a man in the sun, I think I expected the evolution of style and technique to match the larger size of this film. I also had a great interest in seeing someone doing a horrific fictitious description of what happened during the most famous Japanese atrocities, but it is not. This plays as a film of European Nazi exploitation from the mid-1970s - eg SS Experimental Camp etc. (Maybe more like deported women in a special section actually). He realized he had more space and more people were running, but he attracted the same cheap and ungodly device to many unfortunate non-actors who were deeply disintegrating to the sound of ridiculously fake shots, flavored by the occasional mistaken "shock" sequence. Naturally horrible documentaries are roughly intertwined between the scenes, so they were destroyed that even these real images are being robbed of much of their power. Check out Channel 4 "The Holocaust" (which has been broadcast recently (still running?), From 1 No 2006) for a really worrying documentary about the war of evil (with an excellent contextual use of real shots). This is a kind of treatment that proudly deserves Nanjing, and not this unnecessary abuse of rubbish (a better exploitative film minus the unfair use of a movie record would be fine, but again it is not a very good film for exploitation). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as treatment for the subject).
