This horror movie is really weak ... that's when it's the right movie I comment on. Nothing is really terrible because the family accepts a cute puppy of a German shepard. I had a German shepherd and it is a really good dog. I did not get the idea to get out of this movie, but rather from the comedy "K-9". That's another story all together. This movie does not really have a lot of horror at all, because the worst scene is at the end and it looks really cool. We also see that a man has almost put his hand in the mower. That's about it. But your father suspects something because his family seems pretty weird, somewhere to find out if you're holding a mirror while sleeping, you can see if they're obsessed. All in fact a very weak horror film even according to television standards ... TV movies that work out there as "this house has" is pretty good and there is another scary home movie about a woman and those strange shapes that are rather good. This one is really a bit boring.
