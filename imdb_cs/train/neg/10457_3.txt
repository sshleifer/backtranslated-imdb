What can I say? I am a secret fan of "Upper" action and horror films. Especially when it comes with a lot of humor and cues, but I'm not a snake fan on the plane. There are three potential draws to this movie: ?? Comedy of the situation; ??? Horror; a ?? New hundreds of airplane snakes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not written as a terrible horror or comedy and there are only 1 or 2 points in the movie where you will smile. If you want to feel the movie, the trailer really represents a movie, horror. <br /> <br /> Second, if you expect a movie full of action and shock, you will not be disappointed. It does not matter if it's over the other movies, but it always gives you it. <br /> <br /> Third, though the novelty Aircraft Snakes do not get rid of, but let the cinema think "what was all about". I know this movie has a high rating, but it does not add. A) Many reviews where it was written before the movie was released and B) The distribution of user ratings has a much smaller variation than normally 77% of people rated 10/10, only 7% 10 - Why such a huge gap?
