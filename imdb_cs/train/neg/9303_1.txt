I'm writing this review that watched her a few months ago ... the pendant looked so promising to buy this chrome excuse for the movie. It's a complete joke .... and literally spit in the face of real classics of an early generation of horror, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which even had a stomach to cope with the back of the cover art. The producer who played Brandon should go to flip burgers and serve a greasy hamburger ... hell that it would not even be good! The illumination was bad and the huge harassment in the movie you've never seen the actor's faces. I do not even remember the other members of the cast, which is really sad, bad that they will never do anything to remember them. That's all the time I'm going to lose in this review PLEASE stay as far as you can from this pile of junk mail, even if you get it for 25 cents, do not buy it a piece of gum at least you would enjoy! <br /> <br /> If you want a quality low budget entertainment, far better than this ... then look at the Jeff Hayes movie ... because it requires talent to do it in horror and the kid has it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have this 1 star just for cover art .... this is the only thing that's worth the so-called "movie" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
