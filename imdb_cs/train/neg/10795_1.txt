Could somebody say he will stick to what's good in basketball. This movie was not even a stupid one. In this movie, Shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box that is not an original genie in a boom box instead of a lamp. It is to help a young boy playing the equally uncomfortable French cappra. This film had a most ambiguous story from the water world, acting was terrible and I think everyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit.
