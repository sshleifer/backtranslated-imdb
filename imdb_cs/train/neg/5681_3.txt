After seeing and loving Poštova (yes, he really loved Poštova), I decided to try another film Uwe Boll and I chose Seed because I tried to do it at the local DVD store and it was supposed to be one of his better movies. While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film was very promising, and it seemed to be the beginning of a psychological thriller that is not too much of a traditional stream, it soon descended from the hill and was eventually immersed in one of the most generic movie slasters I've seen so far, a large number of conspiration holes, unrealistic emotional reactions, and subtopics. It seems Boll tried to come up with a good conspiracy, but after a while he gave up. Maybe he should be comedy? Several good things about this movie are that he has managed to create a total scary atmosphere that special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack goes well with the overall atmosphere but the unbalanced stimulation of this film combined with its generous generic nature makes the last half hour was a rather lengthy watch, which destroyed my experience completely. There are very good shocking scenes, but they seem to be just for shock value. And let's not forget to work with a camera that was sometimes nasty. <br /> <br /> I hope Uwe Boll once knows what makes a good movie because he seems to be doing a decent film everywhere amongst a lot of terrible movies. The seed is not one of them.
