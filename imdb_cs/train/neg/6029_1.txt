If you're curious about where many conspiracy theories and paranoid thoughts about the United Nations, Israel, and international affairs come from, do not look any further. This is not a supernatural Hollywood film freely based on some biblical passage. Instead, this film was created by Cloud Ten Pictures with a political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result for a while looks more like clips from the TV program (supplemented by family prayers and light that blend through the windows of the church while playing harps). For main stream viewers, it can be hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally as it is in the film. And maybe that makes the movie important. Probably you will not find a brief interpretation of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So, if you see it, look at it as a socio-cultural document. If you are subtle in all media, you do not need to be alerted to the relentless attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie.
