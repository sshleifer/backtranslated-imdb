This youthful, restless shooting is exclusively for teenagers in the bodies of old masters who desperately survive their hormone-injured teen years. How? Burning gas and an equivalent fast, ruthless wagon (or aircraft) with freedom. The conspiracy hardly borrows from Mr Rogers' Neighborhood (if it was my oil conglomerate), and Logan's Run was heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style. Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this film is based in a post-gas-crisis world in which a powerful government can not (* ahem *) drive your car and burn gas. The very opposite of today's Enron-Bush, which caught the oil, the government pushing the SUV. This concentration itself makes the film ridiculous. But wait ... there's more. Although the movie is set in the future, we do not show any signs of future technology, except for returning to bikes, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks ... just like today. The same clothes, the same suburban houses, the same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions for energy change. The effects are flat and tasteless. Even scenes that might be inexpensive or moving, buddies, honor, romance, horror ... all fall flatter than the paper doll under the briefcase. <br /> <br /> Continuity Is Missing - Burgess Meredith's character changes color and configuration from moment to moment while filmmakers hurt our intelligence with incomparable stock footage and over and over again. The story is just as sad and only half as exciting as the episode Dukes of Hazzard. <br /> <br /> Even stubborn autopilot and SF fans should avoid this film as a mileage if you do not like Exxon's excited managers who try to make the film empty as a hero reservoir.
