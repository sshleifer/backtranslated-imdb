I saw this movie when it was released for the first time. The memory of how bad she has stayed with me for almost forty years. I did not want to believe my own visions of the film when I saw it, so I consulted a film review published in big metropolitan newspapers the next day - sentiment confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the film is incoherent, unrecognizable and unwavering. Little research reveals that the producer was the star of Leslie Caron's wife, so the story of nepotism suggests the beginning of this terrible movie. The film list of many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Graham and James Sikking among others - suggests he has some promise. But the death of this film is caused by its terrible scenario. The mysterious "secret" is so obscure and so little is revealed in the film that the viewer remains confused from scene to scene. The film seems to be torn between the detective secret and the spy thriller, but it never works. The feeling of tension is totally absent. The main characters settle down on playing dry, powerless types in a fashion that does not evoke any empathy. Cinematography is for pedestrians. As a result, the unlucky viewer loses interest in characters, conspiracy, and ultimately the film itself. I am a little surprised that there is no version of this pitiful movie he could buy. I hope that if TCM finds a printout of this movie and feels forced to broadcast it is safely released to the 4:00 slot.
