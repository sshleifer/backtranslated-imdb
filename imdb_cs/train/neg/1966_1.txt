I was disappointed to see this movie after reading a positive review from another website and the man I was p.o'd! it took me at least 15 minutes before I picked it out of the clipboard b / c I did not want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes build courage to take it on the counter and actually use the real money to rent. I thought my whole stress would be worthwhile at the time I came home and watched the movie b / c The review I read said the movie was a pleasant surprise; it's a joke! if you can do it for the first hour of the movie, then you'll be lucky! b / c is not until the movie turns into horror. Do not worry about this one of your people, your better look at "dankness falls"
