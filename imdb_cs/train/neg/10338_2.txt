This movie is just stupid. Since shooting Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatal peak, the film is practiced in wooden predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the real sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlowe and Spade, who put the pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer shares things to get to the truth. This film transforms Hammer into her breast by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too stupid to get anything out of the way. One is so ill-drawn that he is subject to a popcorn attack. The other parts of the film are from Play Three Stooges. Velda is a dance in barre, for example, or the bad guy who accidentally defends his boss in his back. And uninterrupted breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher runs down the centerline of the road when the camera is tightened on the lower legs, but she is over the side when the camera stretches back for a wider shot. However, the worst break is preceded by a popcorn attack. The evil guy who haunts Hammer goes through the clock for our hero, except the hours that show he's seven minutes behind his guy. To be fair, some interesting camera and lighting angles and the big final is so bad that it was visible, which is the only reason why it gets two points out of ten.
