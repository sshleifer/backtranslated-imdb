Valentine is a terrible movie. That's what I thought: <br /> <br /> Behavior: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. The others were not much better. Story: The story was fine, but it could have been more sophisticated. This movie had the potential to be a great movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some of the music was quite nice. Original originality: too original. Is the name "Paige Prescott" recognized by Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: You do not see Valentine. It's a really silly movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
