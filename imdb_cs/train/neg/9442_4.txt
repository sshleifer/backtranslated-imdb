I tried to like it, as if I was looking forward to all the slasher films. I mean helpless killing mixed with little nakedness and some tension as you can go wrong. But Unhinged I think it is an example that this formula will go wrong. The main problem is the terrible behavior of the main three girls who appeared in the house. It was as if they were in my mouth, and that stopped me from ever wondering about my desperate situation. The film focuses on tension and creep, but it's exhausted by the numerical direction and leaves the film so boring. It's a shame, because if the movie was better done, it would be an ace. The story and characters are pretty scary and there are some dark and bizarre humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter in the old house. There is some good nudity and occasional flushing of bloodshed, it is not enough for the film to get the necessary kick. The final is quite twisted and terrible and gives the movie a big lift, but sadly, too late. So, in my opinion, one to avoid if you do not really like obscure movies slasher. There is quite a lot of potential, but the film supplies too little to be useful.
