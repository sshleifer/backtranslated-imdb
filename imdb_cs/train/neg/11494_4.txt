Richard Dix is ​​a big, not very nice industrialist who almost hurts to death. If he enjoys the vacation he has been suggesting to his doctor, can he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, he will probably be better off if he does not take the voice of HISTORY. <br /> <br /> This William's Castle controls the entrance has some great moments (introduction and view Richard Dix's life through newsreel and la Citizen Kane) and some interesting rendering in the final reels. Dix's performance is generally good. But, unfortunately, it just does not work quite well, because one does not finally buy that the characters will behave the way they do it. The film also comes from a dark (and fascinating start) to almost merry thirties film, like the middle section (full of nice ethnic ethnicities who do not mind being wealthy) and back to a complex noir plot last 15 minutes or so. It's a decent movie - it's worth seeing - but it took a little more time to create a few characters and female leadership to meet the roles of her role.
