I see that someone already thought of a similar analogy that was similar to the first thing that came to mind after watching this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no conspiracy. In addition to sex scenes that border with child pornography (which in my opinion could have been modified or presented rather suggestively than nature graphically, this film would resemble recipes that were torn in half.) The list of ingredients without any instructions how to put them together into the finished product ... From the very beginning it lacks character development and story development ... Unfortunately many times in this monotonous noise we are bothering with the bits of plot and we think "Ahh-OK ... finally we find out more about why this scene is happening .. or ... WHAT is this character ... or maybe we finally know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and engage more in this relationship between the characters ... etc ... "But such a luck! when the carrot was wavy, just to find out that no matter what the hatever mini-plot (and it was badly imagined) was just Russian. Why did I stay with it until the end is a secret, other than usual IFC has better selections and gave it 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery) It's not that the characters are not pleasant or that we can not identify with them or their humanity at all ... it's just that it could be much better with a little more effort. I noticed it was shot around Santa Cruz and I found out she was wondering if it was someone's film school project. I wish I could do better, but frankly it was frustrating and disappointed to waste an hour and a half.
