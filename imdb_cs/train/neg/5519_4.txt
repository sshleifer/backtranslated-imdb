Well, so the previews of this movie just tell you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer to get her right. This is not the case! She is a young, upset 17-year-old girl who reveals secrets, and is on her mother to believe when she tells the truth or not. To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this film. They had a really good conspiracy and a really good theme of the relationship of love and hatred between mother and daughter. However, I did not like to watch Lindsay Lohan's acting. In fact, this movie would be great if they had someone else, perhaps better actress. The character Rachel (Lohan) is a sexually aggressive person who reminds us of Lindsay's true, so she takes a lot of the movies. <br /> <br /> I think, Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this movie. The end is pretty good (and sad).
