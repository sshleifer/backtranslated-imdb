Far from providing caffeine, you would expect from a movie that shares its name with the most energy-boosting hot drinks, coffy collapses and never really rises above just being a horrible revenge story. If the film was a cup of coffee, it would be rather faint and watery, full of unwanted crumbs and lacking a permanent flavor. Sporadically, it falls into place, but otherwise it is not the hot action drama that she hopes will be. Coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her hands and brings the righteous justice to the drug-pushing, lady-pimpin 'mug-suckers that her younger sister adds to the spoiled, sick state. The social policy commentary on the situation of urban black youth in America is prominent in Coffy, and makes some thoughts about things like Coffy's crusade against political corruption and the white racism institutions that profit and act as a parasite outside targeted African-American minorities. It is sad that timely reports are undermined by poor film quality and lack of focus. Coffy's thoughts are important, it's just that they are not well focused. One of Coffy's plus points is the presence of the Blaxploitation Pam Grier icon. Grier goes to her role with taste and makes her an attractive action hero when she gets rid of her grand spectacles of vigilant violence (how do you deal with a house full of hoods? You drive the car through the front door!). It's just a shame that the story has the opportunity to lose as much sexual exploitation as possible. The low budget could not help but the Coffy for Blaxploitation forced groove. Just as problems are undermined by inadequate quality, fun and excitement are also disturbed by moments of dullness and wrong direction. The overall result is labor and wood. We get a hippo hero, but not a hip movie. It's a shame because Coffy has his moments and should be rightly considered a key movie in madness. it just will never rise above the average, tepid number.
