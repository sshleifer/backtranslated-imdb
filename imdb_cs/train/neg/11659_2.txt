I loved * the original Scary movie. I'm a huge fan of parody - it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the most intelligent form of humor. Wayans' boys apparently grasped this concept perfectly in the original film, and then temporarily forgot to continue it. I think Wayans are a family of comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even the geniuses make mistakes. The film starts with a promise. I liked the parody of "Exorcist", especially "come out, ma" gag. Now it's Wayans quality material. But besides, I can just think of one more laugh: 1) When Tori Spelling is seduced spiritually in the middle of the night, then he becomes adherent and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he says, "It was just a day off!" That was a bit funny. 2) Parody "Save the Last Dance", where Cindy's character inadvertently defeats the girl as she practices her new moves. But even short-lived giggling can not be compared to the laughter of the first scary film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is pure waste filled with cheap coarse gag. Jokes from the first film, which were subtle or implied, are magnified and exaggerated. For example, in Scary Movie I, several insinuendos are created to indicate that the character of Ray is gay. It was funny. But in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-strangled scene with Ray under the bed was thrilling and incredibly unfortunate. This is the pattern of the whole movie. Shocking humor * alone * The film does not care too far. This trend was unfortunately in 2000 and 2001. <br /> <br /> Just as it hurt me to rate Wayans movie so low, I have to give him 2 out of 10.
