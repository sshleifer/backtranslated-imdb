<br /> <br /> As usual, I was looking forward to a new TV / movie on my favorite subject - it makes a nice change from the * strangely famous * document about Kursk or Stalingrad on the historic channel <I was just looking forward to Pearl Harbor and Enemy at Gates - but he was brutally brought down to earth with the realization of the Hollywood malicious, stupid power and power, and his ability to spend absolute wealth, and I again excited "The Rise of Evil", especially when I heard Ian Kershaw was involved because I enjoyed my books . I see why he left. <br /> <br /> Citing a guy responsible for this waste: <br /> <br /> "The Kershaw Book was an academic work," he said. "It was quite dry, we needed more incidents." <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are nuts? Hitler's life can not be said to be without an "incident" - yes Kershaw's two volumes of Hitler's biographies were long and detailed but they should have been. The thesis of Rise of Evil seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - he was not a very bad person who FOLLOWED the Jews, and only if you miss it, we will emphasize the reality EVERYWHERE scene in film. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to explain the mood of that time and why Hitler could accept the views and strategy he had made. Needless to say - as opposed to the "Nazis - Warning of History" in general - this film has been neglected by emphasizing the fact that almost all the leaders of the Munich Communist Rebellion were Jewish and that it may have colored its views on the subject - and its axiomatic interconnection of the Jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect for understanding much of the Nazi era. But there was not much understanding - the filmmakers were about to go there, so we got everything we knew about. We certainly will not get the fascinating reality that Kershaw mentions, which Hitler did shortly after Socialism / Communism immediately after the First World War. This, of course, would be too complicated for the film to cope, and it could even aggravate the inexorable "very bad" mantra that is constantly sticking. We know he's a bad man. But we also know that he was a charming figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic, and, of course, he was interested in opinions like vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking that many Guardian readers could agree to. He was also very fond of the animals, and that's why it was a completely fictional scene for dogs, he was so absurd. Also, from all the accounts I saw, he was a brave soldier in WW1. While we saw him with his Iron Cross, we never see how he wins (acts of courage were not in the script, it is useless to say). We also have no information about why he was so burned by his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and many others considered it a repulsive experience. And again, as the above-mentioned link to the Jewish / Bolshevik connection, it is essential for someone to understand this subject. Why did he love so much war? Why did he think it's always a good idea, despite massive evidence of the opposite? Why did not he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but he did draw the wrong conclusions. This movie certainly had nothing to be interested in. <br /> <br /> The film is a classic example of "making a history relevant to the presence" and inventing things or leaving unpleasant facts to fit into the "presence" - which is too often to deal with the lowest common denominator, Do not believe your listeners about centimeters, so you just wrinkle your throats and know (sadly) that you will always be away with them because there are so many silly fools in the world. <br /> <br /> History is really about being relevant to the past and seeing how our presence turns out to be better and worse. This waste was a great opportunity, he lost again. They spent millions and places on it, and great scenes were impressive, but they did not tell us anything we did not know about and did not support any understanding of this dark period in human history.
