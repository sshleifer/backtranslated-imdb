I really can not believe that this film is not the worst in the IMDB 250, it's absolutely terrible. When I first saw her, I remember talking about it in the classroom, and two other people also saw it. We told other members of the class that they did not see it because it was so terrible. By the time we were done, some others wanted to see just because they could not believe it was as bad as we said. Do not be like them, just go through it. I'm sure everyone who engages in this movie would also prefer not to see them in this movie.
