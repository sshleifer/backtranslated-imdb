Look, it's the third one, so you know it's bad. And "Maniac Cop" was not good enough to guarantee a second installment, so you know it's even worse. But how worse? When Maniac Cop continues the killing spree, the reporter shouts: "What happened here may be ONLY described as the black rainbow of death." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1-- Rainy are not black, and they can never be. 2-- The pipes are harmless and can never cause pain or death. 3 - A news reporter, one valuable to his agency, may find another way to describe the consequences of killing. The "Black Rainbow of Death" is not the only way to describe the situation. <br /> <br /> This is why you are in this area.
