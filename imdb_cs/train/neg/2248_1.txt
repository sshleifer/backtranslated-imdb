This movie is a huge steam pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why someone felt that the Garland / Mason version needs to be redone, or why Striesand would be the first choice for the star. I have no idea why our people (homosexuals) usually consider Striesand as some kind of treasure. At least in my opinion it professionally culminated with Funny Girl and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Take a favor and rent Judy's classic, or even the original (fine film in itself), but please, please, skip this stinkpot!
