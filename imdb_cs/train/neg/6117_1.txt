I can not say that this is the worst movie ever shot, but I personally think so, because when it was originally released in the theaters (1), the initial buzz was so positive that my girlfriend insisted on seeing it, and we actually get STOOD IN LINE tickets and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember where the audience started to entertain at a certain point and basically laughed at the film for the rest of the trip. As soon as we arrived at the infamous (and endless) scene of the Battle of the Serpent, I think they all surrendered. The only positive thing I can admit is a seductive location. Oh, and there is also Bo Breast, though her acting is so wooden that nudity is unerotic and does not rate much more than Playboy's image. The "dramatic tension" in this film is Bo's terrible acting and the terrible direction of her husband. The fighting serpent must be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever shot. However, it is one of those films that are bad enough, it may happen that you should monitor the level of unintentional humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever paid.
