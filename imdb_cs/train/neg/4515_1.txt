"Piece is Cake" is a defeatist, a revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is the unfairly wild reputation (probably fictitious) of the pilots it displays. This left a remarkably bad taste in the mouth. In March 1989, "Airplane Monthly," Roland Beamont wrote a sharp condemnation of the way the RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV mini-series.

It would not be for a moment tolerated ... ... The prevailing atmosphere was rather similar to that of a good rugby club, though with more discipline and no sense of "death or glory". training meant that we were there to defend the country, and now we had to do it - nothing more or less. "" There was no discussion of "bravery" or "cowardice." People had either courage or not - but they were mostly doing it. But we knew the fear, we recognized it in ourselves and in each other, our curse controlled us, and then we went to work ... "... I could not feel any" glory "but it was a feeling of grandeur and none of them <br /> <br /> Beamont was, in his words, a fighter who, unlike the author and producer of a recent television series, was there at that time. "Beamont served with the 87 squadron in both France and BoB, before becoming one of the most prominent representatives of both the Typhoon Tempest and the post-war test pilot." The "Piece of the Cake" is an absolute, absolute false expression of the way , as the pilots in the fighter headquarters used to do at that time. It's nothing but complete and complete shame ...
