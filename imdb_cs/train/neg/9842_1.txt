It seems that everyone in this film will direct Woody Allen. They stamm and pause and stoke even more. Only for really nice fans of DeNero! It strives to look sharp and artistic - but it is based on the fact that it looks like a very, very low budget for the film by university students. The most commonly used word in the whole movie is "hum". The film captures the atmosphere of the late sixties or early seventies. If you like movies that people are still talking about, terrible lighting (even if it's for "art"), and you feel as if you are sitting at a lame political meeting, then you like it - but you really have to be boring . I found this CD in a dollar basket and now I know why.
