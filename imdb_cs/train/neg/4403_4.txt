Whatever the movie's merits, it's badly explored. As the others emphasize, the film shows that local people in Iran speak Arabic, rather than Persian. This is enough to lose credibility for anyone with the least knowledge of the region or country. The landscape can not be different from the real one. <br /> <br /> Other factual mistakes: Afghanistan is running a train, while Afghanistan has no rail. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez (red hat), while Fez was banned much earlier than the film was set. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is really dressed as Indian and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided to make her exotic.
