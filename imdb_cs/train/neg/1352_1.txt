Eytan Fox has made several interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and simply a gorgeous "Yossi & Jagger" movie, when he generally relies on the apology of Israeli politics. In "The Bubble", however, this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme has come. Far from making this film constantly guilty, the people on the screen I visited silently get up and walk away. I also quietly left and breathed anger in such a ridiculously unilateral film that translates self-sufficiency as racist bullying and racist bullying (and terrorism) as the outburst of justifiable anger; which means that Arabs are evil Israelis so threatened that they are in anger reacting to a steady stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them and that they should not be responsible for their deeds. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the money I paid for the ticket (I really felt it was a claim to my money) and it was essentially the Israeli sound of Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be anti-Israeli, then you would look at this film by all means because it really justifies just such a system of faith. The fact that this film was shot by an Israeli director, and even worse, is such a talented Israeli director, is a crying disgrace. In fact, how can Israel be surprised to be considered a parionic state when the Israelis themselves make such anti-Israeli propaganda, begging the faith. What a shameful, horrible little movie!
