I saw 10p.m. and I must say that this film was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater and want my time back (because I do not actually pay for movies), I really did not find any redeemed properties. There were a few lines, but it seemed that the film was composed of a constant fan of youth service (more than age, because this movie is labeled R), a male audience. The fans' service looked in place and rather scattered. I know you all want to hear that Samuel L. says his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a lot of hype for a very small payoff. The only really horrible part of the film was the CG, which looked very digitized and did not last well in live action on the screen. Now I'm a reasonable man, I knew he was going to the theater that I did not see "Casablanca," and I'm at least grateful that this film is an original (albiet ined) idea and not some re-make or franchise turn. However, to be honest, if you are not part of a cult culture, you will probably be spending money elsewhere and seeing the movie either in the second theater in a matter of weeks or renting it in a few months.
