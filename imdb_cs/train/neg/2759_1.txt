Merry, laughing loud moments ... and yet no comedy. I really liked the dirty gag on the ambulance soaked in a "dirty bum," which then in their anger screams out "dirty burns", I think wow, someone online literature is paying off! The worst scenario you can imagine with instant plotting, ridiculous movement in the story, the development of ZERO character (even between the characters that meet ... it's like if everyone knew and trusted years) effects and plotting holes .. oh God there are plot holes !! To be honest, I write it even when I was watching the whole thing, but I'm definitely expecting the last 30 minutes not to raise a convincing attempt at the cinema ... thank God we have a good look at it, let's forget that the film is a load ... well ... use your imagination to close this particular sentence!
