If there is one movie that is the worst this year - it's TASHAN The first promo showed that the movie would be a boring film in the style of Dhoom 2 and I knew well that first it would be a bad movie, it's a Yashraj movie or maybe seeing a cheese promo Ale this film made me shock, it was even worse than Dhoom 2 and what did I expect, the first Saif is an introduction that is boring then Saif-Kareen meets, Kareen is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor God, what makes in such a strange movie? What is the role? What does? His first scene is fine, but then his act repeats and exaggerates. Then came Akshay, who provided some nice scenes, but then the film became much boring and with all obsolete things The Children's novel, the overdose of childish Rajnikant action scenes and all boring scenes The end is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would (Vishal Shekhar) is common <br /> <br /> The performance of Akshay Kumar is coming in the film as a glimpse of fresh air, in fact, gives some of the fascinating moments Saif Ali Khan irritates, Kareena is just as bad Anil Kapoor hams relentlessly and spoils the show even more The rest is fine
