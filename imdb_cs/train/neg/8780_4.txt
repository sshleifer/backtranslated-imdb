Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Soon, Dr. Price, an expert on Electronic Voice Effects (EVP), who claims to receive reports from Jonathan's wife Anna leaving her with various electronic devices. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan? Is it just an indication of something in a larger cosmic or other world? It's good to see Keaton in the lead role, but the story with him is intricate and absurd in points; it's as if the film did not know how to answer some of the questions it brings, so it simply brings to the audience new, unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is quite good, convincingly occupied as a widower who desperately tries to communicate with his late wife. Mature as an actor he left behind the role he played 15 years ago. It looks a little scary, with a few wrinkles than expected, but it has lost nothing of what is happening in Hollywood over a quarter of a century. <br /> <br /> So it's not that Keaton turns in poor performance is that the script itself is a sub-paragraph. Written by Niall Johnson, the conspiracy becomes much more confusing as it progresses, each bloody journey ends in another tortuous way. This is good and good if the path leads to some acceptable disruption, something that more or less brings together everything and explains ... something. But no white noise; I knew less about what happened to Jonathan than I did before I saw him for the first time. Keaton is really the only reason to look at this waste, although he gets great support from Ian McNeise (as a doctor). Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as a desired affectionate interest.
