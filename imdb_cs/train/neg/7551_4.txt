Well, eventually, in London, he finally managed to see a remake, inadvertently cheerful, sexless and free of any real humor. I really do not know where to start, while I enjoyed this strange honor. The actor is screaming, there is no original music, the costumes are too "Disney" is ridiculous "six months later" to put on after burning Nic Cage (who came soon to like it) The cage in the bear suit had to suppress the audience festivity, as well as a comedy that scared off the island from various "baddies". It's such a strange remake that I can not really believe I saw him reminded me of something Comic Strip would be like in the 1980s, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of Miner's Strike, very strange!
