The Marxist polemic of Jean Lucha Godard is so close to an unexpected film, as you will probably see from an internationally acclaimed filmmaker. The pieces of political theater, wisely exhausting and endless, are scattered by the creation of "Sympathy for the Devil," representing Rolling Stones in the studio. Mika Jagger's song development process plays a demo on acoustic guitars, singing vocals recorded to the end, is fascinating, and is worth renting this movie just to see bits with stones. Almost half the film is dedicated to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops you can skip all bizarre political skits and just watch the Stones put the song together. When I had it on laserdisc, I tried to watch everything, but I do not see how anyone could go through it. Finally, I moved away and only the chapter skipped the way to the Stones.
