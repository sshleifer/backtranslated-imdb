Steve McQueen surely has a lot of loyal fans. Surely he was a charismatic man, one of the most charismatic who ever knew on the screen. Even McQueen can not save this step from the movie, fired with what looks like a small camera in actual locations in St. Louis. McQueen is a new child without record of the criminal record brought into planning from the bank robbery of one of the other gangs. There is more than a wider hint that there is a homosexual relationship between the young Steve and David Clark. In other robberies he did not like it anymore, mainly due to the lack of a criminal resume. Steve also has a friend in Molly McCarthy, and he suspects something, especially when he starts hanging with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all the rough characters. That would surely provoke my suspicion. Two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix, were the great robbery robbery. Guggenheim mostly made the document, and Stix did not do much. One of these two jokes decided that Steve's performance was best served by a bad imitation Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie can go down as the worst thing Steve McQueen has ever done. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions have already signed up for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they should have it if they saw it. Or they would see something that the public would overlook except the dressing of this turkey.
