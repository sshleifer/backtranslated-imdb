If you want to laugh like a madman, rent Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are the best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he is unable to take care of himself, so Scott will take him. I have never seen a movie with more homosexual links to two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "fight" and Scott tells Billy that he is "still painful last night", among other things. Amazing catch phrases such as "Close Sh! T Up" and "Ping Pang Pong, Cut Sh! T" will make you laugh a lot. American native Americans playing Mexican gang members are also top players. As they say, it's just a "party of time" right now. Ba-ba-ba ba-ba. I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh. It was so funny that I went out and bought a DVD for $ 5.99
