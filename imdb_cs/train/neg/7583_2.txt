David Lean's worst film. Even "the place we served" was not as bad as this. Usually a movie with a really good reputation like this one has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it can be considered a classic. But after watching it, I just could not understand why this piece of crap liked in 1945! I did not like acting, a tough upper lip of British manners, a story, a script (which can sometimes be quite funny, but totally inoperable) and a soundtrack. Elvira's character is supposed to be appealing and attractive, but in reality it was ugly and had a weird and uncomfortable voice. Just another movie that convinced me not to trust the reputation of the film. Another very overvalued "British classic".
