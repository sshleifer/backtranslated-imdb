In this film we have reached the ceiling of improbability. Basically, the dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some strange old procession called Neweyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Neweyes obviously hears children's wishes everywhere, and decides he should bring children's wish that dinosaurs be brought to modern times so that everyone can see them as inhuman exploitation. Dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter (It's a shame that they did not have the scripts). By the way, it seems strange that, out of all the wishes of children in the world, Neweyes is giving the wish to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not make the children's wishes stop the famine? Disease? War? I mean, come on! Does not Neweyes have anything to do with this power he has? Finally, when dinosaurs get to modern times, they start singing, dancing and destroying catastrophe (basically what you see on a bad LSD trip, I think where else could you see T-Rex playing golf and jump on the Spider-man balloon?) . They end up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) makes the children who associate with the dinosaurs sign an empty contract. Why? Why would children sign a blank contract ??? Screweyes says if the dinosaurs take some ... "Brain-Drain" to let the kids go. The dinosaurs, instead of breaking the dirty limb of the limbs from the limb, gave themselves and agreed to the conditions. What?! That's silly! They could only scare him, force him to lose the treaty, eat, and then leave with the children. I think the creators tried to show that violence is bad, which is an unclear point, when they finally escape the dinosaurs and plenty of crows, surrounding the needles and apparently completely dark. Yeah yeah, it's not violent at all! We're back does not make sense, it's not fun, it's stupid, it's stupid, badly written and contains some of the biggest plot of holes that ever made shooting. Even for a kid's movie ... it's a BAD.
