Demi Moore's character in the movie was selected for SEALs for her appearance. That was a bad start and the movie went down from here. The plot was totally unbelievable. The will to do this in a heavy military unit is not enough. This film did not convince me of the woman's physical abilities to perform the required tasks. I try to pretend that women and men are basically the same, it is an insult to the intelligence of all. Gender differences are what make life interesting.
