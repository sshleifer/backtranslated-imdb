it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I left to watch it for an hour and regretted it. acting is terrible and there is hardly any plot. my guess is that someone came up with the strange shape of the animal and started making the story around it. borrowing some film ideas like Resident Evil and Aliens does not lead to a movie like them. if it's a top Korean film, I'd rather not even see a Korean movie trailer ... By the way, these movies are a good reason to suppose that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean user who has internet for playing online has rated this film for over 8 years, though he has no idea what it is about.
