I thought the movie was a good part. The beginning was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie were good. Camera Angles in the first 30 minutes were weird and I did not like it because they do not include the actors altogether. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie was not really that great, what we await a lot for such films. Dialogues were meaningless and I do not think they are very funny. I felt like trying to copy movies as a phone call from a dialogue point of view, but unsuccessfully. It seemed as if many scenes between the actors had been unloaded due to it and had no sense in the story. The whole movie is characterized by law and doge. I do not think it was waste time, it's OK movie, but not gr8
