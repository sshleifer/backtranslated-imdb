This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers you for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you a silly person because you knew you watched her. The conspiracy is not even the worst part of this film ..... his acting, camera work, lighting and sound. You do not have to like this movie at all. who paid for the film being made is now broken. I hope the director will never get the green light for another movie. In his defense, this film was shot quickly to try to make real BTK killers, but I saw a movie of weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to that.
