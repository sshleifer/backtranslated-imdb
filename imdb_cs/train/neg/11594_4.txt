Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel continues to be a strange idea and is not too big to let the story go. In fact, Alice of No. 4 is pregnant and her child is being persecuted by Freddy, which gives him the opportunity to persecute his friends. It has the smallest deaths of the whole series and wise cracks are relatively poor, so fans of horror and comic fans are not happy. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say. It is slightly interesting to see the characters Alice and Dan returning from four but not worth watching the film. Incomprehensible and unforgettable, perhaps only a competent direction, will save her from being the worst in the series.
