That's a bad movie. Not one of those funny bad ones. It is bad. It was really painful to watch. The direction was terrible, with a lot of jumps around, and the green and yellow shades used throughout the movie make the characters look bad. Keira Knightly was not at all convincing like heavy chickens, and I can not believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed up for this criminal cellulose waste. The script was horrible, and the acting was like a nail across the board. If you did not see it, no. You do not waste anything and you lose two hours of your life unnecessarily and watch this disgrace. I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them because of their faults. This is just a waste of time.
