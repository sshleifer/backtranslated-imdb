This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the worst American dross; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and producer have taken a great deal of recreational medicine, and when they were discussing the conspiracy, it was actually a good idea. It is not. It is wasteful waste from Satan himself (who would probably write a better script if he remembered it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, who spends money on taxpayers (lotteries), should be responsible for this nonsense. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline ??? I ask you - a camp like a Christmas tree, Deathline ... "Mind the doors" is a classic of really bad British film, we really do not need a reminder. And we definitely do not need poor, poor, poorly scripted, poorly developed and bad pieces of garbage. All of this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I'm really my case. You do not pay any money to see it. It's absolute and total bullshit - the only saving mercy for the producers is that they got a huge cash key ... our money ... for doing it. You should cover your head. <br /> <br /> I'm overwhelmed at the low, low level of this movie. It makes me think that our national film support body thought it worthwhile to support. The British film industry has no hope, while idiots run a show. Harvey Wienstein, where are you? Let's go back, we forgive you!
