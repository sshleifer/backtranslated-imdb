After seeing Canadian / Icelandic / British production "Beowulf & Grendel", which I thought was great and amazing, I approached it - as the first of three newer Beowulf films to be released this year - with worries. Once I heard "Viking" and saw horn helmets, I moaned. These were the migratory era of the Swedes and the Danes, not the Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never had horns on their helmets (the horns make it easier for the enemy to find the helmet and then the brain). Then there is Hrolfgar Palace, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, not about Denmark from the 6th century. Swords and armor look like supports that have been left from earlier films in different historical periods. I saw weapons that could be used by crusaders in the "kingdom of heaven", and one character even controlled Windlass Steelcrafts a reproductive film sword from "Beowulf & Grendel"! Besides the basic conspiracy of the original epic poem, the writing was uncompromising and the action was entirely wooden and unconvincing. The biggest joke was the crossbow of a secret weapon, complete with observation shots and exploding projectiles that looked like something bought by Iraqi insurgents. The strange creature and his mother were so steroids that Beowulf could never break his hand, as he did in the poem. Thanks to the gods behind the bases! I could go on but I will not.
