slow, incomprehensible, boring. The three enthusiastic words that describe the book of the book. This is certainly the case when a movie should never be made at the expense of a book. The best part of the film was the scene, excellent. The worst parts were the slowly moving actors' interactions, which together with endless meaningful insights. Edits are sudden and irregular. However, in spite of this, the actors worked very hard, at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible screenplay. It was amazing that although Peru was barely a Peruvian descent that wandered around the scene - even in the scenes of memories depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
