Maaan, where I start with this godsome terrible movie. A bad bad story says. I do not know what the director said when he made this film. Namaste London was a pretty nice movie to be honest ... even the soundtrack was good. But in this .. my good .. for a movie to be a musical ... songs are so bad. AR Rahman was to be the music director. <br /> <br /> Because of the two great actors, the director should do a much better job. Although the first half is upset, the last 30 minutes of the movie is fine. Salman and Ajay's performances save the film from a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Watch if you have nothing better. The last good Bollywood movie I watched (and I look at them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
