It was without a doubt the worst thing I've ever done. I feel dirty when I confess that I have rented this movie and actually paid the money to see it. It does not even evaluate the basket. No no. This is the juice that gathers on the bottom of the industrial cellars, which are located in particularly impassable neighborhoods after an exceptionally humid summer. Marking a trash would mean depreciating the trash everywhere. It was so bad that I had to register with IMDb and warn my neighbor. This figure luvahire claims that this movie is great. One must doubt his grasp of reality. Let's take some of his comments and analyze them. "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a very good job." I see. Well, if the director imagined that his audience was hurrying and winning every sentence that Ricky had spoken, or alternately exploded into uncontrollable laughter at a time when most of the directors wanted a slightly darker reaction from the audience, then yes; Ricky did a great job. "" I'm an aspiring actor who took me to the theater myself and I had to play where I have to cry, and it's not easy to be emotional in such an environment I give props to actors who have to make an emotional scene and pull it off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href='http://www.freedominion.com.pa/phpBB2/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=500'> Fly </a> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was your teacher at school, I would only disappoint the note myself. <br /> <br /> I'm too disgusted to continue. Now I'm going to overturn the movie that my associate, Mr. Bangla, is attacking. /> How does it work? If you have read so much, I find it obvious that you have already seen the movie, and now you are looking for one of two things in this commentary: 1) Another vitriolic depreciation of what you agree is an exceptionally bad film. ) Another vitriolic worsening of what you think was a good kinematic effort that needs to defend against it's against such a catastrophe like me. Whether you want to help talk about your disgust or ammunition when I say something good, it will just disappoint you - and so I assure you there is a little chance of such disappointment. <br /> <br /> The other negative comments here in IMDb have already quantified the specific shortcomings of the movie (eg, acting, soundtrack, overhead, dialogue, editing, etc.), but all these mistakes can easily be forgiven, and the same. Few people lend a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead" if they require these elements to be top-notch. The ultimate failure of the "Hood", however, is his failure to honor the oath of his name. "Hood of the Living Dead" practically jumps from a shelf to a video rental company with the consequences of injured one-time and frantic creative killing. There was a chance that they mix soy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto so that the zombies of the gangsta-thuga bomb 'on innocent life while rockin' do-rags to make undead pimps drive over 'all - too fatal mail in their irritated rides . The mixture of both genres could be cheerful. Instead, the film is more like watching high school children shy to deliver the lines to the game they play, but they do not understand. In order to avoid a sense of betrayal on the part of their viewers, we recommend that the Quiroz brothers re-publish the movie with the following new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: Home horror video we shot on our video camera with several friends during the summer weekend were bored ". Or they could release it as a document. "Today's creativity has died: exploring how a low-budget film can be perfectly deprived of clever or original thinking, even though links to the main movie studio are missing." <br /> <br /> A potential tenant whose interest was not suppressed should be on the back of the video: "The Quiroz Brothers have again shown that watching things you can easily do is not very interesting."
