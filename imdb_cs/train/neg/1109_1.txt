This is almost certainly the worst West I've ever seen. The story follows a pattern that is especially common for westerns and martial arts - the hero learns that the family / friends have been murdered, so the hero decides to exact vengeance, the ineffectual code of the film, rescues the kidnapped loving girl, and kills the arch-nemesis expert in the brutal duel. This formula was often successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most powerful execution you ever see. Scripting is cruelly simple and insulting; It sounds like a high school girl has written a dialogue because she lacks depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. Cinematography is lame and sets are sometimes only facades. The game is pitiful; surely some artists can blame the scenario, but others can not use this justification. I hope I never saw Chris Lybbert talking; every time he says a line that should be exasperated or malicious, he does nothing but reduce his voice and just sounds like a child trying to make a macho. And when you talk about Chris Lybbert playing Hopalong, check out his bagpipes (if you dare watch this movie): He wears this brand new outfit that makes him look more like Roy Rogers than a heavy and dirty cowboy. If you do not like movie fares that serve only to honor Hopalong Cassidy's fantastic grandeur, then you will get it, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.
