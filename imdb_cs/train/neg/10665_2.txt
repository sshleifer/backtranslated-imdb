About three minutes into this, I quickly started forward and stopped only during the nudity (why are so bad movies ever so beautiful women?). Within ten minutes, I ended up and I wish I could get my money back. People who write these films should be approved by the MPAA. Come writers - all the bad people ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the remote control of good guy! This is how it has been done since the times of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to hurt the injuries, the "twist" at the end was so formal that it could have come from any action movie written over the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies. This movie is just a waste of time - it's running away! Run away!
