I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I ordered a movie from Amazon.UK so I can see it without waiting forever before it comes to the US. I really should save money. What about Anna running after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character is that she was calm and refined. It is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, had a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal nor normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters that made their "romance" incredible. In the final scene, even Sally Hawkins is wearing the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same dress does not make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not see the version of 1995 that, although she had mistakes, remained close to the book. The book, I do not even think they read it. This is a bit like Cliff's Notes of Persuasion. Hit all high points without explaining anything.
