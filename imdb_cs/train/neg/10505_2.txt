If you liked the "Blair with" you will like it. It has the same bad work with camera and soundtrack and has the same non-existent conspiracy and exciting moments. He also has Tom Savini, so if you like Romero "Dawn of the Dead" or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk to Dawn" you are on favors. It's an icon and a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is definitely the smartest movie I've seen a long time ago, and I've seen a lot of movies - too bad. I can tell you that most horror movies I find fun, but it was just a waste of time. The only reason why I shot this movie 2 instead of 1 was naked chickens and hot acting with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I had to leave out before I hit the "submit" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if she has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
