When you go to an open-air cinema on a Greek summer night, you usually do not like what the movie is like! Edison has begun to do well with the good efforts of the singers - who want to be actors and once again great Morgan Freeman, but ... (The movie is usually a good start to capture the audience, done, a bit boring, but a story full of a movie that is more about characters and less about action, done and the third part is something really good, so you remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite cops (full of weapons that can destroy the building) shoot at the guy behind the car, can not strike him once while killing all but 3) and then that guy takes a flame thrower (destroys the rest 3), you realize that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is too good to disperse such a movie!
