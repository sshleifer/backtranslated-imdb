Schoolgirl Martha (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a laboratory explosion (also set up) where his face is scarred with acid. A few years later, all the dwarves were invited back to high school (because they were closed) at a meeting. What they did not know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them. Then the storm begins, they are locked in school and Marty is getting revenge. Pretty stupid. Murders are ingenious and cruel and there are some scary atmospheric footage of an abandoned school - but that's all about it. The humiliation caused by Scuddamore is more than cruel (it is rid of it, it has its head on its back and it is ignited) and it is inconvenient to watch. Since Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after he was released, it is almost impossible to see. Also, this movie has faded from its path to nakedness. There is a full Scuddamore queue (surprising for a movie), but one girl decides to take the bath herself ... Being aware that the killer is wandering through them! And then there's a couple who must have sex. This is the type of movie where the killer seems to know where they are all and they can teleport with them. It ends in a twist that moaned me and raised my eyes and then spun that I wanted to throw something on television! Efficacy is tolerable - not good but tolerable. Caroline Munro is in it too. She's a very beautiful woman, but it's not a lot of actresses. It gets 3 for some effectively bloody murders and atmosphere. Otherwise, it's a mill run and forgetting. Scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves.
