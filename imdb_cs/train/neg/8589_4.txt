First of all let me prevent this post by saying that I am a fan of Star Wars movies ... I do not read books, play games, wear lingerie or eat cereals (if there). I'm just a movie fan. With what I have been saying, I'm trying to see how people give this movie so much praise. We take this film in its own right and do not distinguish it from its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say it's an amazing movie. For all the terrible deficiencies in the scenario - cheese dialogue, scenarios (that means R2 is suddenly bad and long CGI intense chasing, which have a little human tinge), HORRIBLE playing and a marked plot of holes ... how good is it? There was no real internal dilemma in Anakin; it seemed to me that the switch turned and suddenly it was evil. I have not been interested in the movie for the last 20 minutes (which in the end destroyed "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein's scene). When you BOMBARD screen with amazingly great CGI effects and fill in gaps with absolutely horrifying disposable flakes, if you could and should have more information, it's no great music. For a movie with such a "dark" tone, too many left in the speech of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I struck out with the question: From the beginning to the end of the movie, the feeling of urgency and importance for what actually happened?
