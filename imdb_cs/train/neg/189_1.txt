This movie has a beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, he has no plot. In order to have a conspiracy, there must be a conflict. This movie had none. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and never did any activities. The image is trying to be artistic, but it can not pay attention to the basics of telling stories. <br /> <br /> If you love the scenery in Montana and fly the fish, you will find some value in this movie, just do not expect the story. There is none.
