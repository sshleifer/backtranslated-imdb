Before watching this movie I had very low expectations and just went see cars. Finally, I even regretted going for this reason. Plot almost does not exist. Character development does not exist. There was a lot of clich√©s and muscular muscles in that movie that I could just stare at and wonder how it was even released. If not for exotics, I would not even rate this movie 1. An attempt at a coherent storyline will destroy the absolute absurdity of this elite culture of racing and the laughter that make up its members. In fact, the film plot is so predictable and simple that an average child could predict most of the plot. Bad behavior, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> You do not see it. Play Gran Turismo HD and satisfy your desires for fast sexy vehicles without having to leave a bad smell.
