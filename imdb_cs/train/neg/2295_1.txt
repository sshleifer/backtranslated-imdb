An insignificant, boring film with a charismatic Mercuri is totally unnecessary. Released Thursday in Thursday in one local cinema and avoided the entire Sydney population, except me and four others. BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors such as John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better results (well, Polson has become the moral director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems to never have guernsey in addition to roles. But Paul Mercurio should become one of the largest Australian exports on the screen. Such roles are the main disappointments and such films are just a loss of talent and time.
