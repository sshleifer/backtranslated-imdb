Lame, a clich√© superhero action movie. I had a lot of hope for this movie, and the genre of HK buddies is such that I do not deny, but very rarely I see a story like this and ridiculous like this one. That would be forgiven because it is always in such films when it compensates for the action, unfortunately it was not. This action bears the surprise of the trademarks and the overwhelming nature of HK's actions, but it is not too obscene, obscenely cruel, and in fact often quite inconsistent (perhaps due to re-editing for the US edition, it shows signs in many patchwork locations). I was very disappointed.
