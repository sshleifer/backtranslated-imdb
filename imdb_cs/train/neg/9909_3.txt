It was not well done by the West. You have this nut that runs around in the blazing sun in a pram with a parasol and kills people for their own reasons. You have the same person who sits in the snow cave during the blizzard and cut off the pieces of your anatomy that were frosty. Then you have a woman in the house in the middle of somewhere to shoot wolves that are not there. What is the purpose of this film? Could Bruce Dern not find anything better? It was the loss of the movie.
