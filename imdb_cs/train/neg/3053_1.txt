Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. has never influenced anyone? This steam pile of olem excrements is a perfect case; it makes "The Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes the worst show Keith Richards look like my first night's emission. I had nightmares, you know you wake up and sweat bullets that will never come close to the terrible terror that Santa Claus has uncovered from my seemingly pure soil. But I can think of some parties where this film could really go well. Also, if you are looking for the perfect example of the dichotomy of Santa-Satan on the VHS tape, look no further. Do not let me take a look at this movie because I was notified that the MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
