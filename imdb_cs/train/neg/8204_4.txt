Neriginal, over-predictable and just a fun, low-cost rehash of sci-fi formulation that we've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists isolated confronted with an unknown stranger and from all places (surprise, surprise) Antarctica! <br /> <br /> The film contains James Spader and almost helpless acting actor (with the exception of Carl Lewis, which is actually not so bad for a non-actor) - who delivers ho-hum performances that do little to encourage a notable dialogue scenario. To make things worse, the film speed is slow, almost no subplot, and a few steps action is stereotypical and not so exciting. No wonder this thing went straight to the DVD. What's amazing is why Spader - a great actor who, at the time he won the Cannes Best Actor award for Sex, Lies and Videotape, and a great job in the innovative science fiction movie Stargate, has decided to sign this flawless project. Or maybe not if you look at his career because he seems to have invested his talents into more mistakes than hits. The most remarkable thing about "Alien Hunter" is how they have strained so many elements from so many great sci-fi movies and it has become so blatant and conceived. There are huge borrowed pieces from "The Thing" (as Howard Hawks 'original and John Carpenter's remarkable 1982 remake), `Contact' and 'Outbreak'; Alien "," CE3K "," Andromeda Tribe "," Kubrick's "2001" (ie "Foreign Black Box") and "Mission To Mars" (ie even a little dash of "sneakers" "(though not the sci-fi movies share the" cryptology "of the connection.) Hell, there are also corn soups and Antarctica as well as the last X movie file, and the light translucent spacecraft at the end looks exactly like something that was excluded from "Everything was done before, and it did much better, even though I admit there were a few mild surprises to come to an end." I would say something about the plot, but it is not necessary at all. , without seeing it (5 of 10)
