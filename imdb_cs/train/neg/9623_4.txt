Ben Stiller does not have so many responses. And it does it very well. She's very dependent on the comedy that's happening around him. There's something about Mary, the stand-up hair scene works just because Stiller is trying to keep his face straight. When she meets two other Mary suitors, she is the most dangerous guy in the room, but the scene is cheerful. In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to understand. Stiller is surrounded by a number of comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman will get the best lines, of which there is too little. He said that Hoffman relies heavily on body humor - you know we're in trouble when they go to jokes of your finger to make fun of them. The basketball scene on which Hoffman is throwing is totally exaggerated (though throwing it into an enemy without a shirt that rises - a smile - apparently through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be in a bubble, there is very little reaction. The characters of Hoffman and Stiller were able to bounce a lot, much more. Aniston will again take on Rachael's role, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more like the "Joey with the Rachel's Burst" scenario. <br /> <br /> Polly is rom-com and it's his failure - he's missing his heart. You do not have the root for the characters. With a little work, we might have a deeper story, but eventually the film's failure turns into bad writing. It's worth watching if they appear on TV on a slow night, but you'll regret choosing the cash to see it.
