this movie was banned in England? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others have done much worse and before that ... such a movie has all the basic elements of the decent 70s and 80s film. good-looking girls (who by the way can not save their lives), a terrible storm with a storm, a scythe, a crazy brother who travels after a family home, and at the end a pretty damn crumb. but forbidden? seriously. when the English Parliament banned this film, the Italians are probably laughing at their collective shit about how it was back and forth really the brothers. Perhaps maybe two minutes of the total screen time devoted to violence and gore (which was very underdone). there was nudity, but no sex, though the links to sex were made, of course. but absolutely nothing that would be banned. I would like to see what could be done if the creators had a decent budget to work with. as is the case at present, the movie is fun, but the lack of image and sound quality is reflected by the result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
