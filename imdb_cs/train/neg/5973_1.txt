This film is another good example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, probably since 1997, seems to be the best thing to bring a movie of the year before the release of the films. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they did. Every joke attempt, every attempt at the moment and a sorry attempt at a love story were exactly what I predicted in my mind. Make a favor and save on this money.
