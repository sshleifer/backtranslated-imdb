Wow, what broke! The fact that people think this movie is scary is ridiculous. Special effects were a direct reflection of the "Ring". Story? Was there one? It's not in my opinion ... Just a few crazy pictures. The whole movie was a dull, stupid mess. I think there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. But this is the worst horror movie I have seen for years. And that Buffy cat? Well, she's a bad actress! Like plastic like Barbie and just as talented .. No, wait, it would be an insult to Barbie talents! I think a lot of movies helped this movie in the box because it was PG-13, and if it was rated R, it would be bombed by the IMO! Stupid movie!
