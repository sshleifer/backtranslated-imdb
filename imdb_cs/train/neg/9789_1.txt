It should be called this film: "He accepted the Brother Mouse, somewhat inspired by some vague memory of Stuart Little, who just refused the book a bit, but mostly remembered the cover" If it was not so misleading, it would have better reviews . But seriously, make your children a favor and let them read the book. They could actually learn something instead of spending their minds in what we all know as a Hollywood film. The Stuart book is little about the mouse, it's about a man who is very small and a mouse similar. Born to his parents, he was not accepted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and about the way he is going. There is a cat named Snowball, who thinks it's food and wants to eat, but Snowball can not talk. <br /> <br /> In the movie, they picked up everything. I think the only things that led the book were the boat race and the names.
