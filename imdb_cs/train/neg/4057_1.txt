It's a very boring movie. If you have grown up during a Vietnamese movie, like me, I have seen and heard all the films and arguments here a hundred times. But what really makes this movie boring is the story of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the film is filmed with Sherwood, who speaks directly to the camera about his views on this conflict time in our nation's history. If you are old enough to memorize Vietnam, you will find something new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another document about Vietnam. Younger viewers interested in this subject should see the great George Butler Going Upriver movie! The stolen honor was clearly meant to become John Kerry's ax but failed unsatisfactorily to achieve that goal.
