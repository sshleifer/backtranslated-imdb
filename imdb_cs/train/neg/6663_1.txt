I can not stand this show! Was there ever even one redeemed quality, one funny punch line or one conspiracy line that did not "make" the average viewer want to drown in a bowl of wet cornflakes? <br /> <br /> Oh, you terrible, lousy voices. Akin repeatedly attracts a set of fine cutlery through the dustbrush, each character is uniquely annoying in its ability for crystal nasal vocals. Cosmo sounds like a grumpy babe, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical joke, and Timmy's father makes every line as a bad impersonation of the game host (Guy Smiley of "Sesame Street" comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Animation is terrible; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the tremendously bad artwork at this show. Each character has buck teeth or a square head or three heads too large for his body. And what is the fact that the characters speak every line with wide eyes and a smile, as if they were talking to the President with a photopoin? Then there is the fact that every character on the show is utterly sad. No, because the fine grace of Amelie Bedelie, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck of the glory "Charles in the Fee" were characters characterized as unrealistically stupid. Usually "unrealistic" is synonymous with "unfunny", and that is definitely the case. There are not so many gossip-based gossip because "Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the presumption of the show (and it's just like every episode, so great a time synder notices here): Timmy wishes something with his two "Pretty Oddparents", something goes wrong, there's always some imaginable reason, why he can not immediately reverse the course and wish for damage, and then everything will ultimately turn out. Oh, and on the side note, Timmy's parents never believe when he complains about Vicky and they will continue to employ her at every occasion. Perhaps it's just me, but it seems like a kid's show that contains a fine message that does not quite mean it would be good to say to a rough babysitter is probably not a great idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing paper and you want to give an example of the extent to which the quality of cartoons has dropped, the "odd odd parents" must be a great place to start. The first example of television producers who collectively collect a worthless product for children with little or no effort, simply because they know someone is watching them somewhere.
