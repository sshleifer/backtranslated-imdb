I've seen this move some years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival, as I recall. I liked it, it turned out to me that it has great potential. I think most people here are filming this film because it seemed that the movie looks hobbled together (at the film's own discretion at the official site - the short one was exposed as a "rough cut"). <br /> <br /> But it was a comedy that evolved easily. I think many people are trying to read too much into comedy. All they have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I just did it when it turned out and so it did. Just my 2 cents.
