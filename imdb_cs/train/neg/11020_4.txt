First, with names such as Fred Olen Ray, Brinke Stevens and Jan-Michael Vincent, plus distributors such as "Rhino" and "Troma" on the video box, you know what to get. B movie mania! If you really expect to see the thriller "Based on Edgar Allan Poe," forget about it and look for the excellent Roger Corman 60s Poe series. It is a pure, rude tangle (only with a pedestrian attempt similar to "premature burial"), complemented by lots of sex and nudity ready for sex with the R video. However, it is definitely fun and entertaining in a way ... Brinke has three naked scenes in the first 30 minutes) plays a rich, traumatized, insomniac Victoria Monroe whose fear of being prematurely rooted stems from her belief that her father had the same fate (Hoke Howell). Her worthless husband, Terry (Jay Richardson), has paid off some serious debt from gambling (owed to the gangster by Robert Quarry) and with her pussy, blonde sex secretary Lisa (Delia Sheppard) Brinke for her money. Actress Karen Black, named for her prize, the band briefly worn as a blond wig hypnotist (is too talented to play such an insignificant role) 50th sci-fi / horror star Robert Clarke plays a doctor and a family friend and shows Michael Berryman to a decent nightmare that has done an autopsy on the still-living Vicki. Jan-Michael Vincent usually sits behind the house in the car and makes goo-goo eyes when Brinke enters and emits a home. Killing-partner-pro-heredity a million times before is the end of unintentional laughter (ending with a straight tear of the Zuni Fetish Doll in TRILOGY TERROR) and one who has created a horrible dull face and robbed his FX head for this release needs to speed up his skills a bit . Brinke does a decent job and her character is somewhat sympathetic, but the biggest surprise of all is how good a former Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is in her role. She stole every scene she was in, and easily gave her excellent performance.
