This "movie" is such a bad job! It does not seem to be real or realistic. The plot is weak, it works - miserable, the actors were interested in themselves as in the first year of production, trying very hard to act without chances from the beginning. What a flop! What is the waste of time, money and effort of all involved, including the audience. Well, as in any thriller, there are murders, corpses, and blood. Just imagine someone who committed a knife murder 5 minutes ago and went out quietly and smiled, not talking about being as pure as a whistle, as if a throat had been crossed by a virtual agent. This murder was also to be made by a small, fragile woman on a tall, strong man and she said her throat !!! She asked politely to move her to her? Much more stupidity of the same kind happens and leaves the audience wondering if it means to be a joke that turned out to be bad. Continuity is another huge problem, such as: An eager hungry bridegroom lies in bed, awaiting his virgin bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long time to fall asleep (!?!). The next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area and asking for a scenery guide! NO WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT ??? Such a waste of time, even though we are trying to write about this low-low "supposed" movie.
