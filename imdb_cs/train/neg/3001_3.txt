Slaughter Invoke the story of a vengeful guy who has been the victim of one of the most beautiful and coldest jokes in cinema history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening of the swing he went straight to hell. A very tedious and superfluous disorder with average slashings and last half an hour, which sucked into a whole new level of suckiness. The guy he played was actually killed shortly after his release. If you want to rent a movie, stop it after joking and remember to choose life.
