It is not a bad start to the program - but what is in the face of genuine law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it attempts to quantify itself as a reality - and is nothing but. Men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve better results. What's next, medical school a minute? Charo performs lipo? Charles Grodin Helps Hip Replacement? C'mon ... show some respect. Even Muncie citizens export the program as staged. Police Academy = Gymnasium? Bad editing (how many times can Taco Bell be used in the car?), Cheese siren effect (the same loop has added to the museum for each "call" whether it is coding or not) and last, but last but not least, other issues related to officer security, before you could shake your wand. If I want to see the manufactured police work and the fake cops, I would watch RENO 911.
