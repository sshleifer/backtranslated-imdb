This is another of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal cats who kill to live, etc. - a variant of the vampire concept. <br /> <br /> The thing that causes it to fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that if you want to survive, you need less attention - look how long it took to capture Unibomber, and that was because the family member realized it. a child (and to a lesser extent a mother) behave as if they were inviolable. The child kills without the idea of ​​leaving no evidence of a trace or a living witness. How these people managed to stay alive throughout the month is incredible, let alone ten years or centuries. It's really a shame - it could be a lot more if it was written in a plausible way - it gives the main people the level of common sense they need to get so long. <br /> <br /> Besides, this is not a bad impression. I loved it at the end, where every cat in the town approaches the house - every time I have a meal on the porch and seeing our cats suddenly hurry from anywhere before, I think of the scene.
