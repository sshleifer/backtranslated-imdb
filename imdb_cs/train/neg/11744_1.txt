After finally watching this movie in its entirety, I was totally locked up with the adoration that was gained by critics and online users. Is it the worst western ever? No, I would not say that. But "the last great American West," the phrase I've seen has more than once done it? Not even close. The film that tries to tell such a story requires credible characters talking about a credible dialogue, and the dialogue in this movie is among the most exhausted and clich√© I've ever seen. Film can be measured in coins per minute; like how many times is an actor or actress forced to tell something that nobody would say in real life? There are so many examples of how it scatters. Cheese lines come to you in waves; predictable, non-original, and often. <br /> <br /> If the bad dialogue does not bother you, what bad weapons? Few Westerners can show you that you have not been able to fight, which is absolutely unbelievable when you are desperately trying to take you seriously. It's okay if there's such a comic as in Silverado, but in Tombstone there's a very staged and very stiff choreography of an early armory just another reason why this movie leaves the list of good westerns. The final showdown is a little bit to buy the director for it, but then I was so immaculate in the film that it was out of salvation. Apart from the flaws, I can say that the visuals are amazing - the movie is well shot and set everything looks great. Conduct is acceptable, especially with regard to what actors were put to work with. However, if you are looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go instead to Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
