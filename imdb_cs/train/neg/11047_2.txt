There are two reasons why I did not do this one. One of the reasons is some actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) who have tried to play at their usually good level of negotiation. However, in many scenes, they were somehow blocked by bad scripting. The second reason is a great idea and look at Cyborg, which is quite different from most of the similar roles I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is just as bad as it may be. Boring scenes, unnecessary and boring dialogues, bad scripting work. And it seemed to be the first film for many actors. It could have been an interesting story, but they failed completely.
