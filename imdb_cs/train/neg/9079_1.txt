What are people talking about? I had to see a different movie than you. I was so boring I left the theater. What's going on with these things. I only laughed, and it was not difficult. Who should be the green film to be taken to the street and be defeated. I always find something in the movie, but that's crazy. "Slackers" makes "No Another Teen Movie" look like a classic. This is one of the worst of such garbage as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory". WAIT WITH ALL COSTS! I thought the studios were giving away money to people when they left the theater as a sign of their apology, but because of my horror that had not happened. Looks like I can never see the money for two hours.
