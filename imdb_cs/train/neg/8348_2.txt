I just watched "El Otro". I have always taken my hat on the performance of Julie Chavez because he is a great actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I think it would be even worse if it was not for Julia. Anyway, it's definitely a movie that you'll never understand if you're not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would recommend you do not borrow this movie to have a nice time with your girlfriend, friend, family or friends ... it's really depressing and incredibly slow, and the story does not make much sense. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is strange and strange to capture you with scenes that shock you a little. It offers you something to think, but not a good way. Overall, I definitely did not like this movie.
