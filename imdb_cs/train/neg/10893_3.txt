This is one of those films that should have been much better than it turned out to be. I'm afraid to think about what an approved blockbuster should look like, because the director's cut on the DVD was a drill of epic proportions. Naturally, you do not expect it to be "The Godfather," but the acting class or two might be useful. There were so many cute boys in this movie, but they were unfortunately underestimated. I like when I look at their BVD looking at how another guy was, but I even have the right to expect a little more. But it was not a total loss; at least we looked at Drew Fuller (covered in) junk mail and a really upsetting hairstyle. And Huntley Ritter looks even better than he did in "Bring It" (and it's also about). There's always a silver lining, kids. Just try to do it. And sometimes you have to use the pause button.
