After reading the first 5 IMDb reviews, I was very excited about this film. But it's really a terrible movie, the total time you see is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is tense), acting is over the top of the story, oh boy, which story? <br /> <Story is probably not in the way, first capture the aliens (after 7 years, eventually succeeding), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want (why the hell captured?). Then the girlfriend who acts is the most over the top, wants to leave this madness, then suddenly does it, then does it again and then not. Then they conclude that the killing of an alien kills the entire human race (and remember that no one else has ever seen these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? They torture him and blow a bunch of foreigners on the peaces. This is my first IMDb review, I'm a very lazy person writing very early, so listen to my warning: this motion is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
