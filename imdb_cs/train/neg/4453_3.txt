I'm sure people will follow this move outside of Britian this movie will be a fun watch, but for someone from the UK it is painful in his fault. Right at the beginning of the movie, Elijah Wood is going to drop the trumpet at a bank station that was destroyed. He tells his sister who is meeting: "What happened here," and she says, "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham are already in the city .. they are part of the city, they do not go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight with other fans, the last place on the ground they would do is a bank station where there is probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. There are several other similar mistakes, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan. He clearly decided that it was not worth talking to the East End accent and instead chose the fake model Dick Van Dyke, which made me bleeding from my ears. This was highlighted by the fact that the rest of his gang all spoke as you would expect West Ham fans to talk about. This mistake made him an incredible role and really messed up the movie.
