To be honest, I heard it was bad enough for me to follow, but I can never let others influence my views, in fact, I'm more likely to look at something of resistance! Bullwhip had one more thing for me to look at, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in him, I was immediately interested. The picture is not very good and it's really morally dubious, all the characters are corrupted and shifted in one form or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victory, that's all good and good if the surrounding film proves justice to a lot of scrupulous people and they are tense the climax that shakes the picture. Unfortunately, it's not, and when the final is filling your eyes with sugar, you can not help screaming that you've been cheated into watching a pretty bad movie, nobody in the star goes out with any credit, with guy Madison lead painfully wooden in extreme. <br /> <br /> Even the beautiful Rhonda can not recommend it to someone, 3/10
