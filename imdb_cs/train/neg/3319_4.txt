I was surprised to see this movie. I hear it's the best one ever made of the novel. How disappointed I am. <br /> <br /> Any real fan Jane Austen can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The screenwriters decided to hold in pieces of laughter, which are embarrassing at the best times, but they also destroy the feeling of the season. As for the actor: Gwyneth Paltrow is doing a somewhat fluent heroine (but in such a case any "hot" American star would be questionable), Toni Collette is a miscast and poor Ewan McGregor looks laughing! <br /> <br /> I really could not say a good thing about this movie. It seems to be among very few people who do not rate it, but if you want advice, look at the TV production headed by Kate Beckinsale - believe me it is much better than this superficial waste.
