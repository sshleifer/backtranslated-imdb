Why is this generic title? Baby Jesus??? So motionless and unpredictable. Films that had previously tried to spend on the festive spirit, most notably, that "Santa Claus was married to the Martians," at least had fun watching him for coming to him, and all the used films ... for some reason that he seemed happy me. But this movie just tricks Christmas in the ass and shortens the joy of all children. Does Santa Live in the Universe? His enemy is a devil named Pitch? Santa gets help from Merlin Magician? How casual is this? Well, because it was done in Mexico, then some of you could understand the way the movie was made. I had to admit that some of these effects were just shocking for the time. It was a pervasive pile of madness! Still, despite all the problems with movies, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good Good Evil and Christmas still play part of our hearts of every good little girl or boy in the world, or maybe the universe, thanks to Santa Claus conquering the Martians .. apparently. I think you should try it, even though it's one of the worst holiday movies ever ... though he would smile every day on his face.
