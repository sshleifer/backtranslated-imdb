<br /> <br /> The film, which looks cheap and ugly, does not kill children in the audience, except for one very entertaining toilet joke. Christopher Lloyd is too distant in this direction and is quite tiring in this role, though a justifiable excuse for writers' jokes does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateur in an alleged comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah are avoiding humiliation. There is really no reason to do this, especially because it is inevitable that we compare it to Robin Williams' often brilliant improvisations in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
