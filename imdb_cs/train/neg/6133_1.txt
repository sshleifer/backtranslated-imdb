Kurt Thomas star as Jonathan Cabot is a gymnast who coaches for a special game that involves hunting by a group of ninjas but those ninjas will not have a chance, especially since the Cabot gymnast! Taken as a whole, Gymkata is one bad film of helluva, crazy acting, horrible script, and really incompetent direction making quality under human standards, but this movie is so terrible that it really is really fun. I mean a dialogue like "I know I'll overcome them!" or "Ha! your pass!" we only add to the fancy value Gymkata gets. Besides, it is (wisely) the only film that has the hero of a gymnast who finds things that rock in the hot spot.
