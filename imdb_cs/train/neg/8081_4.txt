One of the science fiction requirements, at least before it becomes a satire, is that it is somewhat likely. I believe that a bomb against the substance would cause much more damage than what was intended. But I'll let the physicists see the solar crisis. It is a crisis faced by the earth, because the sunlight has completely lost itself. They are getting closer to Earth, so much that they become disproportionately hot, as if the whole country was the Death Valley. The answer is the insect bomb that the spacecraft will have to take in the sun and explode there. This will discourage flares in saying the direction to say that Mercury provides it is not in direct alignment with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who will deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That's if he can keep his mind in business, not his fledged son, Corin Nemec. Caring for the personal face of family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and grandfather Nemec. There's also a villain, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational company that is trying to control the global food supply for survivors. A thought he could not survive does not fit into his thinking. He does everything to sabotage the mission of Matheson. The solar crisis seems to be a bad combination of 2001, Space Odyssey and Voyage at the bottom of the sea. Boyle looks like he takes his grandson from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently the only one in the cast who realizes he is turkey and exaggerated. The remaining casts are bold, true blue and matte. In addition to the desert rat Jack Palance, who finds German and cares for him. <br /> <br /> The key is that the movie was directed by Allen Smithee, a Hollywood supplier of flop films. The film shoots up to four stars to fill the cast, and it was on time thanksgiving.
