I was really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was a serial mom and I loved her. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I watched Polyester and really hated him. All I liked was the movie DIVINE. She had a hell of great talent. I was really surprised. Overall, I would not recommend this movie ...
