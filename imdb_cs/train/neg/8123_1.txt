(spoilers) Wow, that's bad. I made a double departure when I watched the old Star Trek episode the other day - that's where everyone got into the disease with the cosmic disease and then a little nuts - and there was Stewart Moss, an inexpressible "hero" of Life at Night! He played the first infected crew members who died of terminal depression. All I thought was that he had been watching his own movie too many times, which caused depression. This film is full of really unforgettable people. There is no redeemed character in the movie, not one. It is very hard to feel bad when Dr. Beck turns into a bat (or what has actually changed) because he simply does not like it. And you do not like his exciting, bony wife, or the unpleasant, stupid Sgt. Ward or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest in this movie for some time or energy? Where there is no empathy with characters, there is no reason to bother. Not to mention horrible cinematography, which showed that the film was shot with urine, and five thousand special effects, many of which looked like pieces of fan-fed paper to simulate hordes of bats. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K but it's definitely down there.
