Remake today, this movie would be a very scary, very disturbing dark comedy. Stalking, the obsession and web of lies and manipulations are given by the gloss of 1948 that they are not - they are cute harmlessness. Drake plays a stalker, an unsatisfied user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays a prosecution victim, alternately angry and unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> Very disturbing; I was not able to look at the classic romance with the same suspension of mistrust ever since. <br /> <br />
