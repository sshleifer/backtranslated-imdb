The Star Creatures invasion would certainly be in the "so bad a good" category if the film was not so sexist or racist. That's the way it just makes it just bad. It has the same kind of stubborn stereotypical sexism that you have seen in the queen of cosmic space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case native Americans) that you would find in the 1930s and 1940s. As for not to be funny, the same walk across the cave is repeated more than ten times during this relatively short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but he can not work for two impressions of Cagney in a row, or with Peter Lorre when he tries to do that). There are no production values ​​to talk about because "Star Creatures" make Ro-Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from the universe look like creations of industrial light and spell. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely the foremost part of what you would have to call an early independent cinematographer ... not far enough for these theaters and enough good for nothing but the last feature of the all-day drive. /> <br />
