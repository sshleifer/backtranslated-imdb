There is no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no top ... nothing. However, he has several good combat scenes that are really good. So you go ... like the overall movie is pretty bad, but if you like a helpless movie that offers nothing but a good action scene, then look at this movie. Do not expect anything more than just that. I also played and it was not that bad direction .. Several buddies from Kimba and Caran ... I was looking to see Caran a little more in this movie .. he is a good warrior and really hot girls .... White is a great warrior and a decent actor . I really hope he can make a better film in the future so we can truly enjoy his art ... Recognize the movie together with White and Jaou ... that would be amazing
