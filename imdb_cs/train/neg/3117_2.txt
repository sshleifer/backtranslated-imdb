My husband is a huge fan of Robin Williams. I like him too, but in general I find he should "stick to what he does best" and concentrate on comedic roles. My thoughts were confirmed by this film. Throughout the movie, I was completely bored. The story was predictable. I realize he's inspired by a true story. But my guess is that there might be some tension or intrigue, even while keeping the truth in the story. None of the characters were well developed. It was a story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could be further explored. More important, however, would be deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy". Her psychological profile would be interesting. Obviously, he has a long history that no one has ever touched until the surface. If my husband was not such a huge fan of Williams, we would have left him for 20 minutes. Pity I can not get 20 or 2 hours back.
