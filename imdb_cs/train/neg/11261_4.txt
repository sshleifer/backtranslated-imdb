First of all, I must emphasize that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yeah, some things happen, but you do not know why or what. When you finally see things, you realize that it's nothing but a twisted little girl who deals with adult prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons ... The characters are rather poor and the actors (especially the young ones) do not help much that makes it look credible. Only Marisa Paredes excels, but she's a great actress, no matter if the film is pure waste. The only positive thing to say about "Frío Sol de Invierno" is that débutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions and made some scenes that are quite intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br / > <br /> * My number: 4/10
