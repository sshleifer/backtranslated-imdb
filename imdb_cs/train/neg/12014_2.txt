A terrible spy secret with a predictable conspiracy about the dangers of World War II. The secret is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. Best acting is done by Raymond Massey as Doctor Ingersoll, a good doctor turned to evil. He is the head of the spy circle trying to get information from Amnesty Jane, encrypted information on allied activities. Will it say? Remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as an accomplice to Massey. The role played by John Garfield (like Dr. Lewis) is just disastrous. It seems so bad that casting must be considered one of the worst in the film of history. It is unfortunate that such a talented actor is filled with a role that is not in tune with his talents. The film is at one glance, although it is half of the spy and half of the gangster film and although it contains a show of stereotypical characters. It is easy to forget, amnesia is not necessary.
