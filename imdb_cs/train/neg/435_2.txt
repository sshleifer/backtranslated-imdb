The old intellectual discusses what he regards as art in movies. You'll get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and other things 80 years ago. To hide that he does not think what's going on in the cinema today, he's throwing himself into the Matrix. But it's not just the same coincidence. This speech is limited to obsolete psychological fantasies: ego-super-ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It is adorned with the cheese effect that Zizte plays in the films he is interested in. For someone who should know about movies, it's actually a film: yeiks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7 on the screen, or according to the words of a great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Lord (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most bold idiots I've ever heard. At no time in your tiny, inconsistent reaction, you were even close to something that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now stupid because they are listening. I attach you (two) points (and only) and God can love your soul.
