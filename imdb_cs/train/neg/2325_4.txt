the first scanners did not have to be a great movie, but at least it was original. It's not such a novelty. This is worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special. as the dialog.and special effects are not better than in the original. This is the film is lower than the first in all ways. The only other thing about it is that it is loud and messy in times.but it does not mean to do a good movie.if they do something better with the story and it makes it interesting, it could be a decent film. In fact, it could not go through it without a quick transfer over it. It's me, it's a forgotten movie and much more. despite the fact that there are worse movies. are in a great mood, I'll give Scanners 2 4/10.
