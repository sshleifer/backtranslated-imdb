I wish I could have this movie out of ten. Before I got to this movie the day after it came out, I came to IMDb to look at the comments. A comment called a predictable movie and cheese with a terrible dialogue. I never went to other people's minds, so I lost seven dollars for this fucking movie. It must have been one of the best movies I've ever seen. The person who wrote the script should be pushed out of the cliff. Since when are scary movies a fading scene? I swear, I am amazed that there were no moments of GROUP HUG ^ - ^. I think I jumped. Once. That's because I said goodbye and thought about my research paper for English. Clich√©, birds / cat that emerged from nothing when you thought something was going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost laughed when the alarm came and the main character said, "I gotta get my mother's scarf!" You. Idiot. Draw a scarf! Security is just a few steps away, but NO, the lady's scarf (which does not fit the dress by the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all, they took her back to the house because they knew the murderer knew where he lived. God. My friend and I also predicted the whole movie. And not just that, I think he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was, "He stole the ringing of his clothes and slipped out of the hotel" and "It's a detective who descends down the corridor, not a murderer!" moments. Films should NEVER be predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> I'm going to finish my rant by saying, it was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see theaters so I would not buy him for $ 15 and then I hate him. It was bad. It would be better if only one happened. If he was shot dead by a detective, the killer fell in the same position he shot him. A knife in his hand that fell and stabbed a girl on her way down. Oh, how beautiful it would be. Do not waste your time or money. Check out a good movie.
