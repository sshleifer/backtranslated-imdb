James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what has ever done a role in this unfortunate garbage. Affleck is just a lightweight one that simply can not cut, the rest of the cast is really unforgettable. I saw it in the US in an empty theater, I soon knew why the space was empty after 10 minutes. I went out before the end, he was so bad, imagine how surprised I was when I returned to England. I saw a movie that had a terrible news on this Sunday market on Sunday from the joy of "Paul Ross." I always rely on Ross to save money on cinema tickets, if he says the movie is good, I'll go straight to this website to check it out. This movie should go directly to DVD 1.99 GBP in a supermarket near you.
