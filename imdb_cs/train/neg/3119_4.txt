Robin Williams performed at The Night Listener with great performance, just like other cast members. It seems, however, that the film is submerged and leaves too many free ends to be seen as "must see". I think the problem is because there is not enough strong relationship between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to explain this because IMDb wants to automatically correct the spelling to "Nobody"). The movie runs a little over 01:30 and during the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, Noon begins to look for Pete Logand, the boy of the caller. This happens after talking to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The interviews are not too deep, mostly consist of how you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why did you avoid a friend ... etc. In the book, the boy almost happens to be a Sunday contraction and a sergeant on the other side and the reader will understand, why he is going to look for this boy as soon as he finds out that the baby is gone and thinks it could be a scam. In the movie, Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logand, but the audience is wondering why? Because there is not really a strong link between the phone and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? I know there is a difference between the book and the movie, but these calls and this relationship were crucial to creating on the screen because it provides the basis for the rest of the movie. Because it's not, the movie is falling apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising due to Maupin's next work, Stories of the City. When it was made into a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
