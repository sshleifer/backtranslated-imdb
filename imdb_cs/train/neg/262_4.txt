Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel he has been sold to gain his first major executive role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of people such as Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents lose stereotypical producers who think that black men who commit good crimes are fun concepts (see: Money Talks , Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Okay, I laughed a few times, and I gave all these comedians the best of fun, but I'd like to see how these guys share the Marlon Wayans portrait in Requiem in a dream. Or Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans in the vibrant color of the satirical performance Spike Lee Bamboozled.
