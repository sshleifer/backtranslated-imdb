I agree with the previous comment, what is disappointment. I hired it to be a good movie from Mira and Olivier, where it will be. I was surprised by their performance, I expected more because they are good actors. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a slow start, but it got worse. I even laughed at some bad pieces! when it is supposed to be a mysterious movie. You can even guess who the killer is before !!! <br /> <br /> Really what happened? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I say, but do not bother to lose your time and money. <br /> <br /> Bored!
