I did not even bother finishing the movie because I was so bored I thought I was going out and I watched it in the cinemas and I and my friends just got tired so we got up and went to another movie if I ever had to sit for 2 minutes . I think again I'm going to shoot ... and I know the entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and I was not surprised at all I do not know who did not know she would do the right thing and let it be happy that you really have to be a complete idiot not to know. I know I missed nothing, and when someone asks me to see the movie, I would say "over my dead body".
