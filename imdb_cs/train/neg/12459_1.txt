Because of how much money was included in this movie, you would expect more of the story as a whole. This might be the most suitable movie I've ever watched. There was no real progress. Character development, minimal. Perhaps it was possible. Entertainment, none. I'm not sure what points they are even trying to do. To see a movie where terrorists are good guys, the US CIA bombs everything that does not agree with our views, all the capitalists are corrupt, and you'd like to see something that reminds of the evolution of history accompanied by death. For those of us who realize that it does not kill a good guy to do it, we will be holding other movies. All in all, it was a terrible attempt at "oceanic 11-year" movie "we hide in such a guy" because not only do you know what is happening, no one who shot the film, not one of them. Home Alone 3 was a better movie piece.
