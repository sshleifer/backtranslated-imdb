I came to this movie, which he really wanted to depict. I thought the assumption had a lot of potential and was mature for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect it to be Citizen Kane. This means that it still does not reach expectations. The historical aspect of the story is glazed, and it has slightly cooled off. The film was very wooden in the film. Overall, I give it 4 for a great idea, but the movie could record much higher with a little more attention to the basics of film making. Is that worth seeing? I did not want my two hours back, but I do not know I would recommend it to the others.
