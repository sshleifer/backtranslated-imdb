This movie is really great. It is trivial to banality that you do not have to see good sense at such a speed, and that ordinary decency for humanity is coming around. But it does not stop there! This film hits the bottom of your head so hard that it jumps back to a point of sad comedy: Behold, Kor Beergutted Conan catches with excess of neck hair his struts swinging his sword as if it were not tomorrow (and the way I turned I'm really I'm afraid I was tomorrow for him or at least for his beer crap ... Do not miss this movie, it's a fantastic story over an idiot and utter bloody! And once you've finished watching this, drain tears of joy (or tears of frustration in such an unsuccessful attempt telling) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $ 5 to go on!
