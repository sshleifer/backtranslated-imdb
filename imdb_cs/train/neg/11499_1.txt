Gadar is a really stupid movie because it tells a fake story. It's too unrealistic, and it's a typical sunny movie deool that focuses on Pakistani bash. The aim of the film is to abuse viewers to think that Pakistan and its government are bad, but trying to hide their own mistakes will not work. And all the songs and music from the movie are all bad. Probably Sikhs will love the movie because they are being introduced. The film is upset and angry. I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 of 10 I would, but the lowest is 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and do not look at this silly boring movie.
