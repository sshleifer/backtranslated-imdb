It was perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends, and after the end, none of us understood the conspiracy. In addition to the missing plot, acting was horrible, "special effects" were not so strange and writing was terribly horrible. The film is the only redemption of the factor that it is so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. You can not laugh when the zombie who exaggerates them appears while the actors are dirty dialogue. I do not intend to recommend this movie to someone who is looking for a good movie, but it's something a group of friends can meet and have a good laugh. Now it's a joke run between my friends and I 1 out of 10.
