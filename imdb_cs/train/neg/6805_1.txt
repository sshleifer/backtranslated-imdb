I even saw the movie 10 minutes ago .. WoW still can not believe what I watched. This is absolutely the worst EVER movie. If I said all the mistakes in the movie, this review would get me a lot of sentences. (Very fun bugs because it was bad) <br /> <br /> You have to be surprised by the skill-rescue commands. they did not even know how to move. Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and the thing I do not understand is how he wanted production to be a hero, but he's zero. Of course the major bugs will be landing 747, he only needs 3 or 4 tips from a man in landing airplane transfer ... awesome .. as well as dead bodies that had almost no blood. <br /> <br /> But I strongly recommend watching this movie because it is very interesting to see how bad something can get
