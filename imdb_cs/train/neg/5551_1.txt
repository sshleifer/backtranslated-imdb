How long has this crap been on TV? It's scary. I'd like to shoot someone. It's so fake it's actually worse than sci-fi movies of the 1940s. I wish I had a wound to follow this nonsense. I remember watching it when she came out. I thought it might be interesting, then I found out how completely, madly, ridiculously stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually pulled my pocket knife and pressed my hand to the table. Please stop watching this and all other reality shows, these are garbage that breaks the networks and cancel quality programming that requires some idea to create.
