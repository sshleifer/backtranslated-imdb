The first tracked 17.5.2002 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The relatively poor Titanic disaster account is the first recorded version of this much-reported event. Replication of this catastrophe is not bad, but the drama around her is sometimes stupid, misplaced, and like a soap opera. The story is exactly the same as the last one who won Oscar, except that we have shown how the crew tried to hide the real catastrophe that occurred until later. Good only for nostalgia and the feeling that James Cameron was fighting in his recreation (hardly?).
