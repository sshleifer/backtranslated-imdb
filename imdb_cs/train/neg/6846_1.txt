I'm a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I saw this movie after seeing Fizzu, which was absolutely great. There are movies that are bad and there are movies that are cr * p but this movie has only a biscuit. <br /> <br /> We were so annoyed that we were excluded from paying our money waiting for a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any price, that. <br /> <br /> 1/10
