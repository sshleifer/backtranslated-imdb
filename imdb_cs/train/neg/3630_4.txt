It is supposed that those who praised this film ("the biggest recorded opera ever," I did not read anywhere?) Not interested in the opera at all, Wagner does not care or does not care about their desire to appear CULTURED. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan, or as a film, he considers me to be an uninterrupted disaster with lead-based scoring that fits into fraudulent and indifferent grasping of the text. <br /> <br /> It is that people who have an idea of ​​what "o" of some opera (or a game, especially one about Shakespeare) should be allowed anywhere near theater or film studios; Syberberg, very fashionably, but without the slightest justification of Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is "about" bisexual integration, so the title character in the final stages transforms into a beatnik babe, though the one who still sings the tenor - little if some actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, a conductor who is considered a face (but not heard as a voice) by Amfortas, and also appears in a double exposition as a Batonzilla or a conductor playing Monsalvat during Good Friday - in which, by the way, the beautiful beauty of nature is represented by the dispersion of stormy and frosty crocuses, stranded by badly laid turf that prevents me. In the theater we sometimes have to deal with our thoughts, but I can not think why Syberberg could not get together because the Parsifal and Gurnemanz pastures are as lush as they were given to Julie Andrews in Sound of Music. . <br /> <br /> The sound is tough, the high voices and trumpets are especially hearing glare, which adds more impatience to our impatience thanks to the non-inspiring and paralytical development of the ritual. Someone else mentioned a record in Bayreuth of 1951 and Knappertsbusch, although his pace is often very slow, had what Jordan does not have, a sense of pulse, a sense of flow and flow of music - and after half a century, orchestral sound in this set, in modern dispatches, still dominates this film.
