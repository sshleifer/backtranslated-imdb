In my life there were moments when I was confused and depressed. It was sitting over Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> There were warning signs there. No premiere (or stars did not want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I was sitting in the movie was in the hope that I could see some sleep. Nothing in the movie was explained. The narrative was idiotic. At one point I was upset when it seemed that the film was shot, and then to the growing despair, it was found that he was not really shot. I sincerely hope that all those involved in the film are hanging out for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, especially unintentional moments of humor. For example, a scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the necessity to manually get rid of in the dressing room when he tells the person in the next closet to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I close it. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: Only for sadists, deserters and regressions who want to torture.
