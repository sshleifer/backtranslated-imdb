=== small spoilers === <br /> <br /> I am, like many others, a huge fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging from the front and the trailer coming in front of MI: 2, expectations were rising. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars. Nothing Cage and Fresh from Oscar - Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? Many. <br /> <br /> The script is not funny (it really is trying to be) or exciting. You gave a black person who constantly makes racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa! do you have a comedy? I think yes. Excitement is completely out of the picture. At first (and it is probably many times said) there are no sympathetic figures, so who cares who is killed? If your stomach could assume that the psycho kills Nico's brother until he steals 50 cars in 4 days, another thing you know is that Kip (brother) goes back to the streets with Nik. Is it excitement? Do not think. Then comes the best piece - the romance between Nic and Angelina. Actually, it seems bored that he had to tell all those stupid lines to Nico. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone?" 'What's wrong?' etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is only one spark of hope: the car pursues. They are disappointed when they say the smallest, because the trailer seems to be full and there is only one. Very long, taken with the irritating hectic motion of the camera. I really had trouble with the action. <br /> <br /> So is it an action movie? thriller? romantic comedy? - no need to decide to avoid this terrible mess. I put 3 out of 10 stars and I feel like I'm generous.
