Daniel Queen Margot was much better for Daniel Auteuila. For Nastassu Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments come from Chris Menges ("CrissCross" and "A World Apart" can not even be compared with this), and Goran Bregovic for using the version of the same musical theme from "Queen Margot" for this film (Watch to the end of the film). If it was an American pop film, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and a director, the similar common approach to child abuse without original insight is very simple and unsatisfactory. There are those bad people who are kidnapping and selling minors. There are the poor children who hate the people who sell them, waiting for someone to save them. Finally, there's a great hero who kills all the bad guys and rescues these poor kids from bad boys. Each character is displayed in simple black and white terms: good versus evil. Moreover, I understood from the beginning how the story would end. Is it the end of the history of sexual abuse of children? I think that the difficult problem of child molestation and pedophilia is much more complicated than is shown in this not too original film. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
