Like South African, it's an insult if you think someone has actually been paid for producing this nonsense! Despite the fact that the director was one of the authors of the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "addition" to the series is scary! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and fighter. A man who played a major role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. The story of the film, however, is nothing more than a spring that has been lifted from the bottom of a barrel by a writer who has not been impressed since the mid-1990s. While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, rescues shitty slaves with their red buoy and pale smile? <br /> <br /> I was obviously expecting a blonde, fleeing woman to appear out of nowhere and going through the screen in her little red bath suits for no obvious reason. Not that it was no more bizarre than the fantastic conspiratorial line that was probably dreamed after ten beer beverages on a fantastic dress where someone caveman costume inspired the writer to return to the African theme for his next "blockbuster."
