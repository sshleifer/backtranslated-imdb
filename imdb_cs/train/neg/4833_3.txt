Yes, this movie is a real thief. He stole some of the shining Avatar Oscars just because politicians wanted another movie about heroes to support acceptance (support?) For the war that the US is fighting today. I really do not want to go to politics, but come on, it's brighter than the summer sky. Hurt cabinet really has nothing special, no real plot at all. I really feel in the 1950s in Hungary when the party told people what they like and what they do not like. The same propaganda films were produced at that time, except for those that were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of "US genre to be cool," you certainly have much better movies to choose from.
