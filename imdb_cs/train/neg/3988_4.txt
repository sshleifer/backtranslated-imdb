Briefly: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee apparently has a lot in mind. He thinks about racist coloring, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, heterosexuality, the politics of the war against drugs, and so on. <br /> <br /> This level of self-consciousness is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are deciding to critically explore the basic aspects of our everyday life; silent and invisible forces that drive our societies. Just because Lee makes controversial movies does not make him a good filmmaker. What is happening in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> First, Lee tries too hard. He seems desperate to adapt to any political / social statement he can think of within 90 minutes. And as such, the end result seems confused and frozen, for he will not allow himself to develop characters that could fully embody the ideas he hopes to introduce him. So it exhausts stereotypes, and we are left with the hot testimonies and the very busy dialogues. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. Second, it seems that, when attempting to make a statement about such a wide range of social functions, it has no concrete or original interpretation of the presented social / political issues. What is happening is puddle with regurgitation of misunderstanding. You feel he has bought a basic level sociology book and cleansed all 500 pages. These are highly problematic features because the artistic creation of the film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into the speaker voice of the voice of the filmmaker. He can not move away from work and allow him to talk to himself. <br /> <br /> It does not include artwork or sound political arguments. While I'm still thanking Lee for keeping these important questions, I have to say: <br /> <br /> Two inches down.
