The Rookie suffers so much. There are random music songs scattered throughout the movie, a long insignificant script and plenty of slapstick grids to make Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt just do not know when to stop. It took an hour before the story finally gets to the main conspiracy, and the characters are wrecked. The boys then start playing Japanese sailors with the standard racist cartoon of the day. It's a shame that the most fun part of the movie is when Noonan and Leavitt play silly, stereotypical Japanese boys. But after switching between two sets of characters it becomes quite tedious. Then it suddenly ends. Even naked Julie Newmar in a towel can not save it. <br /> <br /> There are really few spells in the movie and it's too long for half an hour. The story moves only by trying to create humorous situations and failures. Hold Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had a spell and Jerry had that animated face.
