He saw this movie when he first came out in the 1970s and hated, hated and hated it! Just the most popular movie I've ever seen in my life. You do not know where Leigh got its inspiration but it's one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to open their mouths and communicate. The title says everything because there are no savings in this movie, just a long and long silence with people who can not express what they are (probably) feeling. If you want to see something that will lead you to drink, then it is for you. If you have nothing better than two hours, then hold the fork in the pot: the experience will be infinitely enjoyable than anything you can get! Yes, Leigh has come up with a lot of really good stuff a lot later in his career, but give it one miss.
