I'm irritated by Shakespeare's modern adaptations, when the director can not make his or her opinion, use the original or update it. If it uses the original words in the updated setting, it is particularly difficult if it is set in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work in the style of the era, for example Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set the Victorian very late very efficiently. It could work with the 30-year setup if there were much less songs and dancing and much more from the text of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it ends up being quite trivial, though very nice show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students, but it is more important that he is such an experienced Shakespearean actor that, despite all his efforts to be just another student, he shows his power of action. Of course he should play the King - no problem in the fact that the adult student king encompasses younger students. Instead, we had a nice but unreasonable actor for the King, not representing a so-called king who does not have any Kingly attributes. <br /> <br /> A lot of songs and dances that I did not find boring despite nice songs and pleasant dance unfortunately meant that the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be drastically reduced. The whole thing ends up with trivial and mild sweets and I'm very boring, including comic turns, and was glad when it ended. Branagh did not make Shakespeare's righteousness in this production. <br /> <br /> He is surprised by Richard Brires and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely gorgeous as an older couple.
