The most thrilling moment in this movie is when Brady Corbet says, "You've blossomed," near the movie. I'll practically die. I'm still sure why the screenwriters put the line there. Should it create romance? Because she almost did me wrong. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but Thunderbirds had the potential to do so. This movie is not. If it does not have a large Thunderbirds drawing card, it would be stored directly on TV or preserved in postproduction. Maybe before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits unfold and play the song 'Busted' Thunderbirds go '. I can not believe I lost $ 7 and watched over pay-per-view.
