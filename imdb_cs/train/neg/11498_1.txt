Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's worst reevaluated films. Anil Sharma, who prefers filming, gives the film a litter. The songs were boring and they are not the kind of song you want to listen to in the car, full of volume. Sunny Deol is known for doing a lot of movies to beat 100 bad guys. He even kicks the metal prison door (Indian) and kicks the moving car away (Teesri Aankh). I would give another 50 examples of the shameful act of Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know that. The sun gives a pathetic performance and repeats the same type of role again. The boy who claims to be fighting for his country uses violence. Amisha Patel has her hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that I would like to bone. But she could not save the film from disaster. Instead of having a sexy outfit as usual, she does not have this movie. Perhaps because he plays a Muslim but does not participate in the movie as one. Overall, this is a bad show all the way, I'm sure it will appeal to some people who like to see Bollywood's actor beat 100 boys. Give me a break.
