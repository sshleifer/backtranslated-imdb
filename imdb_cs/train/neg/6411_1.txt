Return is one of those films for this group of people who like movies that are both wearing and mixing. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or naked at all throughout the movie. I was willing to handle it, but I was not willing to deal with the worst modifications combined with useless obstacles. Eventually it turned out that when she was young she hit her car. Or maybe I'm wrong and it was just a flash. It's impossible to say with this movie. Can you trust the guy who produced the crap from Army of Darkness? A much better idea is to stay home and watch the army of darkness on the Sci Fi channel. The movie had everything: sluts, zombies, and a jerk with a chainsaw. He has not even forgotten one of these things.
