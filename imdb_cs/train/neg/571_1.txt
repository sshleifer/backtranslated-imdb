I chased it just because I loved the first film. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just the ultimate trick that will make you hire. He is in fact a powerful producer and clearly has nothing to do with making this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) Tragic Story, Terrible Special Effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter ever. It's not comical bad either. What we end up with is a boring, uninteresting film with a terrible scenario and vague bad and clich√©. It's just a low budget reeks. <br /> <br /> Avoid Bubonic Plague.
