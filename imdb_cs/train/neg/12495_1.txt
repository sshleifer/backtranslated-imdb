OK, I love bad horror. I really like the horror that's bad enough to have fun. Demonicus or House of the Dead - they were bad enough to have fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> br /> <br /> I do not know, I have a lot of comments, both in the style of "angry" and in the real critic. Plot - In this city is a man (which may be Seattle, see the comment below) running and cutting off the heads It's been more than a year (I will not go back to get the exact numbers - thank you very much) maybe two or three years One head a week And the police are just calling in a "specialist" but will never give up.) Schya correctly, the Federation will take over after the three linked murder - after almost the same deadly attacks we would have been under the irritation of martial law !!!!! Anyway, this "specialist" consults voodoo chickens that the police ignored all the time, and both of them come to the conclusion that he is Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit that separates the heads to gain enough energy to become a body ( and probably takes over the world - maybe just going to Disneyland.) <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Settings - where is this happening? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you might not realize that the bar / rave (occupied by about ten film staff and their family members) is a poster for the local radio station, and the fun dialogue "Pulp Fiction" (as IF) between the two cops yes, those who get into the head for 15 minutes) are discussing a "new stadium" that could still be a problem the movie was made. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize for the movie and the name and hang my head in shame. OK, here is where it becomes really critical - to be a horror movie writer (not published, do not go looking for my name in IMDb), I'm doing research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - while Voudon Loa (the ghost) who is watching the cemeteries and traditionally associated with "Satan" - is in fact "Loki" God. <br /> <br /> In other words, he does not close his head. Besides, the main part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have the body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies focus on holding various members of the loa church. <br /> <br /> And not to mention if someone has already sat down, why make a new body? <br /> <br /> Also, if the Baron Samedi GOT body, he would not walk around cutting his head, he would get some good rum and cigars and par-TAY !!! Overall, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in a totally unnecessary reading of the Tarot card (used to show that the voodoo cat is "scary"), they did not screw up the interpretation of cards as most movies do. Again, I did research. (Who remembers the old late night phone tarot advertising - "Lovers - do you soon fall in love with madness ..." and all the nonsense?) If you did, I congratulate you very much for my remarks. And again I apologize. I'd be more sorry if you feel like watching the movie for me, so please do not.
