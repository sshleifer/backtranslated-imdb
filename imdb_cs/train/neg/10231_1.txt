Frankly, I'm rather upset that I lost nearly two hours on my debut offer on the basis of the brilliant reviews attributed to Steven Smith. They were all written to his buddies? Activity is hidden, music is irritated and overused, the script is just terrible, and the actors (except the gardener) are on average the best. I think we should support the young filmmaker's efforts, but we say he's great when it's not, he'll just encourage him to repeat the same mistakes, ie he continued writing his own scripts and used the same actors for another business. Yes, it's his first film, a low budget, etc. - I'll get it, but it's also out there for the public to buy it, and it's just not a scratch.
