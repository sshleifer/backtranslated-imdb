Joyce Reynolds seems to grow up in the role of Janie, a sixteen-year-old boy in a small town in America, who is going out of his standing guy for a visiting soldier, and he's welcomed on the cover of Life magazine the same week! Non-stop barrage wisecracks, put-downs, bull speech and unhappy bits of business, such as Janie's little sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as a maid) constantly swinging after sassy baby sis, Janie mother involved with the Red Cross, and Janie's father (such as parents, exhausted, homeless Edward Arnold and pert, interview with Ann Harding makes an unlikely couple even for 1944, seems unable to help get the baby into getting a lot less two of them). In 1946, he was nominated for an Oscar (!) Award for Owen Marks and Warner Bros. it followed with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds was supposed to overcome her prey - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 from ****
