I stayed one night and I got extremely bored around 2:00 in the morning, so I turned helplessly through the channels and at H.B.O. where this "classic" played. At first, I was happy to catch something at first, but my luck disappeared for about two minutes in the movie. The whole movie was centered around an uninteresting man who was afraid of women, four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's dinner, and his extremely fat and extremely poor cousin who also worked at the dining room. In this film there are some interesting twists that make it interesting, but it is definitely not worth it. Basically, if you have nothing to do for a night or just can not sleep, the medicine works much better. However, guys have a lot of skin so it can be okay to watch without sound, but it can be uncomfortable
