I'm a passionate B-Rate horror film fan and I've seen my fair share in slash pictures, so I have a great breakthrough to judge this movie. It easily falls into the top part of the worst horror films to offer in the 1980s. It's not as frightening as the Night of Demons, it's not as creepy as the Re-animator, and it lacks the campsite value. That said, this movie has no value. Keep in mind that film production is for a completely different film. Shadow shots on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this movie. VIOLENCE: $ $ $ (There is a lot of violence, but we've seen it all before.) A murderer kills beloved students and occasional members of the facility by dividing their throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror movies use). NUDITY: None <br /> <br /> THE STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes, who wisely changed his name to Forbes Riley, who accepts work at the university. the libido-crazy student? To be honest, it's impossible to take care of, because the script does not make any figure out of Forbes). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> students, but everyone else is from "extra" acting caliber).
