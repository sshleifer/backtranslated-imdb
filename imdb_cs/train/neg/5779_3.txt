I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and enjoyable. When I saw the name of this title and genre, I thought it great, this one could be really good ... some parody for slashers or other gore films ... but .. then I read a preview and thought it might be good as well ... but it was not ... my opinion: if the movies look a bit like a documentary, with a little comedy to try out some Moore movies or Alien autopsy, there really is something. this was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a comedy on the title ... no comment ... really bad joke
