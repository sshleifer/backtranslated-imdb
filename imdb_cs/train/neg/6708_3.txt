Avoid your back or get into big trouble from MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK! Only a happy end can bloom your innocence, full of darkness and destruction when you watch it. It is safe to say that the whole movie is falling apart, a sarcastic attitude and a homage to the zombie shows that we resist nonsense at max. We get the name "Johnny" so often and this "Johnny" has no place to go. There is no particular reason why our "dead corpse" crawls from its grave, just to survive until the ball of the night, so the film is completely useless. Without feeling sad, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny jumps from Eddie's arm. The audience is asked the hard question: Why should the film be this cornball? There is an answer. Any similarity with all living or dead is purely random. "Life" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the movie. Show it to your girlfriend, and she drops the superior ball and turns your life into a deserted ruin. Blah !!!
