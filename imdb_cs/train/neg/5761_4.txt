Hollywood does it again. Lots of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers were different from oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the previews, I thought it would be a fun movie. But if you are not the last stupid pop culture, then you will miss most of the silly humor in this movie. Why waste time. You can sit on the diary and do nothing and have more fun than the movie provides. <br /> <br />
