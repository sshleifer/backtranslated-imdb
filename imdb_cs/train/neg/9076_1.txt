It was certainly the stupidest, worst, most repulsive film I've ever seen. I was tempted to turn off the video recorder, but just as in the fascinating view of a terrible traffic accident, I literally discovered that it was REALLY COMPULSORY in any conceivable way, and eventually I pulled it out. I am by no means annoyed by anyone who opposes the comic depiction of sexual anger on the screen. The Animal House, Porky, is something about Mary, American Pie, and even the notorious Freddy Got Fingered. Mamie Van Doren's breast-killing sponge is the most frightening look of a naked geriatric from The Shining. Unexpectedly edited and filmed, with unbelievably annoying performances by Devon Saw and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended without the benefit of one giggle. The only useful purpose of the film is like a textbook example of how to make a rough picture. Oh, and that would be good as a fertilizer lawn.
