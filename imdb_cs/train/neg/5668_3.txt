First of all - there is absolutely no flirtation in this movie - with Anthony or someone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first test of endurance is over 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. That would not be so bad - damn, I like violence and perversion as well as the next reviewer, but without a context that can be put in, it's repulsive. That's what you can do with torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the film will change to something different in common - not better - just another: the picture on the heartless road. There are lame attempts at comedy portraits - widely written and widely played as broad as Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and a couple just enough to drag queens, too). Everyone deserves better. Photography is deliberately disorientating, so if you get a movement sickness (or indeed any kind of illness) - this move is not for you. Think about it, I'm not sure about who this movie is - maybe even gay and bi-sexual S & M fans who like badly written, badly shot Indian movies about themselves.
