Oh, God, what a terrible, terrible movie. It means commenting on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst TV series. Interstitial events organized by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most difficult part written in a tone that is likely to be reflexive and savvy. Rather, these moments are frowning when they talk to a camera with a diary written by someone with a love of insult, a blissful speech that pushes the "sense" of the movie into the throat of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Also, point to future filmmakers: Long shots and silent scenes are not art. Even extreme angles and logic are stretched to the point of absurdity. If any of you are interested in watching this movie, please do not. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
