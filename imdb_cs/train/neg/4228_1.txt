I can not believe how bad this waste is! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words do not support the description of this badly produced bite! Dubbing in any way the shape or form is equal to the actor's mouth. The film looks like it was shot by a vintage 1970 camcorder. I shot better movies with a cell phone camera. Gore is ridiculous due to the stupid incredible conspiracy. It is what you would expect if you called all your friends on Saturday afternoon and started to tear apart and then tried to put your game in your garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neil and I love zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this movie that they are inconsistent. Avoid!
