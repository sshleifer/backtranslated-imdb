... bothering to make this movie? Anyone? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie, go to the summer of '42. It's not summer of 42. <br /> <br /> When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, & Sarsgaard gets more time on the screen, this is your first warning sign And of course for such an "artsy" movie, there are plenty the curse, and the skin slid around, just to make it look "artsy". Sarsgaard made his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, interrupted moments to be intense. Intense is someone with a bipolar disorder. Miller is the most famous for her appearance and what she had to say about Pittsburgh after this film. Pittsburgh should be against her. She was a real native of Pittsburgh. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a lot of money in cardboard style. Wow! Was it his first role after graduating from high school? So we have this strange triangle. Foster is on Mille, but he's with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed, and the boss does not come to bed. So, he hangs up with Sarsgaard and Miller, and watches how they do it. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of the pseudo-intense moments of Sarsgaard, Foster & Miller takes it, the scene, in every careless, shadowing detail. Finally, to solve all this, Foster & Sarsgaard will do it, with Foster as Miller. Now I know how two boys will catch it (as if it were something I needed to know). After all, there will be a tragic end for one character and retrospective views of the remaining 2. It gets me right to the stomach. OH Wait! It was a pepperoni pizza I just got. I'd like to go back when the movie came out of my life, please.
