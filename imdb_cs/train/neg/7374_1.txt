This is without a doubt the absolutely worst film Steven Seagal ever did. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the rating, it's too good. This abomination was not worthy of 0/10 if such a thing existed. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (much dubbing) and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and could not care less about this movie. Something that is very obvious all the way <br /> <br /> Take all the other garbage that Dagel Seagal has created, multiply it by multiplying it by thousands of billion and all the badness, even 1% of this absolute crapfest.
