This film was two and a quarter unbearable hours. Someone please tell me what it was? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical environment. Should it be a group of conflicting bushwhackers (terrorists?) On the border between Missouri and Kansas and avenge all northern sympathizers and dissidents during the American Civil War. But apart from unscrupulous violence, it was not so important to the film. Maybe it was a political statement? Is this war really nothing more than gratuitous violence? If it was a reason, it was pretty good, but I do not think it was a reason. I think the producers really thought they were making a valuable movie here, but for me it was a complete lack of a plot. It seemed to me that I was looking at a book novel that comes alive with characters that look like what you would see on the envelopes of such novels. This movie should be burned along with some of the cities of this gang by fire!
