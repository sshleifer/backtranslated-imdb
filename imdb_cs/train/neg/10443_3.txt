I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I, along with my friends and almost the whole audience, were extremely disappointed. The film was not so bad that it was good; was as lifeless as the snake victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired of most of it, and the snake's effects were chrome. It reminded me of one of those Cheese SciFi films, except for the cheeses of this film, not funny, or even camp. Everything seemed worn out, flat and obviously formal. I'm shocked by the fact that I think Anaconda is more fun. It's easy to realize that SOAP realizes that it's a piece and plays with it, but what the film does not do is a scenario that is worried about the tension. It's the worst kind of lame film: it's hopeless.
