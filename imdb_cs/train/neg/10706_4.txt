Wow and I thought that every movie by Steven Segal was bad. Every time I thought the movie could not get worse, it turned out I was wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not take him away. They also made a lot of mistakes on how correct archiological kicks are done. For example, you do not have to manipulate artifacts until they are categorized and billed. The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the film less realistic than it was. The whole Knights Templar Concept, which was underground for all those years, seemed quite stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and what looked like almost depressing. I thought the characters did not explain that well enough. You did not find too many backgrounds and it was harder for them to get together.
