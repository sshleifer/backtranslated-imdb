When I saw three more versions of the same movie, I'm afraid it's by far the weakest, mainly because Scott is somewhat boring and leaded. His emotions throughout the body are so subtle that it's hard to get involved in the movie. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was in his worst, you do not have the point Scott calls a dialogue with great conviction, and when he goes through his metamorphosis, he is equally unconvincing. I can not think of any actor in this movie that would match those of the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical versions (and honestly Muppets) are better done. Great disappointment.
