I found writing really horrible in this movie. The only thing that saved this movie is that 1 in 10 was Lacy Chabert's performance, which I thought played a lot of personalities really well. For me, it was definitely the pinnacle of this film. Dina Meyer was pretty much the same as ever, but I found her role quite insignificant, so I do not think it could be said that her acting is great. <Br> <br /> As for the male leader of Armando Assante, his interpretation of the role was mainly reminded by doctors in the Cheese Hospital of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Everything I can live with. However, a terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, mental and even psychological role were just some of the worst scriptures I've ever seen.
