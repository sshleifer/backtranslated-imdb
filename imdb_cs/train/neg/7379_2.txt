What does Steven Seagal mean? First I like Seagal. I love all of his films until mid-2000. His early things are some of the best in the genre. This, however, does not suit his excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson (Seagal)) could be expected to be an insignificant action movie with Seagal in a typical unanimous kick. However, what we get is the secret of crime, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who move to superhuman when they take a drug. What happened in this movie. Dabing Seagal is shame, laughter and shame. Why to do it? The story is terrible. This got me 2/10 due to the scene where Seagal asks for a backup, even though she has an army with her, and a merry fighting scene where seagal swinging hands like a girl facing the camera! "Revenge is the way in two directions," says in this film ... well forget Steven's vengeance, you need redemption!
