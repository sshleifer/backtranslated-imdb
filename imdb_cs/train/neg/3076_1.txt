This movie should not be seen if you do not try to kill. I think this movie could cause serious brain damage. The main characters are the kneeling non-hero Kevin, Amy, his brothers, the godless conservative girlfriend, Kyle, the red shorts in the shorts that enjoys sex, Daphne, a rough, horny girl who is supposed to be "cool" how to dress, and her over-friend Nick, a soldier who can take some of the cue. No, I'm not a piss, that's really the movie. The film itself is an exaggerated renunciation of the 1986 Gremlins, where there is nowhere any trace of Gizmo. No, these Hobgoblins, unleashed by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), do the wildest dreams of someone and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it - end up in a strip club where Amy's biggest dream is revealed - she wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this movie through MST3K and even Mike Nelson, Tom Serva and Crow T. Robot, who got rid of this movie trailer, and yet I bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had it. I'm not giving you a conspiracy because because I've been through it again, it gives me this great need to drive the fork across my brain. Moreover, it's not like a plot that's worth mentioning. This film should give general warnings to the Surgeon.
