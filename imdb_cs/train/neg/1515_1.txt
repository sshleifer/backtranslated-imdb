I watched the film "The Flock" due to casting Gere and Danes, and because the story of the synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the best movies I've ever seen (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never published online, but this movie was so terrible that I had to do it. I suppose the problems start with a script that was so amateur that it's incredible. The story makes zero sense, and the dialogue is so tedious that it's nauseous. Poor Gere deserves it much better. As for Gere / Danes on the matchup screen, because of horrible writing, one does not believe one character for one minute. I bet Gere wished he could return the negative, it was such a thing. It's a shame to see that such talent was unnecessarily bad, not to mention that I could take my two hours back. (I know what you mean, how do I really feel?)
