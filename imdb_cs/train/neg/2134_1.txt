With this occupation and budget, you expect more. John Cusack has made a number of films that are bordering on strange but still work. Neither he, his sister, or Sir Ben could do anything to save the dirt of badly written garbage. The film is nothing but a series of eyes and poor. The plot goes nowhere, the font is fictional, senseless, and the signs of thin paper. If you think the movies are three-dimensional, where the story and characters bring in depth pictures, this glowing element is flat like a mickey steamboat. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dan Akroyda brought back the memories of another really terrible film, 1991 is nothing but a problem. Frankly, this movie is a type of project that kills a career and launches agents.
