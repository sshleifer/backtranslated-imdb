I tried to watch this film without really having to sit, because even if it is supposed to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular font interpretation. Interpreting, in my opinion, is being introduced by a lot of people. In addition, I was a film maniac and acting in this film completely unacceptable. Never before I did not want a negative score to rate the movie. So if you want to be continuously preached by those who do not have authority, then with all the means to get this movie. This note is also a warning for people who like or love the scifi because this title is deceiving a lot of people. It was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and the possibilities were wiped out. The film has only redeemable quality that it has made me realize that the character in the Time Machine magazine would probably have a little more moral anger on the strange behavior of those in his future.
