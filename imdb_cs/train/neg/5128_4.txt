This early B entry into the patriotic category hit the advertising and posters of the gorgeous young Gene Tierney, but you have to wait for it before you look at it, driving a camel on the Hollywood train. Previously, we founded George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as boys who barely get but have to face the attack. I saw Sanders like so many nice hairdressers that it was fun to see a precious good boy. However, Bruce Cabot is a big secret for me - it's a comparison, but I always felt that he was just grinning out of under a car covered with grease and sixth degree. Some people like it, like Gene's gypsy queen. This is an action adventure filler, and as we have been warned of assaulting local residents of weapons prepared for sabotage and attacking the British in their country, there is the last battle for a weapon in which we have to lose the main character for the good of all. This feature requires no more than your most important attention on Saturday afternoon, a programmer who did everything that was paired with the better one. It was almost interesting to identify Dorothy Dandridge's great supporting cast and surprise appearance in one of her first roles. Two or two and a half stars out of five. - MDM
