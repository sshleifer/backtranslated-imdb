with a name like this, you do not know that you are expecting a great horror movie. But it was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: a fugitive criminal wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. this joke can actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not throughout the movie! actors are not that bad, but their characters are somewhat stupid and the story is boring and completely stupid. No tension, no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's little assistant tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and dramatically succeeds. It was so boring I stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I could not take care of what happened. Amanda Plummer was great at Pulp Fiction, but she came ... it was 13 years ago and she did not do anything good. So it's no surprise that she had to sink as low as this piece of dumb. Avoid or warn.
