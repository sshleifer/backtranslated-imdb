I like musicals, but like Dickens fan, I hate this. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the lab? The poor of London are singing? Do Fagin and Dodger go to sunset? Not just a faithful novel. When I recall, Dodger was publicly hanged, and Fagin went crazy in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, he does just a little more than the wailing to point out his evil. But the worst is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often encounters such annoying and passive that you are wondering if he really is the main character. His portrayal is by no means helped that the best that they can do when singing is the voice of the girl. I do not think they realized that boys can be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Self-confident Dickens fans: Hold on to David Lean's amazing film from 1948 or BBC 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80s. years. Avoid this bloated white musician.
