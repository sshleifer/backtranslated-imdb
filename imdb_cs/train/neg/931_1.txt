I can not believe that this wood-writing and controlled clich√© film has gotten. There are roughly four good-looking shots (the director should think about moving to static photography) and that's it. Strong cast is totally useless, the scene repeatedly ends in the least interesting moments and the script does not say anything new. Save this movie.
