I really like Slasher movies, but this is really terrible. The acting is lame, the script is bad and the atmosphere does not exist. The plot is as follows: Deforestated gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American city. That's true - this is a conspiracy. Very original, eh! "Night brings Charlie" is not even cruel - if the film is not scary, at least it should be bloody. Avoid this left piece of waste at any price. If you want to see some good slasher moves, check out "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - Just Do not Lose Precious Time with this worthless piece of garbage.
