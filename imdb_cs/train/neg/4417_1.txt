I am a Catholic taught at nursery parish schools of nuns taught by Jesuit priests at high school and college. I am still a Catholic practitioner, but in the eyes of the Church I would not consider myself a "good Catholic" because I do not believe in certain things or do it in a certain way just because the church says it. So back to the movie ... it's bad because these two nuns are killed by two people who think of satire as the embodiment of a female religious figure. There is no comedy in it, and satire is not doing well by acting over Diane Keaton. I have never seen the game, but if it was very different from the movies, then it could be good. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the gun might be fake and the first filming of all female leadership plans by four former students as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual fantasies of Nurse Mary's faith. But it turned out that the bullets are real and the story has a tragedy ... a tragedy of loss of life (except for two former students ... the lives of broken children, the mother of a student's mother), a tragedy of dogmatic authority over love for people, the tragedy of an organized religion replacing the true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity.
