Although he gained some favorable press after playing on Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there were many reasons why we can not expect too much from that. One - it's a very expensive Canadian movie. Two - it's written, directed and played the same person (usually a bad sign if it's not Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But in spite of looking at it with low expectations, there was still much more disappointment than I thought it was possible. In short - bad script, bad acting, terrible direction! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. She says it's a comedy, but I just laughed twice. In addition, everywhere there is horror music. How does it have some attention that I will never know.
