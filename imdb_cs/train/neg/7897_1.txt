This movie was created for people who found Gremlins too serious and Critters to hardcore. Like many of the filmmakers / trolls / gremlins of 80s, this film is bad. The sad part is that there is no comment to this remark. It's just bad and not fun. The problem with this miniature movie about a monster is that it really tries to be humorous and ends up being successful in how Howie Mandell was in Walk Like a Man. What makes the horror films in classics from the 1980s was that they really tried to scare, but they were gay because they had not so badly succeeded. Someone had to tell Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) that she had a comedy before she was driving this movie. Unfortunately, they were wrong. We saw the weird, slightly mutated cross between the ferret and the tumor that wore a brown trenchcoat and threw balls in the pool on the outcast from Lost Boys, it's fun, but it's not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently the most annoying part of the movie is the figure of Paul. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to start a quick rewind from the time of his first scene to the end when the credits stopped only once to see the scene where the munchie throws the ball on the ball at one guy ... not that I'm he did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> this pile of rubbish.
