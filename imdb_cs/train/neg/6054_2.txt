I'm not sure Carpenter is trying to think about abortion and make it really hard and obvious that a woman should be allowed to abort if Satan is a father, but it goes on and on. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The baby is really stupid, basically a crab with a child on his head. You see enough material for Satan costume. Such a mess. This episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of story. Very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After learning that his child is dead, does the devil devastate the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, bloody shock? NO! He just puts his head down and runs out of the room. Grapes.
