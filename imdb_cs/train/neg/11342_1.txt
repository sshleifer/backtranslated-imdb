I should explain why I gave this ... "piece of art" 1 star rating is unlikely 10. Simply because it is difficult or impossible to evaluate it unobtrusively. it would probably be the same if I gave it 10/10 - an explanation would also follow. <br /> <br /> I do not like these nonsense gore films like HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting and pretty terrible (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historical drama" - and it would probably be in the case of 10/10 because it has a lot and Tarantino would be more than happy (and they killed Bill 3 to pour more blood on the screen than to show that it was possible ). but the thing about the genre of "historical drama" lies in the fact that it is a subcategory of "smash movies" where John Romero is the undead-cruel emperor and so can not automatically be considered as the starting movie - because these are films that are ill-suited and you can not really tell if it was a comically bad moment, or it was just bad. it's for people who like bad acting, bad screenplay and bad everything else. And some believers - I am one of them. there are days when I have the urge to see a really bad movie and look for some waste and here you go - the day is saved! but that is definitely my opinion and I have no connection with anyone else. What I wanted to say is that if you want to watch some horrible movie - it's definitely Casanova Fellini, but take my advice and do not rate it by default.
