a very good story, good excitement ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the movie ... what happened? extremely well done and good story destroyed in the last few seconds ... sorry to say but 1 in the vote ... that's what it deserves, so I would think Chris Shadley could come up with a better end ... but maybe next time :), does this insignificant blood say nothing about it? the end would raise the story so close to 10, but not ... the end destroyed the whole story, I think most people are not lame and when they go to the movie you want a good end, even if it's complicated ... but the only lame here is the end ... I'm sorry
