Life in any future fascist or almost fascist state that seriously restricts personal freedoms is a recurring theme in both modern literature and filmmakers. Such work points to the undesirable trends of our company, but to be effective, it must also be fun. Unfortunately, most books are likely to be more effective in sending a warning than in expanding them sufficiently amusingly to really read; while for films, the problem is usually the opposite. The first such work, which became truly widely known, was probably "1984" (first published in 1948) by George Orwell, and it is still available both in the form of a book and in a film. or read it: and then, when you feel a little depressing human inhumanity towards man, you will reach Cinderella 2000. This is a low budget movie based on the same theme that provides an easy but unresponsive display; and as in 1984 the calendar has now passed its past period. Most comedies are laid with a trowel, although there are only a few really funny moments. To use your mind at lengthy intervals, you can focus on whether the movie gets a new life extension by releasing it as a DVD or eventually disappearing into oblivion because existing cartridges get worse after redemption. There are much worse movies in the DVDs and I really do not care what happens in any way. So far, the best film of this genre was probably "The Handmaiden's Tale," but I would happily exchange it for the well-written film The Jacket London novel "The Iron Heel". As it is ambitious, it still seems unbelievable that no modern filmmaker has ever dared to try it out (IMDb lists only the silent version of B / W in Russia in 1919).
