This British and Spanish co-production looks great what you see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are horribly cropped, so it's so bad that it looks as though the buildings are mutually contemptuous. Few movies suffer as badly as lady and scanning, as it seems that director Robert Parrish was so in love with a widespread process that tended to use both sides of the screen at the same time, neglecting in the middle. Another user states that we see that all the inhabitants of the Church were initially massacred; not in any of the copies I have. There are some sudden pieces of peasants to shoot rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrate, and that's it. We never know why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we will never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I think he was called home playing in Kojak because his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange sequence of memories where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing in a bowling hat and a bad suit in the old tradition of the old English musical hall until 1960 hit BATTLE NEW ORLEANS, sung by Johnny Horton, but with some lyrics I he had never heard before. On the side it is a great location, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher type stairs that did not go anywhere, some beautiful sculptures of chewing from Robert Shaw and a good performance by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I really did not like the movie, but I did not know exactly. I'm looking for a widescreen version and then I'll decide.
