What happened on earth to our dear Ram? Is that the same man who made Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was the most ambitious Ram's project, he jumped out of the high cliff that he had come out of, giving the industry some of the greatest works of all time. This movie is falling like a brick. I wanted to leave the theater but I was forced to sit because I could not take the car out of the car park before the others left. Otherwise, I would not do anything if I sat outside the interval. <br /> <br /> This movie is nowhere near Sholay. This does not even happen near a mile. I believe Ramu certainly loves the Godfather more than Sholay, because Sarkar was a classic piece of work. I read Ramu's interview a few days back, in which the interviewer said that Ramu was not sleeping for more than 4 hours a day, not even for a stretch. I agree with this now because his lack of sleep probably caused the film. <br /> <br /> There is no performance in performance. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look scary. He looked rather scary in several of the posters and wallpapers I'd seen earlier. Favorite Ramuina Nisha Kothari did a great job at Sarkar because she did not have many dialogues (in fact, none if I remember correctly). She opened her mouth in this film and found a place in history. The new guy who plays Jai's role seems to have that horrifying look, but Jai did not play a role at all. I can not go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big to be able to handle it right now. I promised myself all the time that I was going to watch the original Sholay again just to see that she was still there. <br /> <br /> Attenuation: A terrible movie. Media and critics are about to cook Rama goose. And just to remind all readers, I'm one of Ram's biggest fans, and I can not even save him for this act.
