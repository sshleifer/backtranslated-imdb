I bought this exciting film of unreasonable, over the top, fun bloody spa. None of them was. This film will fail at virtually every level, not even frightening, or funny, it's just horrible filmmaking and never gives the audience anything worth seeing. What is so bad that it is not far from being brutal, violent and brutal, as he promised that there was very little violence. Virtually no blood and no excitement. The actions, directions and dialogue are totally unbearable. Frankly, it's really ridiculous. I could hardly get away from it; I certainly do not want to watch her. Do not waste your time by being such a celluloid waste; this is really the worst movie ever made. If I could give her a minus star, I would.
