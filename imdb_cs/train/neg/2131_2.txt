I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as the movie was announced), but it disappointed me. For me, the conspiracy was a bit confusing, and then I lost interest. I'm sorry John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for joining this movie. I will remain a fan of everyone, but only time can heal my feeling of this. The only thing I can say positively about the movie is that Hillary played Yonica's character so well I did not even know Hillary; several scenes took me to realize that it was her. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box; if I paid to see it on the big screen, I would really be eager !!
