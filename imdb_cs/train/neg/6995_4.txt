Funny how many people who say this are much better than Romero's version tend to be very young (judge according to their other positions). What we have here is a slick, full action, harsh and "Whoopee" packed with a 2 hour MTV video. Wonderful edition, pop-video camera, "cool" music blah blah bla bla bla <br /> <br /> In fact, it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (Chain Massacre was a complete disaster) bike, absolutely predictable in "who die more "bets and total cash in the Dawn Of The Dead name that will generate a lot of revenue by the original fans who will go and see it out of curiosity ... <br /> Do not expose the classics to nerves? Can they really come up with something original? Why Repair Dawn of the Dead? Things that made the original special (the middle segment that kids think is so boring is slow to show that when you get everything you ever wanted is not happy yet) is totally absent. This is a movement, simple and simple. The faster, the better. If you're in action (and how it is, the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little stuff in their movies ... get ready for sighing (again) ... <br /> Watch the cinema in the next few years when we get the series of The Godfather showcased by who's the most fashionable pop director and Star Wars shuffle and all kids say how the new version is a mile better than the old version it's slow and boring and keeps the camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> It's not bad, but in ten years it will still be discussing the version of Romer, not this pap
