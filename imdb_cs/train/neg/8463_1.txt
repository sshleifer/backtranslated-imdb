No scenario, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Put such a budget to it ... In Belgium we make ten films that win all the Cannes prizes with that . <br /> <br /> The last time I saw such a NULL movie was Hypercube. But the script was better. Is anyone aware that the director was a school graduate or a policeman? Better stuff in this movie was the word "end" <br /> <br /> Why authorize to sell this? 1รง is expensive. <br /> <br /> I have to pay ten dollars to buy it. <br /> <br /> For me, it was my big mistake of the millennium. <br /> <br /> <br /> Next time I will break my hand but buy this type sh * t.
