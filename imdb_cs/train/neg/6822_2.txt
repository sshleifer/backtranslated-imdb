Drones, ethnic drums, bad synthesizers, children's songs. The most numerous "world music" you can imagine. This is a tourist film and a miserable movie. What really kills are discontinuous sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. No gradients, no visual explanation why we are at ten thousand miles away, no ideas expressed in pictures. Only a bunch of third-world sages with "baskets" as another reviewer said. Walking infinitely as if it had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make the 3rd world music video, it was only a few hundred kilometers south of where the best parts of Koya and the film in Mexico were shot. This would be much better setting for "life in transformation." But not. They decided to be a beautified tourist route covering half of the planet and captured filtered shots. The only thing that recommends this movie is that it does not saturate as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RastJ
