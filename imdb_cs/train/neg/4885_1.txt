I should have listened. I was warned and yet I paid the money for it after reading all the reviews when I knew the original was "so bad that it was good", and part 2 did not fit into this category at all, even then I could not resist . Exactly what happened here? Part One was Cheerful, she had so many political mistakes and another Crazy, Fat Entertainment and this, it just could not be a worse sequel to God's green land, not to Basket Case 2, to hell, not even Troll 2. This is really the worst continuation of history and it really says something he considers pioneering, the bottom of the barrel properties of the original. Criminally insane part 2 was just another bad sign. Shot on video, zero score, zero value of fun, 1/3 is made up of memories of the original and moreover, the crazy, thick Ethel has lost part of its circuit. I mean honestly, is this a bad joke?!? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
