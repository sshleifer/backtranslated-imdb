The miracle is really noticeable. I think it's bad. It's really bad. But given that the original was so bad - it's - devastating - my life is bad, it's so - bad - it is - slightly fun bad. Okay, that's a little weak praise. Production values ​​are unnecessarily rotten, acting is unbearable, and Romero-wannabe satira can not figure out which side of the ecological fence is mocking. Internal logic has a back seat on the head that pushed out of the refrigerator, the incubation time of the virus fluctuates like a "plot" requires, bullets working against the zombies or not, zombies have the power of speech or not. Gore is a dragon, of course, but the framework is so slapdash that's unpleasant. The dialogue sounded as if it had been translated by the same computers that manipulated the instruction manuals, and the extent of zombie infestation was not implied by any of the inventions of Romer's films. It's all finished with a terrible synthetic score. Absolute garbage.
