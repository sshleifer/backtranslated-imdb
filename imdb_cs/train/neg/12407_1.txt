Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a woman in custody for young Rosalie Cole (Rosalione Cole), who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie lacks her dead mother and constantly visits her grave (conveniently located in the cemetery just behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> with a really scary sequence in the cemetery ... then it collapses. The story is thin and the tone of the padding is 85 minutes long. It's playing terribly overboard (with Cole's worst). Badly directed with some of the best adjustments I've ever seen on the movie. Scenes (and sound) are just cut off without a pipe or reason. Also, the film has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. As for blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and what looks incredibly fake. I've never seen such a fake-looking blood - it looks like ketchup! Dull, useless - rightfully forgotten movie. You can skip this option.
