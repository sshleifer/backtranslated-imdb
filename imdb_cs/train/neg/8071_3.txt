I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliz Dushka, but she has only a small part and her character is not very sympathetic. However, the main character played by Melissa Sagemiller is extremely beautiful and perfect joy when I watch the whole movie. It is nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent. She does a very good job. The story itself is quite absurd on the face. After a car crash, some friends may be dead, but they still live in their past lives as many mysterious things happen. Some of them are after them, but we never know who they are (maybe they were in another car, but we definitely do not say why they are after them). Concluding scenes appear to be film ambitious, but I can not get anything coherent. An introductory scene where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut the wrists of the blond girl and gather that some of her blood is never explained or followed. If the enemy behaves like surgeons who are trying to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the dead ... but no, it does not seem to work. Criminals are simply bad; they really just a mess the story that would otherwise be interesting. In the supernatural tale of death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
