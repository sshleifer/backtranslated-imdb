Apparently he intended to be a movie thriller who is almost laughing. That made me call, "My God!" more than once at the convulsions of conspiracy that were simply stupid. Fanditous or absurd places, for the sake of complete novelty or dramatic situation and unlikely, almost impossible human reactions and circumstances, are too understanding why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to find out how bad a picture can be, then you want to see this. Otherwise, take some time observing some dry colors for more productive time investments! (That movie released in 2003 is already featured on TV in July 2003 could indicate the quality of the film)
