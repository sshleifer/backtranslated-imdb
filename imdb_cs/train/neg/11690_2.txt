It's a passport to have such great actors in such a tedious and boring film. In addition to all the unanswered questions that have been published in other commentaries, what is hard to capture robbers? Simply remove the bank laborers, you will see who was at the shore - from all angles of camera shots - before entering thieves, and you have four remaining thieves amongst these weapons. Where is the tension that every person talks about? It was so obvious that when the hostages were asked to change to the same uniform that everyone would go out of the front door ... they had seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee was able to taste the film with some good musical results and artistic shootings. The film is not worth it. Pronto!
