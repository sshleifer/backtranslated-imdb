Slash rings are a little and far between days, so when I heard about Cut I had great hopes and heard good things about it. The good things I heard were all bad ... very bad! This move is bad and I mean BAD. It's just stupid. Everything about it. Especially the origin of the killer, how he remains alive and how he will eventually take care of it. There is nothing original or exceptional in this movie. Just another slasher wannabe with those "Hip", "Self aware." Characters "Movie Awareness". I'm so dirty. Someone is doing something different because the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
