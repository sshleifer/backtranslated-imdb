Even though he was not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised to see his name in credit when opening "Joshua". Damn it, I did not even realize she was in "Joshua" before I started the movie. Obviously, I watched the film based on the film, not the film. Some sort of "Rosemary's Baby", "Omen" or another demo children's movie "Joshua" was billed. Unfortunately, it fell. Slowly, incredibly slow and flat. Still, I continued to see how it would work out, hoping that the final climax would cast some light on this question. Well, I admit it (a bit) but what happened. And what the low-budget budget movie, or at least as they suggested it. Person falls? you do not see a drop, you will see someone lying in what looks like blood. Is the person hit by the cabin? you do not see, you see someone is complaining and holding a motorcycle up. I'm not sure if this is called "style" or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects. Do we have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a working father trying to balance everything, child? Joshua, who may / may not be antichrist and a newly born little girl who is crying a lot. Does she cry the same way we see how many days it is alive? and what was that about? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua mad? Just being jealous of newcomers to the family? Will he grow up like Michael Myers? Or is he driving his family on the brink? I think yes. They were nuts before, and no "so-called" action would convince me otherwise. Unfortunately, it was hardly possible to answer questions, almost no open door was closed. I'm sure it was an idea, but for Pete, give me something. Anything. There are plenty of better movies for kids to explore. Joshua is more like the Mini-Me antichrist.
