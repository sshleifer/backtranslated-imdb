The only real highlight in the film is the death of catching a guy and the reaction of surviving characters to him. In any other case, this film is very poor by the jaws, Lake Placid and Alligator, with a bit of Godzilla (1998) he threw. <br /> <br /> As with the 1990s horror film, both women who are not stars. Feminine lead is not because he has, of course, a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie surrounds the shooting of really stupid extreme sports, which is called surfing in the blood where surfers tell and surf in the waters of infested sharks. In this movie is a huge crocodile with salt water also in the area. People are eating. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I do not mind a bad movie of horror, but I really hate a boring horror movie that's definitely the case.
